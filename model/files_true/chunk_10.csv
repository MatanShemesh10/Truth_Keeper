Immigration win for Republicans could help Clinton in the end,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans cheered after the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday thwarted President Barack Obamas plan to offer millions of undocumented immigrants relief from deportation, but any sense of triumph might last only until the November presidential election.  If recent history is a guide, the stalled cause of immigration reform could energize Hispanic voters in support of likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, hurting Republican Donald Trumps chances of reaching the White House.  Four years ago, Obama, seeking reelection to a second term, made Republican opposition to reform a central theme of his campaign. He ended up swamping his opponent, Mitt Romney, by almost a 3 to 1 margin among Latino voters, who now make up around 12 percent of the U.S. electorate. Republican hopes for securing a larger share of that vote this election already seemed grim given Trumps vow to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally and to build a wall along the southern U.S. border.  Democrats were quick to assail the ruling and voice concern about the fate of the 4 million or so immigrants who were to be shielded from deportation by Obamas executive action. But it was also clear that they believe the high court has handed them a potent weapon to spur Latinos  the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. electorate  to vote in greater numbers. The Latino voting bloc is expected to swell to 27.3 million in 2016, up 4 million from 4 years ago.  The prospect of Clinton filling the current vacancy on the top court with a liberal-leading justice who could, potentially, protect immigration-reform programs, may galvanize those voters as well. Republicans in Congress have refused to accept Obamas pick for the top court to fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia in February.  The justices ruling on Thursday sent the question of the legality of Obamas program back to a Texas federal court for trial, leaving open the possibility that the matter could return to the high court on appeal at a later date.  The courts decision just adds fuel to the fire thats already raging, said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist. Each of these events raises the intensity and the Latino turnout even more. In the wake of the ruling, immigration activists vowed payback in Novembers election and staged protests on Thursday. A recent survey by Latino Decisions, a polling firm, showed that about half of the U.S. Hispanic electorate showed greater enthusiasm to vote in 2016 as compared to 2012, with support for Obamas pro-immigrant executive orders running high.  We should expect similar dynamics this fall, perhaps even more so given the election is likely to determine the ideological direction of the Supreme Court, said David Damore, an analyst for the firm. Given Trumps unpopularity with Latino voters, the question for many Democrats both in and outside the Clinton campaign has been less about attracting the blocs support and more about making sure it votes in large enough numbers to help offset Trumps expected advantage among white voters.  The courts decision may also help make traditionally Republican states with increasing Hispanic populations such as Arizona more competitive this election, strategists in both parties said.  Reed Galen, a Republican strategist in California, said the ruling could boost Democratic hopes in Latino-heavy battleground states such as Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.  The issue isnt getting [Latino voters] fired up, Galen said. Its getting them to show up. Galen believes there is little his party can do now to mitigate the damage he believes Trump has done to its appeal among Hispanics. A Republican National Committee autopsy report after Romneys defeat said it was essential for the party to broaden its appeal to Hispanic voters by embracing immigration reform.  Trump has pushed the envelope on immigration so far for Republicans, I dont know this [decision] is going to be any more damaging, he said. The barns already been blown up. But Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, a conservative advocacy group, disagreed. He said Republicans in Congress could still enact reform this year, which would ward off Trumps deportation threat while building stronger ties with Latino voters.  This is the quintessential green light for Republicans to put their money where their mouth is, Rodriguez said.  Many Republicans were careful on Thursday to applaud the courts ruling on the grounds that it curtailed what they viewed as an abuse of executive authority by Obama, without delving into the underlying immigration issues.  The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws  only Congress is, said Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Ryan supports comprehensive immigration reform. Trump, however, went further, praising the ruling and saying the election now held the key to blocking further illegal immigration.  The election, and the Supreme Court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and, hence, a country, he said in a statement. He has vowed to reverse Obamas executive actions on immigration as president. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Trump predicts 'staggering' July fundraising for White House bid,"TURNBERRY, Scotland (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, stung by a meager fundraising haul compared with that of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, predicted on Friday his campaign would draw staggering numbers this summer. Supporters have voiced concern he will not have enough money to finance his campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump had $1.3 million in cash to start the month, compared with rival Democrat Hillary Clintons $42 million war chest. The numbers are going to be, I think, quite staggering, especially in July, Trump, a New York real estate developer, said at a news conference in Turnberry, Scotland, where he reopened a golf resort. He said he had only begun fundraising in earnest a few weeks ago and that the numbers, especially for small donations, had been amazing. Steve Mnuchin, Trumps top fundraiser, told CNBC on Thursday that in the past week the campaign had raised about $10 million together with the Republican Party at fundraising events. He said Trump also raised $6 million through online donations. [L1N19F0VD] Trump said on Friday the July report will show you some pretty massive numbers. Trump also has suggested he could use more of his personal wealth to help win the White House. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
"Latest gun control bid falters in Congress, Democrat sit-in ends","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Another attempt at gun control faltered in the U.S. Congress on Thursday despite outrage at the Orlando massacre, as a proposed ban on firearms sales to people being monitored for links to terrorism barely avoided being killed in the Senate. In a procedural vote, the Senate narrowly rejected an attempt to scrap the plan by Republican Senator Susan Collins to prevent guns getting into the hands of people on two U.S. government terrorism watch lists.  But the proposal looked short of the support it would need to advance through the chamber, and Republican leaders said the Senate would switch from debating gun control to other matters until at least after the July 4 holiday.         It was the latest setback for proponents of gun restrictions who have been thwarted for years on Capitol Hill by gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.     Frequent efforts at gun control have failed despite anger at mass shootings like the killings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and in San Bernardino, California, last year.  Eventually this problem will get addressed again one of two ways: We find a breakthrough, which I will seek, or there will be another terrorist attack which will bring us right back to this issue. I hope we can do it without another terrorist attack, said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who supported Collins.        A few hours earlier, Democratic lawmakers ended a sit-in protest in the House of Representatives over guns. Fueled by Chinese food and pizzas, dozens of them stayed on the House floor all night, at times bursting into the civil rights anthem We Shall Overcomebefore giving up their protest after 25 hours.      Its not a struggle that lasts for one day, or one week, or one month, or one year, said Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a key figure in the civil rights protests of the 1960s. Were going to win the struggle, said Lewis, who led the House sit-in.  Dramatic protests by legislators are rare in the U.S. Capitol and the sit-in underscored how sensitive the gun control issue became after this months Florida attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Opinion polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen.      After a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, some senators had seen resistance to gun restrictions softening because the issue had partly become one of national security. But Collins measure received only 52 votes in the 100-seat Senate test vote, short of the 60 votes that would be needed for  approval in future Senate procedural votes.  While her plan could be revived next month, it is unclear if she has the momentum to overcome pro-gun rights forces in Congress who argue that gun control measures in Congress have been too restrictive and trample on the constitutional right to bear arms. Four other gun control measures failed earlier this week.              Collins, a Maine lawmaker, wants to forbid gun sales to anyone on the U.S. governments No Fly List for terrorism suspects or the Selectee List of people who receive extra security screening at airports.         Despite the lack of legislation, the gun debate has stirred passions. The House Democrats sit-in brought an outpouring of grass-roots activity.  Jennifer Hoppe, deputy director of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said that in less than 24 hours from Wednesday, about 130,000 calls were made from supporters of gun control to members of Congress. First lady Michelle Obama backed the House Democrats protest. We have grieved for too many children and wept for too many families after shootings. Chicago. Tucson. Newtown. Charleston. Orlando. #Enough, she wrote on Twitter on Thursday. The Democrats were seeking votes on legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases, as well as measures to curb the sale of weapons to people on government watch lists             Republicans allied with the NRA gun rights group say that while they want to combat terrorism, they represent constituents who believe firmly in the constitutional right to bear arms.  Its a tough issue. For people like myself, who come from a hunting and fishing state, its pretty hard, said Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who voted against Collins.

Obama briefed after Britain votes to leave EU,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed by his advisers late on Thursday on Britains vote to leave the European Union, a result that he had argued passionately against during an April visit to London. Obama, who was scheduled to deliver remarks to global entrepreneurs at a conference at Stanford University at 10:45 a.m. PDT (1:45 p.m. ET/1745 GMT), was dining out at an upscale restaurant with a small group of top venture capitalists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs as the results for the leave campaign began to roll in. The group at San Franciscos Twenty-Five Lusk included John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, and LinkedIns Reid Hoffman. Obama dined for more than two hours, departing shortly after British networks called the referendum for the leave campaign, and markets plunged. A White House official said Obama had been briefed on the returns and would continue to be updated by his team as the situation warrants. We expect the president will have an opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Cameron over the course of the next day, and we will release further comment as soon as appropriate, the official said in a brief statement to reporters. Obama traveled to London in April at the request of Cameron, whom he calls a friend, exhorting Britons to stay in the EU, an unusual intervention that was denounced as meddling by those in the leave campaign. Obama also warned that leaving the EU would put Britain at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the United States. Obamas term in the White House ends on Jan. 20, 2017. His former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 election, had also said she hoped the UK would stay in the EU. The presumptive Republican nominee - real estate magnate Donald Trump - had taken the opposite stance, saying he thought the UK should leave. Trump, in Scotland on Friday to reopen a golf resort, told reporters that Britons took back control of their country by voting to leave the European Union. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Democrat gun control sit-in sparks social media sensation,"(Reuters) - A blackout of television cameras in the U.S. House Representatives during the Democrats gun control sit-in may have spurred public interest in the protest as it forced the demonstrators to use social media to broadcast their message. Democrats leapt on Facebook Live and Twitters Periscope after the cameras, controlled by the House, went dark Wednesday when presiding House officer and Republican Representative Ted Poe declared the chamber not in order during the protest. As Democrats took to alternative forms of video broadcasting, their message gained tremendous momentum from social media. On Twitter, the hashtags #NoBillNoBreak and #HoldTheFloor have been tweeted at least 1.4 million times. Of the roughly 20 members of Congress who remained at the sit-in overnight, 19 of them used Facebook Live for a total combined viewership of 3 million. It really connected with people out there, Congressman Scott Peters told Reuters. This whole phenomenon with [live video] struck a nerve. Peters used the application Periscope, which is connected to the social media platform Twitter, to send out video. Without that, think about it, it would have been a caucus meeting where we talk to ourselves, he added.  In remarks Wednesday outside the Capitol, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi praised how her party harnessed social media. Without you and without the technology of Periscope [the sit-in] would just be a debate in the Halls of Congress unrecorded because they turned off the microphones, Pelosi said. But we raised our voices.They turned off the cameras and we went to Periscope. Congressman Mark Takano, who began posting live videos from the chamber to his Facebook page Wednesday afternoon and continued to throughout the night, said the social media video helped him connect with constituents. Once I got started with the live streaming I didnt feel like I could let down the people who were following me, said Takano. It was a way to push out a message. Even C-SPAN, which typically broadcasts footage recorded by the House cameras, picked up live video from four different members of Congress roughly two hours after the House cameras shut down, according to communications director Howard Mortman. It marked the first time the channel broadcast a live social media feed from the House floor. Something interesting is happening with Facebook Live thats bringing more openness to the political process, said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, in a post to his social media profile Thursday. Its a way to share anything you want with the world using just your phone. ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 ",1
Democrats say gun defeat in Congress could help on campaign trail,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in Congress ended a 25-hour sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives where they have been countless times before: short of the votes needed to tighten U.S. gun laws. But many see their latest defeat as a prelude to victory in the Nov. 8 elections. Spurred by the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Democrats are showing a new willingness to make gun laws a top issue in Washington and on the campaign trail, defying powerful lobbying groups like the National Rifle Association that have helped make the United States the most gun-friendly country in the developed world. The effort is not likely to change federal firearms laws this year, as Republicans who control Congress have shown little interest in proposals that they say weaken Americans constitutional right to bear arms. But Democrats and their allies say that defeat now on Capitol Hill could help them win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections. That is a shift from previous elections when Democrats have downplayed the issue on the campaign trail. The tide has turned, and Republicans ignore this issue at their own peril, said Robert Weiner, a former Democratic congressional aide.  Hillary Clinton, the Democrats presumptive presidential nominee, talks frequently in her campaign about banning military-style assault rifles and expanding background checks  a marked contrast to President Barack Obama, who avoided talk of guns during his 2008 and 2012 elections. In Congress, Democrats have resorted to confrontational tactics to force gun votes since June 12, when a gunman killed 49 people at a Florida nightclub. Senator Chris Murphys 15-hour speech in the Senate last week forced five votes this week on measures that would make it harder for terrorism suspects to buy guns, though none have advanced. In the House, Democrats occupied the chamber for 25 hours in an unsuccessful attempt to force votes on terrorism suspects and expanding background checks for gun buyers. Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway said Democrats willingness to talk about guns reflects the party becoming more liberal, not a change in public sentiment.  Most voters view the shooting in Orlando as an act of terrorism inspired by Islamic State, she said. The shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, he did not call 911 and pledge allegiance to Smith & Wesson, she said, referring to an acronym for Islamic State and the firearms manufacturer. Still, Democrats willingness to take a stand on gun control has shifted the debate, said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. Theres a potentially a good electoral outcome for Democrats out of this. They will probably pick up seats, he said. After landslide defeats in 2010 and 2014, most Democrats who remain in office tend to represent safely liberal congressional districts where gun control is popular. But those up for election in competitive states have spoken up as well. U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who hopes to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio in gun-friendly Florida, said during the House sit-in that gun rights groups like the NRA are largely responsible for the countrys 32,000 annual gun deaths.  This passion youre seeing is whats needed to get people to wake up, he said on the House floor. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats have public opinion on their side: a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted this week found that 48 percent of those surveyed support strong gun regulations, while 23 percent support minimal rules. Support runs higher for specific proposals, like imposing background checks on all gun buyers. (bit.ly/28U7CA7) But intensity has been a sticking point for gun control advocates. The NRA has been able to mobilize supporters who are willing to vote for or against a candidate solely because of their position on guns, while gun-control supporters typically consider other issues as well, such as abortion and the environment. Anytime the Democrats start a gun movement, it costs them votes, said Dave Mudcat Saunders, who has worked for centrist Democratic candidates. I cant imagine its changing. Shootings in Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and, most recently, Orlando have changed that dynamic, others say.  Mass shootings are highly visible, and force people to pay attention and realize that we have a problem that isnt going to be solved by more guns, said Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist in Atlanta who worked on Obamas 2012 campaign. The gun-control lobbying group Everytown for Gun Safety says its members generated 245,000 telephone calls to Congress, and brought hundreds of its members to Congress to press for action during the debate. Ive been in the fight for a number of years and Ive never seen anything like this, said Colin Goddard, an advocate with the group who was wounded during the 2007 Virginia Tech mass shooting.

White House threatens to veto Republicans' Zika funding plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday threatened to veto the $1.1 billion approved by the U.S. House of Representatives to fight the Zika virus, blasting the measure for short-changing the administrations $1.9 billion funding request. The Republican-controlled House approved the funding deal early Thursday morning after reaching a deal with both House and Senate Republicans. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the bill falls far short of the amount of money recommended by health officials to address the spread of the Zika virus. This is a bill that would steal money from other critically important public health priorities, Schultz told reporters at a briefing. We urge Republicans to stop turning this into a political football, and to actually get to work to come up with proposals that will serve the American people. The administration also criticized the bill for limiting contraception access for women seeking to prevent Zika, which can be spread through unprotected sex.  The Senate is expected to vote on funding to combat the Zika virus next week, but the bill faces an uncertain fate in the chamber, where the Democratic minority has more power to stop legislation. Democratic leader Harry Reid has declared his opposition. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan urged the Senate to move on the bill. It is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public, Ryan said. Republicans said the deal included funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.  If the Senate approved the bill, a White House veto would likely mean that lawmakers would not take up the issue until the House and Senate return from their July 4 holiday recess - well into the U.S. summer season. The House has already adjourned for holiday and the Senate is expected to start its recess next Friday.       Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to more Zika funding, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million that had been set aside to fight Ebola. House Democrats said they could not go along with the deal because of $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere that the Republicans want to use to pay for the Zika spending. Senate Democrats also voiced displeasure, clouding the outlook for it passing. A narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off womens access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus, Reid said.  According to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, $543 million of the $1.1 billion would come from unspent funds set aside for implementing Obamacare in U.S. territories, while $107 million would come from unused funds to fight another virus, Ebola. Another $100 million would come from unused administrative funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 ",1
Clinton's server technician declines to answer court-ordered questions,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The computer technician who set up Hillary Clintons private email server for her work as U.S. secretary of state declined to answer questions more than 125 times during a deposition ordered by a federal judge, a transcript released on Thursday shows. Bryan Pagliano worked on Clintons previous presidential run in 2008. He joined the State Departments technology department the next year as one of Clintons political appointees and set up the unauthorized server in her New York home.  The decision to set up the server has dogged Clinton, the presumptive Democratic Party candidate ahead of Novembers presidential election, and clouded her campaign with legal uncertainty. A majority of voters say they find her dishonest, polls show, with many citing her private server as a reason. Judge Emmet Sullivan of the U.S. District Court in Washington had ordered Pagliano and other Clinton aides and department officials to give sworn testimony to help him decide whether the server was set up to thwart the publics right to see government records.  Sullivan is overseeing a lawsuit by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group suing the State Department. It is one of scores of such lawsuits filed by individuals and groups who were incorrectly told by the government that Clinton had no emails before the arrangement became publicly known in 2015, two years after Clinton left the department. On the advice of counsel, I will decline to answer your question in reliance on my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Pagliano said 128 times over 80 minutes in response to a series of questions by a Judicial Watch lawyer. The deposition under oath took place on Wednesday. The Fifth Amendment gives Americans the right not to be forced to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases. Pagliano is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justices criminal inquiry on the server arrangement in exchange for a form of immunity from prosecution.  The inquiry, prompted by the discovery of classified government secrets among Clintons emails, has been underway for nearly a year. Investigators have interviewed several of Clintons senior aides. No one has been charged.  Clinton has repeatedly said the server was a mistake in hindsight and that she thought it was allowed, which department officials now say was not the case. She has said she does not believe she will be charged with breaking any laws. Her spokesmen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 ",1

Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.  The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at 1,434 through May 21 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation declined to 3,257. Colombia confirmed two cases of microcephaly linked to Zika. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. Cases of sexual transmission have also been reported, prompting health officials to advise use of condoms, or abstaining from sex, to prevent infection between partners. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 48 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (39): Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is relatively common and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. All cases involve possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. The WHO has also identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  British health officials reported Zika was found in a mans semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue. ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 ",1

Trump will not ask donors to repay nearly $50 million in campaign loans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump has forgiven nearly $50 million in loans he made to his presidential campaign, he said on Thursday, signaling to donors that future contributions will be used to fight Democrat Hillary Clinton and not to repay himself. The announcement that Trump will not seek repayment of the loans via contributions came amid concerns from his backers that he does not have enough money to fund his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. He had only $1.3 million in cash to start the month. I have absolutely no intention of paying myself back for the nearly $50 million dollars I have loaned to the campaign, the presumptive Republican nominee said in a statement. The New York developer has suggested he could use more of his personal wealth to help win the White House. (Trump) has also said he will contribute significantly more money, Steve Mnuchin, the top fundraiser for Trumps campaign, said in an interview on CNBC earlier on Thursday. Mnuchin was the first to say that Trump would forgive the loans. Although Trump has said he has unlimited personal wealth to fund his White House run, a Reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to Election Day. Gaylord Hughey, a Texas-based fundraiser supporting Trump, called Trumps decision to forgive the loans unprecedented. I think it indicates that hes all in and he wants every dollar to be spent toward a successful campaign for the general election, Hughey said. Hughey, who as a bundler collects donations from other supporters, said Trump was broadening the pool of donors in addition to gaining support from people who historically donate to Republicans.  Weve had new folks come in as major donors unexpectedly, Hughey said. Mnuchin also told CNBC that Trump had seen a strong uptick in fundraising in the past week. He said Trump raised about $10 million in conjunction with the Republican Party at fundraising events this week. Trump also raised $6 million through online donations, Mnuchin said, following the wealthy New York businessmans first attempt to appeal to supporters to contribute to his campaign. Weve really ramped up the effort this month, Mnuchin said.  Supporters began worrying on Monday after Trumps campaign revealed weak fundraising totals. He began June far behind Clinton, who had a $42 million war chest to start the month. Candidates need a hefty bank account to fund a presidential bid, including hundreds of millions of dollars for television advertising and staff. Trump has benefited from extensive media coverage but could be buried in attack ads if he lacks the funds to push his own message. Mnuchin said Trumps numbers at the beginning of June were irrelevant because his fundraising efforts for the general election only started recently.  Trump funded his campaign for the Republican nomination largely through his own personal wealth, putting money into his campaign in the form of loans. By leaving them as loans, he would be entitled to seek repayment from his campaign. By converting the loans into contributions, Trump is telling his supporters he will not seek repayment via contributions. There are no legal limits on how much candidates can contribute to their own campaigns, in contrast to caps on how much an individual, company or group can give. Trump only began fundraising in earnest at the end of May. His campaign has said that donations have been pouring in since he started seeking contributions.  On Tuesday, Trump attended a dinner fundraiser in Manhattan, where the attendees included billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital and hedge fund manager John Paulson. Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets football team, hosted a breakfast fundraiser for Trump at a restaurant in the city. Trumps campaign was working to quickly raise large sums via a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee and several state Republican parties.  A presidential candidate can only accept up to $5,400 from an individual donor. The joint fundraising agreement allows Trump to accept checks as high as $450,000. The donations are then divided up between the campaign and the state funds.  That money is then used to hire staff and contact voters in battleground states, efforts intended to help elect Trump and other Republicans running for office. Such states are hotly contested because their voters can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in White House contests. ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 ",1
U.S. Senate advances compromise gun control measure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday advanced a compromise gun control plan to stop people on some terrorism watch lists from buying guns, in the wake of the June 12th mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. While the measure, spearheaded by Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, cleared one procedural hurdle, it was not clear if the Senate would move further ahead on it. Passing the bill in the House of Representatives could also be an uphill battle.  ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 ",1
"Latest gun control bid falters in Congress, Democrat sit-in ends","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Another attempt at gun control faltered in the U.S. Congress on Thursday despite outrage at the Orlando massacre, as a proposed ban on firearms sales to people being monitored for links to terrorism barely avoided being killed in the Senate. In a procedural vote, the Senate narrowly rejected an attempt to scrap the plan by Republican Senator Susan Collins to prevent guns getting into the hands of people on two U.S. government terrorism watch lists.  But the proposal looked short of the support it would need to advance through the chamber, and Republican leaders said the Senate would switch from debating gun control to other matters until at least after the July 4 holiday.         It was the latest setback for proponents of gun restrictions who have been thwarted for years on Capitol Hill by gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.     Frequent efforts at gun control have failed despite anger at mass shootings like the killings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and in San Bernardino, California, last year.  Eventually this problem will get addressed again one of two ways: We find a breakthrough, which I will seek, or there will be another terrorist attack which will bring us right back to this issue. I hope we can do it without another terrorist attack, said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who supported Collins.        A few hours earlier, Democratic lawmakers ended a sit-in protest in the House of Representatives over guns. Fueled by Chinese food and pizzas, dozens of them stayed on the House floor all night, at times bursting into the civil rights anthem We Shall Overcomebefore giving up their protest after 25 hours.      Its not a struggle that lasts for one day, or one week, or one month, or one year, said Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a key figure in the civil rights protests of the 1960s. Were going to win the struggle, said Lewis, who led the House sit-in.  Dramatic protests by legislators are rare in the U.S. Capitol and the sit-in underscored how sensitive the gun control issue became after this months Florida attack, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Opinion polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen.      After a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, some senators had seen resistance to gun restrictions softening because the issue had partly become one of national security. But Collins measure received only 52 votes in the 100-seat Senate test vote, short of the 60 votes that would be needed for  approval in future Senate procedural votes.  While her plan could be revived next month, it is unclear if she has the momentum to overcome pro-gun rights forces in Congress who argue that gun control measures in Congress have been too restrictive and trample on the constitutional right to bear arms. Four other gun control measures failed earlier this week.              Collins, a Maine lawmaker, wants to forbid gun sales to anyone on the U.S. governments No Fly List for terrorism suspects or the Selectee List of people who receive extra security screening at airports.         Despite the lack of legislation, the gun debate has stirred passions. The House Democrats sit-in brought an outpouring of grass-roots activity.  Jennifer Hoppe, deputy director of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said that in less than 24 hours from Wednesday, about 130,000 calls were made from supporters of gun control to members of Congress. First lady Michelle Obama backed the House Democrats protest. We have grieved for too many children and wept for too many families after shootings. Chicago. Tucson. Newtown. Charleston. Orlando. #Enough, she wrote on Twitter on Thursday. The Democrats were seeking votes on legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases, as well as measures to curb the sale of weapons to people on government watch lists             Republicans allied with the NRA gun rights group say that while they want to combat terrorism, they represent constituents who believe firmly in the constitutional right to bear arms.  Its a tough issue. For people like myself, who come from a hunting and fishing state, its pretty hard, said Senator Orrin Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who voted against Collins.

Republican lawmakers approve $1.1 billion in new Zika funds,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday agreed to $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus, short-changing President Barack Obamas $1.9 billion funding request and angering Democrats by making other cuts to pay for it. The House approved a funding deal that had been agreed to on Wednesday by Republicans from both the House and Senate. But the bills future was uncertain in the Senate, where the Democratic minority has more power to stop legislation, and Democratic leader Harry Reid has declared his opposition. It is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Republicans said the deal included funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.  But the White House said the allocation fell short.  This plan from congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus, and steals funding from other health priorities, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement before the House voted. Earnest said the Republican plan would limit needed birth control services for women seeking to prevent Zika, which can be spread through unprotected sex  a clear indication they dont take seriously the threat from the Zika virus.  Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to more Zika funding, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million that had been set aside to fight Ebola. House Democrats said they could not go along with the deal because of $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere that the Republicans want to use to pay for the Zika spending.  Senate Democrats also voiced displeasure, clouding the outlook for it passing. A narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off womens access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus, Reid said.  Still, Ryan urged the Senate to move on the bill.  According to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, $543 million of the $1.1 billion would come from unspent funds set aside for implementing Obamacare in U.S. territories, while $107 million would come from unused funds to fight another virus, Ebola. Another $100 million would come from unused administrative funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1

House Democrats broadcast 'sit-in' on social media after cameras shut down,"(Reuters) - Democrats demanding action on gun control turned to Twitters Periscope and Facebooks live video platform to broadcast their sit-in on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday after the chambers cameras shut down. Representative Scott Peters of California told Reuters he downloaded the online video platform Periscope from the House floor after it became clear that chamber cameras were not operating.  Thanks to them, the American people got to look in on and listen to what is taking place this floor, U.S. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina said in praise of the platform. The protest was the latest move by Democrats to persuade the Republican majority in Congress to take up votes on gun control measures in response to last weeks mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, the deadliest in modern U.S. history. The speaker (Paul Ryan) controls the cameras, Peters said. We noticed that over lunch, he turned them off - allowed them to be turned off. A spokesman for Twitter said that tweets from Peters account containing the Periscope footage had been viewed over 800,000 times as of Wednesday night. Ryans spokesman, AshLee Strong, said in a statement:     The House cannot operate without members following the rules of the institution, so the House has recessed subject to the call of the chair. At about noon EDT, presiding House officer and Republican Representative Ted Poe declared the House not in order, as Democratic protesters sat at the front of the chamber. Cable news channel C-SPAN, which typically uses the House cameras to broadcast live footage of Congress, broadcast Peters Periscope and other lawmakers feeds. Other news networks and cable news channels, including MSNBC, FOX and CNN, also ran parts of the footage. C-SPAN communications director Howard Mortman said it was the first time the channel broadcast a live social media feed from the House floor. The House controls the cameras and that means they control the camera angles, the audio, video, the whole thing, Mortman said. Were using social media platforms to show whats happening. With official broadcasts suspended in the House, weve created a channel to follow #NoBillNoBreak on #Periscope live, Periscope said in a tweet. Peters said about five or six Democratic House members had broadcast live video during the sit-in. Late Wednesday, lawmakers cheered their thanks during one of his feeds that aired on C-SPAN. One representative, Eric Swalwell of California, published live video from the House floor to Facebook. #NoBillNoBreak became a rallying cry for gun control supporters on Twitter and quickly became the top-trending hashtag in the United States on the social media platform. Politicians and average social media users alike used the hashtag as a sign of solidarity with the sit-in. Nowhere Id rather spend my bday than the House floor w/ @repjohnlewis for gun control. #NoBillNoBreak #goodtrouble, tweeted Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is mentioned as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

U.S. completes 'takedown' of Medicare fraud: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement officials have charged 301 suspects with trying to defraud Medicare and other federal insurance programs in 2016, marking the largest takedown involving health care fraud allegations, the Justice Department said on Wednesday. The national sweep resulted in charges against doctors, nurses, pharmacists and physical therapists accused of fraud that cost the government $900 million, the department said.      The cases involved an array of charges, including conspiracy to commit health care fraud, money laundering and violations of an anti-kickback law.  This years sweep exceeded last years record in which 243 defendants faced charges in a combined $712 million in government losses. Officials said it was the largest takedown in the nine-year history of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, a joint initiative between federal, state and local law enforcement. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said some of the cases reflect new, troublesome trends, including instances of identity theft in order to prepare fake prescriptions and a growing number of cases involving compounding, or the mixing of medications tailored to meet a patients needs. Compounded medications are typically very expensive. From 2012 to 2014, the quarterly Medicare spending on these prescriptions skyrocketed from $28 million to $171 million. As this takedown should make clear, health care fraud is not an abstract violation or benign offense, Lynch said. It is a serious crime.  In one case, two owners of a group of outpatient clinics and a patient recruiter stand accused of filing $36 million in fraudulent claims for physical therapy and other services that were not medically necessary.  The Justice Department said that to find patients, the clinic operators and the recruiter targeted poor drug addicts and offered them narcotics so they could bill them for services that were never provided. Another case was filed against the operator of a marketing business that received referral fees from pharmacies that filled and billed Tricare, the U.S. militarys government insurance program, for compounded medicines.  The prescriptions were submitted via telemedicine sites, and doctors were given blank prescription forms to fill out, regardless of medical necessity, according to the complaint. One doctor told the FBI her identity and medical credentials were used without her permission to fill thousands of dollars worth of prescriptions.",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1
Medicare program spending within target rate: trustees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans hospital bills will exhaust its reserves in 2028, two years sooner than last years estimate, trustees of the program said on Wednesday, but spending growth remained within forecasts. The Medicare program, which provides health coverage for more than 55 million older as well as disabled people, said that the projected growth rate for per capita spending has not exceeded its target. That put aside the need for the programs regulator, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, to establish a savings target and to initiate mandatory spending cuts, their annual financial report said. As such, the government would not need to immediately set up an Independent Payment Advisory Board to make proposals on the cuts, it said. Drug stocks gained after the release of the report on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index up 2.5 percent. It had lost ground ahead of the reports release. Wall Street analysts had worried that if the mandatory savings clause was triggered, the new board might have tried to implement cuts in prescription drug prices. Not hitting the trigger is good news for healthcare investors, Sanford Bernstein analyst Timothy Anderson wrote in a research note. In the annual financial review, the trustees also said that the combined Social Security and disability trust fund reserves are estimated to run out in 2034, the same projection as last year. Medicare spending in 2015 totaled $647.6 billion.    The Medicare programs trust fund for hospital care is still scheduled to have sufficient funding 11 years longer than the estimate given before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the trustees said. The trustees put the shorter timeline down to changes in estimates of income and cost, particularly in the near term. A depletion in funds available for Medicare and Social Security does not mean the programs would suddenly stop. At the current rate of payroll tax collections, Medicare would be able to cover 87 percent of costs in 2028. This would fall to 79 percent by 2043 and then gradually increase. Social Security would be able to pay about three-quarters of scheduled benefits from 2034 to 2090, the trustees said.  ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1

"Rubio seeks re-election to Senate, says Trump 'worrisome'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio will seek re-election to his U.S. Senate seat, he announced on Wednesday, reversing a pledge not to run and saying the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency worries him. The first-term Florida senator said the Senate can be frustrating, but that it is also a place where policy advances can be made and one that can counteract the power of the White House. But as we begin the next chapter in the history of our nation, theres another role for the Senate that could end up being its most important in the years to come: The Constitutional power to act as a check and balance on the excesses of a president, Rubio said in a statement. The 45-year-old lawmaker, a proven fund-raiser who is well known nationally, had been under intense pressure to run, especially given the cost of contesting an important election swing-state where campaign advertising is expensive. Republicans are more likely to retain his seat if he is a candidate in the Nov. 8 general election, as they face a tough fight to preserve their majority in the Senate. He could also rally Republican voters to head to the polls in a state that is critical in the presidential race. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, took Florida by just a one percentage-point margin in 2012 over Republican Mitt Romney. This year, Republicans must defend 24 of the 54 seats they now hold in the 100-member Senate, compared with just 10 the Democrats have to fight to retain. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it would be a terrific outcome if Rubio decided to run.  Rubio had harsh words for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, predicting her election would mean four more years of what he termed Obamas failed policies. But he said the prospect of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the White House was also worrisome, citing Trumps statements about women and minorities and noting that many of the likely Republican nominees positions on important issues are unknown. If he is elected, we will need Senators willing to encourage him in the right direction, and if necessary, stand up to him, Rubios statement said. Still, he pledged to vote for Trump, a real estate mogul and political neophyte who has shaken the Republican establishment.  Its not the choice I wanted ... and its not the choice a lot of people are comfortable with, but its the choice we have, he told CNN in an interview. His announcement did not mention the massacre last week at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, but he had said in recent days he was reconsidering his decision not to run because of his concern about serious events in the country, including the mass shooting. The decision reversed a campaign pledge Rubio made a year ago to retire from the Senate if his presidential bid failed. He ended his bid for the nomination in March after losing the primary in his home state to Trump following a harsh war of words. The Cook Political Report said Rubios announcement breathed new life into Republican chances of holding onto the seat but still rated the race as a toss-up, citing his poor Senate attendance record and the senators remarks during his presidential campaign that he was frustrated with the upper chamber. Republican U.S. Representative David Jolly, who had been seeking the Senate seat, opened the door for Rubio to run when he stepped aside last week.  After Wednesdays announcement, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera, a friend of Rubio, and Republican U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis also scrapped plans to seek the seat. Other Republicans, however, have not announced plans to quit ahead of Floridas Aug. 30 primary. U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, a leading Democratic challenger, accused Rubio of first abandoning his constituents, and now treating them like a consolation prize.

"Former Ford, Bush national security adviser Scowcroft endorses Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brent Scowcroft, who was national security adviser to two Republican U.S. presidents, on Wednesday endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump, in a snub of the Republican Partys likely nominee by a prominent member of its security wing. The presidency requires the judgment and the knowledge to make tough calls under pressure, the Republican elder statesman said in a statement. I believe Hillary Clinton has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time. Scowcroft, 91, served as national security adviser under Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Ford was president from 1974 to 1977 and Bush from 1989 to 1993. He joined a number of well-known Republicans defecting due to the prospect of a Trump presidency, including Richard Armitage, deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush.  Armitage gave Clinton, 68, who was secretary of state under Democratic President Barack Obama, his backing last week. Trump doesnt appear to be a Republican, he doesnt appear to want to learn about issues. So, Im going to vote for Mrs. Clinton, Armitage told Politico at the time.  The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Scowcrofts endorsement of Clinton. Trump, 70, who has never held elected office, often boasts on the campaign trail his relative newness to politics, appealing to voters disillusioned by the current political climate.  Despite that facet of his appeal - which helped Trump beat 16 rivals in the campaigns primary phase to become his partys presumptive nominee - establishment Republicans worry that his inexperience and brash style will alienate foreign allies and other international partners. Among his proposals, Trump has criticized NATO, a cornerstone of U.S. security policy, and said he would consider letting Japan and South Korea develop their own nuclear weapons instead of relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China. Secretary Clinton shares my belief that America must remain the worlds indispensable leader, Scowcroft said. She understands that our leadership and engagement beyond our borders makes the world, and therefore the United States, more secure and prosperous. Trump has said he would strengthen national security, but has offered few details about his plans, other than his proposals to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border and for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.  Many national security experts have expressed alarm over the proposed ban and have warned that Trumps fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail is fueling extremism. ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1
"Clinton offers her vision for U.S economy, rebukes Trump's","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday that if the U.S. Congress does not act to close tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy and corporations, she will ask the Treasury Department to take up the issue if she is elected president. Lets make sure that Wall Street, corporations and the super rich pay their fair share of taxes, Clinton said in Raleigh, North Carolina, the state capital. The former U.S. secretary of state used her campaign stop to offer her vision for bolstering the economy after using a speech on the topic on Tuesday to attack presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, predicting a Trump recession if he becomes president. Trump delivered his own speech attacking Clinton on Wednesday, saying she is part of a political establishment that has cheated American workers through bad trade deals. In her speech on Wednesday, Clinton said, I think its an understatement to say Americans face a choice in November. Im here today to offer an alternative. When people say the game is rigged, the best evidence is the (U.S.) tax code. It is riddled with scams, loopholes and other special breaks, added Clinton, the presumptive Democratic  nominee. She said that if the Republican-controlled Congress does not enact reforms to end tax breaks for the wealthy, she would use her presidential authority to direct the Treasury Department to do so. Democratic President Barack Obama has faced criticism for using executive action. In one example, he used executive power to shield certain groups from the threat of deportation when immigration legislation stalled in Congress. Clinton said modifying the tax code is one prong in a five-part plan the federal government would follow to jump-start the American economy if she is elected on Nov. 8: - Large-scale investment in rebuilding infrastructure to create well-paying jobs;  - Enabling debt-free college educations; - Giving companies incentives to share profits with employees; - Creating national family-friendly policies such as paid family leave. In a nod to populists within the Democratic Party who may have supported U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic Primary, Clinton also said she would aim to raise the federal minimum wage, strengthen labor unions and reject international trade deals that do not benefit U.S. workers. As I said during the primary, I am a progressive who likes to get things done, and we can do this, Clinton said. ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1
"Seeking to regain ground, Trump calls Clinton corrupt and a liar","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump staged a harsh attack on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, accusing her of corruption and dangerous incompetence as he tried to put his campaign back on track after recent setbacks. In a speech in New York that Clintons campaign called nutty and that was criticized by some Republicans, Trump argued that the former secretary of state is part of a political establishment that has cheated American workers through bad trade deals and endangered U.S. national security. Both candidates are seeking to overcome their high unfavorable ratings among voters at the Nov. 8 election by painting the other as a villain who puts personal gain over the interests of less powerful Americans.  Even by the standards of modern presidential races, the sparring between Clinton, a former secretary of state and U.S. senator, and brash businessman Trump has made for unusually acidic rhetoric. Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States, Trump told a small crowd of supporters at a hotel he owns in Manhattan, accusing her of having run the State Department like her own personal hedge fund.  Clintons staff quickly dismissed that attack and others as lies. Trump read his speech from a teleprompter to curb his off-the-cuff comments but he pulled no punches. He said Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft and described her as a world-class liar. Republican Lindsey Graham, a U.S. senator from South Carolina who has so far declined to support Trump, said he disagreed that Clinton may be the most corrupt person to have run for the White House, and challenged Trump to become more presidential. My advice to Mr. Trump would be to make the case that you have the temperament, knowledge and judgment to be president, he said on CNN. Thats the mountain youve got to climb. Trumps campaign has been distracted in recent weeks by racially-charged comments he made about a Mexican-American judge and the Republicans firing of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski this week.     The New York real estate mogul is trailing Clinton in most opinion polls, and campaign finance figures released on Monday show he has raised only a fraction of the amount Clinton has brought in, although Trump has said he is willing to loan his campaign more money.     In his speech, Trump repeated accusations that Clintons decisions as Americas top diplomat were influenced by donations to the Clinton Foundation and associated charities.  Clinton and her staff have denied this and similar allegations, dismissing them as politically motivated smears. The only thing Donald Trump offered today was more hypocritical lies and nutty conspiracy theories, Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said. The State Department has said it is not aware of any evidence of improper influence, although it has acknowledged that new donations from foreign governments should have been submitted to the departments ethics advisers for prior review but were not, in breach of an ethics agreement Clinton signed before taking office. Trump attacked the Clinton Foundation for accepting millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and other countries criticized by the United States for not protecting the rights of women and gay people. Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, has said that accepting such funding is not an endorsement of everything a foreign government does. Clinton added a pointed defense of the Clinton Foundation in a speech later on Wednesday. The Clinton Foundation helps poor people around the world get access to lifesaving AIDS medicine, she told cheering supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina. Donald Trump uses poor people around the world to produce his line of suits and ties. Trump also said Clinton had used bad political judgment in her four years as secretary of state, failing to stop the rise of Islamic State, keep strong sanctions on Iran or avoid chaos in Libya. Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched, Trump said.          On Tuesday, Clinton delivered her own blistering attack on Trump, saying that putting him in the White House would be a disaster for the U.S. economy.  On Wednesday, Clinton won the endorsement of former U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, a Republican who served under Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed that 44.5 percent of likely voters backed Clinton, while 35.5 percent supported Trump. Some of the accusations made by Trump on Wednesday appeared to contradict the public record. He said Clinton would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees to the United States without any prior screening. But under the current process, refugees must wait months or years in foreign camps while U.S. security agencies review their backgrounds, a system Clinton supports. Trump said Clinton was sleeping soundly in her bed as a deadly attack unfolded in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 in which four Americans were killed. State Department records show Clinton was in her State Department office when news of the opening assaults came through. She has said she later worked through the night on the U.S. response.             ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1

Trump to detour from campaign to visit Scotland golf properties,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facing slumping poll numbers and a shakeup of his team, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump takes a detour from the campaign trail this week to visit his golf resorts in Scotland. Trump leaves Thursday on a three-day trip centered on the grand reopening of Trump Turnberry, which the New York businessman bought in 2014 and renovated at an estimated cost of $290 million. He will also visit his other Scottish golf property in Aberdeen. His visit to Scotland, the birthplace of his mother, comes as Britain votes on Thursday on whether to remain in the European Union. Trump has said Britain would probably be better off if it left the EU. He will hold a news conference on Friday when he will doubtless be asked to respond to the vote. Trumps trip abroad comes at an unusual time given the political calendar. With less than a month left until the Republican convention in Cleveland where he is to be formally nominated, Trump is lagging in fundraising and campaign organization and taking heavy fire from Democrat Hillary Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election. He is under pressure to adopt a more presidential demeanor and strengthen his campaign organization after a rocky period in which he criticized a U.S.-born federal judge as unfair because of his Mexican heritage and took fire for his response to the killing of 49 people at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub. Just this week, he fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski at the urging of family members alarmed at the direction of his campaign. It also emerged that he had only $1.3 million in cash on hand at the end of May to fund his campaign, compared with  Clintons war chest of $42 million. His poll numbers have also dropped. After sealing the nomination seven weeks ago, Trump was basically tied in national polls with Clinton. But she has crept ahead in many polls in the past two weeks. Trump and his aides see the Scotland visit as a chance to showcase his far-flung business empire and job-creating abilities. Aides said the trip also reinforcedhis ancestral ties to Scotland and his love of family, with his children playing an important role in his business dealings. But many Republicans see Trumps trip to Scotland as a waste of valuable time. It has nothing to do with running for president, said Republican strategist Rick Tyler, who was a spokesman for  former presidential candidate, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. It speaks to the non-seriousness of the campaign when youre taking time off the campaign trail to leave the country for a place where there are no voters. Trumps golf properties are among his proudest business possessions and he is particularly proud of Turnberry, where the British Open has been played four times, including the famed Duel in the Sun in 1977 when Tom Watson edged Jack Nicklaus by one stroke. Limiting the trip to his golf properties means there are likely to be fewer chances for missteps like 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romneys gaffe-filled trip to London, Jerusalem and Poland four years ago. But it offers little chance for Trump to burnish his foreign policy credentials. Traditionally, nominees take overseas trips to build their foreign policy chops, said Republican strategist Scott Reed. Trump is not meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has denounced Trump as divisive for his proposed Muslim ban and anti-immigrant rhetoric. ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1
House Republicans unveil healthcare alternative to Obamacare,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled an alternative plan to overhaul the nations healthcare system on Wednesday, slamming Obamacare even as they aimed to keep some of its more popular provisions. Their proposal, part of broader effort by House Speaker Paul Ryan to offer a Republican agenda ahead of the Nov. 8 elections, is conservatives latest bid to repeal and replace the 2010 law. Ryan, the countrys highest-ranking elected Republican, is offering the proposal as the party seeks to maintain control of both the House and the Senate and take over the White House. Other proposals cover tax reform, address poverty as well as national security. Republicans have challenged President Barack Obamas signature Affordable Care Act since it was enacted and have voted repeatedly to repeal it. Obama, a Democrat, has said it has helped some 20 million Americans get health care coverage. Ryan acknowledged his agenda was unlikely to displace current law anytime soon.     Were not going to repeal Obamacare when the current president of the United States is a guy named Obama, he told reporters. What we are laying out today is a first-time-in-six-years consensus by the Republicans in the House on what we replace Obamacare with. In their plan, which is not formal legislation, House Republicans blasted Obamacare for limiting patients choices, increasing consumer costs, and burying employers and health care providers under new regulations. Ryans proposal would keep some popular pieces, including not allowing people with pre-existing conditions to be denied coverage and permitting children to stay on their parents coverage until age 26. It would also allow states that have already expanded the number of people eligible for Medicaid under the law to maintain the additional coverage, although it would prevent any new states from doing so.      For people without insurance through their jobs, the Republicans would establish a refundable tax credit. Obamacare also provides subsidies for people to buy insurance if they do not qualify for Medicaid. It also includes long-held Republican proposals such as allowing consumers to buy health insurance across state lines, expanding health savings accounts, reforming medical liability rules and giving block grants to states to run Medicaid programs for the poor. Democrats, who have said they are open to tweaking Obamacare, dismissed Ryans proposals as little more than warmed-over ideas that have long been in the Republican playbook.  House Republican would gradually raise the Medicare eligibility age, now 65, to match that of the Social Security pension plan, which is 67 for people born in 1960 or later. Like Obamacares so-called Cadillac tax on expensive healthcare plans offered by employers, which goes into effect in 2018, the Republican proposal would cap the tax deductibility of employer-based plans.  Industry groups struck a bipartisan tone in their reaction ahead of the election, as it remains to be seen who ultimately wins control of Congress and the White House.  We stand ready to work with both parties on market-based solutions that improve access and affordability for consumers, said Marilyn Tavenner, president of Americas Health Insurance Plans.

Democratic senators ask Justice Department to block insurance megamergers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven Democratic senators urged the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday to block two mergers of major health insurance companies, saying that the proposed deals would mean higher premiums and lower-quality healthcare for consumers. The department is reviewing Aetna Incs $33 billion plan to buy Humana Inc and Anthem Incs $48 billion proposal to buy Cigna Corp. If approved, the deals, both of which were announced last July, would reduce the number of national health insurance carriers from five to three. We urge the DOJ (Justice Department) to challenge these mergers from proceeding and to prevent the damage they would cause to competition and consumers, wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Al Franken of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dianne Feinstein of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. The letter was dated Wednesday and addressed to Renata Hesse, who heads the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. In the letter, the lawmakers said they were skeptical of the idea that the proposed deals would be good for consumers because the companies could use their larger size to hammer out better deals for patients.  The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that few if any cost savings secured by the merging firms through the exercise of market power will be passed on to consumers, they wrote. The lawmakers also disagreed with the notion that the sale of carefully chosen assets to a competitor could resolve antitrust issues, and pointed to past instances where mergers with divestitures led to higher premiums or where competitors bought divested assets, but then did not use them. We are not convinced that any divestitures required of the merging parties will succeed today, given that they have so clearly failed in the recent past, the lawmakers wrote. Capitol Hill does not have a say in whether the Justice Department sues to stop deals. Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said that the company planned to close the merger with Humana in the second half of this year. We believe a combined company is in the best interest of consumers. We continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice on its thorough review of the transaction, Crawford said. Representatives of Anthem could not immediately be reached for comment.

Peru president-elect jokes about ending ties with U.S. if Trump wins,"LIMA (Reuters) - Perus president-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said amid laughter on Tuesday that his government would sever ties with the United States if Republican Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in November. Kuczynski, a 77-year-old former investment banker who won the Andean countrys tight runoff race earlier this month, said he mentioned his worries about a Trump presidency to U.S. President Barack Obama on a congratulatory phone call. Asked by a reporter what would happen to relations with the United States if Trump wins, a laughing Kuczynski said were going to grab a saw and cut them off! The presumptive Republican nominee in the race to succeed Obama, Trump has sparked criticism across Latin America for his anti-immigrant rhetoric, especially in Mexico where President Enrique Pena Nieto has compared his campaign to the rise of Adolf Hitler. Trump is a threat to the region because he wants to put up a wall between the United States and Latin America and make Mexicans pay for it! Kuczynski said in reference to Trumps proposal for stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs across the southern U.S. border. Peru is a leading global supplier of copper and gold. It also shares the dubious distinction with neighboring Colombia of being one of the worlds leading producers of cocaine. Peru and the United States implemented a free trade agreement in 2009 and are both signatories of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Trump has criticized.

Clinton's lead over Trump narrows to nine points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clintons lead over Republican rival Donald Trump has slipped by about five percentage points since mid-June, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, bringing the race for the White House to within nine points.  The poll showed that 44.5 percent of likely voters supported former secretary of state Clinton while 35.5 percent backed businessman Trump. That compares with 46.6 percent support for Clinton and 32.3 percent for Trump on June 12, a date that marked her widest lead for the month. Trump has focused much of his energy in recent days on the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida by a U.S.-born gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State militant group. Trump vowed to ban people from entering the United States from countries with links to terrorism against America or its allies. Hardline national security proposals have help Trump win increased support from voters in the past, including after the shootings in San Bernardino, California and Paris late last year. Clinton responded to the Orlando attack by calling for increased intelligence gathering and air strikes on Islamic State forces, while warning against demonizing American Muslims. She has also criticized Trumps positions on foreign policy and the economy, saying a Trump presidency would be a disaster.  The June 17-21 poll of 1,100 likely voters has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 ",1
Former California state senator pleads guilty to corruption charge,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former California Senator Ron Calderon pleaded guilty in a federal court on Tuesday to a single count of mail fraud, ending a public corruption case in which he admitted to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes, prosecutors said. Calderon, a Democrat from the Los Angeles suburb of Montebello, left office in 2014 after serving a dozen years in the state Senate and four years in the Assembly. Sentencing is set for Sept. 19. The 58-year-old former politician reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors last week, several weeks before he was scheduled to go on trial on charges contained in a 24-count indictment. His mail fraud offense carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, but prosecutors agreed under the terms of Calderons plea deal to seek a sentence of no more than 70 months, the U.S. Attorneys Office said in a statement. Once an influential figure in the California Legislature, Calderon was one of three Democrats in the state Senate  suspended over ethics charges in 2014, costing their party a cherished two-thirds Senate majority during an election year. According to his indictment, Calderon accepted $100,000 in bribes from the owner of a Long Beach hospital to preserve a loophole in the law that allowed companies controlled by the owner to charge more for hardware used in spinal surgeries. Calderon also was accused of taking bribes from undercover FBI agents posing as Hollywood movie executives in exchange for steering legislation in their favor.  His older brother, Tom Calderon, 62, a former member of the California state Assembly who became a political consultant, also was named in the indictment. He pleaded guilty last Monday to a federal money-laundering charge for allowing bribes earmarked for his brother to be funneled through his firm, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence of no more than a year in prison for the elder Calderon brother.     ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2016 ",1
'Glimmer of hope' seen for compromise U.S. gun control bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators pushed for a compromise gun control bill on Tuesday, a day after the Senate failed to advance four gun measures following last weeks mass shooting in Orlando, the deadliest in modern U.S. history.   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would schedule a vote on a bill by fellow Republican Senator Susan Collins that would prevent about 109,000 people on no-fly and other surveillance lists from purchasing guns. Collins said she expected a vote on the bill this week or next. On Monday, the Senate defeated a Democratic prohibition on gun sales to people on a broader range of government watch lists, while also blocking a narrower Republican measure.  Some senior Republicans would not commit to supporting the Collins bill, citing worries about people being denied the ability to buy weapons without adequate safeguards. But the No. 3 Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, told reporters: There may be a glimmer of hope now, adding that Collins proposal seemed to be a step in the right direction. The measure is being debated in the Senate before the Nov. 8 election when Democrats hope to win control of the Senate and gain seats in the House of Representatives. Democrats believe Republican congressional opposition to wider control bills gives them a powerful campaign issue. It was too soon to tell if President Barack Obama would support the Collins bill. Spokesman Josh Earnest said senior officials including lawyers at the Department of Justice were taking a look at it. If the assessment is that this would enhance the ability of our law enforcement professionals to keep us safe and prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing a gun, then thats likely something that well be able to support, Earnest told reporters in a daily briefing.   In the Senate on Monday, four measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists - two put forth by Democrats and two by Republicans - fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-member chamber. The votes were a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through Congress despite repeated mass shootings. The bills lost in largely party-line votes that showed the political power in Congress of gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association. The White House accused U.S. senators of a shameful display of cowardice and said they failed the American people by not advancing any gun control measures after the Florida shooting. The gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to Islamic State during the June 12 rampage in which he killed 49 people and wounded 53 at an Orlando gay nightclub before being fatally shot by police. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he had concerns about the Collins measure. Its a slippery slope when an American citizen is denied a constitutional right, without forcing the government to come forward with some evidence on the front end that a person should be prohibited from buying guns, he said.   After Mondays votes, the Senate also debated a different tactic for battling domestic attacks that could be inspired by Islamic State and other foreign militant groups. Senators were aiming to vote by Wednesday on legislation by Republican John McCain of Arizona expanding the Federal Bureau of Investigations ability to conduct secret surveillance in counter terrorism investigations. This week well have the opportunity to strengthen our ability to combat lone wolf terrorists and connect the dots so we are better able to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States such as the Orlando massacre, McConnell said. Collins, who held a news conference with eight other senators including Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida, said her bill would stop about 2,700 Americans and 106,300 foreign national on surveillance lists from buying guns. We believe that if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane you are too dangerous to buy a gun, the Maine lawmaker said. She said Americans and immigrants with work permits could appeal a denial and recover lawyers fees if they prevailed.  Nelson said he owed it to the families of the victims in the Orlando shooting as well as police and other first responders to the carnage.  It was not clear whether Collins plan would draw significant bipartisan support. The NRA said her proposal was unconstitutional and would not have prevented the Orlando attack.  Gun control groups promised to intensify their push for legislative action, and not just in Washington. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said her group, besides supporting pro-gun control candidates for Congress, would work to strengthen gun-sale background check laws state by state until Congress acts. If the NRA and their lapdogs in the Senate thought moms would feel dispirited and back down, they are sorely mistaken, Watts told reporters in a teleconference. ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 ",1
Senate prepares Puerto Rico debt debate amid Democrats' concerns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday that amendments were necessary to a Puerto Rico debt bill that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said would be voted on by next week. Reid, speaking to reporters, said changes were needed to the federal board overseeing the restructuring of Puerto Ricos $70 billion debt under the bill, but he did not say whether Democrats would be successful in making any changes. The House of Representatives passed a Puerto Rico debt relief bill on June 9, following months of internal debate. Supporters hope the Senate passes that bill, without any amendment, before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment. The Caribbean island, which is a U.S. territory, is suffering a poverty rate of about 45 percent and has been hobbled by worsening debt problems. Some schools and medical facilities are closing and thousands of residents are relocating to the U.S. mainland, further shrinking Puerto Ricos tax base. While Reid said he had some serious concerns with the current bill, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and lawmakers in the House, he did not say whether he expected any amendments to succeed in the Senate. A Senate debate over amendments could simply help put Democrats on record registering their concerns with the legislation. At the very minimum, we need some amendments to make sure that people understand what is not in that bill, Reid said. Democrats in both chambers have voiced concerns over some potential minimum-wage reductions for young workers that Republicans included in the House bill. They also have said the federal oversight board, to be appointed by Washington, might not have Puerto Ricos best interests in mind. Supporters of the bill have argued it is the best measure that can pass the Republican-controlled Congress and that  Puerto Rico could slip into chaos without action.

"Trump shrugs off campaign funding lag, cites personal wealth","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump said on Tuesday his unlimited trove of personal wealth would help compensate for his poor presidential campaign fundraising, even as he took steps to court new donors to help win the White House. The New York real estate mogul raised only $3.1 million in individual contributions in May and ended the month with $1.3 million in cash, leaving him far behind his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton who brought in $26 million and closed the months books with a $42 million war chest. The figures underscore the huge cash advantage Clinton is hoping to enjoy leading into the Nov. 8 presidential election, one that could allow her a large staff and millions of dollars of television and digital ads in battleground states. Trump, who openly shunned donations while winning the party nomination, rebuffed criticism from Republicans who say he needs to raise cash for the general election fight against Clinton. His campaign might need in excess of $1 billion by some estimates but Trump said money was not a problem.      If need be, there could be unlimited cash on hand as I would put up my own money, Trump said in a statement, which asserted he had already spent over $50 million dollars on his bid for the White House.  The billionaire candidate added that his campaign also costs less than a traditional one because it is is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be. Trump has said he is worth more than $10 billion, but much of his money is tied up in properties and businesses. Estimates from outside groups have put Trumps wealth as low as $1 billion. Forbes magazine estimates it at $4.5 billion. According to Trumps most recent personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, in May, he had between $65 mln and $175 million in liquid assets  money in funds, equities and cash. Despite Trumps professed lack of concern for standard campaign fundraising, he took steps to boost donations. Several sources with knowledge of Trumps fundraising activities said he will attend a dinner on Tuesday evening to court hedge fund managers and other Wall Street donors.  Woody Johnson, the billionaire investor and owner of the New York Jets football team, is also hosting a breakfast for Trump at a high-end restaurant in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. Targeting smaller donors, Trump on Tuesday also sent his first email asking for donations, telling supporters that he will match their contributions up to $2 million. Trumps allies, donors, and other Republican operatives have expressed concerns about his campaign operation, which has been dogged by internal battles, a threadbare campaign infrastructure, and thin fundraising apparatus. Without money you dont have a campaign, said Stan Hubbard, a Republican donor from Minnesota who owns a chain of radio stations and who has contributed to Trump.  Hes got to call on people to give money and stop all this nonsense about funding his own campaign, Hubbard said.  Trump this week fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who had been overseeing the campaigns fundraising arm. Trump has spent much of the race so far breaking the mold of a traditional campaign, defeating a crowded field of primary opponents who vastly outspent him in ads and staff.     During the Republican primary race, he often told his supporters not to contribute money and ridiculed opponents for accepting cash from special interest groups and wealthy contributors.     He has so far showed little interest in calling donors to ask for money for his general election battle. He only began holding in-person fundraisers in late May. Trump defeated the most talented GOP field in a generation with less staff, less experience and less money in much less time, said Republican strategist Keith Appell.  That said, Trumps campaign needs to transition quickly to a national, general election effort online, on the air and on the ground  his populist, anti-Washington, new leadership message has been muddled by sideshow issues. Trump has loaned his campaign $46 million since launching last year, federal filings show. He often uses his own plane to travel to campaign events, and also uses his hotels and other properties as venues - expenses he is required by law to reimburse from his campaign funds. The campaign has spent about $6.2 million with Trump businesses including TAG Air and his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. It has also reimbursed Trump about $390,000 for some payroll and other expenses.  The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, announced it raised $11 million in May, and had $19.9 million in cash at the beginning of June. The RNC will help Trumps effort to get elected, but also helps fund congressional races.   ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 ",1

Multiple U.S. officials have said they do not expect the memo, conveyed through the State Departments relatively rarely used dissent channel, a conduit for voicing contrary views, to change U.S. President Barack Obamas policy. In the cable, the diplomats call for military strikes against President Bashar al-Assads government to stop its persistent violations of a civil war ceasefire Obamas policy toward Syria, where a civil war has burned for more than five years, has been predicated on the goal of avoiding deeper military entanglements in the Middle East, and has been widely criticized as hesitant and risk-averse. Obamas limited intervention has focused on fighting the Islamic State militant group that controls a swathe of Syria and Iraq and that has inspired attacks on U.S. soil. The memo by the State Department officials demanded a more muscular stance. While State Department spokesman John Kirby said that Kerry had met with about 10 of the officials for half an hour on Tuesday, he declined to provide details of their discussion about the cable, which the department has not made public. We believe that achieving our objectives will continue to elude us if we do not include the use of military force as an option to enforce the Cessation of Hostilities (CoH) and compel the Syrian regime to abide by its terms as well as to negotiate a political solution in good faith, said a draft of the memo posted online by The New York Times.

Federal judges question intent behind North Carolina voting law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal appeals court judges on Tuesday probed the intent behind a sweeping 2013 North Carolina law that changed the states election rules. A lawyer for the state, Thomas Farr, defended the law and denied claims by attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department and civil rights groups that the law intentionally suppressed minority voters, speaking before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. The court already temporarily stayed the laws provisions that eliminate voters ability to register the same day they vote and to vote outside their assigned precincts, methods that critics say are disproportionately used by minority voters. If the appeals court follows a lower courts April ruling and upholds the law, those options may not be available for North Carolina voters in the upcoming election in November, widely viewed as one of the most critical presidential and general elections in recent U.S. history. Judge Henry Floyd asked Farr about the fact that the legislature considered an expanded version of the law soon after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County v. Holder that Congress could no longer subject states with a record of race-based voter discrimination to special elections oversight. North Carolinas Republican-controlled legislature got the opportunity to change some pretty liberal voter registration provisions with that decision, Floyd said.  And it happened the same day Shelby was decided. Looks pretty bad to me, in terms of purposeful discrimination, he added. Judge James Wynn asked Farr what type of voter behavior information the state legislature considered when passing the law: At the time that it enacted this, did it have ... information that the use of these particular procedures was disproportionately higher in the minority community than they were in the non-minority community?  Farr replied that the state board of elections launched a campaign to educate voters about the new requirements. When these rules were used in 2014 election, African-American turnout increased at a higher rate than whites, Farr told Reuters by email after the hearing. Attorneys for the civil rights groups opposing the law appeared jubilant afterwards, greeting supporters outside the courthouse and at a local church in Richmond, where NAACP members sang, spoke and answered questions from reporters. The judges asked really probing questions to understand the crux of the matter, said Allison Riggs, a lawyer for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. The court below just got the law wrong.

Clinton says Trump presidency would be 'disastrous' for U.S. economy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that if Republican rival Donald Trump wins the White House, it will be a disaster for the U.S. economy, predicting a Trump recession. Now I dont say this because of typical political disagreements - liberals and conservatives say Trumps ideas would be disastrous, Clinton said. Economists on the right, the left and the center all agree Trump would throw us back into recession. Clintons speech in Columbus, Ohio, a state that will be a battleground in the Nov. 8 election, was the second in which she has argued the wealthy businessman is temperamentally unfit to lead the country. The first was on foreign relations and national security. Donald Trump has said he is qualified to be president because of his business record, Clinton said. So lets take a look at what he did for his businesses: Hes written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11; go figure, Clinton said, in a jab referring to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Clinton then said Trump, a self-described king of debt, had allowed businesses to amass huge debts and declare bankruptcy, leaving hundreds of people without jobs and wiping out shareholders. Allowing the United States to accrue similar debt would rattle investors and could lead to economic catastrophe, she added. On Twitter during Clintons speech, Trump said, I am the king of debt. That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S. Clinton also said the likely Republican nominees tax plan - which aims to simplify the tax code, along with slashing the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent - would benefit the wealthy over working families. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated the plan would increase the federal deficit by $9.5 trillion over the next decade. The former secretary of state also said Trumps plan to scrap trade deals could start trade wars and that the agreements should instead be renegotiated if they do not benefit American workers.  Clinton said Trumps plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deport undocumented immigrants would shake the workforce and prove disastrous for the U.S. economy, creating a Trump recession. The tussle over the economy came as the two continued preparing for what is expected to be a fierce campaign. Trump was slated to give a speech criticizing Clinton in New York on Wednesday. As the presumptive Democratic nominee spoke on Tuesday, Trumps campaign tested what appeared to be a more active rapid-response operation, sending emails saying Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, had backed bad trade deals and that her immigration plan would lower wages.

U.S. legal group lavishes praise on Obama Supreme Court nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The American Bar Association issued a glowing evaluation of President Barack Obamas U.S. Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday, giving Merrick Garland its highest rating even as Senate Republicans stood firm in their blockade of his appointment. The influential lawyers association, which has evaluated the qualifications of nominees to the federal judiciary since 1953, deemed Garland well qualified, the highest of its three ratings, for a lifetime job on Americas highest court. The unanimous consensus of everyone we interviewed was  that Judge Garland is superbly competent to serve on the United  States Supreme Court, the ABA panel that conducted the evaluation said in a report. Obama nominated Garland, 63, on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Garland is a centrist jurist with two decades as a federal appeals court judge. A nominees ABA rating typically is considered when the Senate acts on a judicial appointment. Republicans were unswayed. In an emailed statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells office pointed out that Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, when they were senators, tried to block the 2006 Supreme Court confirmation of conservative Samuel Alito, even though he also earned the ABAs highest rating.  Supreme Court nominations require Senate confirmation, and the Republicans who control the chamber have denied Garland customary hearings and a confirmation vote. Senate Republican leaders have vowed not to act on any Supreme Court nominee put forward by Obama, arguing that the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office on Jan. 20, should fill Scalias vacancy. Obama has accused Senate Republicans of abdicating their constitutional duties. The court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals, meaning Scalias successor could influence its ideological direction for years to come. The White House renewed its demand that the Senate act on Garland. Spokesman Josh Earnest said it is such a shame he has been treated so unfairly by the United States Senate in an unprecedented partisan action. The Republicans are hoping their presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, wins the presidency and nominates a conservative to the court. This significant point warrants repeating, the ABA panel wrote. All of the experienced, dedicated and knowledgeable sitting judges, several former solicitor generals from both political parties, legal scholars from top law schools across the country,  and lawyers who have worked with or against the nominee in private practice, government or within the judiciary describe  the nominee as outstanding in all respects and cite specific evidence in support of that view.

Republican Donald Trump says he has 'unlimited' access to campaign money,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he is willing to tap into his personal funds to cover any fundraising deficit he faces against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, after finishing May more than $40 million behind her in cash.  If need be, there could be unlimited cash on hand as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million, Trump said in a statement. Our campaign is leaner and more efficient, like our government should be. ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 ",1
U.S. military says will not disclose details on injured service members,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military will not provide details on specific cases of American service members injured in Iraq and Syria because it could give information to Islamic State militants, a Pentagon spokesman said on Tuesday The spokesman, Peter Cook, was responding to a question at a Pentagon press briefing seeking confirmation that four Americans had been wounded in Syria earlier this month.  Cook said there had been no a change in policy and aggregate numbers would still be provided. Our policy is not to identify wounded service members for a variety of reasons, including operational security, including privacy reasons, Cook said.  Also, we do not want to provide additional information to the enemy that might enhance their own assessment on the battlefield situation, he said. However, the Pentagon has released such information in the past and responded to queries, and it was unclear how Cooks comments were consistent with previous disclosures. Last month a spokesman said two U.S. service member had been injured, one each in Iraq and Syria, during the last weekend in May. Captain Jeff Davis said the incident in Iraq took place in the north, near Erbil, while the injury in Syria was north of Raqqa, Islamic States de facto capital. According to Pentagon data, there have been 16 American service members wounded in action since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, the militarys name for an operation targeting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria which started in 2014.  Cooks comments came the same day that President Barack Obama visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; he has visited wounded U.S. service members there throughout his presidency.

New Jersey governor proposes flat rate for education funding,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Tuesday proposed overhauling the states education funding formula to provide all public school districts with a flat rate of $6,599 per student. Calling it his Fairness Formula in policy statements on Tuesday, Christie said aid for special needs students would continue even with any potential formula change. Schools are funded through property taxes, which in New Jersey are some of the highest in the nation because of the states unaffordable and broken school funding formula propped up by special interests and misguided Supreme Court precedent, Christie said in a statement. He said he would traverse the state this summer to talk about the proposal. The amount of state aid school districts receive now varies widely, with some getting less than $3,000 per pupil and others getting as much as $28,000 Such a change would be an uphill battle, as it would need approval from a Democrat-led legislature that has already rejected previous education formula changes from Christie, a Republican. Governor Christies idea is unconstitutional and harmful to our most vulnerable children, Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that Christie still hasnt fully funded schools under the existing formula. Currently, poorer districts receive more state aid under a formula based on a 1990 New Jersey Supreme Court decision called     Abbott v. Burke II, which ruled the states education funding was unfair and that low-income Abbott districts must be funded on par with wealthier ones.   ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 ",1
"Briton arrested at Trump rally 'wouldn't hurt a fly,' father says","DORKING, England (Reuters) - A man charged with trying to attack Donald Trump with a policemans gun found it hard to cope with life but did not have political views and was never violent, his father told British media on Tuesday.    Michael Sandford was arrested after trying to grab a police officers side arm at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Saturday. When asked why, he told police: To shoot and kill Trump, according to U.S. court papers.  Hes never shown any violent tendencies before. Hes never been a bad person, his father, Paul Davey, was quoted as saying by the MailOnline website which put Sandfords age as 20. U.S. prosecutors have said he is 19.   Hes a nice kid and literally wouldnt hurt a fly - he used to tell us not to use fly spray because he didnt want any flies to die. The Mirror newspapers website quoted Davey as saying his son had Aspergers Syndrome and had left school at the age of 15 because he couldnt cope with it all.  He went to the United States 18 months ago after an American girl he had met returned home, something that had made him quite down and depressed, Davey said. Hes been refusing to come back and we were worried about him, we were in contact with the American Embassy ... (but) the American authorities said hes over 18 we cant do anything. Davey said someone must have coerced or radicalised his son into attacking the presidential candidate. He has never mentioned Donald Trump. The reason it is such a shock is because he shows no interest in anything like that ... I doubt he would even know who the president of the United States is. Sandford lived on his own in Dorking, a commuter town near London, in a flat in a large white house. A local who knew Sandfords mother, who did not want to be named, told Reuters Sandford had autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  He was one of those guys who just stays in his room thats it, wouldnt come out, the man said.  The U.S. court documents said Sandford had been planning to kill Trump for about a year. He had visited a gun range the day before the rally to fire a weapon for the first time.  Last week, a British member of parliament was shot and stabbed to death in the street - an incident that has shocked a country that has strict gun controls and where attacks on public figures are rare. Media reported that Sandford and his mother had taken part in a Robot Wars competition where contestants operate robots trying to destroy their opponents machine. A web page for the Fighting Robots Association listed Michael and Lynne Sandford and Paul Davey as owners of a number of robots, including machines named Mr Nasty, X-Terminator and Steel Avenger.  He was quite active in the robot community for a while - buying famous robots from the show ... I then got them working for him because he had absolutely no idea about robots, John Findlay, director of the company behind Robot Wars, told the Mirror newspaper.   He was calm, very quiet, a little bit weird and reserved. ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 ",1
Obama pick to lead U.S. military in Africa favors powers to strike Islamic State,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas nominee to lead the U.S. military in Africa on Tuesday backed the idea of gaining greater power to strike Islamic State, including in Libya, which he described as the groups Plan B as it loses territory in Iraq and Syria. Marine Lieutenant General Thomas Waldhauser told his Senate confirmation hearing that the U.S. military was making preparations for possible military strikes in Libya against the militants. But Waldhauser noted limitations on the current commanders ability to order strikes against the group in Libya, which require adhering to White House guidance. That differs from the rules of engagement in Iraq or Syria. Asked by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham whether it would be wise for Obama to give the commander of the Africa Command the authority to go after Islamic State targets in Africa on your own, Waldhauser said: It would be wise. It would certainly contribute to what were trying to do inside Libya, he responded. Islamic State established a presence in several parts of the country from 2014, and has been active between Benghazi and the militant groups coastal stronghold of Sirte, about 380 km (240 miles) to the west. In recent weeks, however, the ultra-hardline group has retreated into the center of Sirte after forces aligned with Libyas U.N.-backed unity government advanced from the western city of Misrata. One reason Islamic State established itself in Sirte, Waldhauser told the Senate Armed Services Committee, was to be kind of a backup if Iraq and Syria fail, he said.  Waldhauser estimated that Islamic State faced between 3,000 and 4,000 opponents fighting the group around Sirte, drawn from the Mirsratan militia forces and the Petroleum Facilities Guard Central Branch.  But he cautioned that alliances can shift among the Libyan militia, driven by everything from tribal ties and religious beliefs to material gain. The unpredictable nature of paramilitary group patronage will most likely remain a significant obstacle to the GNAs efforts to establish sovereignty, he said in written testimony. For months, the United States has had a small number of U.S. forces rotating in and out of Libya, establishing contact with fighters inside the country.  Waldhauser said they were acting in an advisory role to support the unity government, and said no more U.S. troops were needed in the country at this time. ",politicsNews,"June 21, 2016 ",1

"Trump doubles monthly campaign fundraising, lags Clinton","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trumps campaign raised $3.1 million from donors in May, more than doubling previous monthly hauls as he began soliciting donations to battle Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. But with spending that outpaced inflows, the New York real estate magnates campaign began June with just $1.29 million in cash, putting it well-behind Clintons $42 million war chest, according to federal disclosures filed late on Monday.  Clintons campaign raised $26 million in May.  The figures underscore the huge money advantage Clinton is hoping to enjoy leading into the Nov. 8 election, one that could allow her a large staff and millions of dollars of television and digital ads in battleground states. Trump, who has self-funded most of his campaign and only held his first general election fundraiser on May 25, is betting he can run a race that builds on his low-spending, insurgent primary operation. Trumps surrogates, however, have said the cash is now pouring in for the general election. For months the biggest cash injections into Trumps campaign coffers were from his personal bank accounts. He has loaned his campaign $46 million since launching last year. Trump may still have several hurdles to cross before convincing deep-pocketed donors to write the kind of checks that would make him competitive with Clintons campaign bank account. Trump donors, allies and other Republican operatives continue to express concerns about his campaign operation, which has been dogged by internal battles, a threadbare campaign infrastructure of about 30 paid staffers, and a barely existent fundraising apparatus. On Monday, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who had been tasked with overseeing the campaigns fundraising arm.  The primary Super PAC supporting Trump, Great America PAC, reported raising $1.4 million in May - accounting for most of the $2.5 million the group has raised this year. The PAC had $500,971 cash remaining at the beginning of June. Clintons cash advantage has been fueled in part by the Super PAC supporting her. Priorities USA raised $12 million in the last month, ending May with a $52 million in cash. Three unions, AFT Solidarity, Liuna Building America and International Union of Operating Engineers, each gave $1 million. The group has largely been tasked with attacking Trump. And so far, they have spent more than $5.7 million this year on television ads alone attacking the Republican.

Senate rejects gun-control measures after Orlando shooting,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Monday rejected four measures restricting gun sales after last weeks massacre in an Orlando nightclub, dealing a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through Congress despite repeated mass shootings. A group of senators was still hoping to forge a compromise for later in the week aimed at keeping firearms away from people on terrorism watch lists, although that effort faced an uphill battle with critics in both parties skeptical about its chances. Last weeks massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, had intensified pressure on lawmakers, who moved swiftly to take the issue to the Senate floor. But the gun-control measures lost in largely party-line votes that showed the lingering political power in Congress of gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association. Republicans and their allies in the NRA gun lobby said the Democratic bills were too restrictive and trampled on the constitutional right to bear arms. Democrats attacked the Republicans two proposals as too weak and accused them of being in the thrall of the NRA. What am I going to tell the community of Orlando? asked Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida after the votes. Sadly, what Im going to tell them is the NRA won again. Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, attacked the Democrats amendments and thanked Republicans for rejecting them. Today, the American people witnessed an embarrassing display in the United States, he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Democratic measures were ineffective and Republican senators are pursuing real solutions that can help keep Americans safer from the threat of terrorism. As the parties remain largely locked in their positions,  polls show Americans are increasingly in favor of more restrictions on guns in a country with more than 310 million weapons, about one for every citizen.  The issue is already a prominent one for voters in November elections. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton supports new gun restrictions, while Republican Donald Trump expressed a willingness to talk to the NRA about the issue. After the votes, Clinton issued a one-word statement: Enough. It was followed by the names and ages of the dead in Orlando. Gun control efforts failed after mass shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and a conference center in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. But some senators see resistance to gun restrictions softening as national security looms larger in the debate. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the militant group Islamic State as he killed 49 people in a gay nightclub.  This country is under attack ... its not a plane or an explosive device, its an assault weapon, said Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat who led a 15-hour filibuster last week to draw attention to the effort to restrict guns. Murphy walked off the floor after the Senate votes and embraced Erica Smegielski, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, a Sandy Hook principal killed during the Newtown shooting. He said, the good thing about me and you is were young, well be at this a long time, said Smegielski, 30. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week found that 71 percent of Americans favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on gun sales. That compared with 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014. Senior Senate aides left open the possibility of other votes later in the week on unspecified gun control proposals. Some Republicans pinned hopes on a proposal by Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, which was not one of the four bills being considered on Monday. Collins plan would restrict gun purchases to a narrow group of suspects, including those on a no-fly list or a selectee list of people who require additional screening at airports.. But Democratic aides said people credibly suspected of involvement in terrorism would not be covered by the weapons ban under Collins bill, and a Republican aide indicated it would not do enough to protect the constitutional rights of gun buyers. Even if the Senate approved a gun compromise, it would also have to be passed by the more conservative, Republican-majority House of Representatives. House Republican leadership aides did not comment on the possibility that any bills proposing gun restrictions would be considered on the House floor this week. On Monday, all four of the measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists - two put forth by Democrats and two by Republicans - fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-member chamber. Gun-control advocates expressed disappointment after the vote and vowed to take revenge on lawmakers at the ballot box in November. Shame on every single senator who voted against these life-saving amendments and protected the rights of terrorists and other dangerous people to buy guns, said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The Brady Campaign will expose these politicians for who they really are and call out their failure to disarm hate in America. ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 ",1
Trump fires campaign manager in shakeup for election push,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump fired Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager who helped him win Republican presidential nominating contests but clashed with other advisers on how to appeal to the broader general electorate, several people with knowledge of the decision said on Monday. The firing on Monday morning was another shakeup for a campaign already at odds with many senior Republican figures over the presumptive nominees policies, with the partys nominating convention in Cleveland less than a month away.  But it may also prove a step toward calming concerns among party leaders about Trump, a wealthy businessman and political outsider, and the conflicting advice he was getting from senior aides, as he battles presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Trump said Lewandowski did a great job but its time now for a different kind of a campaign. We ran a small, beautiful, well-unified campaign. It worked very well in the primaries. I think Im probably going to do some of that, Trump said in an interview with Fox News, in which he did not say if Lewandowski had been fired. Three people close to the campaign said some of Trumps staff viewed Lewandowski as opposing strategic changes and staff hires urged for the general election campaign by Paul Manafort, a strategist hired in April partly for his experience on presidential campaigns that Lewandowski lacked. The three, a campaign staffer and two people in regular contact with Trump advisers, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by Trump to discuss the firing. Manafort will take over as campaign manager, said Carl Paladino, co-chairman of the campaigns operations in New York state. Pauls in charge, Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committees communications director, said in an interview. Trumps decision to fire his manager came in part at the urging of his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who have powerful advisory roles in the campaign, the two people in contact with Trump aides said.  Hope Hicks, who single-handedly fields Trumps media inquiries, disputed reports she had complained about Lewandowski to Ivanka Trump. That is entirely untrue, she said. Lewandowski, 42, had been a near-constant presence at Trumps side since the New York developer launched his campaign on June 2015.  In a brief statement read on CNN, Lewandowski said: I stand by the fact that Mr. Trump is a great candidate and is better than Hillary Clinton ever will be.  Lewandowski denied there were any tensions between him and Trumps family in an interview with CNN. Later on Monday, a campaign adviser resigned after reveling in Lewandowskis exit on his Twitter account, CNN reported. Ding dong the witch is dead! Michael Caputo, the adviser, wrote shortly after reports of the firing emerged. He later released a statement to CNN saying he had resigned. In hindsight, that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move, his statement said. The RNC spokesman did not think there would be a change in Trumps tone. Its going to be more of a streamlined effort and more of an understanding of the difference that a general election has, Spicer said. Clintons campaign has hundreds more staff than that of Trump. In contrast to her unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid, there has been no public sign this time of any significant infighting among her advisers. The former U.S. secretary of state has also spent millions of dollars on television commercials in recent weeks. Trump has not aired any paid advertisements since becoming the presumptive nominee, preferring to spread his message through his Twitter account and in media interviews. Trump has faced setbacks in the past two weeks. His renewed calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States have drawn heavy criticism from Republican politicians in Washington and prompted corporate sponsors like Apple and JPMorgan Chase to withhold funding from the partys July 18-21 convention. Recent opinion polls show at least half of all voters approve of the Muslim ban. Lewandowski, a former New Hampshire field director for a conservative advocacy group, argued that Trumps unconventional campaigning style did not need to be changed after it proved successful in the last few months of primary contests. Lewandowski repeatedly defended that strategy with a line that became his mantra: Let Trump be Trump.  Known for his brusque manner, Lewandowski was accused of manhandling a female reporter in Florida during the primary campaign, but the battery charge against him was later dropped. He is still scheduled to attend the Cleveland convention as chairman of New Hampshires delegation. The Democratic National Committee said Lewandowskis exit was unlikely to change Trump. It wasnt Corey Lewandowski who called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, Mark Paustenbach, a party spokesman, said in a statement, it was Donald Trump. ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 ",1
Man arrested at Trump rally said he wanted to shoot candidate: court papers,"(Reuters) - A man arrested over the weekend trying to wrestle a gun from a police officer at a Las Vegas rally held by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told an investigator he wanted to kill the candidate, court papers showed on Monday. Michael Steven Sandford, who prosecutors described as a 19-year-old British national, was arrested on Saturday at the Treasure Island hotel in Las Vegas after trying to disarm the officer, according to Las Vegas police. According to court papers filed on Monday in federal court in Nevada, Sandford told a Secret Service agent he had driven to Las Vegas from California with the goal of shooting Trump. Sandford claimed he had been attempting to kill Trump for about a year but decided to act on this occasion because he finally felt confident about trying it, the court papers said. He was charged with committing an act of violence on restricted ground, Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys Office, said in an email. Sandford has not entered a plea and is scheduled to be in court for a preliminary hearing on July 5, Collins said. Sandfords federal public defender, Heather Fraley, could not be immediately reached for comment. Sandford said he had been in the United States for a year and a half, the documents showed. The records said he had lived in Hoboken, New Jersey, after coming to the country. Court records said Sandford went to the Battlefield Vegas gun range last Friday to practice shooting, adding that he had never fired a gun before. While there, he fired 20 rounds from a Glock 9 mm handgun, the records said. Sandford told investigators that if he were on the street tomorrow, he would try again, the documents said.

'Economikes': the gatekeepers of Clinton’s economic policy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has no shortage of economic advisors. Scores of world-class experts pour ideas into her campaign on the policies she should champion in her bid for the White House. But before much of the input reaches the Democratic candidate, it is filtered through a pair of staffers known inside the campaign as the Economikes. Working out of Clintons campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, Michael Shapiro and Michael Schmidt are helping shape what could be a lasting economic agenda if the former secretary of state overcomes Republican rival Donald Trump in Novembers election. In an interview with Reuters, Shapiro and Schmidt described Clintons process for forming policy by broadly soliciting ideas and crafting them into the action points that she takes to voters.  Before Clinton takes a position, Shapiro said, she wants to know we have talked to and gotten input from everyone, making sure that were consulting with labor, making sure that were consulting with experts. Clintons inclusive approach to developing policy positions has been faulted for being slow and unwieldy. Much of the work of sifting through the wealth of sometimes disparate ideas and data it yields falls to the Economikes. Both are recent graduates of Yale Law School. Prior to joining the campaign, Schmidt, 30, worked at the U.S. Treasury Department and the Yale Investments Office, helping manage the universitys endowment. Shapiro, 29, worked at the White House for the National Economic Council. Earlier this year, he married the daughter of New York Senator Chuck Schumer. The pair helps Clinton draw upon a deep bench of advisers, including economist Alan Krueger, Duke professor Aaron Chatterji and Simon Johnson, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, along with scores of other academics and business people.  Some communicate regularly through emails, conference calls, meetings and memos. Others are tapped once or twice for specific expertise. Frequent contributor Alan Blinder, the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he will usually email the Mikes with ideas. The fruit of the process will be on display today in Ohio, where Clinton is expected to give a speech contrasting her economic vision with that of Trump, a businessman who often names himself as his main adviser and is known for his off-the-cuff style. Clinton has called raising middle class incomes the defining economic challenge of the time. So far, she has presented a mix of goals, including making child care more affordable and boosting jobs. Some business leaders have said her approach is reassuring, but progressives have criticized her policies as too moderate. Trump, in contrast, often has taken business leaders by surprise with his policy proposals. He has promised to renegotiate international trade deals to pump up U.S. manufacturing, vowed to penalize companies that move their headquarters abroad to avoid taxes, and pledged to dismantle Obamas financial regulation reforms. While the Economikes nickname began as a joke, Shapiro said the campaigns digital team made it stick by using it in a Q&A posted on Clintons web site. Their bosses, senior policy advisers Jake Sullivan and Maya Harris, have been known to stick their heads out of their offices and ask for one of the Mikes. On email chains, CC: notes will sometimes include plus the Economikes. Humor aside, their work often is serious business. After the tainted water crisis hit national headlines in January, Clinton dispatched Schmidt and her political director, Amanda Renteria, to Flint, Michigan to investigate.  Schmidt said the effort informed Clintons approach to the water crisis during the Democratic debate in Flint, including her call for the governor to resign. In other cases, they said, Clinton will ask the pair to research issues shes heard on the campaign trail, such as the case of an Iowa bowling alley owner who told the candidate student debt made it hard for him to get business loans. The campaign since has rolled out proposals to allow for refinancing of student debt and the use of income-based repayment programs to cut monthly payments. Shapiro and Schmidt said the policy points they bring back to Clinton typically lead her to ask more questions, a process that can go on for several rounds before the candidate finally settles on a policy proposal.

"Invoking Orlando, Senate Republicans set up vote to expand FBI spying","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set up a vote late on Monday to expand the Federal Bureau of Investigations authority to use a secretive surveillance order without a warrant to include email metadata and some browsing history information. The move, made via an amendment to a criminal justice appropriations bill, is an effort by Senate Republicans to respond to last weeks mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub after a series of measures to restrict guns offered by both parties failed on Monday. In the wake of the tragic massacre in Orlando, it is important our law enforcement have the tools they need to conduct counterterrorism investigations, Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and sponsor of the amendment, said in a statement.  The bill is also supported by Republican Senators John Cornyn, Jeff Sessions and Richard Burr, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. Privacy advocates denounced the effort, saying it seeks to exploit a mass shooting in order to expand the governments digital spying powers. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, criticized a similar effort last month as one that takes a hatchet to important protections for Americans liberty. The amendment would broaden the FBIs authority to use so-called National Security Letters to include electronic communications transaction records such as time stamps of emails and the emails senders and recipients. The Obama administration for years has lobbied for a change to how NSLs can be used, after a 2008 legal memo from the Justice Department said the law limits them largely to phone billing records. FBI Director James Comey has said the change essentially corrects a typo and is a top legislative priority for his agency. NSLs do not require a warrant and are almost always accompanied by a gag order preventing the service provider from sharing the request with a targeted user. The letters have existed since the 1970s, though the scope and frequency of their use expanded greatly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The amendment filed Monday would also make permanent a provision of the USA Patriot Act that allows the intelligence community to conduct surveillance on lone wolf suspects who do not have confirmed ties to a foreign terrorist group. That provision, which the Justice Department said last year had never been used, is currently set to expire in December 2019. A vote is expected no later than Wednesday, McConnells office said.

"American Muslims see Trump rhetoric fueling prejudice, hate incidents","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About three months ago, Sarah Ibrahims son came home from his fourth-grade class at a Maryland school with a disturbing question. Will I have time to say goodbye to you before youre deported? he said, according to Ibrahim, a Muslim Arab American who works at a federal government agency in Maryland. The kids in his classroom were saying: Whos going to leave when Trump becomes president? said the 35-year-old mother. The incident happened a few months after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump  now the presumptive nominee  first called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and for more scrutiny at mosques after 14 people were killed in San Bernardino by a Muslim couple whom the FBI said had been radicalized. Trump intensified his anti-Muslim rhetoric after last weeks mass shooting in Orlando, in which a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub, calling for a suspension of immigration from countries with a proven history of terrorism. He reiterated his call for more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were trying to take over our children.  While Democratic and several Republican leaders have distanced themselves from Trumps comments, many American Muslims say his stance has fueled an atmosphere in which some may feel they can voice prejudices or attack Muslims without fear of retribution. What Trump did was make these hidden thoughts public. He gave people permission to speak out loud, he removed the shame associated with being prejudiced. People know that they wont be punished, Ibrahim told Reuters at a community iftar, the sundown meal during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Trumps campaign did not respond to Reuters request for comment. Trump has rejected the criticism that his rhetoric is racist, and has said he is often misunderstood by the media and his opponents. A report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations and University of California, Berkeley released on Monday said the number of recorded incidents in which mosques were targeted jumped to 78 in 2015, the most since the body began tracking them in 2009. There were 20 and 22 such incidents in the previous two years, respectively. The incidents include verbal threats and physical attacks. Corey Saylor, CAIRs director of the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia, said there had been a spike in Islamophobic incidents in the wake of Orlando, including those  targeting mosques. Trumps rhetoric is a direct threat to American principles. He has mainstreamed anti-Constitutional ideas like banning or surveilling people based on faith, Saylor told Reuters. Such divisive rhetoric contributes to a toxic environment in which some people take the law into their own hands and attack people of institutions they perceive as Muslim. CAIR says the last big spike in incidents targeting mosques was seen in 2010 following the controversy over locating an Islamic center near the site of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York. It said that lent additional weight to the argument that levels of anti-Muslim sentiment follow trends in domestic U.S. politics, not international terrorism. American rabbis and preachers have also denounced Trumps rhetoric. Anti-Semitic incidents in the United States still outstrip those against Muslims. The Anti-Defamation League said last year there were 912 anti-Semitic incidents across the United States during the 2014 calendar year, up 21 percent from 2013. If Muslims are not free and safe in America, then Christians and Jews are not free and safe in America, said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism. Trump has also drawn criticism for his rhetoric against Latino immigrants, saying early in his campaign that Mexican rapists and other criminals were coming across the border and calling for all undocumented immigrants to be deported. Manal Omar, a Muslim-American author based in Washington, said she has stopped taking the metro and walking alone late at night. I cant dismiss the tweets and angry messages Ive received from right wing militants, said Omar, who says she has grown especially vigilant after last weeks murder of British lawmaker Jo Cox, whom she knew. A few days after the San Bernardino attack, Ilhaam Hassans family restaurant was burned down in an arson attack in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  Matthew Gust pleaded guilty in May to federal hate-crime and arson charges. He admitted to setting the fire because of the national origin of the employees and customers at the restaurant  a focal point of the local Somali-American community. I dont know what to expect if he (Trump) becomes the president, Hassan said. He is against minorities. He is against Islam. Its not a message of unity, its a message of dividing the country and that is not what America is based on. ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 ",1
"In separate speeches Obama, Biden, Carter target Trump policies","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, his vice president and defense secretary took aim on Monday at policies of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump they said would alienate Muslims globally along with U.S. allies and neighbors. In a speech focusing on national security at a think tank in Washington, Vice President Joe Biden said Trumps calls to bar the entry of Muslims and to profile Muslim Americans reflected the politics of fear and intolerance. There are 1.4 billion Muslims in the world Biden said. Some of the rhetoric Im hearing sounds designed to radicalize all 1.4 billion.    Bidens attacks on Trump as an isolationist, and others by Obama and Defense Secretary Ash Carter represent an unusually early and vigorous assault on an opposing partys presidential nominee. The election is on Nov. 8. Referring to Trumps vow to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico if elected, Biden said that the most complex threats do not respect borders and a wall would destroy much of the progress the Obama administration had made with U.S. neighbors. If we build walls and disrespect our neighbors, we will quickly see all this progress evaporating, replaced by a return of anti-Americanism, a corrosive rift throughout our hemisphere, Biden said. Obama, who last week assailed Trump for what he called a dangerous mindset and loose talk and sloppiness in defining the countrys enemies, on Monday criticized  Trumps anti-trade policies in a speech at a U.S. Commerce Department conference. This is not just about jobs and trade, its not just about hard, cold cash.Its also about building relationships across borders, Obama told the 2,400 people from 70 countries at the conference to attract foreign investment. Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports and demanded a change in a U.S. trade policy he says allows other countries to shut out U.S imports, devalue their currencies and unfairly target U.S. industries. Speaking at the same event as Biden, Carter said a critical part of U.S. leadership is its longtime network of allies and partners in every corner of the world. Our allies around the world have stood with us - and fought with us - time and again, most recently in Iraq, Afghanistan, and against ISIL, he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. Carter did not mention Trump, who has called NATO obsolete and said he would consider letting Japan and South Korea develop their own nuclear weapons rather than relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China.While Obama, Carter and other top officials generally have refrained from attacking Trump by name, Obama administration spokesmen have not denied that such remarks are directed at the presumptive Republican candidate.

Obama takes turn as 'America's pitch man' to help sell TPP trade deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama made a plug on Monday for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal to a group of 2,400 investors looking at locating business in the United States, saying the deal would help boost the global economy. Trade has become a hot-button issue in the Nov. 8 presidential election campaign, with presumptive candidates from both parties voicing objections to the 12-nation TPP deal that Obama wants the U.S. Congress to sign off on before his time in office ends on Jan. 20. Both the Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns have tapped into populist skepticism about the benefit of trade deals on jobs and wages, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Obama tried to dispel the economic gloom-and-doom coming from the campaign trail, extolling the recovery of the United States from recession. I dont mind being Americas pitch man, Obama said in a speech at the SelectUSA Summit. In seven months or so, Ill be on the job market, and Im glad Im going to be here. Im going to get on LinkedIn and see what comes up, he quipped. Obama argued that while there are legitimate concerns about boosting wages and improving working conditions, ultimately  global trade can help connect people from around the world and reduce poverty. This is not just about jobs and trade, its not just about hard cold cash, he said. Its also about building relationships across borders. When your companies come together you help bring countries and cultures together.   American business lobby groups have been pushing the White House and congressional leaders to finish their work to ratify the TPP before the next administration takes office. Obamas top economic adviser sidestepped a question on a conference call about the timeline. Were continuing to work with congressional leaders to find the right opportunity, the right window of opportunity, to get TPP passed this year, Jeff Zients, the director of the National Economic Council, told reporters. On Monday, Obama announced a $70 million matching grant to a Los Angeles manufacturing hub, a group of businesses and researchers piloting sensors and other technology to help factories cut costs and energy use. It is the ninth of 15 planned hubs that the White House hopes will boost manufacturing across the country. On Friday, Obama will continue his pitch for business, speaking about technology and the economy on a panel with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg at another summit at Stanford University aimed at boosting entrepreneurs in developing countries.

U.S. Latino voter group to get free ad space on Telemundo boxing program,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A leading U.S. promoter of Latino boxing, All Star Boxing Inc, will give free television advertising space to Hispanic civic group Mi Familia Vota, which openly criticizes Donald Trumps anti-immigration stance, in an effort to encourage Latino Americans to vote in Novembers presidential election. The partnership will put the name and website of the group on signs in boxing ring corners and on T-shirts worn by the athletes on Spanish language network Telemundos Boxeo Telemundo program, starting at the end of June, officials at both organizations told Reuters. The partnership will be announced on Tuesday. Desperate times call for desperate measures, said Ruben De Jesus, the director of operations at Florida-based All Star Boxing, referring to this years presidential election. He said he decided to contact Mi Familia Vota with the offer of free advertising after hearing just the whole rhetoric with regards to the Hispanic community in the current election.  He did not mention any candidate by name.  Our platform is not to tell our Latino citizens who to vote for, but its important that this year especially we engage, he told Reuters in an interview, adding the free advertising space could reach as many as 5 million people. Ben Monterroso, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, was blunter about the partnerships aim. I think Mr. Donald Trump lives in another world, he said. In my experience working with the community, a big majority of the people that I talk to, they definitely dont like what Donald Trump has done. Trump, the Republican who will likely face Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election, launched his candidacy last year by calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration from Mexico, a country he said was sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States.  The wealthy New York businessman has also repeatedly vowed to build a wall along the border and force the Mexican government to pay for it if elected. More recently Trump angered Latinos by criticizing a federal judge overseeing a fraud trial against Trump University, calling the Indiana-born man a Mexican and, later, saying his Mexican heritage meant he couldnt do his job properly. Trump has rejected accusations that his comments are racist and has said he is well-liked by Hispanics. A spokeswoman for Trump was not immediately available to comment. The partnership between All Star Boxing and Mi Familia Vota will begin on June 24 and run for four events this summer, then another four events after a brief hiatus, comprising 128 boxers in total, De Jesus said.  Half the shows will take place in Florida and half in Mexico. The fighters will also hold local events in Florida to boost voter engagement in the critical swing state, De Jesus said. That could include visits to political events around Tampa and Orlando, such as helping to register voters. The boxers are coming out of their corners to fight for the community, Monterroso said. Boxeo Telemundo, with an over 25-year history, calls itself the most-watched Spanish-language boxing show in the United States. The show attracts an average 550,000 viewers weekly, especially among men 18 to 49, De Jesus said. Mi Familia Vota is a non-profit, non-partisan group that works to register Latino voters and get Latinos involved in U.S. political life. ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 ",1
"Biden to rebuke Trump foreign policy ideas, defend Obama strategy","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Joe Biden on Monday will denounce Republican Donald Trumps call for a halt to Muslim immigration as an appeal to intolerance and defend the U.S. fight against Islamic State at a time of dissent within the Obama administration over Syria policy. Biden will deliver a wide-ranging rebuke to Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, in a speech to the Center for New American Security think tank, according to excerpts released by the White House. Biden, who has joined President Barack Obama in endorsing presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, plans to wade deeper into the campaign a week after Trump sparked criticism for his comments on American Muslims after a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In a speech last Monday on national security, Trump stood by his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and proposed a suspension of immigration from countries with a proven history of terrorism.      Biden, in his remarks, will say: Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance - like proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States or slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism - calls into question Americas status as the greatest democracy in the history of the world.   Although not naming Trump, the vice president will say: Alienating 1.5 billion Muslims - the vast, vast majority of whom, at home and abroad, are peace-loving - will only make the problem worse. Biden will also apparently chide Trump for having spoken admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Embracing Putin at a time of renewed Russian aggression could call into question the U.S. commitment to Europes security, he will say. Referring to Trumps vow to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico if elected, Biden will assert: If we build walls and disrespect our closest neighbors, it will reignite anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Bidens defense of Obamas strategy against Islamic State militants appears intended, at least in part, to push back against a recently leaked internal State Department memo critical of the presidents response to Syrias civil war. The document, signed by 51 diplomats and reflecting long-standing frustration among Obamas aides, calls for urgently broadening an approach, now focused on attacking Islamic State, to unleash air strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assads forces. U.S. officials made clear Obama would not be swayed. The use of force should be precise and proportional, Biden will say. There must be a clear mission that advances U.S. interests. Whenever possible, we should act alongside allies and partners. ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 ",1
U.S. justices to mull president's power to nominate officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to review a lower court decision that invalidated part of a former U.S. labor board officials tenure, in a case that could curb the next presidents power to staff top positions in his or her administration. The justices will hear an appeal of a 2015 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit saying that once President Barack Obama nominated Lafe Solomon in 2011 to be general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Solomon should not have continued to fill the position on a temporary or acting basis pending Senate confirmation. The appeals court said a 1998 federal law bars anyone from serving in an acting role while they are the nominee unless they were previously the first assistant to that post. The Supreme Courts ruling in the case could decide if the White House can temporarily fill high-level administration positions with nominees waiting for confirmation, which could take on added importance if the next president faces protracted nomination battles in the Senate. The case will give the Supreme Court a second chance to weigh in on executive branch authority related to filling positions at the NLRB. In 2014, the court in NLRB v. Noel Canning ruled that three 2013 appointments Obama made to the board while Congress was in recess were invalid. Although Obama withdrew Solomons stalled nomination in 2013, about six current high-level officials are serving on an acting basis while they await a Senate vote, including officials at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, the NLRB said in its petition for review. Former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush also tapped officials to permanently fill the posts that they were manning in a temporary capacity, the NLRB said. Clinton, Bush and Obama all relied on an interpretation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act that viewed the restriction on first assistants as only applying to people who automatically become acting officers under a chain of command, rather than those nominated by the president, the NLRB said. But the D.C. Circuit, as well as the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2016 ruling, have disagreed. The case is NLRB v. SW General Inc, No. 15-1251, in the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump seeks to clarify comments on guns at Orlando nightclub,"(Reuters) - Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said he was referring to security staff, but not patrons, in comments that if more people had been armed during a Florida nightclub shooting last week, fewer would have died. When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees, Trump said on Twitter on Monday. Trump had said last week that he wished someone inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12 was carrying a firearm to stop a gunman before he could kill more clubgoers.  If the bullets were going in the other direction aimed at this guy, who was just open target practice, you would have had a situation that was always horrible, but nothing like the carnage that we all as a people suffered this weekend, Trump said on Wednesday at a rally in Atlanta. National Rifle Association President Wayne LaPierre on Sunday appeared critical of the idea of having clubgoers armed. I dont think you should have firearms where people are drinking, LaPierre said on CBSs Face the Nation.  An off-duty Orlando police officer was working security at the club when the shooting occurred, authorities have said. ",politicsNews,"June 20, 2016 ",1
Obama immigration win at Supreme Court could benefit Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If the U.S. Supreme Court in the coming days decides a high-profile immigration case in favor of the Obama administration, the ruling could have an unexpected beneficiary: Republican presidential contender Donald Trump.   The Obama administration is asking the high court to revive its 2014 proposal to protect up to 4 million people from deportation, a plan that was blocked by lower courts. The court could rule that a president has broad authority to interpret and enforce federal immigration law.  Such a ruling would allow Obama to implement his signature executive action on immigration, aimed at the parents of U.S. citizens children, before he leaves office. It could also help Trump, who has put forth his own sweeping and controversial plans on immigration ahead of the Nov. 8 election. To the extent the court has language about the presidents wide authority in immigration law generally, that would certainly strengthen Trumps hand. said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell Law School. The Supreme Courts ruling will come at a key phase in the presidential election cycle, with candidates Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton trading jabs over immigration policy following the mass shooting in a Orlando nightclub in which a gunman killed 49 people.  Trump has proposed curbing immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, blocking the entry of Muslims and deporting the estimated 11 million people in the United States who entered the country illegally.  If he wins the race for the White House, Trump might need to invoke his own executive authority - as happened with Obama - if the U.S. Congress does not approve his proposals, which have sparked outrage at home and abroad. The current case is unlikely to provide any support for Trumps  proposal to bar Muslims, which legal experts say would face other legal hurdles because it targets people on the basis of religion. But legal experts say it could help Trump if he seeks to block entry from certain countries under a provision of immigration law that gives the president the power to suspend entry of noncitizens whose entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  That provision has previously only been used block entry of small groups of people, such as officials linked with foreign governments hostile to the United States. Applying it to entire countries could prompt a similar lawsuit to the one filed against Obama. Clinton could also seize on an Obama victory in the case, but her own immigration proposals are more modest. She has said that absent action by Congress to reform the system entirely, she would keep Obamas program in place and seek to expand on it. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress passes laws and the executive branch enforces them. In the immigration context, Congress has traditionally given the president considerable leeway to interpret how to implement the laws. The high court, evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, could decide the case on narrower grounds than the broad question of executive power.  It could avoid touching on immigration law at all by finding that the states challenging Obamas proposal did not have legal standing to sue. The court could also split 4-4, which would leave in place the lower court decision blocking the plan but without setting any legal precedent.     U.S. presidents generally have discretion to enforce immigration law, but the plans challengers said Obama exceeded the limits of his authority by setting up a program that would allow millions to gain temporary legal status and work permits.  Critics say his plan was unlawful in part because it effectively granted relief from deportation to a much bigger class of people than had ever benefited from any similar programs in the past. Texas and 25 other states who filed suit said it was an unconstitutional abuse of power. Obamas lawyers told the Supreme Court that Obama was acting within the governments exercise of prosecutorial discretion to decide who to deport. ",politicsNews,"June 19, 2016 ",1
"Immigration, abortion, race rulings due at Supreme Court","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is heading into its home stretch, with major rulings due by the end of the month on President Barack Obamas unilateral immigration plan, racial preferences in university admissions and a restrictive Texas abortion law. Producing decisive rulings has been complicated by the fact that the court has been down one justice since conservative Antonin Scalia died in February, leaving it evenly split with four conservatives and four liberals. The justices also are set to rule on whether to overturn Republican former Virginia governor Robert McDonnells 2014 corruption conviction, one of the 13 cases yet to be decided. The court appeared divided along ideological lines when it heard arguments on April 18 over whether Democrat Obama exceeded his constitutional powers in bypassing the Republican-led Congress with a 2014 plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits. Twenty-six states led by Republican-governed Texas brought the lawsuit. A 4-4 ruling, which appeared to be one possibility after the arguments, would deal Obama a huge defeat because it would affirm a lower-court ruling invalidating the plan. Split rulings do not set nationwide legal precedents, but a 4-4 decision would effectively kill Obamas immigration plan. The court also seemed split along ideological lines during March 2 arguments in a challenge to a Texas abortion law brought by abortion providers backed by the Obama administration. A 4-4 ruling would deliver a victory to Texas because it would affirm a lower-court ruling upholding the law. Because such a ruling would set no nationwide precedent, it might not serve as a legal blueprint for other conservative, Republican-dominated states to enact similar laws. The question before the justices is whether the law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a womans constitutional right to abortion as established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. There cannot be a 4-4 ruling in a challenge by a white woman, enlisted by a conservative legal activist, to a University of Texas student admissions policy giving preferences to racial minorities in a program aimed at fostering campus racial diversity. Only seven justices heard that case. Liberal Elena Kagan, the Obama administrations solicitor general when it supported the university in earlier litigation, recused herself. That means four conservatives and three liberals will decide the case. Conservative justices expressed reservations about the affirmative action admissions policy during Dec. 9 arguments.

Trump says U.S. should mull more racial profiling after Orlando shooting,"(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States should consider more racial profiling, in response to a question about whether he supported greater law enforcement scrutiny of Muslim Americans after the Orlando mass shooting. I think profiling is something that were going to have to start thinking about as a country, Trump told CBS Face the Nation.  You look at Israel and you look at others, and they do it and they do it successfully. And you know, I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense, he said when asked if he supported increased profiling of Muslims in America. Trump made similar comments last December about profiling, the targeting of specific demographic groups for extra scrutiny, after a Muslim American and his wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Last week, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, sparked criticism from many in his party for his comments on American Muslims after the Orlando attack on Sunday, in which a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub.  In a speech on national security on Monday, Trump stood by his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and proposed a suspension of immigration from countries with a proven history of terrorism.  He also said the Muslim community had to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad.  Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has said the comments show Trump is unfit to be president. The Florida gunman, Omar Mateen, was born in the United States to Afghan parents. During a three-hour siege at the club, he expressed support for Islamic State, but officials believe he was self-radicalized. In his interview on Sunday, Trump said there were red flags around Mateen, who had been investigated twice by the FBI but ultimately cleared.  Trump also reiterated his support for more scrutiny of mosques, saying that could resemble a controversial New York City surveillance program that has been shut down.  If you go to France right now, theyre doing it in France. In fact, in some instances theyre closing down mosques, he said. Police in France closed some mosques shortly after gunmen aligned with Islamic State militants killed 130 people in Paris in a series of attacks on Nov. 13. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan endorsed Trump but has said a Muslim ban is not in U.S. interests. In excerpts of an NBC interview released on Friday, Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, said Republicans weighing whether to vote for Trump should follow their conscience. Trump brushed off the criticism on Sunday and said he would put up his own money for his campaign if needed. It would be nice if the Republicans stuck together, Trump said in an ABC interview.

Supreme Court may take action on state assault weapon bans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court may weigh in this week on gun control, an issue smoldering again following the June 12 Orlando massacre, with the justices due to decide whether to hear a challenge by gun rights advocates to assault weapon bans in two states. The Connecticut and New York laws prohibit semiautomatic weapons like the one used by the gunman who fatally shot 49 people at a gay night club in Orlando in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Supreme Court will announce as soon as Monday whether it will hear the challenge brought by gun rights groups and individual firearms owners asserting that the laws violate the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment guarantee of the right to bear arms. The court has not decided a major gun case since 2010.  If they take up the matter, the justices would hear arguments in their next term, which begins in October. A decision not to hear the challenge would leave in place lower-court rulings upholding the laws. The courts action in another recent appeal indicated it may be disinclined to take up the matter. The justices in December opted not to hear a challenge to a Highland Park, Illinois ordinance banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. A national assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Congressional Republicans, backed by the influential National Rifle Association gun rights lobby, beat back efforts to restore it. Some states and municipalities have enacted their own bans. In their petition asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, those challenging the Connecticut law said the type of weapons banned by the state are used in self-defense, hunting and recreational shooting. Connecticut said its law targets firearms disproportionately used in gun crime, particularly the most heinous forms of gun violence. It said people in Connecticut still can legally own more than 1,000 types of handguns, rifles and shotguns. There is a longstanding legal debate over the scope of Second Amendment rights. In the 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller case, the Supreme Court held for the first time that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individuals right to bear arms, but the ruling applied only to firearms kept in the home for self-defense. That ruling did not involve a state law, applying only to federal regulations. Two years later, in the case McDonald v. City of Chicago, the court held that the Heller ruling covered individual gun rights in states. ",politicsNews,"June 19, 2016 ",1
Trump says Britain should leave EU: newspaper interview,"LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trump told Britons on Sunday he supported Brexit, repeating just days before the vote on June 23 that he thinks the UK would be better off outside the European Union. As the campaign to decide Britains EU membership restarted after a three-day hiatus following the killing of lawmaker Jo Cox, Trump, the presumptive Republican U.S. presidential candidate, said in a newspaper interview he was backing an out vote.  I would personally be more inclined to leave, for a lot of reasons like having a lot less bureaucracy, he told the Sunday Times. But I am not a British citizen. This is just my opinion. The billionaire businessman also told the newspaper that he would seek to have good relationships internationally if he were elected president in November, including with David Cameron. The British Prime Minister has in the past called Trumps proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States divisive, stupid and wrong.  Trump said in May that Britain would be better off outside the EU because of high levels of migration. The latest opinion polls showed the Remain camp recovering some momentum, although the overall picture remains one of an evenly split electorate. Trump, whose mother was Scottish, is due to be in Britain the day after the referendum, when he visits two golf courses he owns in Scotland. Trump also said that if he became president he would try to improve the trade deals the U.S. has with China, and work more closely with Russia and that could include co-operating with Russia in the fight against Islamic State.

Democrats' new line on gun control: Do it for national security,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats pushing for gun curbs after the latest mass shooting in the United States are co-opting a Republican mantra to build public support and defang opposition: its time to get tough on national security. Shoring up national security has long been a pillar of Republican orthodoxy, as has staunch opposition to gun control. But the massacre of 49 people in Orlando, Florida, last Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, by a gunman who pledged loyalty to Islamist militants may be leaving Republicans on shakier ground. With national security driving the debate, Democrats see a more powerful argument than simply advocating the need to curb gun violence in a country of 320 million that has more than 310 million weapons. Although the Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed to have had no help from extremist Islamist groups in targeting a gay nightclub, he had been investigated by U.S. authorities for possible links to terrorism and subsequently cleared. That prompted Democrats to clamor for legislation to expand background checks and prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns. Votes on four measures were scheduled Monday in the U.S. Senate, two sponsored by Democrats and two by Republicans. Many Republicans, and some Democrats, oppose strict gun curbs partly on constitutional grounds. Every senator is now going to have to say, whether theyre for terrorists getting guns or against terrorists getting guns, Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer told reporters on Thursday. The terrorists that we need to fear are not on the streets of Aleppo, or Mosul or Fallujah. Theyre on the streets of the United States and they will have guns unless we pass tough laws, added Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson all took the tack this week that gun measures were a safeguard against terrorism. Republicans have long criticized Obama for not being tough enough on national security and doing more in the fight against Islamic State. The Orlando massacre and the San Bernardino, California shooting in December by a couple inspired by Islamic State  captured the attention of the American public in a way previous mass shootings have not, said Tom Diaz, a former member of the National Rifle Association gun rights lobby who now backs gun control. Theyve changed the dynamic of this whole issue, said Diaz, an author and expert on terrorism and the gun industry. That shift in sentiment has heartened the families of the 20 elementary school children and six staff members killed in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012, who championed the last big, and ultimately unsuccessful push, on gun control. About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014. Diaz believes Republicans must look as if they care about keeping guns out of the hands of so-called homegrown extremists, whilebalancing issues of due process and the Constitutions Second Amendment right to bear arms that form the backbone of the NRAs opposition to gun control. Republicans say new laws wont necessarily keep weapons out of the hands of people intent on doing harm, and are keen to avoid twinning the two issues.  This is not a gun control issue, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz  said on Thursday. This is a terrorism issue. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said Democrats must be careful about overplaying their hand with rhetoric that could sound like government overreach to Americans who believe in the Second Amendment. Even if the current efforts fail, the new push on national security may prove Democrats best shot at eventually luring Republican support on an issue that has floundered for decades. This is a chance for the Democrats to talk in tough terms about safety and security and also to link that to the gun issue, said Robert Spitzer, political science professor at State University of New York at Cortland.Some notable Republicans appeared willing this week to engage in the debate on gun control. The partys presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, vowed to meet with the NRA to talk about ways to bar people on certain government watch lists from buying guns. The top Republican in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said he was open to suggestions from experts on how to prevent terrorism suspects from acquiring firearms and called the Orlando shooting a calculated act of terror. But it was unclear whether Trump or McConnell would throw their weight behind any measures acceptable to Democrats. Democratic U.S. Representative Jim Himes said he did not hold out great hope that the gun legislation would advance. The reason you wont see a compromise anytime soon is because Congress actually acting in the wake of Orlando would be a tacit admission on the other side that guns had something to do with what happened in Orlando as opposed to ISIS, he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

Clinton's lead over Trump slips after Florida shooting: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump chipped away at Hillary Clintons lead in the presidential race this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, as the candidates clashed over how to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. Thats down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a proven history of terrorism against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States. He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Partys general opposition to gun control. While Trumps comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters. Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trumps idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014.   Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called radical jihadist terrorism, while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons. As usual after a major attack, terrorism jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues. The polls five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clintons support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trumps 32.3 percent. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The political horserace poll included 1,133 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of the polls accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 ",1
New York lawmakers vote to legalize fantasy sports games,"ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - Fantasy sports moved a step closer to being legal in New York on Saturday when lawmakers approved the daily and season-long games, clearing a path for FanDuel, DraftKings and others to offer them to millions of players in the state. The multibillion-dollar industry, where players draft fantasy teams for sports including football, basketball and baseball, has drawn increased scrutiny since last year with the attorneys general of several U.S. states, including New York, Illinois and Nevada, questioning the legality of the games. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had held off on pursuing litigation against the fantasy companies for what he claimed were illegal gambling operations, and the companies have suspended their games of skill while the proposed legislation was in train. New Yorks Senate passed the measure 45-17 early Saturday morning, sending the legislation that regulates and taxes the operators of fantasy sports games to Governor Andrew Cuomo. It is unclear whether Cuomo will sign the legislation, which the Assembly passed on Friday.  Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game where players draft teams in live games played in just one evening or over a weekend, has boomed over the past decade. State Assembly Gaming Committee Chairman J. Gary Pretlow predicted Cuomo would endorse the bill, partly because many young New York voters play the fantasy games and because it would generate tax revenues. Its a good thing for New Yorkers because there are more than three and half million participants, most of them millennials, Pretlow said. DraftKings, which has dominated the industry along with FanDuel, praised the legislation as providing what it called a sensible framework for regulating our games.  In a statement on Saturday, the company said it would resume operations soon with new rules that provide fairness and transparency at the core of all its contests, assuming the governor signs the legislation. FanDuel pointed out that New York was the seventh state to pass a fantasy sports bill this year, following Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Virginia. It speaks to the popularity of our game said Nigel Eccles, the companys CEO and co-founder. The New York legislation calls for a 15 percent annual state tax on gross revenues of all sports fantasy contests with an entry fee. Another 0.5 percent will be assessed each year on the companies with a maximum of $50,000. State Senator John Bonacic, who sponsored the bill, estimates annual state revenues will be about $5.5 million, adding that the measure is going to make a lot of New Yorkers very happy. The legislation survived heavy opposition from casino companies operating in New York. Opponents said it would weaken New Yorks current gaming operations, including the horse racing industry which has been propped up by state government, by giving gamblers more options. After intense lobbying from the fantasy gaming industry, which retained former pro quarterbacks Jim Kelly and Vinny Testaverde to promote the games, lawmakers beat a June 30 deadline to set regulations. Schneiderman said in a statement on Saturday that he would enforce the law as amended, but his office would still pursue claims that DraftKings and FanDuel had engaged in false advertising and consumer fraud. FanDuel and DraftKings are in early-stage talks to merge, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. ",politicsNews,"June 18, 2016 ",1
House panel claims oversight of state climate probes into Exxon,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A Republican-led congressional committee sought on Friday to assert oversight over inquiries that about 20 states are making into Exxon Mobil and climate change, reiterating demands to know more about state attorneys generals consultations with environmental groups. In a letter, some 17 members of Congress and ranking members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee said they have broad jurisdiction that allows them to review investigations carried out by states. The committee was pushing back against state officials who have said they are not subject to federal oversight. The standoff is the latest in a high-stakes battle between the worlds largest publicly traded oil company and a coalition of state attorneys general who have said they would go after Exxon in a bid to force congressional action to tackle climate change. About 20 state officials jointly said in March they would participate in inquiries into whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of climate change. Prior to that March announcement, some state officials met with a range of prominent environmental and investment groups that oppose fossil fuels. The House committee has complained the inquiries risk stifling free speech and scientific inquiry, and that state officials were coordinating with special interest groups. The House committee demanded for the second time since May that state officials hand over all records of communications between their offices and outside groups. Congress has a responsibility to investigate whether such investigations are having a chilling effect on the free flow of scientific inquiry and debate regarding climate change, the letter said. People should be troubled by any attempt by members of Congress to silence or undercut basic investigatory authority by a state attorney generals office, said Cyndi Roy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. Our office will not be intimidated by oil industry-backed members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Exxon, for its part, has said it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years and communicated this to investors.   On Wednesday, Exxon asked a federal court to throw out a subpoena that would force it to hand over decades of documents on climate change to Healeys office. ",politicsNews,"June 18, 2016 ",1
"George W. Bush ends exile, helps Republicans raise money","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President George W. Bush had every intention of sticking to his self-imposed exile from politics, but found that the phone kept ringing with appeals from Republican U.S. Senate candidates for help, friends say. As a result, Bush has embarked on a rescue mission to try to preserve the Republicans narrow Senate majority in a year in which many party figures fear presumptive nominee Donald Trump will drag them down to defeat in the Nov. 8 elections. Republicans control 54 seats in the 100-member Senate. I think that this is a one-off, temporary thing that where he can be helpful he will be, said Dana Perino, who was Bushs White House press secretary. Condoleezza Rice, who was Bushs secretary of state and is now a political science professor at Stanford University, is also raising money for Republican candidates, but on Friday ruled out speculation that she might be drafted as Trumps vice presidential running mate. Dr. Rice hasrepeatedly said in past cycles as well as this one,shes not interested in being vice president.Shes happy at Stanford and plans to stay, said Rice chief of staff Georgia Godfrey. Friends say Bush was initially reluctant to get involved, feeling his time in the limelight had passed. They said he was surprised at the appeals he was receiving to get back into politics more than seven years after his eight-year White House run ended. So far Bush has headlined fund-raising events for Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. He plans to help senators Rob Portman of Ohio, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Roy Blunt of Missouri. Bush is no fan of Trump, but to a certain extent, he is doing Trump a favor in spite of the continuing antagonism toward the Bush family from the bellicose New York businessman. Typically, the partys nominee is the chief fund-raiser in election years, but Trumps fund-raising effort has lagged. Meanwhile, Trump continues to take swipes at the Bush family, particularly at Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who was defeated by Trump in the Republican presidential primary race. On Wednesday in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump complained about Jebs decision not to honor a pledge made last year to support the Republican presidential nominee whoever it is. He signed the pledge but he hasnt endorsed me, Trump said. Like his brother, Jeb Bush is helping raise money for Republican congressional candidates. The Bush family has a deep love for the party and cares about the future and in light of Trumps capacity to damage the brand, I think this is part and parcel of doing what they can to preserve the party, said Jeb Bushs spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell.

Obama family explores 'Big Room' cavern on national parks tour,"CARLSBAD CAVERNS NATIONAL PARK, N.M. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and his family escaped the blistering heat of the Chihuahuan Desert on Friday when they went through a maze of ancient caverns where the only sound was the drip-dripping from stalactites. The subterranean adventure was the first stop on a working vacation during which Obama will spend some time with his teenaged daughters while making the case for more spending on conservation and curbing climate change. It was just like any other family holiday, except the entourage of Secret Service agents, aides and press who follow Obama wherever he goes had to descend the 754 feet (230 m) on elevators in eight shifts. How cool is this? he said to the press in the dark, damp alien landscape of the Big Room, the best known of the labyrinth of limestone caves that actor Will Rogers once called the Grand Canyon with a roof on it.  The president is helping celebrate the centennial of the National Park Service while highlighting his plan to reduce climate-changing carbon emissions, which he sees as part of the legacy of his time in office. The White House has said the changing climate evidenced by  droughts, increased flooding and wildfires and stronger storms has put national parks at risk. The Obamas were due to fly west later on Friday to the Sierra Nevada mountains and Yosemite, the countrys oldest national park and one of its most popular landmarks. Visits to national parks have surged due in part to lower gasoline prices. Still, roads, sewer systems and visitor centers in national parks are aging, and the government is grappling with a $11.5 billion backlog of maintenance projects. At Carlsbad, elevators broke down in 2015, though they seemed in good shape for the Obamas descent. During his time in office, which will end on Jan. 20, 2017, Obama has added 20 sites to the national park system, protecting more than 265 million acres of public land and water and historic sites with new parks, monuments and restrictions for development, more than any other president. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said national park visits in 2016 were on pace to beat last years record of 307 million. Tourists contributed an estimated $300 billion to the economy, supporting about 2 million jobs, she told reporters. She wants Congress to remember those numbers as it considers investments in public lands. Republicans have slammed Obama for adding sites at a time when the government does not have enough funding to look after existing ones. To me, there is little point in conserving lands or allowing the federal government to acquire even more land if we are not going to take proper care of them, Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said last year.

"Under pressure, senators formulate gun control compromise","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some Republican senators tried on Friday to craft a compromise bill to impose limited gun restrictions in the face of pressure from Democrats and public rage over the Orlando mass shooting, the deadliest in modern U.S. history. A gunman killed 49 people at the Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub last Sunday, sparking a scramble over competing gun measures in the U.S. Senate. While past gun-control measures have failed to clear Congress, the massacre, coupled with public pressure and a suggestion by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he can work with gun rights lobbyists to bring about change, may be changing the picture. Republicans over the years have blocked gun control measures saying they step on Americans right to bear arms as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. During a week-long Senate debate, Democrats generally have criticized proposed Republican measures as being ineffective. Republicans and Democrats have offered four separate proposals to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales for people on terrorism watch lists. But they seem destined to fail because of partisan politics and a requirement that any proposal muster 60 of the 100 votes in the U.S. Senate. Republican Susan Collins of Maine, leading the new effort, is considering a more tailored approach. It would prevent the sale of guns to terrorism suspects whose names appear on either the governments no-fly list, which bans them from boarding planes, or a so-called selectee list that requires additional screening at airports, her office said in an emailed statement. These lists are much shorter than a broad terrorism watch list kept by the FBI.  Collins measure also includes a five-year look-back provision that would notify the government if someone who had been on the no-fly or selectee list in the last five years, but was dropped, purchases a gun. That would allow the FBI to put the individual under surveillance or take other appropriate action it deems necessary, Collins office said. The gun control issue is deeply divisive and there have been no major restrictions passed since 1994, when Congress imposed a ban on semi-automatic assault weapons. That expired after 10 years. About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014.     Vice President Joe Biden weighed in on the debate, urging a public groundswell in support of banning the type of weapons that have been used in mass shootings. Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership, Biden said on Friday. Both the gunman in the Orlando attack, Omar Mateen, and the married couple who carried out a December mass shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, were thought to have been inspired by militant Islamist groups abroad. Collins proposal likely would be offered in the Republican-led Senate sometime next week, provided the four other gun-control proposals fail to pass on Monday. Collins is working on the legislation with Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire; she has also been talking to Democrats. A senior Democratic aide said that Democrats have concerns that under Collins bill, some people credibly suspected of involvement in terrorism would not be covered by the weapons ban. Collins told reporters on Thursday that barring everyone on terrorism watch lists from weapons purchases carried with it the risk of affecting people who have been swept onto the lists without good cause. U.S. authorities maintain several watch lists - the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains three and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence runs one database. People are placed on such lists based on the threat level they are believed to pose. What were trying to do is not deny constitutional rights to a large group of individuals who find themselves on watch lists despite the fact that there might not be credible evidence of potential criminal intentions, Collins said. At least one Senate Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, has been involved in the talks, her spokeswoman said.  I think she (Collins) is sincerely committed to finding a way to work this out, said U.S. Senator Chris Murphy who, along with fellow Democrats, set the U.S. Capitol abuzz by talking on the Senate floor for nearly 15 straight hours this week to demand that Congress act on gun control. Murphy said it was too early to say whether any Democrats would get on board with her approach. On Friday, the largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group in the United States, the Human Rights Campaign, said it would push for curtailing access to assault-style rifles, expanding background checks for firearms buyers and limiting the ability of suspected terrorists to purchase guns.

"Obama, Saudi prince focus on Iraq and Syria in Washington meeting","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Friday discussed ways to support Iraqis in their fight against Islamic State militants and the importance of a political transition in war-torn Syria, the White House said. Obama met with Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval office for about an hour. The deputy crown prince is visiting the United States to repair frayed relations and to promote a plan, known as Vision 2030, to slash the kingdoms dependence on oil exports. The President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabias contributions to the campaign against ISIL, the White House said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.  The two talked about steps to support Iraqis including increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs, the White House said.  U.S. officials have expressed unease about the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which according to the United Nations and human rights groups has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia is worried about closer relations between the United States and Iran, Riyadhs arch enemy, after a 2015 nuclear deal.   Obama welcomed Saudi Arabias commitment to a political settlement of the Yemen conflict and support by the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the kingdom is a member, to address humanitarian needs and rebuild the country, the White House said.  On Syria, Obama and the prince talked about the importance of supporting a political transition away from President Bashar al-Assad, the White House said. The United States is working with international partners on what it calls a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the United Nations, but so far there has been little progress.  Over 50 diplomats at the U.S. State Department signed a memo, leaked on Thursday, that was critical of the Obama administrations Syria policy and called for targeted military strikes against Assads government.  Asked about the memo, Saudi Arabias Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, also in Washington, told reporters the kingdom had been arguing for a more robust intervention including airstrikes, a no-fly zone, and a no-drive zone, from the beginning of the five-year civil war.  Obama does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, White House spokeswoman Jen Friedman said.  Both Washington and Riyadh are anticipating the release of classified pages of a U.S. report into the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that some U.S. lawmakers have alleged link Saudi government officials to the attacks. Jubeir said investigations show that the allegations are not correct and they dont hold.  ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 ",1
Bloomberg looks West after bankrolling Philadelphia soda tax win,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After successfully funding a campaign to pass a soda tax in Philadelphia, billionaire Michael Bloomberg is preparing to fund similar efforts in several other cities, giving new momentum to  measures seeking to limit soft drink consumption. The former New York City mayor contributed the bulk of the money for the pro-soda tax side in Philadelphia, providing around $1.6 million. Now the prominent public health crusader will support measures in San Francisco and Oakland, California this year, Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg, said in a conference call on Friday. Bloomberg may also support soda tax drives in Seattle and Multnomah County in Oregon, which includes Portland, in 2017, Wolfson said.  The billionaires planned backing raises the stakes for the powerful beverage industry, which has lobbied hard to defeat many of the 43 municipal and state-level attempts to implement a soda tax that have failed since 2008. Before this week, Berkeley, California was the only U.S. city with a soda tax.  But the success in Philadelphia, the countrys fifth-largest city with a diverse population of 1.6 million, could mark a turning point as Americans become more aware of health campaigners message that sugary soft drinks contribute to obesity and diabetes.   If Berkeley was a tremor, Philadelphia is an earthquake, and we expect there will be more earthquakes going forward, Wolfson said.  As New Yorks mayor, Bloomberg led efforts to pass a state-level soda tax, prevent residents from buying sodas with food stamps, and limit the size of sugary beverages. His efforts prompted public outcry against what were dubbed nanny state initiatives, and all three measures were ultimately defeated. Philadelphias Mayor Jim Kenney took a different approach, emphasizing the revenue benefits of the tax over the health angle. The city council approved the measure in a 13-4 vote on Thursday after activists raised a total of around $2 million, according to Kevin Feeley, who led the pro-tax campaign.  Feeley and Wolfson both said the soda industry outspent the pro-tax campaign.  A spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association (ABA), which represents Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo and funded a local group opposing the tax, said the group did not yet have a final tally for how much it spent. The spokeswoman added that the group would oppose all discriminatory tax proposals. The group has said the taxs passage in Philadelphia was the result of unique local political conditions and unlikely to have a ripple effect in other cities.   The ABA said on Thursday it would sue Philadelphia to stop the tax, and Wolfson did not rule out the possibility that Bloomberg would contribute to aid the citys defense.  Wolfson declined to specify an amount that Bloomberg was willing to spend on the San Francisco and Oakland efforts, but noted that he was not in a position to match soda dollar for dollar. Bloombergs contributions are meant to help level the playing field, he said. (Story corrects first name of Howard Wolfson in paragraph two previously said Michael.) ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 ",1
Ryan says Republicans should follow 'conscience' on Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers should follow their conscience on whether to support Donald Trump in Novembers presidential election, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said in an interview, reflecting the partys unease over its White House candidate.  The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something thats contrary to their conscience. Of course I wouldnt do that, the Republicans most senior elected official said in excerpts released on Friday of an NBC interview set to air on Sunday.  Some Republican leaders and lawmakers in the House of Representatives are struggling to get behind the New York businessman, who last month became the partys presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election. After an initial delay, Ryan has said he will back Trump but he has also acknowledged deep differences with him. He denounced as textbook racism Trumps criticism of a Mexican-American judge and has also criticized Trumps proposal - reiterated after the  massacre of 49 people in a gay bar in Orlando on Sunday - to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States. As Republicans seek to keep control of both chambers of Congress, Trumps comments on such issues have also worried some lawmakers concerned about their own election prospects, particularly in close races. All 247 House Republican seats are up for grabs in the election. Trump, who has welcomed support from Ryan, this week fired back at Republican leaders, telling them to stop speaking out against him or else risk him potentially running by myself. Ryan said earlier this week at his weekly press conference that he does not plan to withdraw his support of Trump, although they disagree on some key issues.  I feel as a responsibility institutionally as the speaker of the House that I should not be leading some chasm in the middle of our party. Because you know what I know thatll do? Thatll definitely knock us out of the White House, Ryan said in the interview for NBCs Meet the Press program. Trumps embrace this week of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and potential gun control measures, in contrast to general Republican orthodoxy have also thrown conservative lawmakers.  Still, Republican leaders have to reconcile their unease with the fact that primary Republican voters opted for Trump. He has never held elected office before but won more than enough delegates to secure the partys nomination at the Republican convention in July.  ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 ",1
Potential Boeing Iran sale faces opposition in U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Republican House of Representatives lawmakers said on Friday they were concerned that Boeing Cos reported plans to sell aircraft to Iran could threaten U.S. national security and had requested more information from the company. American companies should not be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian Regime, Representatives Jeb Hensarling and Peter Roskam said in a letter to Boeing released on Friday. Iran said on Tuesday it had reached an agreement with Boeing for the supply of jetliners, reopening the countrys skies to new U.S. aircraft for the first time in decades under an international nuclear agreement that eased sanctions. Boeing has not confirmed an aircraft sale agreement. The company on Tuesday declined to provide detailed comment in response to Western and Middle East sources saying Iran had reached an understanding with the company to acquire over 100 passenger jets. The nuclear pact reached by Democratic President Barack Obama was opposed by every Republican member of the U.S. Congress. Several questioned the Boeing deal as soon as the news reports came out. In their letter to Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, the lawmakers asked for clarification of the current state of negotiations. Their questions included whether Boeing could guarantee that Irans government could not convert Boeing passenger aircraft to cargo aircraft and whether it would repossess aircraft if Iran violated the nuclear agreement.

Florida lawmaker drops Senate bid to make way for Rubio,"(Reuters) - U.S. Representative David Jolly ended his bid for a U.S. Senate seat from Florida on Friday, opening the way for Marco Rubio to seek re-election in an effort to help Republicans maintain control of the chamber. Marco is saying hes getting in, Jolly, a fellow Republican who has been running to fill the seat for the past 10 months, said on CNN. Rubio dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination.  Later Friday, Jolly, who represents the area around St. Petersburg and Clearwater, said he will run for re-election to his congressional seat. Today I am asking my friends and neighbors to let me continue doing my job as a member of Congress, Jolly said in a news conference in Clearwater. He will likely face former Governor Charlie Crist, a Democrat, in the Nov. 8 election.  Rubio, who ended his presidential bid in March, said this week he was reconsidering running and may decide as early as this weekend.  Representatives for Rubio declined to answer questions about his future plans. At the news conference, Jolly said he fully expects Rubio to run for re-election to the Senate. His spokesman Preston Rudie told Reuters the congressman had no actual knowledge of a Rubio decision. Rubios entry into the senate race would complicate Democrats efforts to win back a majority in the Senate in the November election. Republicans won control of the Senate in the 2014 mid-term election and now hold 54 seats in the 100-seat chamber. Democrats have 44 seats and two independents are aligned with them.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans have urged Rubio to run despite a pledge during his presidential campaign not to seek re-election. They cited polls showing he is the only Republican who can win the state. The deadline is June 24 for candidates to file with Florida election officials their intention to run for the Senate. The Republican primary election will be held on Aug. 30. ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 ",1
"Sanders vows to help Clinton beat Trump, but keeps campaign alive","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders promised on Thursday to work with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, but did not formally pull out of the race for the White House. Sanders did not endorse Clinton during an online speech to his supporters, but made it clear he was shifting his focus to building a grassroots movement to fight for his liberal policy agenda and transform the Democratic Party. The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly, and I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time, the U.S. senator from Vermont said. I also look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to transform the Democratic Party so that it becomes a party of working people and young people, and not just wealthy campaign contributors, he said in a speech broadcast from his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. Sanders, who has resisted pressure from Democrats to exit the White House race and back Clinton since she clinched the party nomination last week, said he would keep fighting for his goals of reducing income inequality, removing big money from politics and reining in Wall Street. Defeating Donald Trump cannot be our only goal. We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become, he said. And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates. Sanders has kept his campaign alive as leverage to force concessions from Clinton on his policy goals during deliberations on the partys issues platform, and on the reforms he seeks in the Democratic Partys nominating process. But he has laid off some staff, stopped campaigning and dropped plans to court unbound delegates in an unspoken acknowledgment the former secretary of state will be the nominee. Sanders, who met with Clinton on Tuesday night after the nominating process ended, said he would continue his discussions with her campaign to make certain the Democratic Party passes the most progressive platform in its history, and that Democrats actually fight for that agenda. Our vision for the future of this country is not some kind of fringe idea. It is not a radical idea. It is mainstream. It is what millions of Americans believe in and want to see happen, Sanders said. ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 ",1
Senate inches toward possible gun control action,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A long-running battle over gun control in the United States reaches a critical stage next week in the U.S. Senate amid signs Americans are more willing to accept limited restrictions after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. While it is far from likely new measures will pass, the Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub massacre of 49 people and a suggestion by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that something be done have fostered a different atmosphere. While President Barack Obama was in Orlando consoling the survivors of the rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to Islamic State militants, the U.S. Senate moved closer to votes on limited gun control measures. About 71 percent of Americans, including eight out of 10 Democrats and nearly six out of 10 Republicans, favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Monday to Thursday. That was up from 60 percent in late 2013 and late 2014. As always, Democrats were challenging Republicans to vote for new restrictions and reject pressure from the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby that has been known to punish politicians who thwart its will. U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and fellow Democrats set the U.S. Capitol abuzz by talking on the Senate floor for nearly 15 straight hours to demand that Congress act on gun control. They ended their speeches before dawn, citing a Republican pledge to hold votes soon on measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and to prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns. The Senate is expected to vote on Monday on four proposals. One from Democrat Dianne Feinstein would let the government prevent terrorist suspects from buying guns. A second from Republican John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, would require court approval within three days for a government ban on an individuals attempt to buy a gun. Democrats have said Cornyns plan is unworkable; Republicans say Feinsteins might harm the rights of people wrongly on terror suspect lists. A third proposal, from Democrat Murphy, would expand background check procedures to the sales of all firearms, including those online and at gun shows. A fourth proposal, from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, would provide for law enforcement to be notified if a person investigated for terrorism in the last five years tries to buy a gun.  Gun control is a potent issue in U.S. politics. Republicans, who control the Senate, have blocked Democratic-backed gun control measures over the years, saying they infringe on the right to bear arms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Any bill would have to pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the president to become law. At his weekly news conference on Thursday, Paul Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives, injected a note of caution. We dont take away a citizens rights without due process, said Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican. If you have a quick idea in the heat of the moment that says lets take away a persons rights without due process, were going to defend the Constitution. A string of mass shootings across the United States in schoolhouses, churches, movie theaters and other public places has failed to break the deadlock. The last major gun control measure was a ban in 1994 on semi-automatic assault weapons such as the one used in Orlando on Sunday. The ban expired 10 years later. One of the most dramatic moments in the Senate debate came when Republican Senator John McCain, who is in a tough re-election race in Arizona, told reporters Obama is directly responsible for Islamic State-inspired attacks on Americans like the one in Orlando. He later said he meant to say he blamed Obamas decision to withdraw most U.S. forces from Iraq, and that this had fueled the rise of Islamic State. Murphy, asked what would be the message if the Senate fails to act on the gun control measures next week, suggested it could be a campaign issue for the Nov. 8 election. There are going to be a lot of voters in this country who are going to watch ... the votes that are cast next week, he said. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president has been endorsed by the NRA. He jumped into the gun debate by saying he would meet with NRA leaders to talk about barring people who are on terrorism watch lists from buying guns. Ill be looking at it very, very seriously - the terror watch list and the no-fly list, Im going to be talking to the NRA about that and starting a real dialogue. I think a lot of people agree with me but I want to really hear what they have to say, Trump told Fox News on Wednesday night. Democrats were deeply skeptical that Trumps word signaled any sort of shift toward more Republican support for Democratic-backed gun control proposals. He is going to meet with the NRA. ... Whats he going to come out saying? Oh the NRA and I agreed we shouldnt have terrorists have guns, but doing nothing about it, U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters.

"Trumped by candidate's rhetoric, Republican lawmakers at a loss for words","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The awkward efforts of Republicans to embrace their partys standard-bearer Donald Trump looked particularly painful in Congress this week as lawmakers ducked into elevators, dashed away from reporters, ignored questions or, worse, tried to answer them.  Only days after a furor over his criticism of a Mexican-American judge, the presumptive presidential nominee sent Republicans reeling again by renewing his call for a ban on Muslim immigration after a gunman who pledged allegiance to Islamic militants killed of 49 people at a Florida nightclub. Then former reality TV star Trump waded into two sensitive topics for social conservatives by embracing the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and suggesting the country may need certain new gun control measures.   For lawmakers accustomed to well-crafted talking points and predictable lines of questioning, the week marked a chaotic flurry of contorted responses or terse, tight-lipped replies. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming walked away when asked about Trumps embrace of the LGBT community, saying: I dont know what the latest is. I havent read anything. I havent been watching. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a former Trump adversary in the presidential primaries, had to bat away two Trump questions before he could announce that he is considering running for re-election  a decision that could determine whether Republicans retain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 election. Senator Ted Cruz, another rival in the primaries, refused to respond directly to the speech in which Trump hardened his line on Muslims while Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr called it an OK speech before stepping into an elevator and refusing to respond to any more questions.   The Trump challenge is obvious even for seasoned Republicans.         Im spending my days commenting on everything that Donald Trump says, lamented John McCain, chairman of Senate Armed Services Committee. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, ricocheted from rejection of Trumps comments on Muslims to doubts about the legality of his proposed immigration ban to bafflement over the billionaires response to the Orlando shootings.  Trump controversies have also overshadowed House Speaker Paul Ryans rollout of a policy agenda, a campaign document that was supposed to help bring Trumps position more into line with mainline party doctrine.  Asked on Thursday whether he was bothered by having to contend with Trumps remarks, Ryan called Trump a different kind of candidate...(in) a different kind of year.  Asked how many more times he would be called on to do so, Ryan said: I dont know the answer to that question either. In an ironic message to his critics among the Republican leadership this week, Trump had this to say: Be quiet, just please be quiet. Dont talk. Please be quiet. Just be quiet. Ryans response? ...You cant make this up sometimes, he said.   A political neophyte who has never held elected office, Trump has also said he may not need much from his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill anyway. We have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself. Ill do very well, he said in a CNN interview. A lot of people thought I should do that anyway, but Ill just do it very nicely by myself.   ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2016 ",1
McCain says he 'misspoke' in blaming Obama for attacks on Americans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Thursday that President Barack Obama was directly responsible for attacks on Americans like the one in Florida because of policies that contributed to the rise of the Islamic State. But the Arizona Republican later  said he misspoke. McCain, who is in a tough re-election race, made the comments after reporters chased him down a marble stairway and into a hallway of the U.S. Capitol. They asked what he was hearing from constituents about gun control issues being debated in the Senate after Sundays shooting rampage by a gunman who claimed allegiance to Islamic State militants. Im hearing a lot from my constituents about what happened and of course I am making them realize that Barack Obama is directly responsible for it, McCain said. Because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obamas failures, utter failures, McCain said. So the responsibility for it lies with President Barack Obama and his failed policies. After media reports began to appear about his comments, McCain, who lost the White House to Obama in the 2008 presidential election, posted a clarification on Twitter and then issued a statement that said he meant to blame Obamas policies, not the president personally. I misspoke. I did not mean to imply that the president was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obamas national security decisions, not the president himself, McCain said in the statement. Forty-nine people died in the shooting in Orlando, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The gunman was U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, whose parents immigrated from Afghanistan. McCain, 79, faces multiple opponents in a Republican primary race in August, and some analysts say he is in danger of losing the Senate seat he has held for three decades. Earlier this week, presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appeared to suggest Obama may have been complicit in the Orlando attacks. Look, were led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or hes got something else in mind, Trump told Fox News. And the something else in mind  you know, people cant believe it ... Theres something going on. Its inconceivable. Theres something going on. ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2016 ",1
White House sees surge in Syrian refugee admissions this year,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration believes it will be able to process many more Syrian refugees in the last half of fiscal 2016 than in the first six months, allowing it to meet its goal of admitting at least 10,000 by Sept. 30. In a letter to Democratic Senator Richard Durbin seen by Reuters on Thursday, the White House said it has allocated additional staff and added more processing locations in the Middle East to expedite the screening process without compromising U.S. security. Therefore, we expect to admit more Syrians in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2016 than we did in the first and second quarters to meet our goal of admitting at least 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year, the letter said. The administrations move is in sharp contrast to recent anti-refugee rhetoric by many Republicans, especially since the killings in Orlando on Sunday raised fears of attacks. Donald Trump, the presumptive 2016 Republican presidential nominee, has called for the refugee resettlement program to be suspended, saying We dont know who they are. They have no documentation, and we dont know what theyre planning. Backers of the administrations plan dispute such statements, citing the extensive screening process the Syrian refugees undergo. So far, the United States has offered refuge to far fewer of the millions fleeing the war in Syria than many of its closest allies. Germany has taken in hundreds of thousands and Canada admitted nearly 30,000 between November 2015 and May 1, 2016. The letter said the administration had set up a temporary processing center in Jordan and expanded operations in Turkey. It also has restarted interviews in neighboring Lebanon, and begun limited processing in Erbil, Iraq. Durbin was a lead author of a letter to President Barack Obama in May, which was signed by more than half the Democrats in the Senate and urged the president to move more quickly to admit Syrians. By mid-May, only 1,736 Syrians had been allowed into the country, a pace that would have fallen far short of the 10,000 goal for the full year. The letter seen on Thursday was the administrations response to the one sent in May. Obamas plan to admit 10,000 Syrians was met with a firestorm of criticism in the United States, mostly from Republicans who say that violent militants could enter the country by posing as refugees. More than 30 governors, most of them Republicans, have tried to keep refugees out of their states. ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2016 ",1
Illinois budget impasse hits $550 million bond sale,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois long-running budget impasse stung the state on Thursday in the U.S. municipal market where buyers of its $550 million bond issue demanded bigger yields over the market benchmark. The pricing was surprisingly soft, considering a strong rally in muni bonds on Thursday, said Greg Saulnier, a Municipal Market Data analyst. The results demonstrate that the market is increasing its penalty due to the states worsening fiscal and political problems, leaving Illinois unable to take full advantage of the historically low borrowing rates. Bank of America Merrill Lynch won the tax-exempt general obligation deal in competitive bidding, pricing bonds due in 2026 with a 5 percent coupon to yield 3.32 percent, which is 185 basis points over MMDs triple-A yield scale. The spread was 175 basis points ahead of the bond sale, according to MMD, a unit of Thomson Reuters.  It was also wider than the 154 basis-point spread in 10 years for Illinois $480 million GO bond sale in January. Illinois is poised to be the only U.S. state since at least the 1930s to end a fiscal year without a complete budget. Its Republican governor and Democratic-controlled legislature have so far failed to reach a deal on fiscal 2016 or 2017 spending plans. That leaves unaddressed the growing structural budget deficit and huge $111 billion unfunded pension liability in the fifth-biggest U.S. state. The bond issue itself was seen as a weapon in the political war to pressure Democrats to cave in to Governor Bruce Rauners demands, while losing money for the cash-strapped state. Muni yields have been hitting new record lows on MMDs scale in recent days, driven by cash-heavy investors chasing low supply of debt. Rauners office said the true interest cost for the bonds, which carry maturities from 2017 to 2041, was 3.74 percent, down from 3.99 percent in the January sale, and the lowest ever for similar general obligation bonds issued by the state. Its clear from todays bond sale that investors realize Illinois now has a governor that is trying to turn the state around and right its fiscal ship, Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said in a statement. Some market participants thought Illinois so-called credit spread should be even wider. Its odd to me, said Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. Illinois has proven time and time again they cant get anything done.    Heading into the deal, Illinois credit ratings, which were already the lowest among the states, were downgraded by Moodys Investor Service and Standard & Poors.  The governors office also revealed on Wednesday that the state lacks appropriations to actually spend all the proceeds earmarked mainly for road construction and mass transit projects due to the impasse. State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a first-term Democrat, predicted the bond issue could be a net money-loser for Illinois if the borrowed funds go unspent and must be invested short-term. Well make far less in interest than well be paying in interest to the bondholders, Frerichs said in an interview. I think we need to make these investments in infrastructure, but were going about it in the wrong order. It seems backwards issuing the bonds and hoping they get an appropriation to spend them. On Wednesday, Rauner administration officials warned of the imminent shutdown of transportation projects and the loss of 25,000 construction jobs without a budget deal. Spokesmen for House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, both Democrats, declined to speculate on the chances of either legislative chamber granting the Rauner administration the spending authority it needs to fully tap the bond issue.

Philadelphia passes soda tax after mayor rewrites playbook,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney scored a victory that had eluded more than 40 U.S. public officials who took on the powerful U.S. soda industry when the city council voted on Thursday to slap a tax on sweetened drinks.  After a bitter, months-long battle, the city council voted 13-4 to approve a 1.5 cent-per-ounce tax on sugary and diet drinks beginning in January. The council already approved the plan in a preliminary vote last week, and the outcome had not been expected to change.  The City of Brotherly Love became the biggest U.S. city to have such a tax. Much smaller Berkeley, California, was the first. Similar efforts, including several spearheaded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, were defeated after intense lobbying from organizations like the American Beverage Association, which opposes the Philadelphia move and represents Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc.  Following Thursdays vote, the ABA said it would take legal action to stop the tax.  The Philadelphia vote marked a major victory for health advocates who say sugary drinks cause obesity and diabetes. But experts noted those concerns were not the focus for Kenney and other backers of the tax as they took on critics complaining that nanny state public health measures intrude on residents personal lives. Instead, Kenney rewrote the soda-tax advocates playbook. He played up the benefits of the cash injection from the tax for the citys depleted coffers. In the first year, the tax is projected to raise $91 million, and he pledged to spend funds on public programs such as universal pre-kindergarten. If you want to tax something and people know where the moneys going to go, then its easier for them to get behind it, Kenney said in an interview. He noted that focusing on revenue, rather than health, was largely responsible for the measures passage.  The strategic shift could lend momentum to movements in San Francisco, neighboring Oakland, California, and Boulder, Colorado. Residents of those cities will vote in November on similar taxes, which could deal further blows to a U.S. soft drink industry already hit by declining soda consumption. U.S. soda consumption fell for the 11th straight year in 2015, according to Euromonitor data.  Bloomberg made public health a centerpiece of his tenure as New York City mayor between 2002 and 2013. He moved to limit smoking in parks and restaurants, ban transfats and require calorie counts posted in some restaurants. On soda, he pushed for a tax, then a ban on soda purchases with food stamps, and finally a much-lampooned limit on the size of sugary drinks. His efforts were ultimately rejected, with critics decrying the moves toward a nanny state.  The strategy worked in Britain, where a new soft drinks levy was announced in March after officials emphasized the countrys obesity crisis, saying it cost the economy billions of pounds annually and was a huge burden on the state-funded health system.  That approach never worked in Philadelphia. Michael Nutter, the previous mayor, twice tried to pass a soda tax as a health initiative and as a way to plug a budget shortfall. He was unable to push it through the city council. Twice before it was used in Philadelphia and it was not successful. It was used in New York and it was not effective, said Kenney, adding that while the health benefits of a tax are not less important, they are less tangible.  Kenney, who became mayor in January, had made a campaign pledge to provide universal pre-kindergarten, and he kept that issue as his focus. A spokeswoman said complex state laws on taxation made enacting a citywide soda tax the best option to raise revenue for that signature proposal. Bloomberg personally contributed funding to support Philadelphias pro-tax campaigners.  Opponents of Philadelphias soda tax argued that the measure will disproportionately hurt the poor and prompt Philadelphians to travel to nearby suburbs to buy soda.  A spokesman for No Philly Grocery Tax, a local ABA-funded group, said it would sue the city to stop it from imposing the unconstitutional tax, but was still analyzing all its legal options. In a statement, it called the tax regressive and discriminatory.  Kenney said the city was prepared to defend the tax in any litigation from the beverage industry.  Its the precedent that they were so staunchly fighting, and thats their problem now, Kenney said. Youre going to see the beginnings of a kind of domino effect relative to this specific effort.  In Colorado, Boulder hopes to use soda tax revenue on health programs, and San Francisco and Oakland officials would recommend but not require funds raised to go toward obesity and diabetes prevention.  When Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014, industry groups dismissed the measure as a fluke given the citys largely white population and reputation as a hotbed for liberal measures. But Philadelphia is the fifth-largest U.S. city, with 1.6 million people. No one can trivialize it as they can trivialize Berkeley, said Larry Tramutola, a California political strategist who worked on the Berkeley campaign and is currently leading the San Francisco and Oakland efforts.

Rubio considers running for re-election to Senate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Wednesday he is  considering running for re-election and may decide to jump into the race as early as this weekend, a move that could help Republicans retain their majority in the U.S. Senate.  Ill go home later this week. And Ill have some time with my family. And then, if theres a change in our status, Ill be sure to let everyone know, the former Republican presidential candidate told reporters in the U.S. Capitol.  Rubio, 45, first elected to the Senate in 2010, announced his retirement from the Senate in March after losing Floridas presidential primary. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others have been pressuring him to reconsider, citing polling data showing him to be the only Republican who can win the election in Florida.  Rubio confirmed a Politico report that he was urged to run for re-election on Sunday in Orlando, Florida, by one of the Republicans contending for the seat, his friend Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera. The two men were in Orlando after the shooting that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub. Another Florida Republican hopeful, U.S. Representative David Jolly, has indicated he would step aside if Rubio entered the race. Rubio must decide whether to seek re-election by June 24, the filing deadline for Floridas August primary. ",politicsNews,"June 15, 2016 ",1

Clinton outpaces rivals in drug company donations,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has taken more money from employees of Americas 15 biggest pharmaceuticals companies than all of the Republicans who attempted a run for the White House this year combined, according to campaign finance disclosures. The donations, which were nearly double those accepted by Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, came even as the former senator and secretary of state vowed to curb price gouging in the industry if elected. Clintons campaign took nearly $240,000 from employees of the industry between its launch and the end of April, compared with just under $168,000 for all of the Republicans together, including around $1,700 for presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to the filings.  The money, a drop in the bucket of Clintons nearly $190 million in overall individual contributions, has tended to come from people in top jobs: 54 percent of the donors list their position as executive, director, manager or lawyer. Donors and company officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment on the contributions. Industry insiders say the sector may be drawn to Clinton for a few reasons: She has a good chance of winning against Trump in November, her policies are relatively transparent and predictable, and shes more supportive of international trade than rivals. Many of the biggest pharmaceuticals companies are also headquartered in areas of the country that are more heavily populated by liberals, like New Jersey and New York  another potential reason for the Clinton-heavy employee donations. (Trade) is, in particular, an issue for the pharmaceutical industry. They all operate trans-nationally, said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm that works with companies across the health sector. He added: We have very limited ability to predict what would happen in a Trump administration. We dont know the people, we dont have a lot to go on. Trump, who largely self-funded his primary bid, only recently began soliciting donations for the general election, meaning his contributions from supporters in all industries are likely to rise in the coming months. Clinton tapped into widespread public frustration over soaring health costs this winter when she outlined a plan to curb drug price hikes and singled out pharmaceuticals company Valeant, saying she would go after them if elected. Trumps campaign seized on Clintons donations from the industry as proof that she would be unlikely to follow through.  Hillary Clinton will be totally controlled by the special interests, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. Clinton has rejected the idea. Hillary Clinton has spent her career fighting to crack down on rising prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable, spokesman Josh Schwerin said. Clintons donations from drug companies have grown since the last time she ran, in 2008, but fall far short of her rival in that race, President Barack Obama, who took in more than $500,000 in contributions from employees of pharmaceutical companies during the equivalent period of time. Clintons total in this race so far, however, beats the combined take in the 2012 election of Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney from employees of the industry of $170,000, according to the filings.

U.S. top court puts some limits on contractor fraud lawsuits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday imposed some limits on the kind of fraud claims that can be brought against federal contractors in a case involving a suit against one of Americas largest hospital operators over a womans death at one of its facilities. But the 8-0 ruling was not the broad victory for business sought by the company, Universal Health Services, and other healthcare providers fearful of suits under the U.S. False Claims Act, which lets individuals make claims that the federal government has been defrauded. The justices threw out a 2015 appeals court ruling that had allowed the parents of Yarushka Rivera to sue Universal Health Services under the False Claims Act, but sent the case back to a lower court, meaning the suit could potentially still proceed. Rivera suffered a fatal seizure in 2009 at age 19 a mental health facility owned by the company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The lawsuit said the facility provided gravely inadequate treatment and used unsupervised and unqualified personnel. The ruling represented a partial victory for the business community because it rejected the lower courts expansive view of a companys liability under the False Claims Act.  Roy Englert, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services lawyer, said he was pleased the justices threw out the appeals court ruling and set a new rigorous standard for determining if the claims can move forward. Riveras parents, Julio Escobar and Carmen Correa, accused the company of defrauding the government because it was getting federal Medicaid funding to provide treatment to low-income people and did not comply with personnel regulations at the Lawrence facility. The ruling accepts the basic notion that fraudsters cant provide shoddy services to the government and expect payment without incurring significant liability, said David Frederick, the lawyer for Riveras family. Businesses had hoped the justices would put more limits, or disallow completely, lawsuits based on a federal contractors failure to meet certain legal or regulatory requirements not specifically outlined in a government contract.  The court instead said such lawsuits can be filed as long as they are relevant to the governments decision to make the payment to the company. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the parents may well have adequately pleaded a violation of the fraud law, but added that the False Claims Act is not a means of imposing treble damages and other penalties for insignificant regulatory or contractual violations. The Obama administration had backed the parents. ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2016 ",1
"Clinton considering Warren, not Sanders, for running mate: WSJ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton is considering U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren for her running mate for the Democratic presidential ticket, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing several people familiar with the process. Warren, a leading progressive voice among Democrats, is among those Democratic presidential candidate Clinton is vetting for the vice presidential position, the newspaper reported. Clintons rival Bernie Sanders is not, it added.  Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Warren, who represents Massachusetts, is considering the potential role.  Representatives for Clinton, Sanders and Warren did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the report. Clinton is the Democratic Partys presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, having won the last primary contest this week in the District of Columbia.  Although Clinton and Sanders met this week, the senator from Vermont does not plan to end his campaign or endorse Clinton in a video speech to supporters scheduled for later on Thursday, his spokesman said.     While the search for a potential partner in the race is still in its early stages, the Journal reported several Democrats said Clintons campaign is looking at a number of potential candidates, including Warren. Other prospective running mates include U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez and U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julin Castro, according to the report. Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Cory Booker of New Jersey as well as U.S. Representatives Xavier Becerra of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio are also under consideration, it said.  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is also a potential candidate, it added.  Warren threw her support behind Clinton last week as the former secretary of state moved her sights from the nominating contest toward a Nov. 8 match-up against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Warren could help Clinton win over Sanders supporters from the partys more liberal wing after a surprisingly protracted primary race. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, has not yet dropped out.  She also would give Clinton a vocal boost in her fight against Trump. Warren has called Trump a threat to the country and has vowed to keep lashing out at him. (This story has been refiled to remove superfluous word endorsed in paragraph nine.)

"Labor powerhouse AFL-CIO backs Clinton, vows 'targeted campaign'","(Reuters) - The largest labor federation in the United States, the AFL-CIO, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Thursday, vowing to throw the full weight of more than 50 unions representing 12.5 million members behind the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.      Hillary Clinton is a proven leader who shares our values, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. We will run a sophisticated, targeted ground campaign. And with the dire consequences Donald Trump poses for Americas working families, it has to be.  While the federation generally does not endorse a Democratic candidate until there is an official nominee, Trumka has warned for months that he believes Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump would be disastrous for working people if elected.  After the endorsement, Clinton pledged to spend more on public infrastructure and to fight to improve schools. She vowed to increase the federal minimum wage, offer paid family leave and ensure that women receive equal pay. As president, I will stand proudly with the AFL-CIO and fight to protect the rights and values that helped build the mighty American middle class. Workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House, Clinton said in a statement. The AFL-CIO has already run digital ads criticizing Trumps candidacy and will now work to boost Clintons campaign on the ground. Working America, one AFL-CIO affiliate that deals with nonunion workers, already has teams in crucial so-called battleground states. In response to the federations endorsement of Clinton, Trumps campaign said the AFL-CIO no longer represents the interests of American workers. I will fight harder for American workers than anyone ever has, Trump said in a statement. Trump attacked Clinton for supporting free trade agreements and said he would win a majority of votes from U.S. union families. ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2016 ",1
'Lone hacker' claims responsibility for cyber attack on Democrats,"(Reuters) - A lone hacker has taken responsibility for a cyber attack on the U.S. Democratic National Committee, which the DNC and a cyber-security firm have blamed on the Russian government. The DNC and cyber firm CrowdStrike disclosed the attack on Tuesday, saying that hackers working for Russia broke into the DNCs computer network, spied on internal communications and stole research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. A Russian government spokesman responded by saying that Moscow had not been involved. On Wednesday, an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 took responsibility for the attack in a post on the blogging site WordPress.com, saying the DNC was hacked by a lone hacker. The DNC did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday evening on Guccifer 2.0s claim. CrowdStrike said it stands by findings that the Russian government was behind the attacks.  Guccifer 2.0s blog includes images of documents it claims were stolen from DNC servers, including one titled Donald Trump Report, which was dated Dec. 19, and spreadsheets purportedly containing information about party donors.  Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the documents, which the blog said were among thousands of files and mails removed from DNC servers that would soon be published on WikiLeaks.  CrowdStrike issued a statement saying it stands fully by its analysis that two groups affiliated with Russian intelligence were discovered in the DNCs network last month.  The company said it was reviewing the documents published by Guccifer 2.0 to determine whether they were authentic.  ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2016 ",1
"Illinois to sell bonds, but cannot tap all the proceeds","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois will sell $550 million of bonds on Thursday but lacks authority from the state legislature to spend all of the proceeds due to an ongoing budget impasse. The General Assembly needs to grant appropriation authority to fully expend the proceeds from the bond sale, although existing FY16 appropriations could be used to expend a portion of them, Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Governor Bruce Rauner, said on Wednesday. Her statement followed a news conference earlier on Wednesday with the Republican governor and his transportation department head, who warned of the imminent shutdown of hundreds of construction projects if the Democrat-controlled legislature does not approve Rauners temporary budget plan. All but $20 million of the states general obligation bond issue is earmarked for mass transit and road construction projects. The odd timing of the announcement on the eve of the state bond sale handed Rauners Democratic rivals in the state legislature fodder to question the first-term governors actions.  Were hoping none of his activities or staff work is going to drive up borrowing costs like it did for the Chicago Public Schools in February, said Steve Brown, spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. The school district delayed, then downsized its bond sale,  after Rauner threatened a state takeover of CPS and said the system was headed for bankruptcy, comments Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called shameful because of their possible impact on the bond sale. Rauner on Wednesday pleaded with Democratic lawmakers to return to session to pass a spending plan that would keep the state operating until January and fully fund K-12 schools. Allowing the crisis to continue is wrong, Rauner said, referring to the ongoing impasse that has left Illinois as the only state without a fiscal 2016 budget. Illinois has been dependent on court orders and a muddle of ongoing and stopgap appropriations to continue operating and lawmakers have not reached any agreement on a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The states GO bonds trade at wide spreads over Municipal Market Datas benchmark triple-A yield scale. But Illinois upcoming debt issue will likely benefit from yields in the municipal market that are at or near record lows as cash-heavy investors chase scarce supply of bonds issued by states, cities, schools and other issuers. Illinois already low credit ratings were downgraded last week ahead of the sale.  ",politicsNews,"June 15, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Eyes on U.S. terrorism watchlists after Orlando shootings,"(Reuters) - As facts emerge about Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday, questions have arisen about how well-known he was to U.S. intelligence agencies. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Monday that Mateen was on a watchlist between May 2013 and March 2014 while he was under investigation after claiming a connection to or support for multiple Islamist extremist groups, including al Qaeda, Hezbollah, al-Nusra and Islamic State. The FBI maintains three watchlists and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence runs one database. People are placed on a watchlist according to the threat level they are believed to pose. Comey did not specify which watchlist named Mateen.  Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton has supported stricter gun laws and said on Monday she would push for laws that would prevent people on a no-fly list from buying guns. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has embraced gun rights, said he would meet with the leading U.S. gun rights group about preventing people on a government watchlist from buying guns. The U.S. government maintains the following databases: Terrorist Watchlist or Terrorist Screening Database (about 420,000 names): Established after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Terrorist Watchlist is intended to positively identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the U.S, board aircraft, or engage in other activity. Prior to 2001, intelligence agencies maintained dozens of individual lists. The Terrorist Watchlist is run by the FBIs Terrorist Screening Center with the goal of consolidating the U.S. governments watchlists into a single database.   No-Fly List (about 16,000 names): A subset of the Terrorist Screening Database, the No-Fly List prohibits people known or suspected of terrorism from boarding a plane that departs from or arrives in the United States.  Selectee List (about 16,000 names): A subset of the Terrorist Watchlist, the Selectee List includes individuals who are permitted to fly, but receive more intensive screening. In addition to the thousands of records updated daily from federal, state and local law enforcement, the Selectee List provides an additional level of screening for individuals thought to present a greater threat.  Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database (about 1.1 million names): Run by the National Counterterrorism Center, part of the Office of the National Director of Intelligence, the TIDE Database shares information with the FBIs watchlists. As of December 2013, it contained about 1.1 million people, about 25,000 of them U.S. citizens. Unlike the FBIs database, TIDE is viewable only by counterterrorism professionals in the U.S. intelligence community and is not shared with local law enforcement.  Federal agencies propose people for inclusion on the TIDE database based on an evaluation of the threat they pose. Reasons someone may be added to the TIDE database include committing terrorist activity, preparing or planning a terrorist activity or providing support, such as funds or housing, for a terrorist organization.

California legislature sends $122.5 billion budget to governor,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The California legislature agreed on Wednesday to a $122.5 billion spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 and sent it to Governor Jerry Brown, who is expected to sign it.  The budget directs $2 billion to the states rainy day fund, a priority for Brown, a Democrat and fiscal moderate who has warned that an economic downturn could lie ahead for the nations most populous state.  Lower-than-expected income tax revenues in April caught state officials by surprise, and Brown said the state could take in $1.9 billion less than anticipated in taxes over the coming fiscal year.  Democratic leaders in the state Senate praised the budget for making investments in the social safety net and early childhood education.  The budget included a repeal of the states maximum family grant rule, which prevents people on welfare from receiving additional public money if they have more children.  Without the rule, households would receive an additional $122 a month for a newborn child. The change is expected to cost the state about $220 million a year.  Our expenditure plan funds anti-poverty programs, child care and education, said Mark Leno, Democratic state senator and budget chair.  It also includes resources to combat homelessness, support low-income working families and improve college readiness and enrollment, he said. Republicans and some Democrats complained the spending increase of $6.9 billion from the prior fiscal year set California on a path of billion-dollar deficits down the road.  Californians deserve a responsible and sustainable state spending plan, said Senate Republican leader Jean Fuller.  Unfortunately, this record spending budget paves the way for future deficits and increases fees that make living in California even more expensive, she said.  Some of the spending increases were attributed to an increase in the minimum wage and increased benefits for the disabled.  In a tweet, Brown said: Good work from the state legislature: were building reserves and investing in CA. Thanks.  Brown has until the end of the month to sign the budget.

"Senators, Trump open to ban on some gun sales after Orlando","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators signaled on Wednesday a new willingness to consider restrictions on the sale of guns after the Orlando nightclub massacre, with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others in his party ready to discuss limited gun control measures.  With Republicans and the National Rifle Association gun lobby under pressure to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Trump said he would meet with the NRA to discuss ways to block people on terrorism watch or no-fly lists from buying guns.  Emotions have run high in Congress since Sundays mass shooting with Democrats stalling Senate proceedings on Wednesday in a bid to push for tougher gun control legislation. Democratic senators planned to speak on the Senate floor well into Wednesday night.  The Senate began discussions on legislation to ban firearm sales to the hundreds of thousands of people on U.S. terrorism watch lists after a gunman who had been on such a list killed 49 people at a gay nightclub on Sunday. But following a full day of wrangling, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said that negotiations were little more than a smokescreen by Republicans trying to give themselves political cover while they continue to march in lock-step with the NRAs extreme positions. Reid said there were no Republican proposals that come close to attracting Democratic support. Earlier on Wednesday, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged senators to offer ideas on how to prevent another attack like the one in Orlando.  I do not believe this was some random act of violence, McConnell said. It seems clear this was cold-blooded murder committed by a terrorist who picked his targets with deliberate malice. On Tuesday, McConnell said that nobody wants terrorists to have firearms.  Earlier in the week, some Democrats in the House of Representatives interrupted a moment of silence for the victims, with shouts of Wheres the bill? to protest the Republican-led chambers refusal to consider tougher gun laws.   If Congress was to pass a gun control measure, it would mark the first time in more than 20 years that lawmakers agreed on how to address the hot-button issue. A ban on semi-automatic assault weapons, such as the one used in Orlando, had gone into effect in 1994 and expired 10 years later. Republicans over the years have blocked gun control measures saying they step on Americans right to bear arms as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, confirmed that he and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein were holding private talks on a possible compromise bill stopping weapons sales to those on watch lists.      Another Republican, Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, also is working on a bill that would keep guns from people on watch lists, a gun control group said. Toomey, who is in a possibly difficult re-election bid this year, took to the Senate floor urging compromise. So theres an obvious opportunity here guys, to work together and find a solution, he said, adding, This is not rocket science to figure this out. A spokeswoman for Toomey, E.R. Anderson, said the senator was seeking bipartisan support for an approach that he had tentatively agreed on with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, which is backed by ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Everytown spokeswoman Erika Lamb said the group was encouraged by the discussions but added, We are not there yet and our support for any compromise legislation is contingent on support from both Republicans and Democrats. Toomeys bill would allow the U.S. attorney general to create a new list of likely terrorists and block any person on the list from buying or selling a gun. If someone was denied a gun, he or she would be entitled to a swift court hearing where the attorney general would have to turn over the evidence against the person. Democrats were dubious. One problem, a Democratic aide said, was that under the proposal officials would just have three days to try to block sales to anyone not already on the new list. Congressional Republicans and the NRA have thwarted previous gun control measures backed by President Barack Obama and other Democrats after other mass shootings, and supporters of new restrictions remained cautious about the moves. The Cornyn bill is outlandish and is worse than nothing. From what Im told all of the compromises proposed by Cornyn and Toomey are not at all acceptable, said Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat of New York.     Feinstein, speaking to reporters following a closed briefing from the Obama administration on the Orlando massacre, held out little hope her talks with Cornyn would bear fruit. I dont think its going to work out, she said, but added she was still engaged in talks. Trump said on Twitter he would meet with the NRA about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no-fly list, to buy guns. His campaign did not specify what he might support legislatively, and a spokeswoman declined to give details about the timing or nature of the meeting. The NRA, a politically influential lobbying group that claims more than 4 million members, said in a statement it was happy to meet with Trump, whom it endorsed for president on May 20. The group said in a statement that anyone on a terrorism watch list who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and any sale to that person delayed, a position the lobby group has long held. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has supported gun control efforts, on Monday said she was bewildered that Republicans in Congress in December had blocked a Democratic effort to restrict gun sales to people on the watch lists. The U.S. government maintains two terrorism watch lists: a no-fly list barring people from flying to and from the United States and a larger one that subjects travelers to greater scrutiny at airports and border crossings. An FBI official said in 2014 there were 64,000 people on the no-fly list and 800,000 on the broader list. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrants, was on the broader list at one time. NRA Executive Director Chris Cox also voiced backing for legislation offered in December by Cornyn, who proposed to put gun sales on hold for 72 hours for people on watch lists. Critics have said such background checks could take longer to complete. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was too soon to tell if Republicans would support common sense steps like blocking firearm sales to people on the no-fly lists.

New York State Senate confirms Vullo as top financial regulator,"(Reuters) - The New York State on Wednesday confirmed Governor Andrew Cuomos pick to become the states top financial regulator. The confirmation vote for Maria Vullo, Cuomos nominee for superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), was unanimous. Cuomo, a Democrat, nominated Vullo in January. Her appointment is effective immediately. Earlier on Wednesday, the New York Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on Vullos nomination and recommended that she be confirmed. Last week, the New York Senates banking and insurance committees also held separate hearings about Vullo.  Vullo, a lawyer who represented banks, described herself during recent state legislative committee meetings as pro-business and pro-consumer.  She has been running the NYDFS as its acting superintendent since February. Vullo will succeed former NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, who left the agency last year. Under Lawsky, NYDFS earned a reputation as an aggressive regulatory body that extracted hefty fines from global banks and other financial institutions. The regulator, created in 2011 by consolidating the states banking and insurance agencies, had been in flux since before Vullos arrival in March. ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2016 ",1

I dont think that going to work out, Feinstein told reporters, but added that she was still talking to other lawmakers in an effort to find agreement. She also said she understood that Cornyn had shared her draft legislation with the National Rifle Association.  Now, that would do it, she said, suggesting the gun lobby would reject her proposal.

Trump backs surveillance of mosques despite criticism of rhetoric,"(Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday called for surveillance of mosques as part of U.S. law enforcement efforts to prevent terrorism, and stood by his remarks on banning Muslim immigrants, which others in his party have criticized. Trump repeated his call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States after a U.S.-born Muslim, the son of Afghan immigrants, fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando early on Sunday. The New York real estate developer said that while the Florida gunman was born in the United States, his parents werent and his ideas werent born here.  We have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we dont solve it, its going to eat our country alive, Trump said at a rally in Atlanta. Trump had called for surveillance of mosques in November, as well as a database of Syrian refugees entering the United States. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed by authorities to have acted alone, inspired by radical ideology he was exposed to over the internet. Any kind of extremism and violence is not preached in American mosques, said Ibrahim Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In fact, research has shown that mosques are a moderating influence on individuals who attend. Prominent Republicans this week distanced themselves from Trumps comments about Muslims.  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he did not think a ban on the entry of Muslims was in U.S. interests. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and has been a fierce critic since, said that he was unnerved by Trumps response. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said on Wednesday that Trumps rhetoric had grown even more inflammatory in recent days. She said the United States counts on Muslim communities in the U.S. and partners in majority-Muslim countries to help fight terrorism. Not one of Donald Trumps reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando, Clinton said at an event for U.S. military families in Virginia. Trump on Monday proposed that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats. He also said radical Muslims were entering the country amid a flood of refugees and trying to take over our children. Trumps hard-line proposals on immigration have contributed to his popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered condemnation from minority and human rights activists and his political opponents, many of whom have called his rhetoric racist. The New York businessman also said in Atlanta he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if he came to the United States, and he dismissed the controversy he caused in May when he said in a Reuters interview he would be willing to speak to Kim. If he came here, Id accept him. But I wouldnt give a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people  that rip us off, Trump said. ",politicsNews,"June 15, 2016 ",1

U.S. signals accommodation of Israeli terms on defense aid,"WASHINGTON/HERZLIYA, Israel (Reuters) - The Obama administration is prepared to incorporate missile defense funds in a new long-term agreement on military aid for Israel, a U.S. official said on Wednesday, accommodating in principle a key request by its ally in the yet-unresolved talks. Disputes over the scope and fine print of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) have clouded already difficult ties between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama during the latters final months in office. The current MOU, signed in 2007 and due to expire in 2018, gave Israel around $30 billion in so-called foreign military financing. Israel has been seeking around $10 billion more for the next decade and that money be earmarked for missile defense projects that were hitherto funded ad hoc by the U.S. Congress. U.S. negotiators previously proposed a total of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion annually for Israel under the new MOU, but did not say whether this might include missile defense funds. A senior U.S. official was more forthcoming on Wednesday. We are prepared to make an unprecedented multi-year missile defense commitment as part of a new memorandum of understanding with Israel on military assistance, the official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. This commitment, which would amount to billions of dollars over 10 years, would be the first long-term pledge on missile defense support to Israel, affording Israel robust support for its missile defense, as well as predictability and facilitating long-term planning. U.S. lawmakers have in recent years given Israel up to $600 million in annual discretionary funds for missile defense, well beyond the $150 million requested by the Obama administration. On Tuesday, the White House opposed a proposal to include $600 million for Israeli missile defense to an appropriations bill for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. Netanyahu came out with a rare statement on the MOU talks, in the face of Israeli opposition accusations that he is endangering American largesse by feuding with Obama over Irans nuclear program and Palestinian peace talks. Netanyahus office said on Twitter that the White Houses move on Tuesday was part of an internal debate with Congress about supplementary missile defense funding for Israel. There has been no cut in American assistance, it tweeted. Prime Minister Netanyahu is working to anchor this supplement as part of the discussions on the assistance agreement for the next ten years. Not only will security assistance for missile defense not be cut, it will be increased. However, Netanyahus acting national security adviser, Jacob Nagel, made clear agreement was not a given. Israeli officials have hinted that, if the disputes persist, they might await the next U.S. president in hope of getting a better MOU.  Netanyahus government was working to wrap up the talks with the Obama administration, Nagel told reporters. But he added: When we conclude that we have arrived at the final (U.S.) offer, we will decide if we want it or not.  Another sticking point has been a U.S. demand to reduce the amount of aid money - now 26.3 percent - that Israel can spend on its own military industries rather than on American products.  Visiting Israel for strategic talks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said it had received $8.5 million a day from the Obama administration in defense aid. In a speech to the annual Herzliya Conference, Blinken did not give details on the MOU talks, but he said Washington was ready to give Israel the largest single pledge of military assistance from the United States to any country in our history, cementing an unparalleled security relationship all the way to 2029.

Sanders not ending campaign in Thursday's video speech: spokesman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders does not plan to suspend his campaign and endorse presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in a video speech to supporters on Thursday, focusing instead on ways to pursue his policy agenda and reform goals, a spokesman said. Sanders, who has resisted pressure to exit the race and back Clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the Democratic nomination last week, will address supporters nationwide on a video live stream on Thursday night. That raised expectations Sanders might formally pull the plug on his campaign. But spokesman Michael Briggs said on Wednesday the speech will focus on how Sanders supporters can keep the fight alive on priorities such as raising the minimum wage and reducing the influence of big money in politics. Tomorrow night, no, hes not ending it, Briggs said of the campaign. Were working our way through that, how to go forward on that front. This message to supporters is going to be a lot broader than that. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has promised to continue his campaign to next months Democratic nominating convention in Philadelphia as leverage to force concessions from Clinton on his policy goals and on reforms he seeks in the Democratic Partys nominating process. Since Clinton secured enough delegates for the nomination last week, however, Sanders has laid off some campaign staff, stopped holding rallies and dropped plans to court unbound delegates in an unspoken acknowledgment that the former secretary of state will be the nominee. He knows how to count, Briggs said. Sanders and Clinton met in a downtown Washington hotel for more than 90 minutes on Tuesday night to search for common ground after she won the final nominating contest in their sometimes bitter primary campaign. In similarly worded statements, both camps described the meeting as positive and said the two discussed their shared goal of defeating presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. Sanders was back home in Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday to prepare his speech and consider how to keep pressuring Clinton to back issues like raising the minimum wage and fighting climate change. He also has demanded changes to the party nominating process, including replacing the Democratic National Committee leadership and eliminating superdelegates, who are unelected and are free to support any candidate. The Sanders camp has pushed for a commitment to hold votes at the convention on some of those platform issues and on changing party nominating rules. We see the convention as a serious opportunity for a serious discussion about a lot of these issues. We hope the Democratic Party establishment can figure out a way to open its arms and welcome into the party fold the people who have been excited by Bernies campaign, Briggs said.

"Clinton wins D.C. primary, has 'positive' meeting with Sanders","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton formally concluded the U.S. Democratic presidential race on Tuesday with a win in the District of Columbia primary, then turned her focus to uniting the party during a 90-minute private meeting with defeated rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton, who secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination last week, met with Sanders in a downtown Washington hotel as the sometimes bitter primary combatants searched for common ground ahead of the Nov. 8 election against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Sanders has resisted pressure to bow out and endorse Clinton in a show of party unity, choosing to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions from Clinton on his policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process. Both camps described the meeting as positive and said the two noted their shared commitment to stopping Trump and pursuing issues such as raising the minimum wage, eliminating undisclosed money in politics, making college affordable and making healthcare coverage more accessible. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said the meeting was a positive discussion about how best to bring more people into the political process and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation. Also attending were Sanders wife Jane, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the two campaign managers, Jeff Weaver for Sanders and Robby Mook for Clinton. Sanders had promised to stay in the Democratic race until the final vote was cast in the Washington, D.C., primary, although in the past week he has stopped talking about capturing the partys nomination and instead focused on ways to advance his policy goals. He scheduled a national video address to supporters on Thursday night, telling them in an email message that the political revolution continues. At a news conference before the Washington meeting, Sanders said he would also demand changes to make the Democratic nominating process more equitable, including replacing the Democratic National Committee leadership, letting independents take part in the voting and eliminating superdelegates, who are unelected and are free to support any candidate. The time is long overdue for a fundamental transformation of the Democratic Party, Sanders said. Clinton easily beat Sanders in the District of Columbia, winning 79 percent to his 21 percent in a primary that closed the more than four-month, state-by-state battle for the Democratic nomination that began on Feb. 1 in Iowa. During a visit to Capitol Hill earlier on Tuesday, Sanders told Democratic senators he would take his message of progressive values and party reform to the convention. Im open to that, I think we should all be open to that, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois told reporters afterward. Its not a surprise that the American people are skeptical of all of us in political life. And we ought to step back and reassess why, and what we can do about it. Top Democrats have taken steps in the last week to begin rallying behind Clinton and ease Sanders out of the race without alienating his supporters.  President Barack Obama endorsed Clinton on Thursday, hours after meeting with Sanders at the White House. Clinton also secured the endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leader of the partys progressive wing. Clinton already has turned her attention on the campaign trail to the race with Trump, rejecting the New York businessmans renewed calls for a ban of the entry of foreign-born Muslims into the United States after the mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, by an American man who claimed allegiance with Islamic State militants.

Senate leader McConnell says 'nobody wants terrorists to have firearms',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that nobody wants terrorists to have firearms and that he was open to suggestions from experts on legislation that could address the problem, following the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. McConnell, a Republican, made his remarks amid blistering attacks by Democrats on the lack of action in Congress on legislation to prevent suspects on watch lists from purchasing guns or explosives. While there was no firm evidence of Republicans and Democrats in either the Senate or House of Representatives moving toward a compromise, there were hints they at least might be willing to talk. Maybe we can find some middle ground. I hope so, said Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. The debate in Congress over firearms was reignited on Sunday after a gunman in Orlando, Florida, armed with an assault rifle killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and injured 53 others before he was shot to death by law enforcement officers. The assailant, New York-born Omar Mateen, had been investigated by the FBI for 10 months in 2013 and 2014 over possible connections he had to foreign militant groups. Democrats are pressuring Republicans in the Senate and House to quickly bring up legislation closing a loophole that allows those on no fly watch lists to purchase weapons in the United States. The Democrats are targeting a Justice Department appropriations bill this week, hoping to add an amendment prohibiting such gun sales. A similar effort last December failed. Theres no excuse for allowing suspected terrorists to buy guns, said Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. McConnell took a swipe at the Democrats, saying: Our suspicion is this is basically a politically motivated effort that were likely to see on the Justice Department spending bill. The Republican leader added, however: Were open - nobody wants terrorists to have firearms - were open to serious suggestions from the experts as to what we might be able to do to be helpful. On Wednesday, senators from both parties will have an opportunity to speak directly to some experts when Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson are scheduled to brief them on the Orlando attack. The officials briefed House members on Tuesday and several House Democrats brought up the watch list issue. There was some question about procedures going forward, said Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in that chamber, told reporters that law enforcement was already being notified if people being investigated for terrorism try to buy firearms. If you listen, they are being notified. Durbin said he and his colleagues might pursue other gun-related amendments as well, including tougher background checks on gun buyers, closing some gun show loopholes and possibly new limits on assault rifles like the one used in Orlando.

"Obama, Clinton scold Trump over proposed Muslim ban","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic President Barack Obama denounced Donald Trump for his proposed U.S. ban on Muslim immigrants on Tuesday, joining Hillary Clinton in portraying the Republican presidential candidate as unfit for the White House. Clearly annoyed, Obama responded to Trumps proposed suspension of immigration from countries with a history of terrorism after Sundays killing of 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub.  Obama and Clinton, the Democrat he has endorsed to succeed him in a Nov. 8 election, made nearly simultaneous speeches. The gunman was U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, whose parents immigrated from Afghanistan. Trump had criticized Obama for not using the term radical Islamic terrorism to describe Islamic State militants. What exactly would using this label accomplish, what exactly would it change? Obama replied. Someone seriously thinks we dont know who were fighting? ... Theres no magic to the phrase radical Islam. Its a political talking point. It is not a strategy. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction, said Obama, criticizing the yapping and loose talk he said he hears from Republicans. Obama, who canceled a joint campaign appearance with Clinton planned on Wednesday in Wisconsin due to the events in Orlando, appeared to be enjoying his role in the campaign to select his successor. He tangled with Trump in 2011, producing his birth certificate to refute Trumps claim that the president was not born in the United States. We now have proposals from the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States to bar all Muslims from immigrating to America. We hear language that singles out immigrants and suggests entire religious communities are complicit in violence, Obama said. Where does this stop?  On Tuesday, Trump was unrelenting in his criticism of Obama, saying in a statement that Obama claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people. When I am president, it will always be America first, said Trump. Aides said Trump, who on Monday said Obama should resign for failing to handle the threat properly, would have more to say at a rally later in Greensboro, North Carolina. The crossfire overshadowed the last Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. Clinton was to meet rival Bernie Sanders late in the day with Sanders apparently inching toward ending his candidacy. Clinton, Obamas former secretary of state, addressed supporters in Pittsburgh. The candidate said Trumps proposal bolstered her case that he was temperamentally unfit to serve as president, saying the commander in chief is a job that demands a calm, collected and dignified response to events like the Orlando massacre. Clinton said Trump seemed to suggest on Monday in a television interview that Obama might have somehow been responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, a point that Trump said he did not make. I have to ask: Will responsible Republican leaders stand up to their presumptive nominee or will they stand by his accusation about our president? she said. The biting criticism was likely to increase the discomfort among many establishment Republican leaders about Trump with little more than a month until party figures gather in Cleveland July 18-21 to formally nominate him. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican who was his partys 2012 vice presidential nominee, on Tuesday distanced himself from the proposed Muslim ban in a further sign of establishment unease with Trumps agenda. I do not think a Muslim ban is in our countrys interests, said Ryan, who last year criticized Trumps original proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Ryan and like-minded leading Republicans have struggled to reconcile their desire to unify the party before a tough fight against Clinton while at the same time separating themselves from some of the positions and rhetoric of Trump, who defeated 16 rivals to win the presidential nomination battle. U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who sources say is among the Republicans that Trump is considering for his vice presidential nominee, said he was discouraged by the way the Trump campaign was going. It wasnt the type of speech one would expect, Corker said of Trumps Monday speech in New Hampshire. Trump has been resolute in demanding tighter immigration policies, and the Orlando attack has prompted him to intensify his rhetoric as he tries to win more support from Americans with deep security fears. Trump noted that Mateens parents were born in Afghanistan. Pointing to specific incidents such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he said threats were posed by people with roots in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. Trump on Tuesday met at Trump Tower in New York with a host of Republican governors, including Oklahomas Mary Fallin, who a source close to the campaign said was also on Trumps short list to be his vice presidential running mate. A Republican official said others in the meeting included the governors of Mississippi, Arizona, Arkansas, Nebraska and Tennessee, as well as New Jerseys Chris Christie, a close Trump adviser and former presidential rival. Trump was celebrating his 70th birthday on Tuesday. Clinton is 68. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
"After Florida shooting, Trump hardens stance on Muslims","MANCHESTER, N.H./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Monday placed responsibility for a mass shooting in Florida squarely at the feet of radical Muslims, who he said were entering the country amidst a flood of refugees and trying to take over our children. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee drew on the countrys deadliest mass shooting to sharpen his vow to ban Muslim immigrants, proposing that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism. In his national security speech, Trump said it was time to tell the truth about radical Islam, the day after 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando by a gunman, likely self-radicalized, who had sworn allegiance to the rebel group Islamic State. His comments contrasted sharply to those of Hillary Clinton, the wealthy businessmans likely Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, who urged increased intelligence gathering and more airstrikes on Islamic State territory, and cautioned against demonizing American Muslims. If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans - women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people - then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now, Trump told the crowd in New Hampshire. He went on to lambaste Clintons policies, saying they would allow hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East to enter the United States without adequate security measures. There would be no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of... their children, he said. Not only their children, by the way. Theyre trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is, and we dont know whats happening. Trump said that, if elected, he would use the executive authority of the presidency to impose stronger controls on immigration to protect Americans from attacks, fine-tuning his earlier campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of foreign Muslims to shore up national security. When Im elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats, he said. He noted that the parents of the Florida gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, were born in Afghanistan. Pointing to specific incidents such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Trump said threats were posed by people with roots in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. The immigration ban, he said would last until we are in a position to properly screen these people coming into our country. Theyre pouring in, and we dont know what were doing. Trumps hard-line proposals on immigration have helped fuel his surge in popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered heavy condemnation from minority and human rights activists, and his political opponents - many of whom have called his rhetoric racist. Trump has rejected the criticism, and has said he is often misunderstood by the media and his opponents. ANTI-WOMAN, ANTI-GAY In her response to the Florida massacre, Clinton, warned against demonizing Muslim Americans and called for increased efforts to remove Islamic State propaganda from the internet, more air strikes in areas held by the group and better coordination with allies in the region.  The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very strong, and we must attack it, she said in a speech in Cleveland. She specifically criticized three U.S. allies - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait - for allowing its citizens to fund mosques and schools that train jihadists.  She also proposed stricter gun control laws, reiterating previous calls to prohibit people on terrorism watch lists from buying firearms. She pointed out that while the Federal Bureau of Investigation was aware of Mateen as a possible threat, he was still able to purchase a gun legally.  Its important that we stop the terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attacks, and that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in Orlando and San Bernardino, California, Clinton said, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd. Trump challenged Clinton to explain why she favored letting Syrian civil war refugees into the United States. He said his policies would better protect American women, gays and lesbians, Jews and Christians. Trumps support among women and gay voters lags far behind that of Clinton. Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American, said Trump.  He accused her of having ties to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays, he said in a Facebook post. Hillary must return all money from such countries! ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
Trump revokes Washington Post's campaign press credentials,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump said on Monday he will no longer issue press credentials to the Washington Post, stopping the publication from gaining access to press areas at his presidential campaign events. The Washington Post, based in the U.S. capital, is one the countrys the most influential newspapers and has one of the largest circulations.  They have no journalistic integrity and write falsely about Mr. Trump, his campaign said in a statement explaining the decision. Mr. Trump does not mind a bad story, but it has to be honest. Trumps campaign repeated criticism the candidate has made of Post owner Jeff Bezos, who also owns online retailer Amazon.com. It is unusual for a presidential campaign to refuse to issue credentials to news organizations. Credentials are needed for reporters, photographers and other staff to gain access to press seating, travel with the campaign and attend media-only events, like press conferences. Donald Trumps decision to revoke The Washington Posts press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press, the newspapers editor, Marty Baron, said in a statement. When coverage doesnt correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished. The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along  honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly. Were proud of our coverage, and were going to keep at it. A source close to the campaign said the ban could be temporary and pointed out that Trump has already barred other new organizations, including Politico, from obtaining press credentials and then reversed course. Ben Smith, executive editor of Buzzfeed, responded that his news organization, which targets millennials, is also banned from covering official Trump events. The Huffington Post posted on Twitter that its reporters are also barred. A candidate for the highest elected office in the land doesnt get to choose what goes in a newspaper, said Committee to Protect Journalist Deputy Executive Director Robert Mahoney. It provides a ready-made excuse for authoritarian leaders to crackdown further on independent journalists. We urge Donald Trump to reconsider and let the Washington Post do its job. Trumps campaign took issue with an article that appeared on The Washington Posts website earlier on Monday with the headline, Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting as their headline. The headline was changed to Donald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting within an hour after it was published. The Washington Post has assigned a team of reporters to produce a book about Trump that is scheduled to be released later this year. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
Clinton calls for U.S. ‘intelligence surge’ in wake of Orlando attack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Monday that if elected, she would pressure U.S. technology companies to help intelligence agencies disrupt violent plots after a gunman inspired by radical Islamist groups killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub. In a speech in Cleveland, she articulated plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers. She is campaigning against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of the November presidential election.  We already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out, Clinton said. Thats why Ive proposed an intelligence surge to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home. While Clinton did not detail what her effort would entail, she said she wants technology companies to be more cooperative to government requests for help in countering online propaganda, tracking patterns in social media and intercepting communications. Clintons comments will likely further stoke an international debate over digital privacy, which has flared  after attacks in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, California. Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old Orlando shooter and a U.S. citizen, was likely inspired by jihadist content online, but there is not yet evidence that he was part of any plot directed by others outside the United States, FBI Director James Comey said Monday. Facebook (FB.O), Alphabets Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) have all dedicated more resources to combating online propaganda and recruiting by Islamic militants within the past year. But they do so quietly to avoid the perception that they are overly cozy with authorities. The companies rely heavily on users to flag problematic content, which is impossible to eliminate completely without creating a highly censored Internet, according to technologists.  Counterterrorism experts have also long said so-called lone wolf attackers are difficult to track and stop because they often do not communicate their plans to others. Twitter and Facebook had no immediate response to questions about Clintons comments. Google declined comment. The Center for Democracy and Technology and Electronic Frontier Foundation, both digital advocacy groups, said they were waiting for more specifics from Clinton before commenting. Unlike Trump, Clinton did not call for blocking online content. She did not reiterate her previous push for a massive effort to break encryption, and she ruled out targeted surveillance of Muslim Americans as dangerous. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
Trump's post-Orlando message falls flat with Republican establishment,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida has allowed Donald Trump to seize upon a familiar issue he has used to great advantage -the threat of Islamist militants and his plan to limit Muslim immigration to the United States, offering him what could be a crucial moment to re-boot his sputtering presidential campaign.  But while rank-and-file voters might respond positively to Trumps renewed call for a ban on some Muslims entering the country, his reaction to the massacre showed few initial signs of winning over Republican foreign-policy figures who have spurned the New York mogul. Its a missed opportunity to present a different image, said Peter Feaver, a top National Security Council aide in the George W. Bush White House. He has doubled down on policies I oppose and that arent going to solve the problem. Trump said in a speech Monday in New Hampshire he would suspend immigration from countries where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States. He said radical Muslim immigrants were trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS (Islamic State) is. After the worst mass murder in modern U.S. history on Sunday left 50 dead, Trumps speech was hastily refashioned from a broad critique of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to a dire warning of the threat from Islamist militants. Although Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. officials have maintained that Omar Mateens motives were unclear and that he had no known direct links with the Syria-based group. Mateen, they said, was likely radicalized over the Internet. A week ago, the presumptive Republican presidential nominees bid was taking on water. He was being battered by fellow Republicans for his comments about the Hispanic heritage of a federal judge, and Clinton was pulling away in the polls. A renewed focus on national security could provide Trump with the chance to expand his appeal both to undecided voters and to the Republican foreign-policy establishment. While Trump at times seems to relish being at odds with the establishment, the unhappiness among the partys hawks isnt just a matter of hand-wringing. It means if Trump does reach the White House, he could have a difficult time recruiting talented, experienced advisers.  Max Boot, an influential conservative at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Orlando tragedy could have provided an opening for Trump to rally Republicans against terrorism. But instead, Boot said, Trump has been partisan and petty. Boot criticized Trump for suggesting on Monday that President Barack Obama may sympathize with radicalized Muslims and for reviving the proposed Muslim ban. His performance has been in character, Boot said, which is to say appalling. Trump has alarmed some mainstream Republicans with vows to shred international trade deals, his demands that Mexico pay for a border wall and his questioning of U.S. foreign policy pillars such as its security commitments to NATO and Asian allies.  Clinton struck a very different tone in a speech on Monday, urging statesmanship, not partisanship and clear, rational discussion on how to protect the United States from terrorist threats. Eliot Cohen, a top-ranking State Department official during the Bush administration, called Trumps reaction to the shootings opportunistic and shallow and not what Americans expect from a president.   Lanhee Chen, a top aide to Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential campaign, suggested Trump will not be able to refine his image. While it would be true in most cases a big speech like this could reset the decks, I think the challenge with Donald Trump is always who he is at his core, Chen said. But voters are another matter. Trumps swift rise within the Republican Party was at least partly due to the strident tone he has taken toward immigrants and refugees. When Trump responded to last years terror attacks in Paris and California with a call for banning Muslims from entering the country, he surged in the Reuters/Ipsos poll in the weeks that followed, opening up a 30-point lead over his Republican primary rivals.  Republicans continue to be strongly supportive of Trumps approach to handling terrorism. This month, two-thirds of Republicans said they agreed with Trumps proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.  Overall, 42 percent of Americans said they agreed with a Muslim ban while 50 percent said they disagreed, with another 8 percent not sure, according to another Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 17 to June 6. The poll of more than 6,000 people has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 1.5 percentage points. Combating Islamist extremism was on the mind of Texas billionaire Doug Deason, a major Republican donor who told Reuters he will meet with Trump later in the week to discuss his support.  Nothing Trump has said since the Orlando shooting has caused him to re-think backing him, Deason said.  Peter King, a U.S. congressman from New York, said his partys foreign-policy establishment will eventually have to get on board with Trump. As one of the two major candidates for president, he will have to get advice or consultation with top national-security people, King said. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
"Trump adds new twist to immigration proposals, but legal doubts persist","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps proposal for suspending immigration from parts of the world with a history of terrorism could have a legal basis, but his assertion that it be part of a broader ban on Muslim immigrants makes it constitutionally untenable, legal scholars say. The new twist in Trumps anti-Muslim rhetoric came in the aftermath of a weekend shooting massacre at a Florida nightclub by the American-born son of Afghan immigrants. In a fiery speech on Monday, he expanded on his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, vowing if elected to halt immigration from any area of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against America or its allies. He also accused the Muslim-American community of broad complicity in attacks such as the Orlando shooting, which was carried out by a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State, and threatened big consequences for those who fail to inform on their neighbors. Many legal experts said Trumps proposal for a religion-based ban would be unlikely to pass the test of U.S. constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, due process and equal protection and would likely be struck down by the courts if he tried to implement them by presidential decree. However, a ban on immigrants from certain countries has some precedent and might pass muster. Some see that new proposal as reminiscent of the congressional Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was used for years to halt the influx of Chinese laborers and has been widely considered a black mark on Americas immigration record. But Trumps overall immigration plan would go beyond that, targeting not just a country or a region of the world but also a religion, something that no modern U.S. president has done.  This is an absurd proposal to build a Fortress America and pull up the drawbridges, said John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the Bush administration. President Barack Obama took a veiled swipe at Trump on Tuesday, saying such ideas represented a dangerous mindset. But U.S. presidents have wide latitude on immigration matters, and some conservative scholars said that the fate of any proposed ban would hinge on how narrowly Trump framed it. They note, for instance, that Democratic President Jimmy Carter barred Iranian nationals from entering the United States during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. If a Trump administration cut off immigration from certain countries, rather than certain religions, it would not violate the Constitution, said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California Berkeley and former Justice Department official who advised the George W. Bush administration on interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects. Herman Schwartz, a law professor at American University in Washington, said if Trump stuck to his proposal for a temporary prohibition on Muslim immigrants, that raises significant constitutional questions and shows his shaky command of the legal facts. In Mondays speech in New Hampshire, Trump showed little sign of scaling back his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which he first laid out in December after an Islamic State-linked deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Debate over the legality of Trumps proposals was complicated by the vagueness of his pronouncement and questions on how broadly he would extend any immigration ban if elected. While legal experts say presidents have the power to ban immigrants from specific countries, the United States does not currently ban immigration from any country. Officials do give extra scrutiny to people entering from countries such Syria and Iran. Under the broadest interpretation of Trumps pronouncement,  immigration could be barred not only from the Muslim world but from U.S.-allied countries in Europe and Asia where militant attacks have taken place. This could include India, the source of many skilled engineers for the U.S. technology sector. Critics say this would be impractical and counterproductive. Is Mr. Trump proposing to stop issuing visas even for business or tourism or education to nationals of certain countries? said Bellinger. Rather than increase economic growth, Mr. Trumps plan could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars. Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump foreign policy adviser, justified the candidates pronouncement, saying it is perfectly appropriate for the country to refuse admission to those whose presence may be detrimental to the national interest. But Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, when asked whether a president has the authority to ban immigrants based on religion, said: Im not sure he does. Legal experts also raised doubts about the legality of Trumps demand that members of the American Muslim community cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad or else they will be brought to justice themselves. Critics have accused him of anti-Muslim fear-mongering to win votes. Generally, the idea that knowledge in and of itself comes with criminal liability is antithetical to the way we talk about criminal law in the United States, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor. If Trump tried to implement such prosecutions as president, he said, potential defendants could simply invoke their constitutional right against self-incrimination and continue to remain silent.

Obama to meet the Dalai Lama at White House on Wednesday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will meet the Dalai Lama at the White House on Wednesday, a move certain to anger China which considers the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader a dangerous separatist. Obama and the Dalai Lama will meet privately at 10:15 a.m. (1415 GMT), a White House statement said. Earlier on Tuesday, China warned the United States to stick by its promises not to support any separatist activities. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, the Dalai Lama had said it was possible he would meet Obama and on Tuesday Taiwan announced that its new president would make a transit stop in the United States next week. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said both issues touched on the one China policy, a basic diplomatic tenet referring to both Taiwan and Tibet being part of China that Beijing insists foreign governments recognize. Lu said the United States had said it opposed Taiwans independence and recognized that Tibet was an inseparable part of China. We demand the U.S. government earnestly stands by its promises, conscientiously handle the relevant issue in accordance with the one China principle and not give any space to any individual or behavior which tries to create two Chinas, one China one Taiwan, or to split China, he said. Obama met the Dalai Lama when the latter visited Washington in 2014 and angered China then when he vowed strong support for Tibetans human rights. The Dalai Lama says he wants genuine autonomy for Tibet rather than independence. He told Reuters Obama was a a long-time friend whom he admired for his work to normalize relations with Cuba, on Iran and for his recent visits to former U.S. foe Vietnam and the site of the Hiroshima atomic bombing in Japan.  Asked how Beijing (Peking) might respond to a meeting, the Dalai Lama said: I dont know - you should ask them. I think in Peking, we cannot as of now ... generalize. In Peking there are different views. Some people there have a more realistic view. Some are more hardline, which is more narrow-minded.  Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will transit in Miami on her way to Panama, one of the islands few diplomatic allies, and stop over in Los Angeles on her return, Taiwans deputy foreign minister, Javier Ching-shan Hou, said. China is suspicious of Tsai, who assumed office last month, as she is also head of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Travel abroad is sensitive for Taiwanese leaders who have angered China as it is seen as exerting sovereignty. Tsais trip will run from June 24 to July 2 and include Paraguay.

Ex-Michigan lawmaker to stand trial; charges dismissed against another,"(Reuters) - A Michigan judge on Tuesday dismissed charges against a former state representative, while ruling another lawmaker should stand trial after he tried to hide their extramarital affair, according to a prosecutors office spokeswoman. Ingham County District Judge Hugh Clarke ruled that former State Representative Todd Courser should stand trial for perjury  and one count of misconduct for his attempted cover-up of the affair with fellow lawmaker Cindy Gamrat, said Andrea Bitely, a spokeswoman for the Michigan attorney generals office. Prosecutors originally charged Courser with three counts of misconduct while in office and perjury, but the judge dismissed two of the misconduct charges. Clarke also dismissed the two criminal misconduct-in-office charges against Gamrat due to insufficient evidence that she knowingly lied to House investigators about an email that Courser sent to distract from their affair, Bitely said. Prosecutors will not appeal the dismissed charges against Gamrat, but they are reviewing their options regarding the charges against Courser that were not sent to trial, Bitely said.  An attorney for Courser, Matthew DePerno, maintained his client is not guilty, and said he believed there was not enough evidence to support the perjury or misconduct charge. Courser is due back in court in late June.      A lawyer for Gamrat, Mike Nichols, said the charges against his client stem from a house investigation that arose from a political dispute. The former legislators faced charges of misconduct related to Coursers failed attempt to cover up their affair. He had devised a plan to distribute an email falsely claiming he had sex with a male prostitute in a move meant to blunt the political impact of the actual affair if it was ever revealed, according to the Detroit News.  The two former lawmakers also were charged with misconduct for allowing their employees to forge their signature on proposed legislation. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Senate passes $602 billion defense authorization bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to pass a $602 billion defense authorization bill, despite President Barack Obamas threat to veto the annual policy measure over issues including a ban on closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison. The vote was 85-13, far more than the majority needed to pass the 100-member Senate. Six Republicans and seven members of the Democratic caucus voted against the bill, which authorizes military spending for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. Obama gave a long list of objections to the versions of the bill passed by the Senate and House of Representatives, including provisions making it more difficult to close the detention center at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba and the use of funds specially designated for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to allow the military to avoid mandatory spending limits. The Senates version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, now must be reconciled with the one passed by the House last month before it can be sent to Obama. The House bill also faces a veto threat. If the bill is finished before November, when every member of the House and one-third of the Senate is up for re-election, a veto could prove challenging for Democrats. Obamas party is trying to keep the White House, and hopes to regain the Senate majority it lost in 2014, if not control of the House. But Democrats perpetually battle accusations from Republicans that they are soft on defense, a fight that could be more difficult if they block the major Pentagon policy bill. Republican Senator John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said he was disappointed the bill did not include a program that would help Afghans who are in danger because they worked for American troops to move to the United States. They are the number one target for the Taliban and for ISIS (Islamic State), McCain said in the Senate after the bill passed without an amendment extending the program to provide Special Immigrant Visas for interpreters and others who worked for U.S. forces. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who had introduced the amendment, called its omission unconscionable. In a statement, she said, For many of them, this could be a death sentence. The bill would also require young women to register for the military draft, as the Department of Defense opens all of the military, including combat roles, to females. A few conservative senators voted against the measure because of that provision. The bill passed with a compromise on the use of Russian RD-180 rocket engines. Lawmakers eased a ban on their use late last year, worried that it could drive United Launch alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, out of business and leave only privately held SpaceX to transport satellites into space. An amendment from Republican Senator Cory Gardner and Democrat Bill Nelson gives the Pentagon time to develop and test a replacement for the Russian-made engines and limits their use for launches. McCain, a harsh critic of Moscow, had tried to stop the use of the RD-180 to send a message to Russias President Vladimir Putin.  The bill also bars military base closures, despite military leaders saying they have more capacity than they need. Closing bases is a thorny issue for many lawmakers, especially in an election year.

Russians steal research on Trump in hack of U.S. Democratic Party,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hackers believed to be working for the Russian government broke into the Democratic National Committees computer network, spied on internal communications and accessed research on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the committee and security experts said on Tuesday. Two separate groups entered the DNCs system, and one read email and chat communications for nearly a year before being detected, according to the committee and CrowdStrike, the cyber firm that helped clean up the breach. Russian spies also targeted the networks of Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as the computers of some Republican political action committees, the Washington Post quoted U.S. officials as saying, although details were not available. A Clinton campaign official said there was no evidence the campaigns information systems had been hacked. A Russian government spokesman denied involvement in the breach. I completely rule out a possibility that the (Russian) government or the government bodies have been involved in this, Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, told Reuters in Moscow. The intrusion is emblematic of the sophistication of Russian hackers, who intelligence officials have long viewed as the most talented of U.S. adversaries in cyberspace. The Democratic Party had been aware of efforts to hack Trump material for two months, and U.S. intelligence agencies were involved in efforts to find out who was behind the hacking, a source familiar with Trump opposition research said. The source said Democratic Party operatives believed the hacking was conducted by the Russian government. The research includes material on Trumps business efforts in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Serbia and Russia, according to information made available to Reuters.         Cyber attacks against political candidates and organizations are common worldwide. U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said last month he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the Nov. 8 presidential election nears. U.S. Representative Jim Langevin, a Democrat and co-founder of the congressional cybersecurity caucus, said it was disconcerting that independent groups penetrated the DNC and that one was able to stay embedded for nearly a year. But the groups are extremely sophisticated, Langevin said, and have previously been implicated on attacks at the White House, the State Department and the German Bundestag, as well as a number of private companies. The DNC contacted CrowdStrike in May and within 24 hours it began investigating unusual activity on the groups network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, the companys co-founder and chief technology officer. It identified two hacking groups and both were kicked out this weekend, he said. The first, which CrowdStrike named Cozy Bear, entered the DNCs systems last summer, according to the firm. It primarily monitored email and chat conversations and may be working for Russias Federal Security Service, or FSB, Alperovitch said.  Russian President Vladimir Putin once ran the FSB. The second group, nicknamed Fancy Bear, is probably working on behalf of Russias military, Alperovitch said. It gained entry in late April and went straight to the oppo research ... on Donald Trump and exfiltrated some of it, he said. Alperovitch said both groups were among the best threat actors that weve ever encountered but they did not appear to be working together. He was not sure how the intrusions occurred but suspected the hackers may have leveraged spearphishing emails to trick DNC employees into downloading malicious code onto their network. When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the DNC, said in a statement. Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network. Trumps interest in Russia goes back to the 1980s, with a 1990 Vanity Fair article citing news program appearances in which Trump offered his own services as a negotiator with Russia.  Information made available to Reuters indicates Trump tried on at least three occasions - in 2004, 2008 and 2013 - to get involved in business deals in Russia. In 2013, he and an Azerbaijani-Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, jointly put on a Miss Universe competition in Moscow, and Trump was photographed with Agalarovs wife, son and daughter. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obamas campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes. U.S. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to Chinese hackers. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Former allies of NJ's Christie fail to dismiss Bridgegate indictment,"(Reuters) - A federal judge refused to dismiss a criminal indictment against two former allies of New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie over their alleged roles in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal, known as Bridgegate. In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton, in Newark, New Jersey, rejected arguments by William Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly that the laws under which they were charged were too vague and that they had no reason to know some of their activities might have been illegal. Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, and Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were charged with wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy for allegedly arranging the September 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The closure led to several days of gridlock affecting the bridge, the worlds busiest, which spans the Hudson River to connect New Jersey to Manhattan. Prosecutors said it was intended to punish Fort Lees Democratic mayor for not endorsing Christies successful reelection bid. In her 23-page decision, Wigenton said reasonable public officials would understand that wrongdoing attributed to the defendants would violate drivers right to travel. Political payback is not a significant government interest, she wrote. Wigenton also said it was for jurors to decide whether to hold the defendants criminally responsible for their alleged dealings with former Port Authority executive David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and is cooperating with prosecutors. Michael Baldassare and Michael Critchley, lawyers who represent Baroni and Kelly respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A trial is scheduled for Sept. 12, court records show. Christie has not been charged and has denied involvement in wrongdoing, but the scandal hurt his popularity within New Jersey and weighed on his unsuccessful 2016 presidential run.  Both defendants are also seeking records from Christies cellphone through subpoenas to a law firm that previously generated a taxpayer-funded report absolving the governor of wrongdoing. Critics of Christie have called that report biased. Separately, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia is weighing requests by media to publicly release a list of unindicted co-conspirators. Oral arguments were heard on June 6. The case is U.S. v. Baroni et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 15-cr-00193.     ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Kerry launches talks with Venezuela but backs disputed referendum,"SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced high-level talks to ease tensions with Venezuelas socialist government on Tuesday, just hours after he backed calls for a referendum that could force President Nicolas Maduro from office.   Kerry said the talks would start immediately in Caracas and be led by Thomas Shannon, a veteran of U.S. diplomacy in the region. Attempts last year at dialogue between the ideological foes were stalled by Venezuelas deepening crisis. The two countries have been embroiled in diplomatic hostilities since the administrations of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and U.S. President George W. Bush. Kerry said the goal was to go beyond the old rhetoric. Ive committed to see if this can work so lets see if we can improve the relationship, he told reporters, after huddling with his Venezuelan counterpart on the sidelines of an Organization of American States (OAS) meeting in the Dominican Republic. The talks would also be aimed at fostering dialogue between Venezuelas government and opposition, Kerry said. Maduro welcomed the proposed talks and repeated his suggestion that the two sides restore ambassadors in each others capitals after an eight-year hiatus that began when Chavez expelled the U.S. envoy to Venezuela. I propose to John Kerry lets designate ambassadors, I am ready. They have ambassadors in Beijing, Vietnam and Havana, and they dont have one in Caracas, he said in a speech to teachers. Maduro proposed an ambassador in 2014 but U.S. President Barack Obama has not yet accepted his credentials. Once one of Latin Americas most prosperous nations, Venezuela has plunged into unrest and a harsh economic slowdown. Long lines for food and medicines have led to protests and opposition calls for a recall referendum to remove Maduro.     That measure is allowed under the constitution, a point made by Kerry to reporters after he met Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez.  Earlier in the day, in a speech to OAS delegates, Kerry gave his backing to the referendum push and called on Chavezs political heirs to release political prisoners and respect fundamental rights.      His comments to the 34 members of the main diplomatic body of the Americas marked the strongest show of support yet from the United States for the disputed referendum process. Venezuelas opposition accuses the election council of stalling the recall at the behest of Maduro by arbitrarily changing criteria for requesting a recall vote. Maduro has said any recall against him would be in 2017 at the earliest, pushing back against opposition pressure. Several opposition politicians are in jail, notably hardline leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has a 14-year sentence for inciting 2014 anti-government protests that spiraled into violence killing more than 40 people. The government denies it holds political prisoners. Kerrys comments drew a furious response from Rodriguez, who accused Washington and OAS chief Luis Almagro of international bullying.   Every day we have evidence of the secretary generals bias in favor of sectors of the opposition who are seeking a coup in Venezuela, she said.  I see now this is ordered by Washington. I know they are on Washingtons payroll to meddle in the domestic affairs of Venezuela, she said, speaking through a translator.  Kerry was more conciliatory after his first ever bilateral meeting with Rodriguez, saying the United States did not support a push by Almagro to suspend Venezuela from the OAS for alleged violations of the regional groups democratic charter. The United States is not taking that position, we are not pushing for a suspension. I dont think that would be constructive, he said. At Almagros behest, the OAS will hold a meeting later this month to initiate the process that could end in Venezuelas suspension. But the former Uruguayan foreign minister appears isolated in the group, with even right-wing governments opposed to Maduro in the region balking at throwing Venezuela out. Venezuela and the United States have repeatedly gone through periods of diplomatic fighting followed by generally short-lived eras of reconciliation.  Following Washingtons 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, Shannon met with a top Venezuelan Socialist Party official to improve ties with Caracas. The good mood soured within months when the United States criticized the sentence handed to opposition leader Lopez. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Senators introduce bill aimed at getting generic drugs to market,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four U.S. senators - two Democrats and two Republicans - introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at preventing big pharmaceutical companies from using safety rules to prevent generic drugs from coming to market. Senators Charles Grassley, chair of the Judiciary Committee, and Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat, are sponsors of the bill along with Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chair of the antitrust subcommittee and top Democrat, respectively. The Food and Drug Administration, which ensures the safety of the countrys food and drug supply, has a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, called REMS, which is designed to ensure that the riskiest drugs are dispensed safely. But there have been complaints that the program has been misused by brand-name drug companies to prevent generic manufacturers from getting the drug samples needed to market cheaper versions. Generic companies also complain their drugs are not allowed to share a safety protocol, making it difficult to come to market. The bill would allow a generic manufacturer who faces either of these situations to file a lawsuit to force access to a sample or force negotiations for a safety protocol. Balancing the cost of developing lifesaving medications with the need to make available affordable prescription drugs to consumers has always been a difficult task.Its a consistent topic at my town meetings, Grassley said in a statement. Unfortunately, were seeing some brand-name drug companies engage in anti-competitive tactics that delay entry of lower cost generic drugs into the market.This bill takes important steps to ensure that our laws are not frustrated. There is a similar bill in the House of Representatives which addresses the same issue but uses a different strategy. For example, it requires the generic company seeking a REMS drug to get FDA authorization to obtain the sample. In one of the REMS disputes which is public, Mylan Pharmaceuticals filed a lawsuit in 2014 against Celgene Corp, accusing it of using REMS to prevent generic copies of Thalomid and Revlimid to market. The Senate Judiciary Committees antitrust panel will hold a hearing on its bill on June 21. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, which counts major drugmakers among its members, said it had no immediate comment. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association was pleased to see the bill introduced. It is worth noting and recognizing recent efforts by representatives in the branded industry to highlight the valuable role generic medicines play in driving healthcare system savings, said Chip Davis, GPhAs president. Continued use of these anticompetitive practices by certain manufacturers drives the exact opposite outcome. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Trump gains slightly on Clinton after Florida attack: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons lead over Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race has narrowed since late last week, according to the results of the first Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted since the Orlando shooting rampage on Sunday. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has blamed Democratic policies for the worst mass shooting in U.S. history and doubled-down on his pledge to ban Muslim immigration, while Clinton has warned against demonizing Muslim-Americans. The poll, conducted from Friday to Tuesday, showed Clinton with an 11.6-point lead - 44.6 percent to 33.0 percent - over Trump, down from the 13-point lead she had in the five days that ended Saturday. The Florida attack, in which a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub and wounded 53 could have a lingering impact on the presidential race, mixing concerns about immigration, gun violence and religious tolerance into what has already been a volatile and sharply negative campaign.  The shooter, Omar Mateen, 29, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrant parents, called authorities during the massacre to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State militant group. Federal investigators have said Mateen, who was killed by police, was likely self-radicalized and there was no evidence he received any instruction or aid from outside groups such as Islamic State.  Trump seized on the attack to accuse Democratic President Barack Obama of failing to address radical Islamic terrorism, to warn that Clintons policies on immigration would allow more potential attackers into the country, and to fine-tune his call for a suspension of Muslim immigration. In a speech on Monday, Trump said he would suspend immigration from countries with a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe and allied countries until we fully understand how to end these threats. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee,  said Trumps response to the attack was disturbing. Prejudice, paranoia and partisanship are not a plan, and will not protect anyone, Clinton said in a statement.     She re-emphasized her support for coordinated military action in Syria and Iraq and called for tougher controls on firearms sales. Clintons slip in the polling was not all Trumps gain.  The proportion of voters who said they would not vote for either candidate has risen steadily over the past week. About 22.4 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate, according to the five-day average of results on Tuesday. That was up from 20.6 percent a week ago. Trumps strident tone on Muslims and national security appears to have helped him in the past, at least with Republicans. He surged in opinion polls among Republicans late last year after attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. According to Reuters/Ipsos polls over the past several months, a majority of Republican voters said he was their partys best choice to deal with terrorism and trusted him more than his Republican rivals to be commander in chief. Most Republicans also support Trumps proposed ban on Muslim immigration, while a majority of Americans oppose it. The online poll included 1,063 likely voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 3.5 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
House votes to protect 'dark money' political donors,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to protect the identities of wealthy individuals and others who make anonymous, or dark money, donations to politically active nonprofit groups. The measure, which drew lobbying support from billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, was approved in a 240-180 vote along party lines. It would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from collecting the names and addresses of donors who contribute $5,000 or more to 501(c) organizations, a name that refers to the tax code section that covers them. The action sent the bill on to the Senate. Although the measure would apply to all 501(c) tax-exempt groups, such as universities, hospitals and charities, politically active nonprofits are the intended beneficiaries. Republicans said the legislation would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from targeting conservative groups following 2013 revelations that Tea Party organizations were subjected to extra scrutiny. Political spending by nonprofit groups including the Koch- aligned Americans for Prosperity has grown dramatically since 2010, when the Supreme Court opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups in its landmark Citizens United ruling.  The White House on Monday said it opposed the bill, the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, claiming it would constrain the IRS from enforcing tax laws and reduce transparency among private foundations. Democrats argued that the legislation could make it easier for foreign entities to finance political campaigns inside the United States.  Charity regulators have also warned that the loss of donor information would make it harder to protect the public against charity fraud. The change would reduce available information on a range of organizations, IRS data shows. Republicans said the bill is necessary to protect donors from potential leaks that could subject them to harassment. Donor identities are not supposed to be released to the public, hence the term dark money.  But leaks have occurred, including the 2012 release of donors to the conservative National Organization for Marriage that resulted in a settlement requiring the IRS to pay the organization $50,000. Supporters of the legislation also pointed to signs that the IRS may seek to end the disclosure requirement on its own.     Nonprofit groups could spend more than $500 million on this years presidential and congressional elections, up from $10 million in 2008, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. House Republicans are also pushing to censure and impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for allegedly failing to cooperate with a probe of the IRS scandal.   ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Justice Department should analyze Dow-DuPont deal: senator,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday urged federal antitrust officials to conduct a careful analysis of Dow Chemical Cos proposed $130 billion merger with DuPont, adding pressure on officials to scrutinize how rapid consolidation in agriculture will affect farmers and consumers. U.S. Senator Charles Grassley called for the review in a letter to the U.S. Department of Justices antitrust division. The Iowa Republican said he was concerned the planned tie-up will decrease competition in the farming sector following a flood of mergers and acquisitions in recent years. He also said he was worried the deal could raise barriers to entry for smaller companies, hurt innovation and raise prices for products. Grassleys request for a federal review increases attention on risks of consolidation as more large agribusiness deals are in the offing. Bayer AG is pursuing a $62 billion acquisition of Monsanto Co, the worlds top seed maker, while Chinese state-owned China National Chemical Corp [CNNCC.UL], or ChemChina, plans to buy Swiss crop chemicals company Syngenta AG for $43 billion. A global downturn in grain prices and a strong dollar have reduced U.S. farm income and prompted farmers to cut spending. That has eaten into sales of the big six agrochemical and seed companies that are now looking to bolster profits through mergers and partnerships. Dow expects the regulatory review of its proposed merger with DuPont will be a thorough process, a company spokeswoman said. The deal is pro-competitive and good for farmers and consumers, she said. Dow has previously said it expects the deal to close in the second half of 2016. DuPont had no immediate comment. The Justice Department declined to comment. In March, Grassley, who also serves on the agriculture committee, joined other senators asking for the U.S. government panel that reviews foreign acquisitions to assess the impact of ChemChinas planned acquisition of Syngenta on domestic food security . The U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to join the review panel, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, a move that subjects the deal to additional government scrutiny. Last month, Monsanto turned down Bayers acquisition attempt as incomplete and financially inadequate but said it was open to further negotiations. Monsanto said the initial offer did not adequately address potential regulatory execution risks related to the acquisition. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Detroit eyes refunding of up to $660 million bonds,"(Reuters) - Detroit would sell its first general obligation bonds since exiting bankruptcy in December 2014 under a proposal by Mayor Mike Duggans administration to refund up to $660 million of outstanding bonds. The city council on Tuesday sent the plan to refund up to $275 million of unlimited tax GO bonds sold in 2014 and up to $385 million of limited tax GO bonds sold in 2010 and 2012 to its Budget, Finance and Audit Committee for consideration.  The outstanding bonds were issued through the Michigan Finance Authority and backed by the citys share of distributable state aid payments. John Naglick, Detroits finance director, said Detroit expects to capture lower interest rates in the bond refundings to save money for the budget and to lower property tax rates supporting the bonds.  If it wasnt for this move to record low rates, we wouldnt do this, he said. Ten and 30-year yields on Municipal Market Datas benchmark triple-A scale are at or near all-time lows, driven by big investor demand for debt sold by states, cities, schools and other municipal issuers. Detroit was able to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations in the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy. In its first post-bankruptcy public debt offering last August, the city restructured $245 million of variable-rate revenue bonds backed by city income taxes into a fixed-rate mode at a hefty spread over MMDs scale. If the GO bond refundings are approved by the city council committee on Wednesday, the measures would head for a full-council vote on June 21. Naglick said the issuance also needs approval from the Detroit Financial Review Commission, the citys post-bankruptcy oversight board, which meets on June 27.    ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1

Senate to debate Puerto Rico debt bill: McConnell,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate this month will debate legislation that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives and aims to give Puerto Rico some relief from its $70 billion debt, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday. McConnells announcement came after some House members briefed fellow Republicans in the Senate on the content of the legislation, which would establish a federal oversight board to restructure Puerto Rican debt. Backers of the House-passed bill are hoping the Senate signs off on the legislation before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline on a $1.9 billion debt payment. Representative Rob Bishop, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, which steered the legislation through that chamber, told reporters that Republican senators peppered him with questions about the makeup of the oversight board and its powers. He added that he assured senators the bill is not a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico and that it would not have an impact on U.S. states. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and some critics of the bill have expressed concerns that a control board appointed by Washington might not have the Caribbean islands best interests in mind. The legislation also got a boost, albeit a tepid one, on Tuesday when Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch offered qualified support for the House bill. He added that he was considering offering changes to the bill but did not elaborate. Hatchs Finance Committee has oversight of the Puerto Rico debt legislation. Some Senate Democrats also have expressed reservations with the bill and indicated that they could seek amendments, but it was not clear if they actually would. Any changes made by the Senate to the House-passed bill would send it back to the House to accept, reject or make further amendments. Bishop left open the possibility of July 1 arriving with Congress still working on the Puerto Rico bill. Its not the end of the world, Bishop said of the possibility of Congress putting finishing touches on legislation into July. Market forces, as long as they realize were moving forward to a solution and were close to it, I think that would mitigate against anything that would be negative that would impact the entire market, Bishop added. The Obama administration has voiced its support for the House bill, which passed on a strong, bipartisan vote of 297-127. Puerto Rico, which suffers from a poverty rate of around 45 percent, has been hobbled by its worsening debt problems, with some schools and medical facilities closing and island residents fleeing to the mainland United States where many find jobs, primarily in central Florida.

Orlando killer expressed support for multiple Islamist groups,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Orlando nightclub killer Omar Mateen had expressed sympathy for a variety of Islamist extremists, including groups in the Middle East that are sworn enemies, the FBI said on Monday, as a picture began to emerge of the angry, violent man who carried out Americas deadliest mass shooting. U.S. authorities said they had found no direct links between Islamic State and Mateen, the U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrants who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando on Sunday.        Mateen, 29, was shot dead by police who stormed the Pulse club with armored cars after a three-hour siege. In 911 calls during his rampage, the killer expressed allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.     But Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey  said Mateen had made comments favorable to multiple armed Islamist movements and people, which adds a little bit to the confusion about his motives. President Barack Obama said Mateen was likely a homegrown extremist.  So far, we see no indication that this was a plot directed from outside the United States and we see no indication that he was part of any kind of network, Comey told reporters in Washington. Were highly confident this killer was radicalized at least in some part through the internet.     Islamic State, which controls territory in Iraq and Syria, reiterated on Monday a claim of responsibility, although it offered no signs to indicate coordination with the gunman.         In calls to authorities on Sunday, Mateen also mentioned support for the Boston Marathon bombers and a Florida man who became a Nusra Front suicide bomber in Syria, Comey said. Nusra is an al Qaeda offshoot which is at odds with Islamic State in Syrias civil war.         Co-workers reported Mateen to the FBI in 2013 after he had made inflammatory and contradictory statements, including a claim that he had family connections to al Qaeda and membership of Shiite militant group Hezbollah, a bitter rival. The FBIs Miami office investigated Mateen for 10 months and interviewed him twice but found no evidence of a crime or connection with a militant group. Comey said the FBI was also working to understand what role anti-gay bigotry may have played in the attack.  The massacre reverberated on the presidential campaign trail, where Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, the two likely opponents in the Nov. 8 election, clashed over how to confront violent Islamist extremists.     Trump proposed suspending immigration to the United States from countries with a history of terrorism against America, Europe or U.S. allies, while Clinton warned against demonizing Muslims and called for tougher gun safety measures. Obama is to visit Orlando on Thursday to pay respects to families of the victims. The Orlando killings followed the massacre of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, last year and raised the question of whether the United States will have to confront jihadist attacks in the homeland for years to come.  Comey said tracking apparent lone wolf attackers like Mateen was like finding needles in a nationwide haystack while also trying to work out what kind of people could become radicalized. The Florida shooting spree began early on Sunday when the club was packed with some 350 revelers at a Latin music night. Many fled as the gunman raked the crowd with bullets from an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle and a pistol. An initial wave of officers charged into the club and trapped Mateen in a bathroom, Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. That allowed many patrons to flee, although others were trapped in the restroom with Mateen, leading to a standoff. Police negotiated with Mateen for about three hours before breaking a hole in the wall, which allowed hostages to escape. Mateen also emerged from the hole and was shot dead by officers, police said. Some 53 people were wounded and 29 remain hospitalized at Orlando Regional Medical Center. Michael Cheatham, chief trauma surgeon at the hospital, told Fox News he expects all of the survivors in the hospital to survive.  Amanda Alvears last Snapchat video post began with a shot of her on the dance floor of the nightclub surrounded by friends. It ended with gunshots ringing out over the music. Alvear, 25, was identified by police as one of those killed at Pulse. Her friend Mercedez Flores, 26, who worked for Target,  was also on the list. Another victim was Edward Sotomayor, 34, a marketing manager at a Florida-based gay-themed travel company. He was a legend in the industry, his boss, Al Ferguson, said.  Pastor Deyni Ventura visited a survivor in the hospital, whom she identified only as Norman, who had taken refuge in a handicapped bathroom stall crammed with 30 people. Norman could hear the shooter laughing loudly as he sprayed gunfire over and under the bathroom stall. They couldnt see the shooter but they could hear him laughing, Ventura said, intimating a loud cackling laugh. Norman, who was shot four times, crawled over the bodies of his friends to safety. Everyone else in the stall died, Ventura said. Most of the people fatally shot were Latino, more than half of them of Puerto Rican origin and at least three of them Mexican citizens. Hundreds of people attended a vigil on Monday night for the dead in downtown Orlando.         Law enforcement officials searched for clues as to whether anyone had worked with Mateen on the attack, said Lee Bentley, the U.S. attorney for the middle district of Florida. But officials said they believed there had been no other attackers and had no evidence of a threat to the public. Mateens ex-wife, Sitora Yusifiy, described him as mentally unstable and violent toward her. He would get mad out of nowhere. Thats when I started worrying about my safety and then after a few months he started abusing me physically very often, she told reporters. The couple split in 2009 after four months of marriage.     When Mateen met with his father the day before the killing, he betrayed nothing of the rage that would soon erupt. I didnt notice anything wrong, Seddique Mateen said in an interview. He was very slick. In the close-knit Muslim community of about 100 families in Fort Pierce, Florida, Mateen was known as quiet with few friends. He wasnt a people person. He was not extremely friendly but he wasnt rude either, said Mohammed Jameel, 54, who worshipped at his mosque.     Mateen was an armed guard at a gated retirement community, and had worked for the global security firm G4S (GFS.L) for nine years..          He told the FBI during its investigation of him that he had made pro-Islamist remarks because he was angry at co-workers who he felt were discriminating against him and teasing him for being a Muslim, Comey said.

Cleveland sued over speech rights outside Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Three groups planning to demonstrate at the Republican National Convention in July sued the city of Cleveland on Tuesday, seeking immediate changes to security measures due to their unacceptable restrictions on free speech. Presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to officially become the Republican Partys candidate for president at the July 18-21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside. Trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations, some of which have resulted in clashes between the candidates supporters and opponents. Led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the three groups filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, naming the city of Cleveland and Mayor Frank Jackson as defendants. Dan Williams, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a phone call he had not seen the lawsuit and that the city does not comment on ongoing litigation. He said the city and the ACLU have discussed protester rights and regulations in meetings.     The plaintiffs are Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the businessmans campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization. The lawsuit contends that Cleveland has imposed an unnecessarily large restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) in the city center where free speech and mobility will be limited. The limitations apply far beyond the part of the city where the convention activities will take place. ... These regulations severely limit the opportunities for members of the public to exercise their expressive rights during the convention, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks to reduce the size and regulations of the restricted an area and asks the court to immediately address the citys rules for issuing protest permits and what the ACLU called persistent delays in approving those permits.  Many of these applications have been pending for months - some as long as four months. The citys continuing refusal to approve or deny these applications leaves the organizers of these activities in limbo, the lawsuit said. Protesters need adequate time to make travel arrangements and rent needed materials such as portable toilets and sound stage equipment, the ACLU has said. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1
Trump to meet with House Republicans on July 7,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump will speak with House of Representatives Republicans on July 7 in what would be the first meeting of the partys presumptive presidential nominee with its entire House caucus, Republican aides said on Tuesday. House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers announced plans for the meeting in a closed-door gathering of House Republicans on Tuesday, the aides said. Some House Republicans have publicly criticized Trumps inflammatory comments about Muslims, immigrants and women, saying they risked the partys chances of winning the Nov. 8 election. Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed the real estate mogul, this month denounced the candidates criticism of a Mexican-American judge as textbook racism. On Tuesday, Ryan said banning Muslims from entering the United States is not in the nations interest, in contrast to Trumps call to limit Muslim immigration. At the meeting with Trump, members will have a chance to share their policy priorities, learn about his plans to unite the party; and get details about his plans to move America forward, McMorris Rodgers said, according to an aide. During his previous visits to Washington, Trump has met with House Republican leaders and a number of lawmakers who support him but not with all members of the caucus. A Senate Republican aide said there were no schedules yet for Trump to meet with Republican senators. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1

Gunman in U.S. massacre described as 'quiet' but grew hateful,"FORT PIERCE, Fla. (Reuters) - The photo from Omar Mateens high school yearbook is hardly remarkable - a toothy, dimpled smile with a peach-fuzz mustache below a mop of black hair.  His transformation from high school football player to perpetrator of Americas worst mass shooting raises questions about whether red flags were missed over the depth of his apparent sympathies with Muslim extremists. As families of the victims grieved and the nation recoiled at the scale of yet another mass shooting, a picture began to emerge of the 29-year-old killer as a quiet, devout person who in recent years displayed a hateful and violent streak. Early on Sunday, he stormed a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, with a handgun and AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, fatally shooting 50 people before police killed him. Fifty-three others were wounded, many critically. His ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, described him as bipolar, and emotionally disturbed with a violent temper. She said she had been beaten and otherwise physically abused by Mateen during outbursts in which he would express hatred towards everything. She was rescued by family members just four months into a stormy marriage that began in 2009 and ended in divorce, she said. He would often get into fights with his parents, but as I was the only one in his life most of the violence was directed towards me, she told reporters in Boulder, Colorado outside a home where she was staying.  She said he aspired to be a police officer and had worked as a correctional officer at a detention center for juvenile delinquents in Fort Pierce, Florida, and had once sought admission to a police academy. In Fort Pierce on Floridas southeast coast, 120 miles (195 km) from the shooting, the imam at the mosque that Mateen attended for nearly 10 years described him as a regular worshipper who was quiet and rarely interacted with the congregation. He hardly had any friends, Syed Shafeeq Rahman, who heads the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, told Reuters. He would come with his little son at night to pray and after he would leave. Rahman said Mateen never approached him regarding any concerns about homosexuals. He usually prayed at the mosque a few times a week, mostly in evenings and as recently as Friday, but he didnt display signs of radicalism, according to fellow worshippers interviewed by Reuters. Mateen was born in New York of Afghan descent but spent most of his life in Florida, attending Martin County High School in Stuart, a small city about a 20-minute drive from the Fort Pierce condominium where had most recently lived. A classmate described him as a typical teen who played football. A school yearbook image of Mateen was seen by Reuters.   Samuel King, who was one year ahead of Mateen, said the two often spoke after Mateen graduated in 2004. King waited tables at Ruby Tuesdays restaurant at Treasure Coast Square, a mall where Mateen worked at GNC, the nutrition store, he said. King, who is openly gay, said the Mateen he knew until 2009 did not appear to be anti-homosexual. What is shocking to me is that the majority of the staff at Ruby Tuesdays when I worked there were gay. He clearly was not anti-(gay) at least not back then. He did not show any hatred to any of us. While at GNC, Mateen lifted weights and got really buff, King said, describing Mateen as gregarious and talkative in the immediate years after high school. Something must have changed since he last saw him, he added. Mateens father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News the massacre was not related toreligion. He said his son turned angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago.  The FBI twice interviewed Mateen for having suspected ties to Islamist militants. The first investigation took place in 2013 when Mateen made inflammatory comments to co-workers that indicated sympathy for militants, FBI special agent in charge Ron Hopper told a news conference in Orlando. At the time, Mateen worked as a security guard at G4S, a British-owned multinational company that is among the worlds largest private security firms.  He joined G4S in September 2007, carried a gun as part of his duties and was employed with the company at the time of the shooting as an armed security officer, the company said.  G4S provides security to federal buildings in Florida. Mateen was investigated and interviewed twice but the FBI was unable to verify the substance of his comments, Hopper said. Daniel Kime, a security guard employed along with Mateen by at G4S in the Fort Pierce area, said he met Mateen briefly three or four times. Every time I saw him he never smiled. If you said good morning, hed just walk right by you, like he had a chip on his shoulder, Kime told Reuters. Daniel Gilroy, who said he was a co-worker of Mateens at G4S, said that Mateens anger was constant. Any time a female or a black person would come by he would use horrible words, he told Fox News.  In 2014, Hopper said, Mateen was investigated and interviewed again, this time for suspected connections to Moner MohammadAbu-Salha, an American citizen who became a suicide bomber in Syria in 2014. Hopper said Mateens contact with Abu-Salha was minimal and it was deemed that he did not constitute a substantive threat at that time. Hopper said Mateen was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of Sundays attack. He said Mateen called during the massacre to pledge allegiance to Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which in recent years declared a caliphate over large swathes of Iraq and Syria. But the depth of that commitment is unclear. Mateen also mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers during the call, which he made 20 minutes into the shootings, authorities said. Mateens former wife said she met Mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida to marry him, according to the Washington Post. He was not a stable person, she said. He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasnt finished or something like that. Mateen had a Florida firearms license that expired in 2013 and a state permit to work as a security guard, according to public records. He was registered as a Democrat. City, state and federal officials were searching Mateens apartment in the Woodlands condominium building in Fort Pierce and had told other residents to evacuate.

Trump calls for increased military response after Orlando shooting,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Monday said the United States needs to increase its military response against Islamic State in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting over the weekend, including additional bombings.

"Trump, on CNN, faults Muslim community for not reporting people like Orlando shooter","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump faulted the Muslim community on Monday for not reporting people like the man who carried out the Orlando gay nightclub attack, killing 49 people and wounding 53 others. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, told CNN he thought Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen was known to people in the Muslim community as someone with a potential for violence. You will find that many people that knew him felt that he was a whack job ... (that) something like this would have happened, Trump told CNN in a phone interview. People that knew him, the ex-wife, other people. They dont report them. For some reason the Muslim community does not report people like this.  Trump said the United States needed better intelligence-gathering to prevent such things from happening. We have to look at the mosques ... and we have to look at the community, he said. And believe me, the community knows the people that have the potential to blow up. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
"Democrats link guns to terrorism, turn to gun control after Orlando","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama lamented the ease with which extremists can get firearms in the United States as crazy and Hillary Clinton said terrorists were using assault weapons to kill Americans, as Democrats on Monday renewed an uphill push for gun control after the Orlando massacre. The worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, in which 49 people at a gay nightclub were killed and 53 wounded, reignited a debate in Washington over what types of guns should not be easily available and what types of buyers ought to be prohibited. The No. 3 Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, and other Democrats said they would try as early as this week to get votes on a measure preventing people on terror watch lists and other suspected terrorists from buying firearms or explosives. Senate Democrats are trying to resurrect a proposal that failed to win backing in December, after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by Islamic State-inspired militants. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, asked by a reporter whether he expected Republicans to oppose the legislation again, said: Except (Senator Mark) Kirk ... one out of 54 I guess is better than nothing. Kirk was the lone Republican who voted last December with Democrats.        FBI Director James Comey said the gunman in the Florida attack, New York-born Omar Mateen, had been on a terrorism watch list while he was under FBI investigation for about a year ending in May 2014, but he was taken off when investigators found no incriminating information. The weapons Mateen brought into the packed Orlando club were purchased earlier this month. Speaking to reporters one day after the mass shooting, Obama said the United States was going to have to make sure that we think about the risks we are willing to take by being so lax in how we make very powerful firearms available to people in this country. Thefact that we make it this challenging for law enforcement ... is crazy, the Democratic president said. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, weighed in during a campaign rally in Cleveland.  If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldnt be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked, she said to applause. In a MSNBC interview earlier, she said: Now that were seeing terrorists use these assault weapons, that has to be part of the debate. Rapid-firing assault weapons were used by gunmen in shootings over the past year in Orlando, Florida, San Bernardino, California, and Garland, Texas. Efforts in Congress to curb weapons proliferation have gained some steam following past mass shootings, only to die amid opposition from the National Rifle Association gun lobby. An NRA spokesman did not immediately comment on Monday on the renewed calls for gun curbs. The December 2013 killings of 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school prompted a push for expanded background checks on gun sellers and banning assault weapons. The initiative collapsed in April 2014, when the legislation failed to get enough votes in the U.S. Senate to clear a procedural hurdle. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump used Sundays shooting as an example of why Americans needed guns, and charged that Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election, wanted to leave only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. Trump declared in a speech in Manchester, New Hampshire, that he would be meeting with the NRA, which has endorsed him, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. Mateen, who was shot and killed by police who stormed the club, had been investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for saying he supported two Islamist groups, a statement he later said he made only to disturb his co-workers. He was questioned again in July 2014 for his connection to an American suicide bomber for al-Nusra, an al Qaeda offshoot, but the inquiry was dropped after the FBI found only a casual relationship between the two men.  U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said additional gun curbs would restrict Americans freedoms without necessarily preventing attacks.  He didnt commit this terrorist act for a couple years, after being taken off the watch list, Johnson said on CNN. The enormous challenge we have, the vexing problem is, what do you do with the not-guilty-yet? ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers disrupt Orlando 'moment of silence' over gun policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives erupted in shouting on Monday as lawmakers held a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Orlando mass shooting as Democrats protested the Republican-led chambers refusal to consider tighter gun regulations. After Speaker Paul Ryan, the Houses Republican leader, called for the moment of silence, Representative James Clyburn asked for recognition to ask about guns. Clyburn, the number three House Democrat, is from South Carolina, where a gunman killed nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church a year ago on Friday. Ryan ruled Clyburn out of order, and the chamber erupted with shouts of No Leadership, and chants of Wheres the bill? Wheres the bill? Wheres the bill? from Democrats. Several Democrats had said they would not participate in a moment of silence to mark the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, in which a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando. They said they were frustrated that Congress does not respond to mass shootings with more than symbolic gestures. ",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1

Ex-California lawmaker to plead guilty in corruption case: prosecutors,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A former California state senator accused of taking cash bribes and gifts from a businessman and from undercover FBI agents posing as Hollywood filmmakers to steer legislation in their favor has agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud, federal prosecutors said on Monday. Ronald Calderon, 58, a Democrat indicted in February 2014 on two dozen counts of bribery, fraud, money laundering and other charges, will enter his guilty plea this week, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorneys Office in Los Angeles said. According to the plea agreement, prosecutors have agreed not to ask for a sentence of more than 70 months, although the statutory maximum for the charge is 20 years. Calderons attorney, Mark Geragos, could not be reached for comment.  The former lawmakers brother, former state Assemblyman Thomas Calderon, pleaded guilty last week to a federal money-laundering charge in connection with the case. The Calderon brothers were members of a political dynasty going back several decades in California before they were ensnared in the federal investigation. The Calderons have acknowledged their roles in a bribery scheme in which money for them and their families alone was driving legislation that would have benefited only a few individuals, U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said.  The 2014 indictment accused Ronald Calderon of taking bribes from California hospital owner Michael Drobot to preserve a legislative loophole that allowed Drobot to defraud the states healthcare system out of hundreds of millions of dollars. According to the plea agreement, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Monday, Drobot hired Calderons son while he was in college, paying him some $30,000 for three summers of work. Drobot has agreed to plead guilty to separate federal charges and is cooperating in the case, prosecutors have said. Calderon was also charged with accepting money from undercover FBI agents, who he thought worked for an independent Hollywood movie studio, in exchange for supporting an expansion of film tax credits in California. According to the plea agreement, Calderon had the undercover agent hire his daughter for $3,000 a month, make a $5,000 payment toward his sons  tuition, pay for $12,000 in Las Vegas trips and give $25,000 to a nonprofit group the lawmaker and his brother used to pay themselves. In exchange, Calderon agreed to vote for the film tax legislation and hire the undercover agents purported girlfriend for his staff, according to the plea agreement.

House panel to consider measure censuring IRS chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-controlled oversight committee in the U.S. House of Representatives announced on Monday that it will consider a measure censuring the head of the Internal Revenue Service on allegations related to scrutiny of conservative groups. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who is already facing a Republican-led impeachment effort, would be condemned for conduct inconsistent with trust and confidence under a measure due to come before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday. Republicans, including the committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, allege that Koskinen failed to comply with a House subpoena as lawmakers sought evidence that the agency targeted Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny. IRS actions came to light in early 2013, months before Koskinen arrived at the agency.  IRS officials had no immediate comment. Koskinen has denied any wrongdoing. Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the oversight committees top Democrat, accused Republicans of leap-frogging over the House Judiciary Committee, which is holding its own hearings to determine whether Koskinen committed any wrongdoing. Cummings said government investigators have found no evidence that the IRS targeted conservative groups or that Koskinen obstructed the House investigation. The proposed censure legislation urges Koskinens removal from office and would require him to forfeit his pension and other federal benefits. Committee approval would send it to the floor for a vote by the full House.  Legal experts say a congressional censure would not pass constitutional muster if it imposed any penalty.

Florida nightclub massacre prompts Rubio to reconsider political future,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who announced his retirement from the Senate after ending his Republican presidential bid in March, said on Monday he would reconsider his future after being urged to seek re-election in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre.   The Florida Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview that the worst mass shooting in U.S. history most certainly has impacted my thinking in general, at least, about a lot of things. But Rubio said he has not considered the rampage from a political perspective. When it visits your home state, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country, Rubio said. My family and I will be praying about all this and well see what I need to do next with my life in regards to how I can best serve.   Hewitt urged Rubio to remain in the Senate, describing the lawmaker who sits on the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees as one of the very few people who know the security issues raised by Sundays rampage. News of the interview brought an attack on Rubios voting record from Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who referred to the Republican repeatedly as the junior senator from Florida.  How can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives? Reid asked on the floor of the Senate. That is how he voted. The junior senator voted against every gun safety measure. Rubio, who is also seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for Republican Donald Trump, announced that he would retire from the Senate and take a break from politics after losing Floridas presidential primary in March to Trump. Before Sunday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others had urged him to seek re-election, citing polling data that showed he would win re-election and help Republicans retain their Senate majority. Rubio has backed his friend and fellow Republican, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera, in Floridas August primary contest for his Senate seat.    If he were to run for re-election, Rubio would have to decide by a June 24 filing deadline. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
Senate Democrats push for new gun control measures,"(Reuters) - Leading U.S. Senate Democrats on Monday urged quick passage of legislation defeated last year to impose additional gun controls in the wake of the weekend mass shooting in Florida. Four Democratic senators, led by Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, called for immediate passage of a bill preventing people on terror watch lists and other suspected terrorists from buying firearms or explosives. Last December, Democrats attempted to pass this legislation but were blocked by Republicans, who said the government could mistakenly place innocent people on watch lists. The new push for legislation came after a man with an assault rifle entered a gay nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. The gunman subsequently was killed by law enforcement officers. Federal agents had interviewed the gunman twice in recent years. Joining Schumer in calling for passage of the legislation are Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, Bill Nelson of Florida and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Meanwhile, Democratic President Barack Obama on Monday blamed weak gun laws for allowing disturbed individuals to gain access to powerful weapons. Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic candidate to replace Obama in the White House, said people on watch lists should be barred from buying guns and said there should be a debate about possible restrictions on assault weapons. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, took a different approach, repeating his call for temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country. The Orlando gunman was born in the United States. His parents were Afghan immigrants.",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
U.S. court skeptical of lawmaker immunity in trading probe,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court fired skeptical questions on Monday at a lawyer for a U.S. congressional committee and a former staffer who argued that Congress is immune from having to cooperate with an insider-trading investigation. During a hearing, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to lean in favor of forcing Congress to comply at least somewhat with two subpoenas from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case is a test of how far securities enforcers may go to police the murky world of political intelligence, in which firms seek to gather and sell information for traders.  The SEC is investigating trading in Humana Inc stock in 2013 ahead of a government announcement about physician reimbursement rates, which affect Humana and other health insurers. In court papers, the SEC said it believes a congressional staff member at the time, Brian Sutter, may have been a source of an early leak to a lobbyist at the Greenberg Traurig law firm, who then passed the information to a Height Securities analyst, who in turn alerted clients. Lawmakers and their staff are not immune from prosecution under insider-trading laws.  But Sutter and his former employer, the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, refused to comply with subpoenas for documents and testimony. Their lawyers argued that they should be shielded from such investigative tactics because, under the legal principles of sovereign immunity and legislative independence, they cannot be questioned without their consent.  Circuit Judge Richard Wesley asked if Sutter went beyond protected activity in talking to the lobbyist. I dont care what his job was at the Ways and Means Committee; he wasnt in charge of insider trading, he said. William Pittard, a lawyer for Sutter and the committee, said it was not the courts role to question the motives of congressional staff. SEC lawyer Jeffrey Berger told the court that a ban on insider trading by Congress would be an empty shell if the regulator lacked the power to investigate. The appeals court is expected to rule in the next several months. A Humana spokesman could not be reached for comment. A Greenberg Traurig spokeswoman declined to comment. Height Securities said in a statement it has not received a subpoena from or been formally investigated by the SEC. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
Trump fights release of video testimony in fraud case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday filed court papers opposing the release of video showing him being questioned under oath about his Trump University series of real estate seminars. They argued that making public the videos, for which written transcripts are already available, would prejudice Trumps case. The video is unnecessary, irrelevant and unjustified, lawyers for Trump wrote in court papers filed in federal court in San Diego. In legal proceedings, evidence is considered prejudicial if it may interfere with a judge or jurys objective consideration of the facts. Such evidence can still be presented if it is considered highly relevant to the case.  The Republican candidate has already claimed the federal judge overseeing the case is biased against him because of the judges Mexican heritage. Trump may also have concerns about the impact the videos could have outside the courtroom. On Friday, CNN, CBS, the New York Times, and other media outlets asked for the complete deposition transcripts and videotapes to be made available. If released, the videos could provide fodder for campaign commercials against Trump. In lawsuits in California and New York, Trump has been accused of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 for an opportunity to learn the businessmans real estate investment strategies. Former Trump University students suing the billionaire claim that they learned little and that their instructors, supposedly hand-picked by Trump, had few qualifications.  During deposition, Trump has admitted that he did not select instructors. His lawyers have argued the hand-picked claim amounted to mere sales puffery rather than fraud. In court papers arguing for the videos release, lawyers for the students argued the images presented nuances not available in the transcripts. Trumps tone, facial expressions, gestures and body language... speak volumes to... Trumps complete and utter unfamiliarity with the instructors and instruction that student-victims received, they said. Trump has said the claims over Trump University are baseless and that students highly rated the programs.  The case is Art Cohen v Donald J.

Police reveal names of Orlando club shooting victims,"Orlando, Fla. (Reuters) - A day before the Orlando, Florida, nightclub massacre, Luis Vielma, 22, updated his Facebook profile with a picture of himself standing with young people in front of a Disney castle and a caption that read: True friends who become family. By Sunday night, his profile was altered to Remember Luis Vielma after police confirmed he was among 50 people killed in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. As authorities frantically tried to notify all the relatives, the Orlando Police Department began publishing the names of victims on a city website on Sunday afternoon. Among them was Vielma, who worked part-time as a rides attendant at the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey theme park ride, while studying physical therapy at Seminole State College, according to his Facebook profile.      Others included Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34, Stanley Almodovar III, 23, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20, Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22, Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36, and Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz, 22.  Police killed the gunman, who was identified as Omar Mateen, 29, a New York-born Florida resident and U.S. citizen who was the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, and officials were probing evidence suggesting the attack may have been inspired by Islamic State militants. The sheer number of deaths appeared to overwhelm officials in Orlando, a city of 270,000 people. Orlando police asked mourners to hold off on vigils as they were understaffed to police them.  We understand our community is grieving and that vigils are being planned but PLEASE hold off on vigils  they represent a serious strain on our limited resources, which we need to dedicate to law enforcement and victims, the city posted on its official Twitter handle. Sotomayor was a marketing manager at a Sarasota, Florida-based gay-themed travel company. His boss, Al Ferguson, said Sotomayors partner was outside the nightclub putting something in the car when the shots rang out. He got a text from Sotomayor telling him he was safe in the bathroom and not to come back into the club. Sotomayor texted again 20 minutes later to say he was OK. That was the last his partner heard from him, Ferguson said.     Sotomayor was a legend in the industry, Ferguson said. He booked tours for entertainer and drag queen RuPaul and put together the first gay cruise to Cuba last year. He was going to announce a second trip on Sunday, but was killed. Anyone who booked gay cruises knew Sotomayor, Ferguson told Reuters. He was a great man.  In an Instagram post published on Sunday, RuPauls Drag Race judge Michelle Visage called Sotomayor a joy. I loved you on so many levels. You were SO SO special and will never be forgotten, she wrote. I promise you that.   Neighbors of Almodovar, a 23-year-old pharmacy technician, said his parents had recently moved back to Puerto Rico after his mother became ill with cancer. He was the youngest in the family. The Facebook page for Almodovar, of Clermont, Florida, was flooded with shocked tributes. Well miss you Stanley. You made an impact on everyone that you came around. A good person and friend, wrote Mark Nielsen of Deltona, Florida. Images posted to Almodovars wall over the years showed him socializing with dozens of friends.

Exclusive: Obama administration not pursuing executive order to shut Guantanamo - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration is not pursuing the use of an executive order to shutter the Guantanamo Bay military prison after officials concluded that it would not be a viable strategy, sources familiar with the deliberations said. The conclusion, reached by administration officials, narrows the already slim chances that President Barack Obama can fulfill his pledge to close the  notorious offshore prison before leaving office in January. The White House has said repeatedly that Obama has not ruled out any options on the Guantanamo center, which has been used to house terrorism suspects since it was set up in 2001 following the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Obama is eager to fulfill his 2008 campaign pledge to close the prison and could still choose to use his commander-in-chief powers, but the option is not being actively pursued, the sources said. Without executive action, the chances of closing the prison would hinge on convincing a resistant Congress to overturn a long-standing ban on bringing possibly dozens of remaining prisoners to maximum-security prisons in the United States.  White House lawyers and other officials studied the option of overriding the ban but did not develop a strong legal position or an effective political sales pitch in an election year, a source familiar with the discussions said.  It was just deemed too difficult to get through all of the hurdles that they would need to get through, and the level of support they were likely to receive on it was thought to be too low to generate such controversy, particularly at a sensitive (time) in an election cycle, the source said. Republicans in Congress are opposed to bringing Guantanamo detainees to U.S. prisons and have expressed opposition to transfers to other countries over concern that released prisoners will return to militant activities. They have vowed to challenge any potential Obama executive action in court. At its peak, the prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba housed nearly 800 prisoners, becoming a symbol of the excesses of the war on terror and synonymous with criticism of detention without trial and accusations of torture. Obama has called it a recruitment tool for terrorists. The number of Guantanamo detainees has fallen to 80 now, the lowest since it was opened.  The administration is focusing on getting the number of detainees at the prison down to such a low number, perhaps 20, that the cost of keeping it open could prove unpalatable to Congress. Republican lawmakers remain unswayed. The Guantanamo prison and associated military commissions cost $445 million in fiscal year 2015. That works out to more than $5.5 million a year for each of the 80 remaining prisoners. Thirty of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo have been approved for transfer to foreign countries and the State Department says it will move all of them out this summer. Those who would be left include 10 being prosecuted in military commissions, and other detainees deemed too dangerous to release or transfer. The administrations goal is to work with Congress to find a solution to close Guantanamo, said Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council. He said the government had made substantial progress  moving prisoners to foreign countries and was working to identify more countries for additional transfers. Reviews to determine whether certain prisoners need to remain detained to prevent a threat to U.S. security had been accelerated and would be completed in the coming months, he said. Obama, who issued an order to shut the prison within a year on his first day in office, released his latest plan to close it to Congress in February, but it has not gained traction. The White House has not publicly ruled out the executive order option in part to keep pressure on the Pentagon to move prisoners who have been cleared for release to other countries, one of the sources said. If Congress ... would finally say no to the presidents plan and the executive order option wasnt on the table, there was a concern that the wheels could grind to a halt, said the source familiar with discussions at the White House. Gregory Craig, who served as Obamas first White House counsel, said that without an executive order, Obama would likely need the cooperation of Congress to shut down the prison. I think the odds are probably challenging, Craig said. ",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",1
"Abortion providers, opponents brace for U.S. high court decision","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As she waits for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law, Amy Hagstrom-Miller said she hopes she will not have to close up to three of the clinics she operates in the state, but is planning for it just in case.  Hagstrom-Miller founded Whole Womans Health, which runs four facilities in Texas that provide abortions and led the legal challenge to the law. She said she has spreadsheets listing staffers who would be laid off if the court allows the law to survive, and is thinking about selling buildings and medical equipment as well as shutting her clinics in Fort Worth, San Antonio and McAllen.  I would be irresponsible if I didnt plan, Hagstrom-Miller said in an interview. The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on whether the Texas law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a womans constitutional right to end her pregnancy as set out in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The court has not issued a major abortion-related ruling since 2007.  The law requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges, a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. That provision has been implemented. A second provision, not yet in effect, requires clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities including extensive standards for such attributes as corridor width, room size, floor tiles and the swinging motion of doors. Supporters of the law, passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013, say it was enacted to protect womens health.  Abortion rights advocates say it imposes medically unnecessary regulations intended to shut clinics and has dramatically reduced access to abortion in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people. Getting a clear-cut ruling is complicated by the fact that the court is down to eight justices, split evenly with four conservatives and four liberals, following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia. One possibility is a 4-4 split that would affirm a lower courts decision upholding the law but would not set a national legal precedent that could guide other states eager to pass similar statutes. Because it is unlikely one of the courts liberals would join the four conservatives, there is almost no chance of a  broad ruling upholding the law and giving other states a green light to enact similar measures. Numerous Republican-governed states have considered measures that would restrict abortion availability. For abortion opponents, who no longer have Scalia to cast a fifth vote to tip the balance in their favor, a 4-4 split leaving the Texas law in place may be the best result possible. John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in California, an abortion opponent who filed a brief with the high court backing the Texas law, said if the justices cannot deliver a decisive ruling, Its not a catastrophe. Id rather have womens health and safety in some parts of the country than no parts of the country, Eastman said. Legal fights over similar laws are ongoing in several states, including Mississippi, Louisiana and Wisconsin.  If the court leaves in place the lower-court ruling upholding the Texas law, the number of abortion clinics in the state would drop from the current 19 to nine, abortion providers said. Texas had 41 abortion clinics when the law was passed. A 4-4 decision would leave us in the untenable situation where a womans ability to get an abortion will depend on where she lives, said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes restrictive abortion laws.   Another possibility is that the justices strike down the law, or invalidate one of the two provisions at issue while keeping the other. It may be more likely that the admitting-privileges provision, already in effect, would survive, while the hospital-grade facilities requirements, which the justices themselves temporarily blocked, would not. Justice Anthony Kennedy could be the key player in any such scenarios, which would require at least one conservative to join the four liberals. Kennedy is a conservative who in past rulings has endorsed Roe v. Wade, but has voted to uphold some abortion restrictions. It comes down to Justice Kennedy, and during the argument he didnt show his hand too much, said John Seago, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Lifes legislative director, adding that the ruling could give abortion opponents ideas about what laws we could pass. Another possibility is that the court returns the case to a lower court for further proceedings, as Kennedy suggested during March 2 oral arguments. Its overwhelming for me when I think what could happen if its not a favorable decision, said Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at two Texas Whole Womans Health clinics. I try not to think about it every minute of every day. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 ",1
Obama calls Orlando nightclub shooting an attack on all Americans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Sunday described the worst mass shooting in U.S. history as an act of terror and an act of hate, saying the massacre of 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida was an attack on all Americans. Today as Americans we grieve the brutal murder, a horrific massacre of dozens of innocent people, he said in a statement at the White House.  Although it is still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate, Obama said. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united as Americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us. He ordered the flag at the White House to be flown at half staff to honor the victims.  The shooter, who was identified as Florida resident Omar S. Mateen was killed by police at the nightclub. A top U.S. congressman said Mateen may have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group, but U.S. officials cautioned they had no direct evidence of a connection.   Fifty-three people were wounded in the rampage, which surpassed the 32 people killed in the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech university. Obama said it was appropriate for the FBI to investigate the massacre as an act of terrorism and said he would spare no effort to determine whether the assailant had been inspired or associated with an extremist group. The president also termed the shooting a new reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub, a reference to other mass killings that have punctuated recent U.S. history.  We have to decide if thatsthe kind of country we want to be, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 ",1
Trump says Florida massacre proves he's right on Islamist threat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gave an aggressive response to the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, quickly claiming the attack was the work of an Islamist militant while calling on President Barack Obama to resign and  for Democrat Hillary Clinton to exit the presidential race. For Trump, it was an attempt to frame the attack in Orlando in a light favorable to his campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Early on Sunday, when few facts were known about the shooting, he boasted on Twitter that it proved he had been right about his warnings over radical Islamic terrorism. Trump canceled a planned Monday evening rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire late on Sunday, because of the shooting, but will go ahead with a major speech at St. Anselms College on Monday afternoon. In a tweet just hours after the incident, he wrote:  Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I dont want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance.  Trump has made combating the threat of groups such as Islamic State a central part of his candidacy.  It was last Decembers attack in San Bernardino, California that killed 14 people that led Trump to propose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump re-visited the proposal on Sunday after at least 50 people died in the attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.   What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough, Trump wrote on Twitter. In a statement late Sunday, the businessman went further than U.S. officials investigating the shootings by asserting that the attack in Orlando was the work of a radical Islamic terrorist. Islamic State, which controls land in Iraq and Syria,  claimed responsibility for the shooting but U.S. officials said they had seen no immediate evidence directly linking the militant group to the massacre. The shooter, U.S.-born Florida resident Omar Mateen, was killed by police. Mateen, 29, called 911 on Sunday morning and made comments saying he supported the Islamic State militant group, officials said.  A Trump supporter played Trumps speeches on a loudspeaker outside the Port St. Lucie, Florida home of Mateens parents. Im a Cuban citizen and Im becoming an American citizen on July 6 and Im going to vote for the first time in my life for Donald Trump, said Arisley Travieso, 36, who works for a shredding company. Traveiso said he supported Trump because the Republican nominee sees the problem is Islamic terrorism. He (Trump) has been saying it nonstop.     Trump ripped Obama for his long-standing refusal to refer to Islamic State and other extremist groups as in part representative of the religion of Islam. In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words Radical Islam. For that reason alone, he should step down, Trump said, adding that, if Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words Radical Islam she should get out of this race for the presidency. Trumps day-long barrage of tweets and statements contrasted  with more cautious approaches taken by Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and her fellow Democrat Obama.     In remarks at the White House, Obama said the investigation into the shootings was ongoing and declined to speculate on the motives of the shooter.  Weve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer, Obama said. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism.   Similarly, Clinton, in a statement, called the attack an act of terror but did not speculate about the ideology of the gunman. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are hard at work, and we will learn more in the hours and days ahead, said Clinton, who expressed her sympathy for the victims and said weapons of war have no place on U.S. streets. Trumps campaign said that a speech scheduled for Monday that was to be devoted to criticizing Hillary and Bill Clinton would now be centered on national security and counter-terrorism.

"Some lawmakers talk gun control after Florida shooting, scant hope for change","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history prompted calls on Sunday by some members of Congress for legislation to tighten control of weapons sales, although there were slim hopes for much change after 50 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Florida. Democratic Senator Robert Casey said he would announce a bill on Monday that would ban anyone convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime from owning a firearm. Under current law, those with felony convictions are prohibited from buying or possessing a gun, but those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes are not.    Casey planned to make the announcement in his home state of Pennsylvania after a meeting with members of Pittsburghs lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Lawmakers, including some Republicans, have sought some gun restrictions after earlier mass shootings, but even minor changes failed to gain enough support to become law. Backed by the powerful gun lobby, many members of Congress see controls of weapons sales as a threat to Americans constitutional rights. Other Democrats also called for Congress to act after Sundays attack in Orlando, some in strong terms. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the killings would prompt debate but not action. The bottom line is that we allow dangerous people to buy guns in America and that has got to change, he said. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said the epidemic of gun violence would continue if Congress does not act and also said lawmakers shared responsibility. Congress has become complicit in these murders by its total, unconscionable deafening silence, he said in a statement. This doesnt have to happen but this epidemic will continue without end if Congress continues to sit on its hands and do nothing  again. A gunman killed 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in Murphys home state, Connecticut, in 2012. The suspected Orlando attacker, identified as Omar Mateen, 29, a U.S. citizen who was the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, was carrying an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun, authorities said. The shooter in Newtown also had an AR-15. Many Republicans, including the presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, focused on the threat from Islamist militants after the shooting, citing reports that Mateen was inspired by Islamic State. The FBI said Mateen had twice been interviewed after making comments to co-workers indicating he supported militant groups, but neither led to evidence of criminal activity.

Assault rifle used in Florida shooting drives gun control debate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Omar Mateen entered an Orlando, Florida, nightclub on Sunday to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, he wielded a weapon that has been used in massacres from California to Connecticut: a military-inspired semi-automatic rifle. Though so-called assault rifles account for a small fraction of the United States 30,000 annual gun deaths, they have been used in at least 10 mass shootings since 2011, according to a database compiled by Mother Jones magazine. The prevalence of these firearms has made them a focal point in the debate over U.S. gun laws as opponents say civilians should not own what they describe as weapons of war. Backers say they are simply modern rifles enjoyed by millions of law-abiding Americans. In December 2012, Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster XM15 to kill 28 children and adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut before taking his own life with a Glock pistol. Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook used two assault rifles and two pistols to kill 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015.  James Holmes carried an assault rifle, a shotgun and two pistols when he killed 12 people in a Colorado movie theater in 2012. Law enforcement officials say Mateen, a 29-year-old U.S. citizen who was the son of Afghan immigrants, carried an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun when he killed 50 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando. He also had an unidentified device, said Orlando Police Chief John Mina. The AR-15 was developed from the U.S. militarys M-16 rifle, used in the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Unlike the military version, the AR-15 is not fully automatic, meaning users must pull the trigger each time they want to fire a shot. Like the military version, many AR-15s combine light weight with a relatively modest recoil. Prominent manufacturers include Smith & Wesson, Sturm Ruger and Remington Arms Co, which faces a lawsuit from some families of Sandy Hook victims who say the rifle should not be sold to civilians. It is the gold standard for killing the enemy in battle, just as it has become the gold standard for mass murder of innocent civilians, said Josh Koskoff, a lawyer involved in the case.   The National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gun manufacturers, said it would not comment on the Orlando shooting until more facts are known.  The NSSF estimates there are roughly 5 million to 10 million AR-15 rifles owned in the United States, a fraction of the 300 million firearms owned by Americans. Most owners say they use the rifle for target shooting and home defense, although they can be used for hunting as well. Despite their controversial reputation, assault rifles do not often turn up at murder scenes. Handguns accounted for at least 48 percent of all murders between 2010 and 2014, according to FBI data, while rifles - a category that includes more traditional types of long guns - accounted for 2.4 percent. Roughly four times as many people were killed by knives in that period. Still, in the wake of the Orlando shooting several Democratic politicians said Congress should renew a ban on assault-style weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines that was in place between 1994 and 2004. It reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets, said presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Research is mixed on whether the assault-rifle ban had a significant impact. Gun manufacturers were able to tweak their designs to get around the ban and crime rates have fallen steadily since the early 1990s, whether or not the ban was in place. The number of mass shootings has increased since it expired.  Any effort to renew the ban would face fierce opposition in the U.S. Congress, where Republicans who control both chambers of Congress have staunchly opposed tighter gun laws and groups like the National Rifle Association have been able to mobilize millions of gun owners against other restrictions. Despite strong support from President Barack Obama, the last attempt at new gun legislation failed in the U.S. Senate in 2013. Opinion polls find that Americans are less enthusiastic about banning assault weapons than other types of gun restrictions, such as expanded background checks. Several polls since 2013 have found between 44 percent and 57 percent of Americans back the idea. Six states and the District of Columbia currently ban assault weapons and two more, Minnesota and Virginia, ban possession by people under 18 years old. Experts say it is difficult to tell whether those laws have had an impact since gun buyers can easily find those weapons in other states. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 ",1

Texas politician slammed for tweet sent after Florida shooting,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The office of Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a Republican and evangelical Christian, on Sunday deleted a tweet many saw as offensive and insensitive that was sent out shortly after the deadly attack on a gay nightclub in Florida. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows, read the Bible verse Patrick sent out on his official Twitter account a few hours after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 50 dead. His office was not immediately available for comment but has told local media, including the Dallas Morning News, that the tweet had been scheduled for release well before the shooting. The office, which regularly sends out a Bible verse on Sundays, has since deleted it and replaced with another passage, they said.  But the deleted tweet from a politician who has condemned same-sex marriage and fought against LGBT rights still raised the ire of those who accused Patrick of blaming the victims. You are a disgrace to your state in this time of national sorrow. You should resign, prominent LGBT activist George Takei wrote on Twitter. The Texas Democratic Party called on Patrick to apologize immediately. Make this right. We are better than this, it said in a statement. Patrick is currently out of the country and has not yet made  comment to media about the tweet.

Obama's remarks on Orlando shooting: 'We will not give in to fear',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Sunday said Americans would stand united and not give in to fear or turn against each other in the wake of a nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, that killed 50 people. Following is the full text of remarks, Obama delivered at the White House: Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder - a horrific massacre - of dozens of innocent people.We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts.We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city.Although its still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people. I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisers. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. Ive directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation. We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. Weve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And Ive directed that we must spare no effort to determine what - if any - inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, well uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us. This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need - they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come. We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harms way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. Its the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough. This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends - our fellow Americans - who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub - it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American - regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation - is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans. Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if thats the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well. In the coming hours and days, well learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families - that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more - as a country - by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us. As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts - friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us. May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love.Thank you. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 ",1

Will she go as far as I would like her to go?  No, she wont, he said. But I think millions of people want to understand and see is what kind of commitment she has to addressing the real crises in the country. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 ",1
Democrats want 'major role' for Sanders: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders may have lost his bid to become the Democratic nominee for the White House, but party members dont want the U.S. senator from Vermont to step off the stage. More than three-quarters of Democrats say Sanders should have a major role in shaping the partys positions, while nearly two thirds say Hillary Clinton - who beat him for the nomination - should pick him as her vice-presidential running mate, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. In a sign that Democrats hope their party can unite after a fierce primary season, two-thirds also said that Sanders should endorse Clinton, a former secretary of state and senator who appears bound for a showdown with Republican Donald Trump in Novembers presidential election. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, managed to turn his long-shot run into a mass movement with hard-line proposals to combat wealth inequality, increase access to health care and education, and defend the environment. His challenge to Clinton, one of the best-known figures in American politics, lasted far longer than expected, as he racked up strong results in a number of state nominating contests and stayed in the race even when the delegate count seemed to spell his doom, and yielded record numbers of small donations to his campaign. Sanders so far has not conceded defeat, even though Clinton recently clinched the nomination and won endorsements from President Barack Obama and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - a favorite of the same left-leaning voters who supported him. Sanders has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the Democratic National Convention in July - when Clintons nomination is expected to become official - though he has hinted he does not want his presence to hurt the Democrats chances of keeping the White House.  We will not let Donald Trump become president, Sanders told supporters last week. The poll, conducted June 7-10 - right after Clinton sewed up the delegate majority to become the presumptive Democratic nominee - showed that while most Democrats want Sanders to line up behind Clinton, about 44 percent would like him to make an independent run for the White House. Some 47 percent said he should not. The poll included 455 respondents and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 5.3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2016 ",1

In February, the technology CEO called Trump unfit to be president. Since then, Trump has become the presumptive Republican nominee and is likely to run against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Ryan, addressing the 300 attendees of the session, explained the difficulty he had with the decision to endorse, the Post said, including weathering pressure from House Republicans to lend his backing to Trump.   After weeks of holding out, Ryan endorsed the New York businessman in early June, breaking with a number of establishment Republicans who see Trumps rhetoric as damaging to the party. The opponents include Romney, Republicans 2012 presidential nominee, who chose Ryan as his running mate. Romney has blasted Trump in recent weeks for attacks he has made on the Mexican-American judge presiding over a case against him, with Romney warning on Friday about the effect that trickle-down racism could have on the country. As the presumptive nominee, Trump now has to balance maintaining the outsider style that helped propel him to the nomination, while courting Republican insiders, who could be critical to financing a general election campaign against a well-funded Clinton.  Trump on Saturday showed no inclination to make peace with his critics. He went on Twitter to note how Romney choked like a dog when he lost to then-incumbent President Barack Obama in 2012 and reiterated it at his campaign stops.  ",politicsNews,"June 11, 2016 ",1
"Alabama speaker convicted of ethics charges, removed from office","(Reuters) - Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard, a powerful figure in state politics, was found guilty on Friday of using his elected office, along with his former post as chair of the state Republican Party, for personal gain, local media reported.  After seven hours of deliberation, a Lee County jury found Hubbard guilty of 12 of the 23 felony ethics charges he faced, convictions that automatically removed him from office, according to Alabamanews.net. This should send a clear message that in Alabama we hold public officials accountable for their actions, state Attorney General Luther Strange said on his website. Sentencing for Hubbard is scheduled for July 8. He faces 20 years in prison, Alabamanews.net reported. Hubbards attorneys told the news website that they would appeal the convictions. Hubbard was indicted by a state grand jury in October 2014 on charges of using his elected office, along with his former post as chair of the state Republican Party, for personal gain. Hubbard helped guide Republicans to majorities in both houses of the state legislature in 2010 for the first time in 136 years before his indictment.  ",politicsNews,"June 11, 2016 ",1
"Appeals court ruling will let some Kansas voters register, for now","(Reuters) - Thousands of Kansas residents who signed up to vote at motor vehicle offices but were kept off the rolls by a state law requiring proof of citizenship could be allowed to cast ballots in the November general election, under a ruling on Friday by a U.S. appeals court. Kansas secretary of state, Kris Kobach, a Republican who has become a national leader in pushing for voting changes, had asked the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to place on hold a decision last month by a lower-court judge ordering the state to begin registering 18,000 residents affected by the law. In requesting the stay, the state said the order to begin to register voters would result in extraordinary confusion on November 8, 2016. The Denver-based federal appeals court, however, rejected the argument. We conclude that defendant-appellant has not made the requisite showing for a stay pending appeal so we deny that motion, a panel of the appeals court said in its ruling. The appeals court has not yet ruled on the merits of the case. It did not say when it expected it would make a decision, but it granted expedited review. The Kansas law will not affect the states status as a safe Republican stronghold in Novembers presidential election, but it has thrust Kansas into a national debate over voting restrictions. Representatives for Kobach could not be reached for comment. The ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by Kansas residents who submitted voter applications through state motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of citizenship. Under a state law that took effect in 2013, they were required to present a document such as a birth certificate. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the plaintiffs, argued in their lawsuit that the statute conflicts with a federal law designed to make it easier to register to vote while getting a drivers license.  U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson, in her May 17 ruling ordering Kansas to begin to register more than 18,000 applicants at Division of Motor Vehicle offices who were kept off the rolls, noted that Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and 2013. Under Robinsons ruling, Kansas residents placed on the rolls can vote in federal but not state elections. Kansas will hold its primaries for state and local elections in August.

"Stung by criticism, Trump vows to work for ethnic harmony","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered a message of ethnic harmony on Friday at a Christian evangelical conference as he sought to calm concern about his criticism of a Mexican-American judge. In a departure from his usual freewheeling style, Trump read a carefully scripted speech from a teleprompter as part of a new push by his campaign to tone down the outspoken New Yorkers harsh rhetoric. Trumps remarks included a wide-ranging attack on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and he said money aimed at resettling Syrian refugees in the United States should instead be spent on tackling poverty in U.S. cities. Speaking to the annual conference of the conservative Faith & Freedom Coalition, Trump did not mention the controversy over his charge that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel cannot treat him fairly because of his Mexican heritage. But Trump did make a point of saying he would represent all Americans if elected president on Nov. 8. Freedom of any kind means no one should be judged by their race or their color and the tone of his hue, Trump said. Right now, we have a very divided nation. Were going to bring our nation together. Paul Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, had criticized Trump for what he called a textbook definition of a racist comment for his remarks about the judge. Other Republican leaders warned Trump to change his tone or risk losing their support. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who  led a movement to derail Trumps nomination, told CNN he would not consider running for the White House. Romney blasted Trump for comments that he said denigrated Mexicans, women and religion. Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry and trickle-down misogyny - all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America, he said. Romney said he expects Trump to get the Republican nomination, but said that he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. He left open the possibility of casting a ballot for the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. As Trump sought to rally more Republicans behind him, Clinton met with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to try and shore up support from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Clinton later addressed the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the nonpartisan arm of the womens health group, and had Trump trained in her sights. This is a man who has called women pigs, dogs and disgusting animals, its kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights, said Clinton, the first woman to become the presumptive presidential nominee of a major party.   Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points, nearly the same  as a week ago, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.       Trump on Friday criticized Clintons willingness to accept thousands of Syrian refugees into the United States and challenged her to replace her support for increased refugee admission in favor of a new jobs program for inner cities.     He stopped short of repeating his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, a proposal that has drawn heavy fire from Republicans and Democrats. We have to temporarily stop this whole thing with whats going on with refugees where we dont know where theyre coming from, Trump said. We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans so they can come out of this horrible situation that theyre in. At the funeral on Friday of boxing champion Muhammad Ali, a convert to Islam, one speaker, a rabbi, inveighed against politicians promoting intolerance of Muslims.  We will not tolerate politicians or anyone else putting down Muslims and blaming Muslims for a few people, said Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of Tikkun magazine, who said he attended the ceremony in Louisville, Kentucky, as a representative of American Jews. Trump said Clintons refusal to use the phrase radical Islamic terrorism - favored by Republicans to describe violent Islamist militants - makes her unfit to be president. The real estate moguls struggle to unify Republicans behind his insurgent candidacy was apparent at the evangelical Faith & Freedom conference, where several speakers studiously avoided speaking his name. Former campaign rival Carly Fiorina steered clear of Trump, speaking instead of the need to prevent liberal policies taking hold.  U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, said a Republican president is needed, without mentioning Trump. We dont want this contest this fall to just be a contest of personalities, she said. But conference organizer Ralph Reed was adamant in his support for Trump, saying the New Yorker has energized the evangelical vote in a way that past Republican presidential nominees failed to do. We understand that perfection is not the measure that should be applied, Reed told the crowd.         ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 ",1

"Puerto Rico GO bond price dips, rescue bill moves to Senate","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos benchmark General Obligation bond fell in price on Friday in choppy trading after the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation aimed at helping the U.S. territory fix its fiscal mess. The GO bond, carrying an 8 percent coupon and maturing in 2035, last traded at 64.74 points in price, pushing the yield to 13.05 percent from 12.73 percent on Thursday, according to data provided by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. According to the MSRBs Electronic Municipal Market Access database, about $21 million worth of bonds traded versus $14 million the day before. Late on Thursday the House passed the ""Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act"" (PROMESA), by a vote of 297-127, with the U.S. Senate expected to take up the bill quickly ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due July 1. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Puerto Rico has a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay and a staggering 45 percent poverty rate. It faces steady migration of its residents to the mainland and a potential humanitarian crisis because it cannot sustain social services. PROMESA, if passed by the Senate and signed into law, would establish a powerful seven-member federal Oversight Board to navigate through the restructurings. Among other things, the board would have the authority to enforce balanced budgets. It is definitely a step forward, a very good step forward. We think it was necessary. It doesnt answer all your questions but at least it sets up a framework and does provide fiscal management and oversight which we think was necessary because the credibility of the government is pretty much shot, said Joe Rosenblum, director of municipal credit research at AllianceBernstein in New York. We dont think at these prices we are ready to dip our toes back in and we havent seen a lot of trading activity out there, so I think we are in company, Rosenblum said. PROMESA does not set out specific rules for restructuring, leaving such decisions to the control board to work through with creditors. This is a critical point for municipal bond market investors where long-standing rules set out a hierarchy among creditors, typically with GO bondholders considered senior to all others. Regardless of how things get restructured today, the fact that the economy continues to shrink and the population continues to shrink is a problem for the credit going forward, said Craig Brandon, co-director of municipal investments at Eaton Vance in Boston.

House opposes carbon and oil taxes in symbolic votes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted largely along party lines on Friday to reject any new taxes on carbon emissions and oil production. The two non-binding actions were intended to get Republicans on the record opposing higher taxes on fossil fuels amid industry concerns that they could become part of a new tax reform debate in 2017, according to aides and lobbyists. One resolution opposing a carbon tax as detrimental to the U.S. economy, which was led by House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and backed by the privately owned Koch Industries Inc, drew support from 237 lawmakers, including 231 Republicans and six Democrats, while 163 Democrats voted against the measure. Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups favor a carbon tax as a way to control emissions. Republican leaders and their industry allies have worried that support for a carbon tax among big oil companies could encourage some Republicans to back such a measure.  A separate resolution against President Barack Obamas proposed $10-a-barrel oil tax won support from 253 lawmakers, including 230 Republicans and 23 Democrats. One Republican and 143 Democrats voted against the measure. These taxes would harm businesses and hardworking American families who (are) already struggling with stagnant wages, Representative Bill Flores, a Texas Republican and former energy industry executive, said in a statement.

Illinois governor vetoes $3.9 billion FY 2016 spending bill,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday vetoed a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature in April to spend nearly $3.9 billion on state services that have not been funded due to an ongoing fiscal 2016 budget impasse. The Republican governor called the legislation an empty promise. The bill purports to appropriate $3.89 billion, including more than $3 billion in general funds that the state does not have, for higher education and social service providers, but provides no source of funding, Rauner said in his veto message.  The political stalemate between Rauner and Democrats has left Illinois as the only U.S. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget, operating instead on court-ordered spending and a muddled patchwork of ongoing and stopgap appropriations. Rauner called on lawmakers to pass complete balanced budgets for the current and next fiscal years, although the governor has proposed funding most fiscal 2017 services with a temporary spending plan and K-12 schools with a full-year budget. Illinois new fiscal year begins on July 1. The Democrats spending bill passed with enough votes in the Senate to override a veto, but fell short of that margin in the House. The measure would have sent money to cash-starved state universities and colleges, covered tuition grants for low-income college students, and funded health and human services that were not subject to court orders. The measure also appropriated about $63 million for unpaid wage increases owed to about 24,000 unionized state workers.  ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 ",1
Congress eyes $1 billion to aid at-risk families,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Key members of the U.S. Congress said Friday they had reached a compromise to shift more than $1 billion to try to keep struggling families together, including those with babies born dependant on opioids. The proposal is driven in part by an opioid crisis that threatens thousands of families. The bill would allow mental health, substance abuse and parenting assistance whenever a child is deemed at imminent risk of entering foster care. The measure also offers support for relatives who unexpectedly assume responsibility for a child when a parent cannot. Under current law, such funds may only be spent after a child enters foster care. A spokesman for the Child Welfare League of America, John Sciamanna, called the proposed change a landmark, potentially historic. The legislation involves more than $1 billion over 10 years. Related opioid bills have not included funding. This bill would make a historic shift in child welfare funding by offering a way for moms and dads to get help and treatment rather than pitching in only after children are removed from home, said Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. The bill is a compromise between four powerful members of Congress: Wyden; the Senate Finance committees Republican chair, Orrin Hatch of Utah; the Republican chair of the House Ways & Means Committee, Kevin Brady of Texas; and the ranking Democrat on Ways & Means, Sander Levin of Michigan. The plan offers bipartisan solutions for families and children affected by the opioid addiction crisis, Hatch said in a statement. In December, a Reuters investigation revealed that at least 110 babies had died since 2010 after being born opioid-dependent and sent home with parents ill-prepared to care for them. No more than nine of the 50 U.S. states followed a federal law requiring them to help those newborns, the news agency found. In response to the Reuters series, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asked all states to report by June 30 whether and how they are following the existing law, known as the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. In May, the House passed legislation to improve safety planning for children born dependent on opioid drugs. Reanne Pederson of Devils Lake, N.D., one of the women portrayed in the Reuters series who accidentally smothered her newborn in bed while on drugs, said she was happy to hear about new funding possibilities. Its important to me that moms who are struggling with addiction get help, she said. ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 ",1
Clinton leads Trump by 11 points in White House race: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"(Reuters) - Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 11 points in the U.S. presidential race, showing little change after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.   The online poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, shows 46 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 34.8 percent back Trump. Another 19.2 percent support neither candidate. Their parties hold conventions in July ahead of a Nov. 8 election. Clintons lead was nearly the same a week ago, before she had amassed enough convention delegates to win the nomination and before Trump drew criticism from leaders of both parties for questioning the impartiality of a Mexican-American judge. Trump, 69, enjoyed a bigger boost after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in May. Having trailed Clinton, 68, for most of the year, Trump briefly erased a double-digit gap and pulled about even with the former secretary of state. Clinton this week defeated party rival Bernie Sanders, 74, in four of six nominating contests, most notably California and New Jersey, and won the endorsements of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other party leaders. Trump this week sparred with party leaders and struggled with questions about his now-defunct Trump University. A lawsuit accuses Trump and the for-profit school of defrauding thousands of people, including many who paid as much as $35,000 to learn Trumps real estate strategies.  A wealthy businessman who asserts the lawsuit is politically motivated, Trump said presiding U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was biased against him because of Trumps plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Trump later added that Muslim judges could be biased against him also because of his pledge to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Trumps comments drew sharp criticism from Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump later said he would no longer talk about the judge. Fridays results had 1,276 respondents and a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.2 percentage points.

U.S. appeals court upholds 'quickie' union election rules,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday dismissed a bid by construction trade groups to block controversial Obama administration rules designed to speed up union elections, saying the National Labor Relations Board had broad authority to implement them. The Texas-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected claims by Associated Builders and Contractors Inc and a Texas chapter that the so-called quickie election rules violated employers free speech rights and would lead to union harassment of workers.  The board ... conducted an exhaustive and lengthy review of the issues, evidence and testimony, responded to contrary arguments, and offered factual and legal support for its final conclusions, Circuit Judge Edith Brown Clement wrote.  The 5th Circuit is considered to be one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country and is a popular venue for legal challenges to Obama administration initiatives. The decision affirmed a 2015 ruling by a federal judge in Austin, Texas. The states chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business was also a plaintiff but was not involved in the appeal.  The rules, which took effect in April 2015, have shortened the period between a union filing a petition to represent workers and an election, from the previous median of 38 days to as little as two weeks.  Under the rules, employers cannot bring legal challenges to the way union campaigns are conducted until after an election and are required to share workers names and contact details with unions once they file election petitions. The NLRB said the changes were necessary because a small number of companies were intentionally dragging out the election process, sometimes for months, to coerce workers to vote against unions.  Associated Builders and Contractors in its lawsuit said there was no evidence that was common, but the 5th Circuit on Friday said it was not the courts role to weigh the evidence pro and con. NLRB spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek declined to comment. ABC did not immediately return a request for comment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business-backed groups last year made similar claims in a separate lawsuit challenging the new rules in federal court in Washington, D.C. A judge dismissed the case, and the groups did not appeal.  President Barack Obama in March 2015 vetoed a measure from Republicans in Congress that would have stopped the rules from taking effect. The case is Associated Builders and Contractors Inc v. National Labor Relations Board, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals No. 15-50497. ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 ",1
Green groups fund-raise against Trump’s climate stance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps promise to gut U.S. environmental regulations and revive the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline if elected president is a nightmare for green groups, but it may be a dream come true for their fund-raisers. The countrys biggest environmental groups say the Republican White House hopefuls pro-drilling and anti-global warming positions have sparked a record wave of donations and volunteer recruitment that could revitalize U.S. green advocacy. Trump has said he would revive the coal industry, pull the United States out of a global climate pact and expand oil drilling.  We couldnt have asked for a more powerful motivator than Donald Trump, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said. Brune said a spring email blast about the New York businessman to the San Francisco-based groups members yielded $25,000 in donations, more than twice as much as projected, along with 15,000 new volunteers. The clubs Political Committee, which works directly on projects to engage voters during the election, has raised more than $62,000 this year, compared with just $22,000 at this point in the 2012 election, according to the filings with the Federal Election Commission.     The Washington-based League of Conservation Voters has also gotten a boost. Officials said its annual fund-raising dinner this week pulled in a record haul, which they would not disclose, after the group also used Trump as a focal point of its donor outreach. Its been a long time since there has been someone that our movement has so universally wanted to stop, said spokesman David Willett.  The leagues Voters Action Fund, meanwhile, has raised more than $610,000 in donations so far this year for election-related work, more than triple what it pulled in during the same period of 2012, and more than double that of 2008, according to federal filings. Trump has long signaled his belief that global warming is a hoax. Last month he outlined plans to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by the Obama administration, scrap the Paris Climate Accord, and revive the Keystone XL - moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement. A spokeswoman for Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NextGen Climate, a San Francisco-based environmental advocacy organization founded by billionaire activist Tom Steyer, has called Trumps agenda frightening. But its efforts were also getting some traction from the candidates rhetoric.  The group, which has featured Trump in its TV ads to drive voter turnout, said it had seen a 127 percent increase in clicks on its social media postings that mention the candidate compared with those that do not. There is no question that voters are very engaged when it comes to fighting back against Trump, said NextGen spokeswoman Suzanne Henkels. Ben Avery, associate fund-raising director of the Sierra Clubs Northwest chapter, said he was happy about the increase in donor support this year but was vexed by the reason behind it. Bad news is good news for fund-raising, he said.  ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 ",1
Trump's corporate targets face tricky task in fending off his attacks,"(Reuters) - As the White House race took off last summer, food giant Mondelez International found itself in an unusual position: Republican candidate Donald Trump began delivering broadsides against one of its iconic products, Oreo cookies. Nabisco is closing a factory in Chicago, and theyre moving to Mexico. No more Oreos. I dont like Oreos anymore, Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire on Aug. 14, reacting to reports that Mondelez was shutting down some production lines at its Nabisco subsidiary in Chicago while boosting output in Mexico. Trumps statement that Mondelez was closing a Chicago factory was erroneous, as the company quickly pointed out, but that didnt stop him from repeating it. Its unusual for a top presidential candidate, especially a representative of the business-friendly Republican Party, to attack major U.S. corporations by name.  But over the course of his unconventional campaign, Trump has aimed his fire at a range of companies, mostly for shifting jobs abroad (Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Corp unit Carrier Corp) but also for building products in foreign markets (Apple) and for what he said were violations of antitrust laws (Amazon).  Trump has threatened the companies with boycotts, tariffs, taxes and other punishments. The Trump campaign declined to comment for this story.  Some of the companies saw their share prices dip in the wake of Trumps criticism while others experienced a small boost. But all of them were presented with a dilemma thats familiar to the presumptive nominees many vanquished Republican rivals: Should they engage with a possible future president known for holding a grudge, possibly inviting more wrath, or should they lie low and risk allowing Trump to define them and to push policies they deem harmful? Most have sought to stay out of the fray even as Trump has kept up the drumbeat of criticism. I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States Many companies  like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier  are moving production to Mexico, Trump said this week. This was bad for all Americans, he said.    It was the first time Trump included GM in his roster of corporate wrongdoers, though the Trump campaign later removed GM from the statement and declined to say why. GM declined comment.      Mondelez, previously known as Kraft Foods, took a different tack. After Trump vowed to boycott Oreos, Mondelez fielded numerous media inquiries and contacted reporters when the company deemed press coverage of his remarks off base, said Laurie Guzzinati, who oversees governmental affairs in North America for Mondelez. The company didnt engage in any Trump-bashing, though Guzzinati said Trumps comments were grounded in inaccuracies.  She said she told reporters that Mondelez would continue to make Oreos in three locations in the United States, countering the impression Trump may have left that Oreos would no longer be made in the United States. Mondelezs response tracks closely what crisis management experts recommend for Trump-targeted companies.   Hilary Rosen, a managing director for Washington, D.C., communications firm SKD Knickerbocker, said her firm was representing corporate clients who have been singled out by Trump, though she declined to name them.  Rosens advice to clients, she said, is dont depend on educating Donald Trump on the truth. People have tried and failed. Rosen, a Democrat, recommends instead that companies make their case to the journalists who cover Trump, so Donald Trump does not define you. None of the companies targeted by Trump acknowledged hiring outside consultants to deal with his criticism. Many declined to comment for this story.  Youre not going to win in a one-on-one confrontation with Donald Trump. Youre just going to get mired in the mud, said Juda Engelmayer, senior vice president for crisis management at 5W Public Relations in New York.  Those who have been willing to engage, including Ford Chairman Bill Ford, have avoided getting too personal. Trump has railed against Ford for manufacturing vehicles in Mexico, threatening a tariff of up to 40 percent on every car, bumper and part entering the United States from Mexico.  Ford, the great-grandson of the automakers founder Henry Ford, called Trumps critique distorted and said the company instead should be held up as a real success story.  We didnt take the (government) bailout, during the 2007-2009 recession, Ford told reporters at a conference in Detroit on May 23, contrasting his company with GM and Chrysler. We paid back our debts. We pulled ourselves up by our boot straps. We are investing in America.  Crisis management experts said companies targeted by Trump need to be thinking more about the policy implications of his presidency. That means, for example, shoring up support in the U.S. Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has said he wants to renegotiate.    A trade lobbyist who asked not to be named because he has worked with one of the companies Trump has called out said Trumps attacks do not particularly hurt companies reputations in Washington, because policymakers understand presidential campaigns are the political silly season. But, he said, they can impact broader efforts on trade and other policies. I think what this suggests, he said, is that there needs to be a concentrated effort by the business community to talk about the benefits of trade. ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Obama approves broader role for U.S. forces in Afghanistan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has approved giving the U.S. military greater ability to accompany and enable Afghan forces battling a resilient Taliban insurgency, in a move to assist them more proactively on the battlefield, a U.S. official told Reuters.  The senior U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the decision would also allow greater use of U.S. air power, particularly close air support. However, the official cautioned: This is not a blanket order to target the Taliban. Obamas decision again redefines Americas support role in  Afghanistans grinding conflict, more than a year after international forces wrapped up their combat mission and shifted the burden to Afghan troops. It also comes ahead of Obamas eagerly anticipated decision on whether to forge ahead with a scheduled reduction in the numbers of U.S. troops from about 9,800 currently to 5,500 by the start of 2017. A group of retired generals and senior diplomats urged Obama last week to forgo those plans, warning they could undermine the fight against the Afghan Taliban, whose leader was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan last month. Under the new policy, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, will be able to decide when it is appropriate for American troops to accompany conventional Afghan forces into the field - something they have so far only been doing with Afghan special forces, the official said. The expanded powers are only meant to be employed in those select instances in which their engagement can enable strategic effects on the battlefield, the official said. That means that U.S. forces should not be expected to accompany Afghan soldiers on day-to-day missions. This added flexibility ... is fully supported by the Afghan government and will help the Afghans at an important moment for the country, the official said. The decision is a departure from current U.S. rules of engagement in Afghanistan, which impose limits on U.S. forces ability to strike at insurgents. For example, the U.S. military was previously allowed to take action against the Taliban in extremis - moments when their assistance was needed to prevent a significant Afghan military setback. That definition, however, left the U.S. military postured to assist them in more defensive instances. The new policy would allow U.S. forces to accompany Afghans at key moments in their  offensive campaign against the Taliban. The U.S. forces will more proactively support Afghan conventional forces, the official said. The Taliban control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since they were ousted by a U.S.-backed intervention in late 2001, and U.S. officials have acknowledged the uneven performance of Afghan security forces. Large portions of Afghanistan, including the provincial capital of northern Kunduz and multiple districts of southern Helmand province, have fallen, at times briefly, to the Taliban over the past year-and-a-half. Many other districts and provinces are also under varying degrees of Taliban control. The new authorities that Obama has given the U.S. military could give it greater leeway in addressing the shortcomings of Afghan security forces. Still, experts warn that its hard to predict when Afghanistan will be able to stand on its own against the Taliban, not to mention the countrys enormous economic difficulties and fractious political system.

Warren to keep up assault on White House hopeful Trump over judge comments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren will keep up her assault on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday in a strongly worded speech labeling Trump a racist and accusing the Republican Party of fostering his intolerance. Donald Trump chose racism as his weapon, but his aim is exactly the same as the rest of the Republicans, Warren will say in remarks to be delivered at a Washington meeting of the American Constitution Society, a liberal group. Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, is a favorite among liberals as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton, who this week became the presumptive Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump has drawn strong criticism, including from some Republican leaders, for his attacks on Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against his now defunct real estate training school. The Republican candidate has accused Curiel, an American  born in Indiana, of having an inherent bias against him because of his heritage and Trumps campaign pledges on curbing illegal immigration, such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Judge Curiel is one of countless American patriots who has spent decades quietly serving his country, sometimes at great risk to his own life, Warren will say. Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself.     Thursdays remarks will be just the latest in a war of words between Trump and Warren. Trump has dubbed Warren goofy, and often taunts her on the campaign trail, while Warren has branded Trump a loser and last month tweeted that his record is embarrassing. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Warren will soon endorse Clinton, after months of remaining neutral in the Democratic primary battle between Clinton and her challenger from the left, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Warren has considered the idea of serving as Clintons running mate although she sees obstacles to that choice, sources said. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
Mexico steps up dialogue with U.S. firms over economy - minister,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has increased dialogue with American companies to make the case for bilateral economic ties, a senior official said on Thursday, in an effort to counter anti-Mexican rhetoric in the U.S. presidential campaign. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said Mexico is killing U.S. trade, threatening to build a border wall to keep out migrants, block remittances sent home by Mexicans, and raise tariffs against Mexico to protect U.S. jobs. While generally at pains to avoid addressing Trump directly, Mexican government officials have warned that his proposals could do serious damage to both nations economies. Paulo Carreno, Mexicos new deputy foreign minister responsible for North America, was appointed in April to lead a drive to bolster his countrys standing in the United States. Since then, Mexicos diplomatic network in the United States has stepped up efforts to reach out to business leaders, as well as politicians and academics, Carreno said, keen to stress that his government took no side in the presidential contest. Of the companies Mexico had met, the majority agreed with a model of bilateral economic cooperation based on free trade that did not involve a border wall, or protective tariffs, he said. They understand the benefit of greater commercial integration, and they live from it in a way, said Carreno. They agree that the model we have today is the better one, though of course thats not to say it cant be improved. U.S.-Mexico trade is worth some $500 billion every year and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says roughly 6 million American jobs depend on it. In addition, an estimated 35 million people in the United States are Mexican or of Mexican background. Mexican business leaders say U.S. companies are crucial allies in their battle to counter Trumps arguments. Carreno did not detail which companies Mexico was meeting, though senior officials have said previously that those with major operations south of the border are key interlocutors. They include firms like General Electric as well as carmakers General Motors and Ford. Both carmakers have been attacked by Trump in the campaign for investing in Mexico.

Obama is 'fired up' for Clinton as Democrats seek to unify party,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clintons White House bid on Thursday and called for Democrats to unite behind her after a protracted battle with Bernie Sanders for the party nomination. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also backed Clinton on Thursday, telling MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was a genuine threat to the country. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said it means the world to her that Obama had her back in a bruising campaign for the Nov. 8 election.  Clinton also said she had the highest regard for Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, and was really pleased to have her good ideas and support. Vice President Joe Biden also waded into the campaign on Thursday. Whoever the next president is, and God willing in my view it will be Secretary Clinton, Biden said in a speech at the American Constitution Society in Washington. The Obama endorsement increases pressure on Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, to bow out of the race and lend his support to Clinton so that the party can focus on defeating Trump. It is absolutely a joy and an honor that President Obama and I over the years have gone from fierce competitors to true friends, Clinton told Reuters in an interview. After an unexpectedly tough battle against Sanders challenge from the left, former first lady Clinton made history when she reached the number of delegates needed to win the party nomination this week. That made her the first woman to lead a major U.S. party as its White House candidate. Obama, who enjoys rising approval ratings as he nears the end of eight years in office, will appear with Clinton on the campaign trail next week in Wisconsin. The two were opponents in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary race, which Obama won, but they buried their rivalry and she served as his secretary of state for four years. Clinton is the 2016 candidate who the White House believes will best safeguard Obamas legacy. I dont think theres ever been someone so qualified to hold this office, Obama said of Clinton in a video. Im with her. I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there and campaign for Hillary.  Trump assailed the endorsement on Twitter: He wants four more years of Obamabut nobody else does!  Clintons campaign tweeted a brash response: Delete your account. Sanders, who galvanized young voters with his calls for more social equality and measures to rein in Wall Street, has been reluctant to concede the race, despite concerns among leading Democrats that continuing party divisions could hamper Clintons efforts to beat Trump. Obama and other senior Democrats are seeking a delicate balance of rallying the party behind Clinton, while not alienating Sanders and his supporters. In what appeared to be an attempt to gently ease Sanders toward giving up his campaign, Obama met the democratic socialist for about an hour in the White House, laughing warmly as they walked into the Oval Office. Although Sanders told reporters afterward that he still planned to compete in the final nominating contest in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday, he said he would work with Clinton to defeat Trump.  Sanders was then welcomed on Capitol Hill by Senator Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate. Reid said the lawmaker from Vermont was in a good place with his Democratic colleagues. He suggested that Sanders was close to acknowledging defeat by Clinton. I didnt hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she is the nominee, I think hes accepted that, Reid told reporters. In the endorsement video, Obama recalled the party unity that followed his prolonged primary battle against Clinton in 2008. Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders may have been rivals during this primary, but theyre both patriots who love this country and they share a vision for an America that we all believe in, Obama said. Warren told MSNBC she was endorsing Clinton because a female fighter in the lead is exactly what this country needs. Warrens populist credentials will boost Clintons ability to court Sanders voters as she prepares to battle Trump. Warren was the only female Democratic U.S. senator who did not endorse Clinton during the primary race. Clinton told Reuters she and Warren had similar views about issues such as economic policy and protecting the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Warren pushed to start.  Trump said in an interview with Reuters last month that he would try to dismantle the Dodd-Frank law. In the interview with Reuters, Clinton said her overall economic package, including plans to rein in Wall Street and cut taxes for the middle class, would come during the first 100 days of her presidency if she defeats Trump. Clinton previously said a plan to generate jobs by investing in transportation and other infrastructure spending and immigration reform would be among other early priorities. One of the things that President Obama said yesterday is he thought his job was to remind the American people what a really serious job this is, the tough choices, the hard decisions, the high stakes in choosing a president and commander in chief, Clinton said. And I know how important it is to get off to a really good start in the White House, she said.     Trump, a wealthy real estate developer who became the partys presumptive nominee last month after seeing off a large group of rivals, is well behind Clintons campaign in terms of fundraising and policy infrastructure. On Thursday, his top donors were holding their first official meeting in New York. Trump also met with industry leaders in New York at an event organized by oil billionaire Harold Hamm.

U.S. House passes Puerto Rico debt relief bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Following months of internal wrangling, the U.S. House of Representatives, on Thursday passed legislation creating a federal control board to help Puerto Rico cope with crippling debt that is wreaking havoc throughout the islands economy. By a vote of 297-127, the House approved the bill, sending it to the Senate for consideration. Some leading Democratic senators have voiced concerns about provisions, including one that potentially could reduce the minimum wage for young Puerto Ricans. But given the overwhelming support in the House and a looming July 1 deadline for Puerto Rico to make a $1.9 billion debt payment, senators may be hesitant to delay or tinker very much with the bill. Following the House vote, the White House in a statement urged the Senate to act promptly so the president can sign the bill into law ahead of the critical July 1st debt payment deadline. The legislation was bolstered by rare bipartisan cooperation between the White House and the Houses Republicans and Democrats over the past six months. House Speaker Paul Ryan urged Congress to act quickly on the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), warning lawmakers of a deepening crisis on the island. Now the island is shutting down, Ryan said, with closed schools; hospitals are beginning to close, thats today. Tomorrow there could be policemen without cars, there could be blackouts at hospitals. Nevertheless, some lawmakers feared that allowing Puerto Rico to restructure its $70 billion debt in a way that changes the seniority of the creditors - for instance by making them all equal or subordinated to pensioners - would set a bad precedent for other U.S. states with debt problems. Puerto Rico does not enjoy Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, unlike the 50 U.S. states. The territory, which has a 45 percent poverty rate amid high unemployment, is also plagued by a growing migration of residents to the U.S. mainland. Puerto Ricos debt problems come as its government and healthcare industry struggle to contain the spread of the Zika virus, which is blamed for severe birth defects and other neurological diseases.  On Tuesday, Aeromed, the islands only active air ambulance company, announced it was suspending its services, blaming the large government debt.     The oversight board would be tasked with working with investors on restructuring the U.S. territorys $70 billion debt. Before passage, the House approved an amendment giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets. Representative Raul Grijalva, like many Democrats, criticized major elements of the bill but argued it was the best possible in the Republican-controlled Congress. The oversight board is too powerful and is yet another infringement on the sovereignty of the people of Puerto Rico and they are right to find it offensive, Grijalva said.   Despite its support for the overall bill, the White House noted that minimum wage and other labor provisions further exacerbate the economic disparities between Puerto Rico and the mainland United States and do nothing to address the (debt) crisis. Supporters praised PROMESA for not using taxpayer funds to help the island reschedule its debt. Failure to pass it, they warned, could put Congress in the difficult position of ultimately overseeing a massive bailout of Puerto Rico. But lawmakers have been buffeted by an opposition lobbying campaign by some hedge funds, which fear losing part of their investments from oversight board decisions. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
Emails in Clinton probe dealt with planned drone strikes: WSJ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Emails between U.S. diplomats in Islamabad and State Department officials in Washington about whether to challenge specific U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan are at the center of a criminal probe involving Hillary Clintons handling of classified information, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The 2011 and 2012 emails were sent via the low side -government slang for a computer system for unclassified matters - as part of a secret arrangement that gave the State Department more of a voice in whether a CIA drone strike went ahead, according to congressional and law enforcement officials briefed on the FBI probe, the Journal said. Some of the emails were then forwarded by Clintons aides to her personal email account, which routed them to a server she kept at her home in suburban New York when she was secretary of state, the officials said, according to the newspaper. Investigators have raised concerns that Clintons personal server was less secure than State Department systems, and a recent report by the State Department inspector general found that Clinton had broken government rules by using a private email server without approval, undermining Clintons earlier defenses of her emails.    The still-secret emails are a key part of the FBI investigation that has long dogged Clintons presidential campaign, the officials told the Journal. Clinton this week clinched the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election and was endorsed by President Barack Obama on Thursday. The White House rebuffed questions by reporters on Thursday on whether Obamas endorsement might be seen as unduly influencing a criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department involving Clinton. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama has reiterated his commitment to this principle that any criminal investigation should be conducted independent of any sort of political interference. The emails, which did not mention the CIA, drones or details about the militant targets, were written within the often-narrow time frame in which State Department officials had to decide whether or not to object to drone strikes before the CIA pulled the trigger, the officials said, according to the Journal. Law enforcement and intelligence officials said State Department deliberations about the covert CIA drone program should have been conducted over a more secure government computer system designed to handle classified information, the Journal reported.

S&P ratchets up pressure on Alaska over budget,"(Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings warned on Thursday that the credit rating for key Alaska bonds could go down if lawmakers fail to agree on a budget that addresses the states long term-fiscal problems.  Alaska Governor Bill Walker convened a special session of the legislature late last month aimed at passing a budget for fiscal 2017 and closing the states nearly $4 billion deficit, which has been driven by a collapse in global oil prices.  S&P on Thursday put the states AA-plus general obligation, AA appropriation, and A-plus moral obligation ratings on Alaskas debt on CreditWatch with negative implications.  The bond proceeds are expected to pay for several transportation-related projects.  The CreditWatch placement indicates that we may lower Alaskas credit rating if state policymakers defer adopting fiscal reforms to correct the states structural budget deficit, said Gabriel Petek, a S&P Global Ratings credit analyst.  Since the special session began late last month the legislature has passed a $4.4 billion spending plan for fiscal 2017 and a bill to reduce the cost of the states oil and gas tax credit program, S&P said.  But it is unclear if a hotly contested bill that would transfer money from the states permanent fund to its general fund will overcome opposition in the state House of Representatives. The bill, SB 128, would reduce the amount paid out to residents annually from the fund. Even if it passes, S&P said it remains to be seen whether SB 128 and other fiscal reforms would be sufficient to put Alaskas fiscal structure on a sustainable trajectory.  Enactment of SB 128 alone would shrink the deficit, but it wouldnt eliminate it. In order to fully close the structural fiscal gap, other measures  such as new income tax or more spending cuts  would also be necessary, S&P said.  Despite the budget deficit, S&P said Alaska continues to have very strong credit quality due to the large reserves it built up over times when oil prices were high.  ",politicsNews,"June 10, 2016 ",1
"U.S. Congress scrutinizes pay TV billing, competitive practices","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel disclosed Thursday it is investigating pay TV competition and customer service issues and will call executives from top cable and satellite providers to testify. The investigation comes as the U.S. cable and satellite TV industry ranks among the lowest in consumer surveys over billing and other practices.  Senators Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who chairs a panel on investigations and Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said in a statement Thursday that they will hold a June 23 hearing that will include testimony from Comcast Corp, Charter Communications, DirectTV, a unit of AT&T Inc and Dish Network Corp. The pair said in a joint statement the panel has been investigating the largest cable and satellite TV companies for more than a year, looking at potential barriers to competition in the industry, including the difficulties faced by companies attempting to create innovative new television delivery models.  The committee has also been examining billing, fees, refunds and other customer service issues. We believe our hearing will be a big step forward for consumers, allowing them to understand how their TV providers really work and make informed decisions about their video service, the pair said.  Comcast declined to comment. Charter, which completed its acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in May, said in a statement our overall customer satisfaction ratings are trending in the right direction. Call volume into our call centers is declining, as are service calls. The senators noted that a recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey found pay television service ranked near the bottom of the 43 industries surveyed - a year after the pay-TV industry tied for the lowest score among all industries ranked. The hearing follows a Federal Communications Commission proposal to allow consumers to swap pricey cable and other pay TV boxes for cheaper devices and apps, a change that would boost competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. The proposal would let customers get video services from providers like Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo Inc. It set off a lobbying battle between tech companies eager to tap into the market and cable and TV companies which could lose billions of dollars in rental fees. The FCC says 99 percent of U.S. customers now must get their boxes from their cable companies, and they pay on average $231 a year to lease the devices. Cable companies say the video marketplace is already evolving as more customers replace traditional pay TV services with streaming internet video. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
"Bernie Sanders-style, grassroots effort a likely model, say Trump donors","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps presidential campaign is likely to launch a small donor fundraising effort akin to the grassroots one that powered another insurgent presidential contender, Democrat Bernie Sanders, according to two top donors who attended the first official meeting of Trumps national finance team.  The Trump finance machine kickoff took place at New York Citys Four Seasons Hotel amid growing concerns about the Republican presidential candidates lack of a campaign infrastructure heading into a Nov. 8 election battle against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The pitch to this group in the room was a traditional pitch, but the backroom discussion was, because of this being a populist movement, theres going to be significant outreach to, you know, those who give $1, $2, $20, said Trump Texas fundraising co-chairman Gaylord Hughey. Theres a huge opportunity there. Sanders, who has effectively lost the 2016 presidential nomination to Clinton, broke fundraising records during his long-shot bid for the presidency, collecting more than $210 million through more than 7.4 million individual contributions, averaging $27 apiece.    Trump could well find his supporters eager to pitch in $1, $5 or $20. For a story in May, Reuters found that nearly all three dozen Trump supporters it interviewed were not only unmoved by Trumps about-face to accept money from outside donors, they said they would also happily contribute. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment about replicating the fundraising apparatus of Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont. Some donors were fearful of the late start of Thursdays gathering. Normally such a meeting would take place two years earlier in a candidates campaign. But others in attendance said they left assured that Trump would be able to easily plug into the Republican National Committees robust infrastructure. Trump, a wealthy businessman, became the presumptive Republican nominee last month after seeing off 16 rivals in a largely self-funded primary campaign. The gathering featured talks by Trump, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, chief strategist Paul Manafort, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, former rival-turned-ally Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Republican fundraisers Ray Washburne and Lew Eisenberg. Trumps late start on fundraising has raised questions about whether he can achieve his previously stated aim of raising $1 billion before November. On the Democratic side, Clintons well-oiled operation is well ahead of schedule. Trump is alsopulling back from his earlier statements on his fundraising goal. Campaign manager Lewandowski told Reuters on Wednesday that he sees no need for Trump to raise that sum and that Trump may be able to stick to his low-cost style of campaigning. That includes garnering free media, which is estimated will reach a value of $5 billion by November, according to media analytics firm mediaQuant. That is more than double what Clinton is likely to get, mediaQuant says. While Trump shot to the top of the Republican race with freewheeling rhetoric, insults of rivals and promises to get tough on issues such as illegal immigration, even his biggest donors say they are discouraged by the candidates attacks in recent weeks on a Mexican-American judge. In comments that have been widely condemned, Trump has suggested that U.S. Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a case against Trump University, has an inherent bias because of his heritage. He needs to stop the campaign infighting, shut up and stop calling an American who was born in Indiana a Mexican, said Texas billionaire Doug Deason. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
"Clinton tells Trump: 'Delete your account,' fueling Twitter war","(Reuters) - The U.S. presidential election battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has barely begun but their Twitter war is on. After receiving President Barack Obamas endorsement on Thursday to succeed him in the White House, Clinton, who this week clinched the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 election, tweeted she was honored to have his support and fired up and ready to go. Trump, who has made extensive use of Twitter during his insurgent Republican presidential campaign, took the opportunity to tweet back: Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obamabut nobody else does! Clintons account quickly responded: Delete your account, in a tweet to her 6.7 million Twitter followers. Within minutes, the phrase, a popular form of online dismissal, became Clintons most popular tweet ever, with more than 194,000 retweets and 213,000 likes.  Prominent Republicans rushed to their presumptive nominees aid, taking thinly veiled shots at Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state.  .@HillaryClinton If anyone knows how to use a delete key, its you, tweeted Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.   Clinton has repeatedly said she chose not to keep some 30,000 emails her lawyers deemed personal, which has been widely interpreted as meaning she deleted the personal emails. Trump later rejoined the battle, tweeting: How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that upand where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted? ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
U.S. representatives question bank regulator on whistleblowers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the congressional committee that investigates data breaches and computer hacking blasted the main U.S. banking regulator on Thursday for possibly jeopardizing the work of its inspector general, an internal watchdog, and hunting out potential whistleblowers.  Part of the House Science Committee for months has been looking into the theft of thousands of records from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, including two breaches in which workers downloaded more than 10,000 sensitive and private records onto portable storage devices before leaving the agencys employ. In a letter to FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, Lamar Smith, the committees chairman, and Barry Loudermilk, chairman of the subcommittee on oversight, described an agency slow to cooperate with lawmakers that fails to conduct good faith searches for requested information. Moreover, the two, both Republicans, said the FDIC had gathered and reviewed internal communications of its inspector generals office while collecting documents that the committee had requested.  By law, inspectors general are independent. They function as the ethical and legal consciences of federal agencies, rooting out fraud and mismanagement, often with information provided confidentially by employees. Not only is the committee troubled that the FDIC continues to withhold pertinent and responsive information to its cybersecurity posture, it is even more concerned by the FDICs gathering and review of the inspector general offices internal communications, they wrote. That could compromise the inspector generals ability to conduct its work in a manner uninhibited by the very agency it was created to oversee, they added. The FDIC was not immediately available to comment. When the committee received documents from the FDIC earlier this week, the lawmakers said, it noticed a distinct watermark included on each page.  Given the committees concerns about potential retaliation against whistleblowers discussed in previous letters to the FDIC, the FDICs inclusion of a novel watermark raises serious questions about whether the agency it attempting to identify the source of committee materials, they said. They added that some of the watermarked pages covered communications between the inspector general and FDIC employees, raising concerns that the agency is attempting to identify confidential informants. The committee is demanding that the FDIC send it information on actions to protect whistleblowers and inspector general communications by Monday, June 13. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1

Michigan lawmakers approve Detroit school rescue package,"(Reuters) - Legislation approved by Michigan lawmakers on Thursday to bail out the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) will keep the district operating, but falls short on funding to fix its crumbling buildings, according to school officials. The bill package, approved over objections by Democratic lawmakers, creates a new, debt-free district governed by an elected school board, while leaving the current district in place solely to levy property taxes to pay off outstanding debt. DPS, which has nearly 46,000 students, has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency. The American Federation of Teachers-Michigan and Detroit Federation of Teachers criticized the lack of a bipartisan compromise in a joint statement on Thursday. These bills are a statement by non-Detroit Republicans that they know what is best for Detroit, a city that is overwhelmingly people of color, the groups said. It has been this attitude that resulted in Detroit Public Schools massive debt, low academic performance and a wild west system of school openings. Under the measures approved on Thursday, Michigan would commit $617 million from the states share of a tobacco settlement in annual increments of $72 million for the new Detroit Community School District. An emergency state loan for transition costs was capped at $150 million, with only $25 million of that amount available for capital improvements, less than the overall $200 million sought by DPS. We also look forward to working creatively with the governors office, the state superintendent, and the Michigan Department of Education to identify the remainder of the critical resources necessary to educate our students, DPS state-appointed transition manager Steven Rhodes said in a statement. A smaller bailout passed by the House in May raised concerns that DPS would run out of cash later this summer. Republican lawmakers contended the final $617 million bailout legislation would prevent DPS from filing for municipal bankruptcy even though Rhodes, a former federal bankruptcy judge, has said such a move would be ineffective because much of the districts debt is guaranteed by the state. Democrats objected to the absence of a Detroit Education Commission to oversee the opening and closing of public and charter schools in Detroit. The House and Senate approved the package with a series of votes late Wednesday and early Thursday, sending the legislation to the desk of Republican Governor Rick Snyder, who signaled in a statement that he supports it.

House committee moves to cut funding for financial regulators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to slash funding for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service and other financial regulators passed a key committee in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a long partisan fight. The expansive legislation would also place a halt on the payday lending restrictions that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently proposed. The Appropriations Committee voted 30-17 to approve the bill allocating funds for financial services and general government, which now goes to the full House. One of the committees senior Democrats, Jose Serrano of New York, warned that the bill in its current form will be vetoed.  The Senate must still pass accompanying legislation. After that, both chambers will reconcile their bills into a single piece for President Barack Obama to sign or veto. Congress has tangled over budget laws for years, and federal agencies frequently rely on temporary continuing resolutions for funding. Republicans cast the bill as a way to streamline agencies and hold them accountable for spending decisions, while saving taxpayer money. Democrats attacked what they called riders to the bill, such as a measure to stop the Federal Communications Commissions net neutrality rule and one to prevent corporations from being required to disclose political donations. They also said cuts to the SEC would hobble the agency in carrying out its duties and implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Earlier this month the CFPB, charged with shielding consumers from financial fraud, proposed rules to limit short-term borrowings known as payday loans, which can charge interest as high as 390 percent. Critics say the proposal will cut off credit to poor people who may need small loans during emergencies. Representative Steven Palazzo, a Mississippi Republican, proposed an amendment on Thursday to delay implementing the rules until the bureau reports to Congress on their possible effects, saying he was concerned they could force people to turn to loan sharks.  Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been one of the few members of her party to oppose the rules, and had sponsored a bill to delay CFPB rules for two years.  Wasserman Schultz, who is also a U.S. representative from Florida, reversed her position in the last week. She told the hearing on Thursday the proposal is inarguably a step in the right direction, adding, I stand with the CFPB in its efforts to protect Americans from predatory lending.

U.S. top court deals blow to Puerto Rico sovereignty claim,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Puerto Rico cannot pursue charges against people for the same crime that federal authorities have already prosecuted them, dealing a blow to the U.S. territorys claim that while it is not a state it should be treated like one. The court ruled 6-2 in favor of defendants Luis Sanchez Valle and Jaime Gomez Vazquez, who were charged with illegally selling guns in 2008 by Puerto Rican authorities as well as federal prosecutors. The two pleaded guilty to the federal charges and then argued that Puerto Ricos indictments should be dismissed because of the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution that bars people from being prosecuted twice for the same offense. A trial judge dismissed the Puerto Rico charges, but they were reinstated by an appeals court. In a March 2015 ruling, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled against prosecutors, prompting the territory to appeal to the high court. On its surface, the case was about criminal law. But it also raised questions about the extent to which the Caribbean island, which has been a U.S. territory since 1898, has sovereign powers akin to any of the 50 U.S. states. The double jeopardy clause allows U.S. states and the federal government to prosecute people separately for the same actions because they are separate sovereign entities. The Supreme Court, in a ruling authored by Justice Elena Kagan, said that the original source of power for Puerto Ricos Constitution came from the U.S. Congress, via a 1950 law. Put simply, Congress conferred the authority to create the Puerto Rico Constitution, which in turn confers the authority to bring criminal charges, Kagan wrote. Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, and Stephen Breyer dissented. Some experts saw the federal governments argument against treating Puerto Rico as a separate governmental entity as having implications for another issue: how to deal with the territorys debt crisis. In such a scenario, that argument could help establish a legal precedent that Puerto Rico is not a sovereign entity, possibly to justify imposing a federal control board or some other mechanism to address Puerto Ricos roughly $70 billion in debt.The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation on the issue. The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of the month in another case involving Puerto Ricos bid to revive a law that would allow it to cut billions of dollars in debt at public utilities in a key test in its quest to weather its crisis.

House Speaker Ryan security agenda veers from Trump's,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled a national security policy featuring stronger defense on Thursday, part of his agenda to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign, but softening some of the hard lines taken by the partys presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump. The plan is sharply critical of President Barack Obama, blaming the Democrat for eight years of broken promises, concessions, and retreat in the Syrian civil war, nuclear deal with Iran, chilly relations with Russia and dealings with a bellicose North Korea. It would overturn or back away from what Obama allies see as his foreign policy achievements, including the Iran deal and his moves toward normal relations with Communist-ruled Cuba. And it criticizes efforts to close the Guantanamo detention center. Its not too much to say that our enemies no longer fear us and too many of our allies no longer trust us. And I think this is a direct result of the presidents foreign policy, Ryan said as he and other House Republicans introduced the plan at the Council on Foreign Relations. While not providing figures, the plan also calls for an end to military rollbacks and demands adequate, predictable budgets. Trump, whom Ryan has endorsed in the presidential race, has made a promise to erect a massive wall along the Mexican border - a centerpiece of his campaign. The plan announced on Thursday includes a range of border security measures such as high fencing, aerial surveillance and radar, but not a large wall. The plan echoes some of Trumps concerns about Muslim immigrants, with calls to tighten refugee screening and discussion of ways to prevent the radicalization of youths. We must constantly reassess our defenses in order to find and close security gaps so that Islamist militants cannot slip into our country undetected, Ryans plan said. Representative Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, said the intention was not to target followers of any one religion, but to do everything possible to not admit those who would attack Americans. What we have to do is target the threat and make sure that they dont come in, said McCaul, one of several Republican committee chairmen who joined Ryan at the report presentation. The plan is not isolationist. It takes a strong line on battling militants abroad, saying the United States must keep all options on the table and eliminate terrorist sanctuaries.  Trump has been critical of some U.S. alliances. Ryans plan, in contrast, underscores the importance of NATO. It also includes many standard Republican policy prescriptions, such as strong ties to Israel, advocacy of severe sanctions on Iran and an insistence that Washington should stand up to Russia. It also calls for more trade agreements and says foreign aid programs should make recipient countries self-sufficient. The plan calls for increased security for diplomats and facilities overseas. In that context, it mentions the 2012 attacks on Benghazi, which many Republicans cite to criticize then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trumps rival in the White House race. Several of Thursdays speakers criticized Clinton as they blasted Obamas foreign policy, because she was the nations top diplomat during the first four years of his term.  Democrats sought to tie the plan to some of Trumps most controversial statements, including his rejection of alliances like NATO, advocacy of waterboarding and calls for attacks on the families of terrorist suspects. Perhaps this agenda is light on details because the Republican presidential candidate has offered a truly disturbing vision of Americas role in the world, Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. Ryan, the countrys highest-ranking elected Republican, has described the agenda as a way to offer voters a coherent policy message for 2017. He unveiled an anti-poverty agenda on Monday. Initiatives on regulation, constitutional authority, healthcare and tax reform are expected in the coming weeks. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
"Sanders praises Obama, Biden for impartiality, to meet with Clinton soon","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Thursday thanked President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for maintaining impartiality during the primary process, and said he would meet with rival Hillary Clinton soon to discuss ways to defeat Republican candidate Donald Trump. Speaking at the White House following a meeting with President Obama, a Democrat, Sanders praised Obama and Biden for not thumbing the scales by endorsing a candidate during the primary season, and said he would do everything he could to stop Trump from succeeding Obama in the November election.

"Sanders returns to Washington, meets with Obama on next steps","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders returned to Washington for meetings on Thursday with President Barack Obama and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid as Democrats pressured him to end his presidential campaign and support Hillary Clinton after a hard-fought primary race. Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, secured enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination this week and become the first woman to lead a major U.S. party as its presidential nominee. Despite Clintons commanding victories in California and New Jersey in presidential contests on Tuesday, Sanders vowed to carry his populist campaign to the Democratic National Convention in July, when the partys nominee is formally chosen. Obama, who is expected to endorse Clinton soon, was scheduled to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday at 11:15 a.m. (1515 GMT). Sanders will meet with Reid, his Senate colleague, in the afternoon. The Sanders campaign, which waged an unexpectedly strong challenge to a better-known and better-funded Democrat, has decried what it called Clintons anointment by the party establishment and the media. In an interview taped on Wednesday for broadcast on the NBCs Tonight show on Thursday, Obama said he hoped that divisions between Democrats would start to heal in coming weeks now that Clinton has clinched the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. At a fund-raiser in New York City on Wednesday, Obama said he was not too worried about bruised feelings after the primary and said it was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary. Obama praised Sanders, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont, for bringing new energy and ideas to the party. He pushed the party and challenged them, he said. I thought it made Hillary a better candidate. Democrats are striking a delicate balance between the need to unite behind Clinton in the looming battle against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and not alienating Sanders and his supporters. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself a progressive known as a fiery critic of Wall Street, is preparing to endorse Clinton in the coming weeks after staying neutral in the Democratic primary, people familiar with her thinking told Reuters.

"Exclusive: Clinton ally Warren weighs potential VP role, sees hurdles - sources","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has considered the idea of serving as Hillary Clintons running mate but sees obstacles to that choice as she prepares to endorse the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, several people familiar with Warrens thinking told Reuters. While her thinking could evolve, Warren has concerns about joining a Clinton ticket, including the question of whether running two women would give the Democrats the best shot at defeating Republican Donald Trump, one source said.       Advisers to Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street and a  popular figure among progressive Democrats, have been in close contact with Clintons campaign team and the conversations have increased in frequency in recent weeks, the sources said. Warren has signaled to people close to her that she is intrigued by the possibility of being Clintons No. 2 but has not discussed the role with Clinton, 68, or anyone else from her campaign, the people said.  Warren, 66, has been one of the Democrats most outspoken critics of Trump, 69, and her priority is helping to defeat the presumptive Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 presidential election, the sources said.  Warren is also committed to advancing her own political agenda, which they described as more progressive than Clintons more centrist positions. Warren fears that as vice president, or in a cabinet position, her voice could be less heard than it is in the U.S. Senate on her priority issues such as addressing income inequality, the sources said.   In the past, Warren has accused Clinton of abandoning her support for stronger bankruptcy legislation to try to appease Wall Street.  An endorsement of Clinton could come within a week or two, one of the sources said. Clinton has been appealing for Democratic Party unity. On Twitter over the weekend, Warren echoed that call and emphasized the importance of the party coming together to beat Trump. Get ready, Donald, Warren tweeted. Were coming. Warren, who represents Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate,   has stayed neutral in the Democratic primary race, notably remaining the only woman senator not throwing her support behind the first woman presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party. Were she to join the Clinton ticket, she could help energize progressives and win over supporters of Clintons rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont. Sanders calls for reining in Wall Street and breaking up big banks dovetail with Warrens views. An ongoing feud with Trump gained steam on social media with a series of posts in which she labeled the celebrity businessman racist, sexist and xenophobic and said she was going to fight to make sure his toxic stew of hatred and insecurity never reaches the White House. Warren joined Clinton late last month in criticizing Trump for rooting for the 2008 financial crisis and delivered a 10-minute invective on the subject at an annual Washington gala two weeks ago. What kind of a man roots for people to get thrown out of their house? Ill tell you exactly what kind of man does that, Warren said. It is a man who cares about no one but himself - a small insecure money-grubber who doesnt care who gets hurt so long as he makes a profit off it. Trump has ridiculed Warren by calling her Pocahontas in a mocking reference to her having said in the past that she had Native American ancestry. Pocahontas was a famous Native American in early colonial Virginia. Warren is due to speak to the American Constitution Society, a progressive legal group, on Thursday at a time when Democrats and some Republicans have criticized Trumps comments about Mexican-American Judge Gonzalo Curiel.

Wooing Sanders supporters will be tough task for Clinton,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Winning over Bernie Sanders supporters who flocked to his insurgent presidential campaign will be the first and possibly toughest order of business for Hillary Clinton after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this week. Every time the Vermont senator mentioned Clintons name at a rally in California on Thursday night, his supporters booed as if she was Donald Trump, the Republican businessman who will face off against Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. But Clinton is wasting no time in launching her charm offensive. She called Sanders on Tuesday night, and during a celebratory rally in Brooklyn she praised his candidacy, saying their vigorous debate during the nominating contest had been good for the Democratic Party.  Democrats in both camps said they expect to see more specific olive branches offered to Sanders in the weeks ahead, including compromises on the issues platform to be adopted at the partys July nominating convention and reforms in a Democratic primary process that Sanders criticized as rigged to favor the establishment. It may not be an easy sell for all of Sanders supporters, who have helped catapult him from political obscurity into the national spotlight, cheering his message on income inequality, campaign finance reform and Wall Street excesses. Given little chance a year ago, Sanders earned nearly 10 million votes and won more than 20 states during the nominating process. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in May found Sanders supporters have become increasingly resistant to Clinton in the past few months, with less than half saying they will vote for her if she becomes the partys nominee. Last month, 41 percent of Sanders supporters said they would vote for Clinton over Trump in the general election. But that was down from 50 percent in April, and 52 percent in March. And some groups supporting Sanders plan to ramp up the pressure on superdelegates, prominent party officials who can vote for any candidate, in the last few weeks before Clintons nomination becomes official at the party convention in Philadelphia.  The people behind the Occupy DNC Convention Facebook group, with around 25,000 members, are creating their own web-based app to contact superdelegates, planning daily emails to urge them to switch to Sanders. Clinton moved to the left to fend off Sanders during the primary battle, opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Asian trade pact, and the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada, voicing support for a higher minimum wage and backing Sanders general goals of reining in Wall Street and reducing income inequality. Her best move now to win over progressive voters who backed Sanders would be showing she will stand behind those positions. One of the biggest points of skepticism that we hear from Sanders supporters and even lukewarm Clinton supporters is the question of whether she really meant the stuff she said in the primary, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. The next two weeks are a golden opportunity to make the answer apparent, he said, citing her pledges to seek criminal sentences for financial fraud, break up banksthat pose economic risks and expand Social Security benefits. Several Democrats said Trump may prove to be the chief motivator for Sanders supporters to switch to Clinton. Trump has done more than anyone to push the Sanders people toward Clinton for the general election, said Brad Anderson, an Iowa-based Democratic strategist who supported Clinton in the primary and said he has seen signs of a shift in the last few weeks. Clinton could make specific concessions or overtures to assuage Sanders, particularly by eliminating the superdelegates from the primary process. Sanders has complained about the involvement of superdelegates, who have heavily backed Clinton. Another easy way to get Sanders most passionate supporters on board is to simply hire them, says Democratic strategist Steve Schale. Thats what Schale, a Florida-based staffer for President Barack Obamas 2008 presidential campaign, did once the bitter primary fight between Obama and Clinton ended that year. Florida was crucial to Obamas prospects  and his campaign need a large operation to work on voter registration, persuasion, and turnout. Clinton could offer Sanders diehards a similar opportunity to stay involved. For a lot of these folks, the campaign is as much as social calling as it is a movement, he said. While there were concerns in 2008 that Clintons supporters would be too disaffected to support Obama, Clinton endorsed him less than a month after the primary ended and unified the party. Democratic party leaders may also help ease tensions. Sanders will meet on Thursday with Obama and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
Judge issues final order upholding Alabama same-sex marriage,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Alabama has issued a permanent injunction barring state officials from denying same-sex couples the right to marry in that state, according to court documents made public on Wednesday.  The order, filed on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Callie Granade, came in response to a 2014 lawsuit challenging Alabamas ban on same-sex marriage, finalizing a decision Granade made in early 2015 that the state law was unconstitutional.  The legality of gay marriage was at the center of a national debate until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that the U.S. Constitution provided same-sex couples the right to marry. Despite that order, Alabama officials continued to resist the change in the law.  Last month, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended for issuing an administrative order to state probate judges that they should not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In March, the Alabama Supreme Court dismissed petitions by opponents of same-sex marriage asking to reinstate the ban on those unions but refused to vacate or withdraw its own March 2015 ruling in favor of the same-sex marriage ban, made just months before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. This brings a finality by permanently prohibiting Alabama from enforcing its marriage laws which are discriminating against gay couples, said Susan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. Given Alabamas fierce resistance, this permanent relief was required to ensure marriage equality in the state. Officials from the office of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who is named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.  Stranges attorneys had asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed because the state was currently complying with the federal law.  But Granade said in her ruling that promising to sin no more did not render a permanent injunction unnecessary. The actions of the suspended chief justice and other officials suggested that other attempts may be made to undermine the constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry, she wrote. It cannot be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that Alabamas unconstitutional marriage laws will not again be enforced, the order said. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
Three teenagers arrested over assaults during California Trump protest,"(Reuters) - Three teenagers were arrested on Wednesday and accused of three separate assaults during a demonstration that turned violent outside a rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump last week in San Jose, California, police said.  The three unidentified juveniles, all males, were accused of taking part in a number of skirmishes between Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators last Thursday outside the San Jose Convention Center. Trump held a rally there in the lead-up to Tuesdays California primary for the Republican partys presidential nomination. Two of the teenagers, aged 16 and 17, face charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon. The third, also 16, faces a misdemeanor battery charge, the San Jose Police Department said in a statement. One of the teenagers is accused of using a blunt object to strike a victim from behind. The victim suffered visible injuries, according to police.  Four others were arrested during the protests last week. Two 19-year-olds and an 18-year-old face charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon, while another 19-year-old faces a misdemeanor charge of refusal to disperse.  It is unclear whether the seven charged were Trump supporters or among the hundreds of protesters who were seen on news clips waving Mexican flags, chanting anti-Trump slogans, and burning Trump hats and at least one U.S. flag.  Protesters, many angry over Trumps comments against illegal immigration, have gathered at his rallies for months. Trump, now the Republican Partys presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, canceled a rally in Chicago in March after clashes broke out between his supporters and protesters.

California voting expert bares naked truth about politics,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Political consultants are sometimes accused of hiding the naked truth about the candidates they represent or the campaigns they devise. But California voting expert Paul Mitchell bared it all after Tuesdays primary election, running naked around the grounds of the state Capitol building in Sacramento after his prediction in a key race turned out to be wrong. When improbable things happen, some pay consequences, Mitchell posted on Twitter early on Wednesday morning. Along with the posting was a photo of the darkened Capitol, a map of a running route from the athletic tracking app Strava and the title, Streaking. Last year, Mitchell firmly dismissed predictions that two Democrats would be chosen in Tuesdays primary to vie for the states open U.S. Senate seat in November. He was so sure that would not happen - despite a change in the states open primary law advancing the top two vote-getters to the general election regardless of party affiliation - that he vowed to run naked around the Capitol if two Democrats were chosen.  When it became clear on Tuesday night that state Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez, both Democrats, topped the polls and would advance to the general election, Mitchell knew what he had to do. He parked his car in front of the Capitol building in downtown Sacramento in the darkest spot he could find, took off his clothes (including shoes) and ran, he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.     I couldnt put up with all the badgering I would get if I didnt do it, he said. Theres honor among politicos, I guess. He managed to maintain his privacy to all but a couple of youths on skateboards. It really doesnt seem like its very dark outside when youre streaking, Mitchell said. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
U.S. House Speaker Ryan offers election-year security agenda,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled a national security policy featuring stronger defense on Thursday, the next step in a conservative policy agenda rolling out as he works to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign. The plan is sharply critical of President Barack Obama, blaming the Democrat for eight years of broken promises, concessions, and retreat in the Syrian civil war, nuclear deal with Iran, chilly relations with Russia and dealings with a bellicose North Korea. It would overturn some of what Obama allies consider his foreign policy achievements, including the Iran deal and his moves toward normal relations with Communist-ruled Cuba. And it criticizes efforts to close the Guantanamo detention center. While not providing figures, it also calls for an end to military rollbacks and demands adequate, predictable budgets. The blueprint includes several departures from foreign policy statements by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom Ryan has endorsed in the White House race. It does not demand the erection of a massive wall along the Mexican border, a centerpiece of Trumps campaigning. Ryan calls for border security measures including high fencing, aerial surveillance and radar. But it echoes some of Trumps concerns about Muslim immigrants, with calls to tighten refugee screening and discussion of ways not to radicalize youths. Trump sparked outrage by promising to temporarily ban Muslims from the United States. We must constantly reassess our defenses in order to find and close security gaps so that Islamist militants cannot slip into our country undetected, Ryans plan said. The plan is not isolationist. It takes a strong line on battling militants abroad, saying the United States must keep all options on the table and eliminate terrorist sanctuaries.  Trump has been critical of some U.S. alliances. Ryans plan, in contrast, underscores the importance of NATO, calls ties to Israel the cornerstone of stability in the Middle East, advocates severe sanctions on Iran and says the United States should stand up to Russian aggression while bolstering Ukraine. It also calls for more trade agreements and says foreign aid programs should make recipient countries self-sufficient. The plan calls for increased security for diplomats and facilities overseas. In that context, it mentions the 2012 attacks on Benghazi, which many Republicans cite to criticize then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trumps rival in the White House race.

Puerto Rico debt bill cleared for Thursday U.S. House vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation helping Puerto Rico dig out of its $70 billion debt crisis is set for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a House panel fended off attempts to open the bill to a series of controversial amendments. By voice vote on Wednesday, the Rules Committee, the gatekeeper for bills moving through the House, sent the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to the full House for debate and a likely vote on Thursday. The legislation, the result of months of negotiations between Congress and the Obama administration, would create a federal oversight board to work with investors to determine how much they would recover of the island territorys $70 billion in loans. Republicans have stressed that no taxpayer money would be used to bail out Puerto Rico from a crisis that has left nearly half of the population in poverty amid closings of schools and hospitals and a contracting economy. During a Rules panel debate that stretched into the night, the committee rejected pleas to allow amendments that would have changed the basic structure of the legislation and the operation of the oversight board. If the bill passes the House, action would move to the Senate, where some leading Democrats have said they would seek significant changes. Earlier on Wednesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, who ushered the bill through his committee on May 25, told reporters he expected the full House to pass it on Thursday. Bishop, a Utah Republican, said a strong vote for passage in the House would help propel it through the Senate. The bottom line is the better the vote here (in the House), the less likely its going to come back in a significantly altered form from the Senate, Bishop said. Supporters hope to get it enacted into law before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment that it might not be able to fulfill. The House Rules Committee voted to allow debate on a limited number of amendments, including one giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets. Another amendment expected to be debated would expand a federal program aimed at encouraging economic development in Puerto Ricos under-utilized business zones. Representative Raul Grijalva, a senior Democrat who worked on the bill, said Puerto Ricos debt crisis, if unaddressed, could grow into a humanitarian crisis. Stabilization measures contained in the bill, he said, would be the first step toward getting the situation under control. But his fellow Democrat, Puerto Rican-born Representative Luis Gutierrez, warned, I dont think many of my colleagues in this body appreciate just how deeply offensive the bill before us is regarded in Puerto Rico. He was particularly concerned with the way control board members would be chosen, with most not having to have any ties to the island. But Gutierrez failed to convince the committee to allow amendments to be offered making changes to the board and its operations. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
Obama hopes for quick party healing after 'ouchy' Democratic primary,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he hoped that divisions between Democrats would start to heal in coming weeks, now that his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has clinched the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. My hope is that over the next couple of weeks were able to pull things together, Obama said in his first public remarks since primary election wins on Tuesday in California and elsewhere propelled Clinton to victory over rival Bernie Sanders after a hard-fought, months-long campaign.    What happens during primaries is you get a little ouchy, Obama told NBC late-night host Jimmy Fallon during a taping of The Tonight Show set to air on Thursday. Sanders, who has not conceded the race, is set to meet with Obama at the White House on Thursday at 11:15 a.m. (1515 GMT). Later, at a fundraiser in the Central Park West apartment of Kenneth Lerer, a venture capitalist and chairman of the BuzzFeed medial company, Obama said he was not too worried about bruised feelings left over from the primary. We just ended - sort of ended - our primary season, Obama said, catching his mistake as the crowd of about 60 Democratic donors, who paid up to $33,400 to attend, laughed nervously. I am concerned about us doing the hard nuts-and-bolts work of turning out people to vote, particularly young people, particularly low-income people, Obama said. Asked whether Obama thought Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, should quickly end his campaign, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the senator had more than earned the right to make his own decision about the course of his campaign. The party will officially vote on Clintons nomination at its convention in Philadelphia at the end of July. Obama told Fallon that it was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary and praised Sanders for the enormous energy and new ideas he brought to the campaign. He pushed the party and challenged them. I thought it made Hillary a better candidate, Obama said. The White House has said Obama, who is very popular among Democrats, will play a unifying role on the campaign trail. The main role Im going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people that this is a serious job. This is not reality TV, Obama told Fallon in a swipe at presumptive Republican nominee and real estate magnate Donald Trump, who starred in a reality television show. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
New York mayor strives to stay the course as probe queries persist,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corruption charges against a union leader and a financierstemming from state and federal investigations that include an examination of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasios campaign fundraising practices are casting a cloud over his office and could possibly complicate his re-election bid. The arrests on Wednesday of the head of New York Citys prison guard union and a hedge fund financier accused of orchestrating a bribery scheme involving union retirement and operating funds were the first to emerge from the probes. Although the charges were not linked to de Blasio, who won a landslide victory in 2013, the case is the first major prosecution to emerge from several overlapping state and federal corruption probes examining de Blasios fundraising practices, among other avenues of inquiry.  David Birdsell, dean of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, said on Wednesday the investigations were keeping him off message, noting that de Blasio was on occasion having to avoid the press because of incessant questions. On Wednesday his office said the investigations were not distracting the mayor. New Yorkers will vote for the candidate who gets things done for their families and communities, said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for de Blasio. That person is Mayor de Blasio. Still, there is evidence that the investigations are affecting the mayors standing, Birdsell said.  If they drag on and raise more questions they will not only be a distraction for the mayor but possibly encourage a challenge from his own party.  Right now people smell some blood in the water, Birdsell said. He said if the mayor becomes directly implicated in the investigations it would turn a contested Democratic primary mayoral race next year into a certainty from a likelihood. On Wednesday at a public appearance, de Blasio reiterated that he was absolutely comfortable that we have done things properly. He has said his administration committed no wrongdoing and is cooperating fully with investigators. In April, de Blasios office received subpoenas from state and federal prosecutors pursuing coordinated corruption probes that extended from City Hall to the police department. News of the subpoenas came days after a leaked January report from the state Board of Elections accusing the mayor and others of intentionally evading campaign finance contribution limits in 2014. The mayors counsel said at the time de Blasio had not been personally served. The once popular de Blasio, who struck a cord with New Yorkers after 12 years of Michael Bloombergs mayoralty, has seen his approval rating fall to a new low in May, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  De Blasio will be up for re-election in 2017. The latest poll, conducted in the first week of June among 600 likely Democratic mayoral primary voters and published on Wednesday, showed 38 percent believed de Blasio deserved reelection while 43 percent said he did not.  The poll was conducted by NYC Deserves Better, a group formed by Bradley Tusk, a businessman and former campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg who wants a new mayor to be elected. The poll found that in a potential match up, de Blasio was neck-and-neck with City Comptroller Scott Stringer.  However, the poll also found that 51 percent had a very positive or somewhat positive opinion of the mayor, and 32 percent had a somewhat negative or very negative opinion. De Blasio brushed off questions about the poll and said he was committed to focusing on the job.  Polls come and go. They go up. They go down. They dont always reflect what happens in elections, he said. I believe fundamentally that the goal is to do the work, do it well ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1
Ohio governor signs bill legalizing medical marijuana,"(Reuters) - Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich on Wednesday signed a bill legalizing marijuana use for medical purposes under certain circumstances, his office said. Over the last few years, state legislatures and voters in the United States have been much more receptive to making marijuana legal for medical purposes, and to a lesser extent, recreational use. The Ohio legislature approved the measure in May. Some 24 states and Washington D.C. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use, and just a handful of states allow its recreational use. It remains illegal on the federal level. Kasich, who earlier this year dropped out of the U.S. presidential race, signed the bill but provided no statement on Wednesday.  The Ohio legislation only allows patients with specific medical conditions to use an oil, edible, tincture or vapor form of marijuana prescribed by a physician licensed in the state, starting in 2017. Medical marijuana users would not be allowed to smoke or grow their own marijuana under the measure, which also would create a commission responsible for regulating and licensing of all operations of the drug. The measure was fast-tracked to head off a possible less-restrictive medical marijuana ballot initiative in November. Ohioans for Medical Marijuana suspended their campaign for the ballot measure late last month, saying that while the lawmakers bill had its shortcomings, it was a moderately good piece of legislation. Last November, Ohio voters soundly rejected a measure that would have made it the first U.S. Midwestern state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. The proposal was criticized for allowing the main backers of the proposal cartel-like powers over the industry in the state for several years. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
New York City reaches agreement on $82.1 billion FY 2017 budget,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Yorks Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Wednesday an agreement on a balanced $82.1 billion city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year that boosts reserves and expands a summer youth employment program.  The agreement was reached with New Yorks City Council and comes well ahead of a July 1 deadline. De Blasio, a Democrat, said it was the earliest agreement since 2001 and credited the cooperation between his administration and the City Council. The agreement increases reserves, with an additional $250 million to grow the Retiree Health Benefits Trust Fund to $3.9 billion. It includes $1 billion every year in general reserves, and $500 million in the capital stabilization reserve. The budget highlights de Blasios social mission. The executive budget, presented in April, dedicated $2 billion to overhauling the citys $7.5 billion public hospital system, which treat around 1.4 million people per year. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and other council members hailed the expansion of the citys summer youth work program to 60,000 at a press conference at City Hall. The program places young people aged 14-24 with community organizations for summer employment. The budget agreement comes at a difficult time for de Blasio who is facing multiple investigations into his campaign finances.  On Wednesday the head of New York Citys prison guard union and a hedge fund financier were charged with operating a kickback scheme. It marked the first major prosecution to emerge from state and federal corruption probes examining de Blasios fundraising practices, among other avenues of inquiry. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
"Clinton, Trump draw battle lines for ill-tempered campaign fight","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump kicked off a fierce general election battle, with Democrats accusing Trump of erratic behavior and the Republican threatening to bring up old Clinton scandals.            Clinton, the former secretary of state, made history when she became the first woman to lead a major political party in its quest to capture the U.S. presidency. Big primary election wins on Tuesday in California and elsewhere catapulted her to victory over Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders. If elected on Nov. 8, the 68-year-old former U.S. senator from New York would return the Clinton family to the White House 16 years after her husband, Bill Clinton, completed two terms as president. All signs point toward a negative campaign as Clinton accused Trump of being temperamentally unfit to serve and the New York businessman charged that Clinton had a dark past and a weak record as President Barack Obamas first-term secretary of state. Clinton told NBC on Wednesday she would not run a campaign of insults, but she sought to portray the 69-year-old Trump as not fit for the Oval Office after the real estate developer repeatedly accused a Mexican-American judge of showing bias against him because of his ethnic heritage. The Clinton campaign has pointed to criticism from leaders in Trumps Republican Party to make this case. Im going to talk about why hes unqualified to be president based on his own words and his deeds. And Im going to continue to make the case he is temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief, she said in the interview. Trump gave a carefully crafted primary race victory speech on Tuesday laying out his own plan of attack. To keep from straying off message, he used a Teleprompter and avoided his typical stream-of-consciousness delivery. Trump said money given to the Clinton Foundation charity from foreign donors had earned the Clintons millions of dollars and had a corrupting influence when Clinton was secretary of state. Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund - the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese - all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. Its a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens, Trump said.     He said he would give a speech next week discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed Clinton leading Trump by 10 percentage points nationally, little changed from a week earlier. [nL1N18Y1Z2] Both Clinton and Trump must unite their parties but the Democrat appeared to face the easier path with Sanders, a leftist U.S. senator from Vermont, nearly out of options to challenge her.  Trump has an uphill battle. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan described Trumps remarks about the judge as a textbook definition of a racist comment, but said he would still support him. Trump said on Wednesday he was disappointed and surprised by charges of racism from Republicans.  I had just won more votes than anyone in the history of the party, he told Time. But you know, they have to say what they have to say. Im a big boy. They have to say what they have to say.     Ryan met behind closed doors on Wednesday with House Republicans. An aide said Ryan discussed with his members the thinking behind his endorsement (of Trump) and how to move forward and reiterated he had confidence Trump would support the House Republican agenda.     Id say the general attitude is, Good. Now lets just move on, said U.S. Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Trump supporter. The irony here and the frustration was that hes not racist. Others said Trump needed to stop engaging in petty battles with former rivals and build a fundraising organization. Trump will meet on Thursday in New York with top fundraisers of the Republican National Committee, a party official said. Hopes flickered among some anti-Trump Republicans that there would be a revolt against him when delegates convene to nominate him formally in Cleveland from July 18 to 21.  Representative Morgan Griffith, a Virginia Republican, said that was unlikely but that Trump needed to improve as a candidate. Dont step into the cow pie, Griffith said. He cant afford to be stepping into any more controversies like that. Clinton edged Sanders out in a rough-and-tumble battle that stretched over four months and 50 states. She won support, especially among older voters, with a more pragmatic campaign focused on building on the policies of fellow Democrat Obama. Clinton said she had spoken to Sanders on Tuesday to congratulate him on his campaign. I am looking forward to working with him to unify the Democratic Party against the threat that Donald Trump poses to our country, she told PBS on Wednesday. So we are talking. We will be having an opportunity to discuss in greater detail in the days ahead how we can best work together.     Democratic Party elites are lined up squarely behind Clinton, including most likely Obama, who may endorse her as early as this week. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama would not endorse until after he meets with Sanders on Thursday. Obama and Sanders have spoken three times in the past month, Earnest said. The presidents eventual endorsement would put pressure on Sanders to exit graciously and throw his support to Clinton. Sanders is also due to meet with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 ",1
Clinton calls Trump economic ideas 'dangerously incoherent',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday said she will deliver an economic agenda address soon to contrast her policy differences with Republican Donald Trump, according to an interview with the Wall Street Journal.  In the interview, the presumptive Democratic nominee called her Republican counterparts statements on the economy dangerously incoherent, and vowed to propose a tax-cut plan for the middle class. Its not hard to see how a Trump presidency could actually lead to a serious global economic crisis, she said. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
Pennsylvania governor signs law expanding wine sales to private stores,"(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Wednesday signed into law new measures to expand the sale of bottled wine to certain private stores, a move that could generate millions in state revenues through taxes and licensing fees. Pennsylvania is one of just two U.S. states, along with Utah, with full control over its liquor sale system - owning and operating retail and wholesale operations. This is truly a historic day for Pennsylvania and the most significant step the commonwealth has taken to reform our liquor system in 80 years, Wolf said in a statement. The new legislation, passed by lawmakers on Tuesday, moves wine sales beyond the states publicly run system, allowing supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and hotels that already have licenses for carry-out beer to sell up to four bottles of wine to customers. [nL1N18Z1W7] It also expands direct wine shipments by the case; liquor, wine and beer sales at casinos; and hours of operation at state stores, including on Sundays. The move is expected to increase retail wine sales overall and could add more than $150 million to state coffers. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is the largest purchaser of wine and spirits in the United States. The state has an 18 percent liquor tax. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
Modi wants deeper U.S.-India security relationship,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a closer security relationship between his country and the United States on Wednesday, in an address to the U.S. Congress stressing the importance of warming ties between the two countries. He dedicated much of the speech to the importance of fighting terrorism, thanking Congress for U.S. support after a Pakistan-based military groups rampage in Mumbai killed 166 people in 2008. The fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels. And the traditional tools of military, intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight, Modi told a rare joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives. We have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it. The need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation, Modi said. He leavened the speech to lawmakers, the first such address by an international leader since Pope Francis in September, with jokes about Congress bitter partisan divide and yoga. But Modi used it to make serious points about Indias neighbor and arch-rival Pakistan and regional concerns about Chinese expansionism. I commend the members of the U.S. Congress for sending a clear message to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains, he said, not mentioning either country by name.     Modi is on the U.S. leg of an international tour. On Tuesday, he met with President Barack Obama at the White House, where the two leaders said India agreed to work toward joining the Paris Agreement on climate change this year and discussed security and cyber security issues. The visit, two years after Modi became prime minister, capped an improving relationship between New Delhi and the United States. Before he was elected, Modi was barred from even entering the country because of concerns about his handling of 2002 riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Today, he is one of the international leaders most popular in Washington, where Modis government is seen as a counterbalance to China. He and Obama have a warm personal relationship. We are now standing shoulder to shoulder in ways that no one could have imagined a generation ago, Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs committee, said at a reception for Modi after the address.  In a 45-minute speech interrupted by cheers and at least eight standing ovations, the 65-year-old Indian leader said deeper U.S.-Indian security cooperation should isolate anyone who harbors, supports or sponsors terrorists. Although he did not mention Pakistan, that line was greeted with applause from the lawmakers, many of whom are increasingly frustrated with what they see as Islamabads failure to crack down on militants behind attacks on American troops in Afghanistan. Modi also stressed that India is committed to helping rebuild a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. Amid heightened tensions over Chinas assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea, Modi said a stronger U.S.-India partnership could boost peace and prosperity from Asia to Africa and from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. He did not mention China. It can also help ensure security of the sea lanes and commerce and freedom of navigation on seas, Modi added. Democrats leaped to their feet when Modi referred to the recent climate change summit. But Republicans in the House chamber remained seated, reflecting the U.S. political divide over the issue. House Speaker Paul Ryan greeted Modi at his office before his speech. After the Indian leaders remarks, he attended lunch with congressional leaders and a reception with members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees.

Two gay men challenge Tennessee denial of service law,"(Reuters) - Two men have filed a lawsuit against Tennessee and its governor saying their constitutional rights as gay individuals are violated by a new law that allows mental health counselors to refuse to treat patients on the basis of sincerely held principles. The law, signed by Republican Governor Bill Haslam in April, has been criticized as discriminatory against the gay community. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday by Bleu Copas and Caleb Laieski in the Chancery Court for Anderson County, asks the court to void the statute because it violates the Tennessee Constitution and the U.S. Constitutions 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens under the law. LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) persons were the target of the statute. They are singled out for discriminatory treatment. There is no other group which could conceivably be the target of the statute, the lawsuit reads in part. A court employee sent Reuters a copy of the complaint on Wednesday via email. Jennifer Donnals, press secretary for Governor Haslam, said in an emailed statement: We are not able to make comments on pending litigation. The law protects therapists and counselors from legal action when they cite their personal principles in refusing service, despite a provision in the American Counseling Associations code of ethics barring members from such denials of service. In the lawsuit, Copas says he is a homosexual man and a resident of Anderson County, Tennessee, while Laieski says he is homosexual and describes himself as a national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights activist residing in Alexandria, Virginia. With gay marriage becoming a lost cause for opponents - the Supreme Court ruled in June that same-sex couples have the right to marry - a new battleground has become a quest by conservatives in some states to allow people to refuse services to gay men and women on religious grounds. tinyurl.com/hj29fs9 The Tennessee law is among a number of state statutes passed over the last year or so, prohibiting sanctions against businesses, service providers, professionals or clerics who refuse service, in some cases to same-sex couples or in other cases to individuals, based on profoundly held beliefs. Some states, such as Arkansas and Indiana, enacted fixes to the measures after large companies and rights groups assailed them as discriminatory. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
Trump 'disappointed' by Republican criticism of judge comments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was disappointed and surprised by the criticism  and charges of racism he had received from Republican leaders for comments he made about the Mexican heritage of a federal judge. I had just won more votes than anyone in the history of the party, so I was a little bit surprised when they said that, Trump told Time. I didnt think it was necessary. But you know, they have to say what they have to say. Im a big boy. They have to say what they have to say. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
Former Reagan aide helped write Trump foreign policy speech,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former senior official in the Reagan administration and prominent Republican foreign policy insider told Reuters he provided input for the late-April foreign policy speech by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. I was asked to contribute material for Trumps April 27 speech at the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said Richard Burt. Burt said he is not part of Trumps campaign. But I am happy to talk to people looking for advice on foreign policy issues, said Burt, a managing director of McLarty Associates, a Washington-based consulting firm co-founded by former President Bill Clintons White House chief of staff and counselor Thomas Mack McLarty. Burt said he also would be willing to offer foreign policy advice to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, if she asked for such advice, though he added, Shes not going to.Burt is also chairman of Global Zero, an independent group devoted to ridding the world of nuclear weapons. Trump told The New York Times in April that he was not sure it would be a bad thing for the United States if Japan had nuclear weapons, and has said the same about South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Burt said the main theme he talked about to Trump was the need for the United States to pursue a more realist foreign policy, in which the United States would avoid seeking regime change abroad, and instead make protecting the United States and its interests the main policy goal. Trump, who became the Republicans presumptive nominee last month after the last of his challengers dropped from the partys race, articulated this theme again in a campaign speech late on Tuesday, as he claimed victory in the last Republican nominating contests. Under Reagan, Burt headed the State Departments Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and then its European and Canadian Affairs bureau and served as U.S. ambassador to Germany from 1985 to 1989. Some of Burts contemporaries from the administrations of Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, have publicly denounced Trumps foreign policy views or remained mute. Earlier this year, Trump met with a group of 11 foreign policy advisers, headed by Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Trumps most outspoken supporters.  Reuters sought comment on the recent activities of Trumps foreign policy team from several of its members and from a campaign spokeswoman. Most declined to comment, and the campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  One campaign team member, who asked for anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly, said that while the team had held several discussions since Trumps speech, the candidate remains his own most important foreign policy adviser.

Senator Tim Kaine an online favorite to run with Clinton,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia has emerged as the online betting favorite to be presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons running mate while Bernie Sanders chances have slipped, online predictions market PredictIt said. Kaine topped a list of potential vice president candidates with about 20 percent probability, followed by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts with about 17 percent and U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez with about 14 percent. The website, which allows users to wager small amounts of money, said Sanders chances of joining Clintons race for the White House were about 10 percent. Big election wins on Tuesday catapulted Clinton to victory over Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, although he has vowed to go on contesting the race. Bets on Clinton winning the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election were going for 66 cents while bets on Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominees, were traded at just 33 cents. On the Republican side, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama was leading the race to be Trumps running mate at 20 percent, followed by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa at 17 percent, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at 15 percent and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at 9 percent. The latest opinion poll by Reuters/Ipsos on Tuesday showed Trump trails Clinton by 10 points in the 2016 presidential campaign, showing little change from a week ago.    The online survey had 44.3 percent of likely voters saying they would vote for Clinton, compared with 34.7 percent who would support Trump.

"'Hi Donald, we're Muslims!' Scottish offer to teach Trump in visit","EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scottish Muslims have invited Donald Trump to visit a mosque and learn about their faith during his visit to Scotland this month in the hope of changing his views. The presumptive Republican U.S. presidential candidate, whose mother was Scottish, last year proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States as a response to Islamist attacks in Paris and California, causing a furor in Europe. Accepting a visit to learn about the Muslim community might help show that he is not so extreme, Edinburgh Central Mosque Imam Yayha Barry told Reuters. I would say: Hi Donald, were Muslims, welcome to our mosque! Do you still see Muslims as a threat to Western civilizations? he said. Trumps views prompted widespread opposition in Britain, where he owns two golf courses on the west and east Scottish coasts. His comments about stopping Mexican migrants entering the United States also caused offense, leading to the withdrawal of Scottish business and academic accolades.  Prime Minister David Cameron said the remarks by the potential leader of Britains closest international ally were divisive, stupid and wrong.  Neither Cameron nor Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon plan to meet him on his visit, which coincides with the result of Britains referendum on EU membership on June 24.  Spiritual leaders in the Islamic community invited Trump to learn more about the Muslims that he offends. We would welcome the opportunity to show him the work that we are doing in the community in Edinburgh when he comes to Scotland, said Hafiz Ghafoor of Annandale Mosque and Munawar Hussain, secretary of Roxburgh St Mosque and Islamic Centre, in a joint statement. Trumps relationship with Scotland has been rocky since he contested a decision to build an offshore wind farm opposite his golf course in Aberdeenshire. His trip will include a visit there as well as to his courses at Turnberry, in southwestern Scotland, and Doonbeg, in Ireland. Protests at Trumps misogynist, racist and xenophobic views are planned by Aberdeen University students during his visit, the president of the Students Association said.  A spokesperson for the Trump Organisation did not respond to a request to comment.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Trump should witness first hand the work being done by local Muslims to reach across faiths and help those in need. Muslims are our friends, colleagues, family and neighbors. When he insults them in such a grotesque manner he insults us all. About 77,000 Scots are Muslims, or 1.4 percent of the population, according to the latest official census in 2011. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
Sanders plants seeds for a lasting U.S. progressive movement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders upstart U.S. presidential campaign may be headed to defeat, but his goals of reining in Wall Street, ending big money in politics and eradicating income inequality were the big winners in the bruising Democratic race. Sanders, who started as a little-known long-shot, pushed the party and established front-runner Hillary Clinton sharply to the left during a long primary battle. Along the way, the 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont energized young and progressive voters and prepared the ground for what his allies predict will be a lasting influence on the party. Clinton, one of the best-known political figures in the United States, clinched the Democratic Partys nomination in a last round of state nominating contests on Tuesday.  But even before her victory, Sanders began taking steps to turn his newfound political influence into an enduring progressive movement. In the last few weeks, he has lent his influence and fundraising power to progressive congressional and state legislative candidates who share his agenda, urging his supporters around the country to donate to their campaigns. Sanders also appointed prominent activists to the panel writing the issues platform for the partys convention in July, ensuring a strong voice in the process. His convention delegates will push for changes to party primary rules, including letting independents vote in primaries and reducing the influence of superdelegates, the hundreds of party elites who can support any candidate regardless of voting in their constituencies, and who in this primary season have largely backed Clinton. I do think we are going to see real changes in the Democratic Party going forward because of Bernie. The future of the party is with the people supporting Sanders, said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, a liberal Vermont-based group that rose from Howard Deans failed 2004 presidential bid and endorsed Sanders this time. He has proven the power of this message, Chamberlain said. During the campaign, Sanders forced Clinton to tack left repeatedly on issues ranging from her support for a higher minimum wage to her opposition to the Asian trade pact and Keystone XL oil pipeline. Sanders progressive allies said those shifts by Clinton will be helpful in the Nov. 8 election against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has touted an anti-trade and pro-jobs economic agenda, and for Democrats in their efforts to recapture a majority in the U.S. Senate. When the story of the 2016 election is told, a major part of it will be that Bernie Sanders helped the Democratic Party turn up the volume on economic populism issues, said Adam Green, co-founder of the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee. If Democrats win back the Senate in the November election, Sanders will be in line for either the chairmanship of the Budget Committee or the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, both powerful platforms to advance his ideas. Chamberlain said Sanders would create a formidable one-two  punch in the Senate with Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator who has been the leader of the partys progressive wing. Bernie Sanders is going to fight all the good fights, he said. With Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were going to see a Senate team that will be very powerful. Sanders investment in the next generation of progressive politicians, meanwhile, is aimed at spawning a new generation of liberals who back his agenda. He has sent emails to his grassroots fundraising list urging his donors to back six insurgent congressional candidates and eight statehouse candidates who echo his economic message, sparking a flood of donations to their campaigns. More endorsements are expected. Our movement is so powerful that we can change congressional elections overnight. Lets keep going, Sanders said on Tuesday in an email to supporters asking them to support two more candidates for Congress - Eric Kingson in New York and Paul Clements in Michigan. Justin Bamberg, a first-term state representative from South Carolina, said he received about $70,000 in small-dollar donations after Sanders sent an email to his supporters backing Bamberg. In Bambergs first campaign, he raised $21,000 during the entire cycle, he said. They dont know me from Adam, but they believe in Senator Sanders, and because of that they believe in the people that Senator Sanders has supported, Bamberg said, adding he was also getting calls offering to volunteer on his behalf. Terry Alexander, a South Carolina state representative backed by Sanders, said he also had received about $70,000 in donations after the Sanders email. The money freed him from worrying about raising funds, giving him more time to focus on meeting voters, he said. It has made a difference in how people see my candidacy, its created a lot of enthusiasm and a tremendous boost in fundraising, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2016 ",1
California poised to shut out Republicans from U.S. Senate race,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California voters on Tuesday were poised to choose two Democrats to face off against each other in the race to succeed Barbara Boxer in the U.S. Senate, shutting out Republicans in a sign of diminished support in Americas most populous state. State Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez will meet in what would be the states first single-party Senate election under a 2010 California law advancing the top two primary vote-getters to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. With 16 percent of precincts reporting in early returns on Tuesday, Harris, 51, led the crowded field of 34 candidates with 40 percent of the vote. None of the Republican contenders came close to Sanchez, 56, who was firmly in second place with 16  percent of the vote. Boxer, 75, a Democrat, is retiring after 24 years in the Senate. Republicans hold no statewide offices in California and represent about 27 percent of registered voters. The state, home to former Republican Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, last elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1988. On Tuesday, former California Republican Party chairman Duf Sundheim was in third place with 10 percent in early returns, followed by fellow Republican Phil Wyman with 6 percent.       Harris is the daughter of two college professors. Of African-American and Indian descent, she was raised amid civil rights activism in Berkeley and Oakland, eventually becoming a prosecutor in San Francisco. She was elected attorney general in 2010 and 2014. For the primary, Harris ran a tightly controlled campaign, touting her role negotiating a settlement with big banks over the mortgage meltdown and using her position as the states top prosecutor to fight human trafficking, cyber crime and other issues. Sanchez, who represents Orange County near Los Angeles, has served in Congress since 1997. Her win in the once staunchly Republican county was an early sign of Californias demographic shift, as the state became more ethnically diverse and far more Democratic. Such a matchup could easily go negative, experts said, straining relationships within a party that are already bruised by the tense competition between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Clinton and Sanders also face off in California on Tuesday. The fact that theyre both in the same party doesnt mean theyre going to treat each other with kid gloves, political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said of Harris and Sanchez. When ideological and policy differences arent as great, its only natural for the candidates to focus on personal issues, said Dan Schnur, who heads the Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. Sanchez, seeking to become the states first Latina U.S. senator, has raised less money than Harris and trails her by about 8 percentage points in polls. But factors including a recent surge in voter registration among Latinos will make her a strong competitor in the general election, analysts said. She has positioned herself more to the political center than her opponent. With support from Latinos, independents and Republicans, Sanchez could win in November despite Harris advantages, Schnur said. Were prepared for any turn in the race, said Harris spokesman Nathan Click. A Sanchez campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1

"Under fire from Republicans, Trump says he'll stop talking about judge","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would no longer talk about a Mexican-American judge after U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan denounced the presidential candidates criticism of the jurist as textbook racism. But Trump refused entreaties from party leaders to disavow his charge that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was showing bias because of his Mexican heritage and should recuse himself from a lawsuit alleging fraud at Trumps defunct Trump University real estate training school. Trump said in a statement that his previous remarks about Curiel had been misconstrued. I do not feel that ones heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial, the presumptive Republican nominee said. Trump added that he did not plan to comment further on the matter. Trump had been suggesting that Curiels heritage was influencing the judges opinion about the case because of Trumps campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Trump has pledged to seal the U.S.-Mexico border with a wall, and has said Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States. Ryan, the countrys top elected Republican, blasted Trumps comments, which have threatened to disrupt Republicans already rocky efforts to unite behind the candidate. I regret those comments that he made. Claiming a person cant do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed, Ryan told reporters. The controversy over Trumps attacks on the judge has set back his efforts to try to unify the Republican party behind him ahead of the Nov. 8 general election when he will face off against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Speaking to supporters at the golf club he owns in the hilly suburbs of New York later on Tuesday, Trump laid out his vision for the meaning of his campaign slogan America First, talking about its implications for trade, energy, financial regulation and tax policies. Breaking with his usual practice of speaking off the cuff, Trump read from a teleprompter and left without taking questions from reporters. Ryan, who endorsed Trump last week after initial misgivings, said he still supported his candidacy, saying Trump would be preferable to Clinton. Behind the scenes, Trump has been pressured from friends and family to back down, fearful of the damage that may be done to his prospects in the general election, a source close to the Trump campaign said. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a potential Trump vice presidential running mate, was spotted at Trump Tower in New York before Trumps statement was issued. Christie earlier in the day defended Trump as not a racist. Some of his friends and family have talked to him and asked him to drop it and so far he wont do it, the source said, speaking before Trumps statement was issued. Everybody is mystified about why he would keep doing it. Ryans emphatic rejection of Trumps comments showed anxiety among party leaders about their ability to hang on to control of the U.S. Congress in November if voters trounce Trump and also punish candidates for other offices on the Republican ticket. Ryans counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said Trump should stop attacking minority groups. My advice to our nominee is to start talking about the issues that the American people care about, and to start doing it now, the Senate Republican leader told reporters. In addition to that, its time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message. Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican who said back in March he would support whoever turned out to be the Republican nominee, said on Tuesday he could not support Trump because he did not have the temperament necessary for the White House. Kirk condemned Trumps comments on Curiel as dead wrong and un-American. Kirk is seeking re-election in November. During the Republican primary campaigns, in which Trump vanquished 16 opponents with a stream of insults to rivals and inflammatory comments about Muslims, immigrants and women, establishment Republicans squirmed over the prospect of the former reality television host becoming their standard-bearer. But many, seeing no alternative, have reconciled themselves to a Trump run for the White House. Trumps continuing practice of making explosive remarks about racial, religious and gender issues is making Republicans, including those who have embraced him, uncomfortable. With greater scrutiny of Trump now that he is set to formally win the Republican presidential nomination at the partys July convention in Cleveland, there are concerns about the partys ability to maintain control of the House of Representatives and Senate. Trumps continuing missteps, punctuated by his outrageous and indefensible comments about Judge Curiel, make that goal much more difficult to achieve, said Lanhee Chen, a senior adviser to former presidential candidate Marco Rubio and a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution.

Trump lawyers channel Obama in court filing,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When lawyers for Donald Trump asked a court to throw out one of the proposed class actions over Trump University, they backed it up with a financial disclosure meant to bolster the Republican presidential candidates credentials as a global businessman. But the form they filed with the court was actually that of the man Trump hopes to succeed in the White House, Democratic President Barack Obama. The presidents nine-page disclosure filed before his 2012 re-election was erroneously included as an exhibit to a motion Trump filed in April asking U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel for the Southern District of California to toss the case before trial, according to a person familiar with the case. A corrected exhibit was filed on Tuesday.  Plaintiffs lawyer Jason Forge seized on the goof in a court document filed late on Friday opposing Trumps motion. Forge said the candidates filing was meant for a court in Bizarro world.  This is just one example of Trumps statements complete lack of credibility, Forge said. Julie Fei, a spokeswoman for OMelveny & Myers, the firm that has been representing Trump in the case, declined to comment. In court filings, Trumps lawyers said the form supported the undisputed fact that Trump is chairman, president and chief executive of the Trump Organization, which conducts business around the world and is affiliated with over 500 companies. Instead, it showed Obamas royalties from his memoir Dreams from My Father and disclosed the first familys 2011 assets of between $2.6 million and $8.3 million. Trump is facing two lawsuits in California and one in New York over Trump University that allege the series of real estate seminars taught students nothing and defrauded them of as much as $35,000 each in fees. The presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election has raised the litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated, and accusing the Indiana-born Curiel of being biased against him because of his Mexican ancestry.  Trumps lawyers intended to file the 92-page financial disclosure form he made public last summer at the time he announced he was running for president. That lists some $1.4 billion in assets, including real estate and other holdings, and $265 million in liabilities. The disclosure does not note his net worth, which he has said is over $10 billion.

Trump criticizes GM for Mexico investments,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rebuked General Motors Co (GM.N) on Tuesday, widening his criticism of American companies that have invested in Mexico. Trump has made criticism of Ford Motor Co (F.N) a staple of his campaign speeches for more than a year, repeatedly suggesting that the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker would back down from plans to expand in Mexico or face a 35 percent tariff on vehicle exports. Trump also has criticized Carrier, a manufacturer of air conditioning units, which is owned by United Technologies Corp and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the owner of Nabisco, for shifting jobs to Mexico. I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies  like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier  are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage, Trump said in a statement defending his comments about a Mexican-American judge overseeing civil lawsuits against Trump University. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn criticism, including from within his own party.  A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Trump had decided to criticize GM. GM spokesman Jim Cain declined comment on Trumps criticism. In December 2014, GM said it was investing $5 billion in Mexico through 2018 - a move that would allow it to double its production capacity at its plants around the country. GM said in 2014 the investment would create 5,600 jobs in Mexico. The Detroit News reported in May that GM plans next year to move some light-duty pickup production to the Flint Assembly Plant from Mexico, according to a memo from UAW Local 598 to membership. Mexican auto production has been rising in recent years as numerous automakers expand operations. Mexico produced 3.4 million vehicles in 2015, the seventh largest vehicle producer worldwide, and could surpass South Korea by 2020, producing more than 5 million vehicles, according to industry forecasts. Ford has repeatedly rejected Trumps criticism and emphasized its significant U.S. investments and employment. In April, Ford announced it would invest $1.6 billion to build more small cars in Mexico. In 2015, Ford said it would invest $2.5 billion in new engine and transmission plants in Mexico, creating 3,800 jobs. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1
Congress approves bill updating chemical safety oversight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would revamp federal chemical safety protections for the first time in decades, sending it to President Barack Obama for his expected signing into law. The Senate approved the measure that was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives on May 25. The bill would update the Toxic Substances Control Act amid complaints that its 40-year-old provisions hobble the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from effectively regulating chemicals, including those ranging from asbestos and flame retardants to everyday household products. No one disputes that this bill transfers power from the states to the federal government, Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky complained during debate of the bill. He said it would add hundreds of new regulations that will burden the U.S. chemical industry and hurt jobs. The EPA, under the bill, would have to consider the impact of a chemical on human health and the environment, as well as the chemicals benefits and the economic impact of regulation.

White House threatens to veto Senate defense bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House threatened on Tuesday to veto a Senate defense policy bill, saying it would prevent President Barack Obama from closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and limit the size of his National Security Council. The bill would undermine expert judgments of the (Defense) Departments civilian and military leadership and constrain the ability of the president and the secretary of defense to appropriately manage and direct the nations defense, the White House said in a statement. The $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, sets spending policy for the Pentagon each year. The Republican-led Congress generally uses the must-pass bill as a vehicle for a range of policy measures. The Senate Armed Services Committee passed the bill last month. It is now being debated in the full Senate, where lawmakers have introduced hundreds of amendments.  Obama had already threatened to veto the House of Representatives version of the annual bill, which passed that chamber last month. The White House opposed it for a number of reasons, including its use of $18 billion in special war funds for day-to-day military programs to avoid automatic budget cuts. The Senate version did not adopt that strategy. But Senator John McCain, the Armed Services Committees Republican chairman, filed an amendment with a similar plan to use $18 billion of so-called Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to pay for additional troops, more equipment and an increase in a planned military pay increase. McCain and other Republicans argued that the increased spending was necessary to keep Americans safe. In a statement, he criticized Obamas veto threat as a sorry defense of the status quo, and said he hoped Obama would change his mind. I hope when the NDAA reaches the presidents desk, he understands the critical importance of this legislation to our national security better than his administration seems to now, McCain said. Democrats said they would support more military spending if Republicans also approved spending on civilian programs. Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the Senate, said Democrats would offer their own amendment, adding funding for airport security, to combat Zika, for local police, to fight opioid addiction and improve infrastructure. If the Republicans pass the defense amendment but then block a similar increase to middle-class programs, they will have broken the budget agreement and the appropriations process will come to a grinding halt, Reid told a news conference. After the House and Senate pass their versions of the NDAA, the two chambers agree on a final version of the bill. If that passes, it is sent for Obama to veto or sign into law. Obama vetoed the 2016 NDAA because it sought to increase defense spending by using the war funds, and over the restrictions involving the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for terrorism suspects. He eventually signed a version with the Guantanamo measures after the spending plan was removed. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1
Clinton leads Trump by 10 points in White House matchup: poll,"(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump trails Democrat Hillary Clinton by 10 points in the 2016 presidential campaign, according to a poll released on Tuesday, showing little change from a week ago and suggesting his comments about a Mexican-American judge had yet to affect his standing in the race. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll came after several days in which Trump faced sharp criticism over his insistence that a federal judge who was born in Indiana to Mexican parents was biased in a case involving the celebrity billionaire. But the fallout from Trumps comments appeared to have done little to help Clinton build her lead over the presumptive Republican nominee.   The online survey showed that 44.3 percent of likely voters said they would vote for Clinton, compared with 34.7 percent who would support Trump. A further 20.9 percent said they would not vote for either candidate. The results were little changed from last weeks survey. The poll was conducted from Friday to Tuesday, starting shortly after Trumps first comments about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against Trump University, the New York businessmans defunct real estate school. Trump has suggested that Curiels heritage is influencing the judges opinion about the case because of Trumps campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called Trumps comments textbook racism on Tuesday, while Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Trump should stop attacking minority groups. Bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, Trump said on Tuesday he would no longer talk about the judge, adding that his previous remarks about Curiel had been misconstrued. Other events, including news that Clinton had secured enough  delegates and superdelegates to become the first female presidential candidate of a major U.S. political party, occurred toward the end of the poll. The poll included 1,261 respondents and had a credibility interval of 3.2 percentage points. See the poll results in Reuters' Polling Explorer. [polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/LIKELY:1/dates/20160401-20160607/type/day] For most of the year, Clinton has maintained an edge over Trump in the Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters. That edge briefly disappeared in May after Trumps remaining rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out and party leaders started to line up behind his campaign.  Trumps level of support has since eroded as he sparred with his partys leadership and continued to be dogged with questions about Trump University. The Reuters/Ipsos poll differs from others that are often days removed from when their data was collected. As a result, the Reuters/Ipsos poll often detects shifts in opinion well ahead of other surveys.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Polling Explorer (Clinton versus Trump) polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/LIKELY:1/dates/20160401-20160607/type/day ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1
Democrats seek probe of Trump donation to Florida attorney general,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida Democrats demanded investigations on Tuesday into a donation made by a Donald Trump foundation to the states attorney general, citing an Associated Press report that the Republican attorney general solicited the money around the time her office was considering a lawsuit against Trump University. At question is a 2013 donation of $25,000 from a Trump charity to a political committee supporting the attorney general, Pam Bondi, that has received media scrutiny this year.  Floridas top law enforcement official solicited a donation from someone she was supposed to be investigating for fraud, Florida Democratic Party Chair Allison Tantsaid in a statement. She even went as far as to campaign for Trump, who has made a habit of bragging about buying politicians. Floridians deserve answers and Pam Bondi must be held accountable, Tant added. Bondi, who has endorsed Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, on Tuesday called the AP report misleading. My office has made public every document on this issue, which shows no one in my office ever opened an investigation on Trump University nor was there a basis for doing so, she said in a statement. Any news story that suggests otherwise is completely false.  The Trump campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The Associated Press reported on Monday that Bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join a New York state investigation into Trumps defunct real estate training school. Trump is fighting lawsuits that accuse his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaires real estate investment strategies. Bondi ended the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived, the AP reported. At the time of the donation, she was seeking re-election. The Tampa Bay Times quoted a Bondi spokesman saying on Monday that documents released in the case consistently demonstrate that through due diligence, staff assessed matters brought to their attention and properly determined that New York litigation seeks relief for any and all aggrieved consumers, regardless of their state of residence.

Ruling against ex-AIG boss Greenberg raises stakes in Trump University case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A ruling by New Yorks highest court in a fraud case against former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) Chief Executive Maurice Hank Greenberg could affect the states case against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his defunct Trump University. The New York Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman could seek to recoup millions of dollars in bonus payments to Greenberg using the legal remedy called disgorgement. Unlike damages, which are used to compensate victims losses, disgorgement requires a defendant to give back gains obtained from unlawful means. The ruling means that Schneiderman can go after $5 million he says Trump personally pocketed from the Trump University real-estate seminar venture. It doesnt help him, Jeffrey Goldman, Trumps lawyer in the New York case, said on Monday of the Greenberg ruling. But Goldman said Trump expected to win the case and could also try to limit the amount subject to disgorgement, such as by arguing that most of it was earned outside of New York. According to the states 2013 lawsuit against Trump, filed in state court in Manhattan, Trump University was an unlicensed, illegal operation that bilked students of up to $35,000 each between 2005 and 2011. Two proposed class actions in California make similar allegations. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly raised the Trump University litigation on the campaign trail, calling the lawsuits baseless and politically motivated. He has also accused the federal judge overseeing the California lawsuits of being biased against him because of his ethnicity. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. In the Greenberg case, the state accused the former CEO of orchestrating sham transactions at AIG and misleading shareholders about the companys financial health between 2000 and 2005. Schneiderman is asking that Greenberg disgorge some $25 million in bonuses during that period, plus interest.  Greenberg has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, David Boies, who represented Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore in the dispute over the 2000 election recount, had argued that disgorgement was not a remedy available to the New York attorney general under either the states securities fraud law or another fraud statute. The Court of Appeals rejected Boies arguments. The ability to seek disgorgement may be useful to Schneiderman because the California cases involving Trump University may be resolved before the New York case. One is scheduled for trial on Nov. 28, just a few weeks after the Nov. 8 election.  A settlement or judgment in those cases could undermine Schneidermans claim for $40 million in damages because he is suing on behalf of many of the same former Trump University students. But disgorgement claims would not be affected. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1

"U.S. lawmakers want more Iran sanctions, but can't agree","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. senator said on Tuesday he would like to pass legislation to extend expiring sanctions on Iran and enable Congress to quickly enact new ones if necessary over the countrys ballistic missile tests. The Iran Sanctions Act, which imposed nuclear, missile and terrorism sanctions on Iran, expires at the end of 2016, and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress support extending it. But Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged that lawmakers have not yet unified behind a proposal that would attract enough votes to pass and become law. Members have different views, he said at a roundtable discussion with reporters. The Obama administration has warned Congress that it would oppose new sanctions that interfere with the international nuclear pact, laying the groundwork for a potential fight over any legislation. Senator Bob Corker, the committees Republican chairman, has said he is working on legislation with Cardin that he hopes will attract strong bipartisan support. That measure has not yet been unveiled and aides said they had no more information about when it might be introduced. Cardin was one of several Democrats who joined every Republican in Congress in opposing the nuclear agreement with Iran announced last July. But he has urged lawmakers to accept it since a Republican-led effort to block the pact failed in September. After the deal went ahead, Cardin filed legislation meant to increase U.S. oversight of it. That bill never came up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. Cardin said he still felt that bill was valid and wants to amend it to extend the Iran Sanctions Act and create a legislative framework so sanctions could be imposed quickly if Iran pursues its ballistic missile program. Late last month, two Democratic senators who supported the Iran nuclear agreement, Tim Kaine and Chris Murphy, introduced a separate bill to extend the Iran Sanctions Act until Obama can guarantee Irans nuclear program is purely peaceful.  And Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte, with 18 other senators form her party, introduced a separate bill that would extend the Iran Sanctions Act through 2031 and require new sanctions over Irans ballistic missile efforts. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has said he wants any Iran bill to come to the floor with at least the 67 votes needed to override a presidential veto.

Republican's plan to revamp Dodd-Frank highlights U.S. political divide,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chair of the House Financial Services Committee has proposed getting rid of much of the regulation put in place after the financial crisis, unveiling a plan on Tuesday that ignited fierce debate in the presidential election but is expected to flame out in Washington. In a sweeping speech at the Economic Club of New York, Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, from Texas, laid out his ideas on weakening the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law just as polls opened in six states holding presidential primaries. Hensarling also met on Tuesday with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee who has called for dismantling the massive reform law. Trumps campaign declined to comment on Hensarlings plan. The lawmaker told Fox Business Network on Tuesday he would not describe the blow-by-blow of his meeting with Trump but said they had common ground on Dodd-Frank.  Meanwhile, the Democrats likely nominee, Hillary Clinton, sought to tie the real-estate tycoon to Hensarlings proposal.  Clinton strongly opposes Chairman Hensarling and Donald Trumps efforts to gut critical reforms put in place to protect the public after the financial crisis, said her adviser Gary Gensler, who headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when Dodd-Frank was passed. While Republicans attempt to roll back measures that protect consumers and curb excessive risk-taking on Wall Street, Hillary Clinton will fight to defend Dodd-Frank and go beyond it, with tough new rules, stronger enforcement and more accountability.  Hensarlings plan would allow banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or meeting much tougher capital requirements. It would also throw out the Volcker Rule that restricts banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council consisting of regulatory agencies heads to designate firms as systemically important, also known as too big to fail. That label triggers requirements to hold more capital and abide by stricter regulations. In essence, Hensarling said his plan involved far more loss-absorbing capital and far less federal control. It would also maintain the laws section on derivatives and keep the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by Dodd-Frank, albeit with a changed structure. Im only replacing 89.7 percent of Dodd-Frank, Hensarling joked. Few expect the plan, previewed in a video last week, to become law soon. While it could pass the Republican-controlled Congress, it would then have to be signed by President Barack Obama, who also signed Dodd-Frank into law.  On Tuesday White House spokesman Josh Earnest said reforms enacted after the crisis essentially guarantee that taxpayers will not be on the hook for bailing out big banks if their risky bets go south. But Obama leaves office in January and those vying to replace him, including Senator Bernie Sanders running as a Democrat, have distinct views on regulation and Wall Street. Those on the left who gave us Dodd-Frank believe in the principle that human nature is self-destructive and that people  - except themselves, of course - are fundamentally ignorant, Hensarling said, demonstrating the political charge of his ideas.  Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick, shot back that Republicans seek to make life easier for mega bankers and tougher for ordinary Americans.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is a firebrand for stronger regulation, said while most Republicans in Congress are debating not whether to run away from Trump - but how far and how fast - Congressman Hensarling is sprinting toward Trump Tower.  Trump has given few clues to how he would take apart Dodd-Frank and what he might put in its place.  Heres something we both agree with, and that is Dodd-Frank is impeding economic growth, Hensarling told Fox Business. I think he well received the message. I think he was interested in the policy. Clinton has proposed breaking up large banks that take excessive risk, charging institutions a risk fee, taxing high-frequency trading, and creating more oversight of shadow banking. The most liberal candidate, Sanders has gone further and suggested reinstating the Glass-Steagall law that once separated commercial and investment banking. James Ballentine, head of congressional relations at  American Bankers Association, the industrys lead trade group, said both parties agree that parts of Dodd-Frank just arent working. Any law that generates more than 24,000 pages of proposed and final rules will inevitably include problems that should be fixed, he said in a statement. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1

District of Columbia approves $15/hour minimum wage,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The District of Columbias city council approved a $15-an-hour minimum wage on Tuesday, a rate adopted by a growing number of U.S. cities and states seeking to battle income inequality. The council voted unanimously to pass the measure boosting the minimum hourly wage to $15 by 2020, with subsequent hikes tied to inflation. A final vote will come later this month, and Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has backed the bill. Once approved, the U.S. capital will join California and New York in making $15 the hourly minimum. At least eight cities, including Seattle, have also approved the $15 base. Raising the minimum wage will help address the issues of  residents being pushed out of the District due to rising costs of living and income inequality, Council member Vincent Orange, a sponsor of the bill, said in the hearing. He and other supporters say Washingtons robust economy and growing population mean it can support a higher minimum wage.  The District of Columbias base wage is $10.50, and will go up by $1 on July 1 under existing law. The federal minimum is $7.25 an hour. The $15 minimum is estimated to raise wages for 114,000 workers, or about 14 percent of the District of Columbias workforce, according to an analysis for the council by the non-profit Economic Policy Institute. The higher pay proposal was supported by unions but was opposed by the Districts Chamber of Commerce. It said the District should not raise wages until neighboring suburbs do. The District of Columbias booming restaurant industry also opposed it. Restaurant owners and the local restaurant association said that higher costs would lead to layoffs. Some lawmakers said the measure did not go far enough to address a widening income gap and 18 percent poverty rate. Council member David Grosso added an amendment requiring the government to study a minimum income system to help the poorest residents. Raising the minimum wage is a good thing, but is $15 enough? Or should the number be $35, or $50 an hour? he asked. Under the measure, the minimum for workers who get tips, like waiters and bartenders, would also be $15 an hour by 2020. Following talks with unions, restaurateurs and community activists, employers would have to make up the difference between a base for tipped workers that will be $5 an hour in 2020, up from the current $2.77, Orange said.

Trump unyielding on Hispanic judge uproar,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday rejected a barrage of criticism from his own party over his allegations of bias against a Hispanic judge, insisting his concerns were valid. All I want to do is figure out why Im being treated unfairly by a judge. And a lot of people agree with it, Trump said on Fox News. Trump has been on the defensive since his comments last week about Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against Trump University, the New York businessmans defunct real estate school. He has also been castigated by Democrats, including the partys likely presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. I dont know what else you could call these attacks other than racist, other than prejudiced, other than bigoted, Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC on Monday. Its just plain wrong, and certainly wrong coming from someone who is vying to become President of the United States. Trump told campaign supporters in a conference call they should stand by him in his attacks on the judge, Bloomberg Politics reported. It said during the call Trump distanced himself from a memo his campaign sent supporters on Sunday that urged them to avoid the issue. Asked for comment, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: It was a very positive call to discuss overall messaging. Two Trump supporters, Tana Goertz and Scottie Nell Hughes, told CNN that former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer had said on the call that she wanted the campaign to go on the offense against expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Goertz said Trump told his suppporters not to be afraid to call out the media when TV reporters suggest that Trump is racist.  Trump has suggested that Curiels heritage is influencing the judges opinion about the case because of Trumps campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, has pledged to seal the U.S.-Mexico border with a wall, and has said Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States. Former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, joined the chorus of criticism. In an interview with Orlandos WFTV, Rubio called Trumps comments wrong and said he had to stop. I ran for president and I warned this was going to happen, Rubio said. Trump has regularly stirred up controversy on the campaign trail and has frequently dismayed Republican establishment leaders. His view of an ethnically biased judiciary has drawn a fresh wave of criticism, including concern in his own party. On Sunday he was asked if - by the same token - he believed a Muslim judge would be biased against him based on Trumps call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Its possible. Yes, Trump said on CBS Face the Nation. Republican leaders including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have distanced themselves from Trumps comments, saying they are worried the tone of his presidential campaign could enrage Latinos, who are a growing U.S. voting bloc. If this doesnt change were in for big trouble, Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, said on MSNBC on Monday. I hope to be able to support the nominee. I certainly cant now, said Flake, whose state has a large percentage of Hispanics. A former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ohio Governor John Kasich, called on Trump to apologize to Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents.  Attacking judges based on their race (and/or) religion is another tactic that divides our country, Kasich wrote on Twitter. More importantly, it is flat out wrong. It was unclear what, if any, effect the latest furor would have on Trumps unorthodox candidacy. States with significant Hispanic populations including California, New Mexico and New Jersey hold nominating contests on Tuesday. Trump fought back against his Republican critics on Monday, with especially sharp words for Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker. Gingrich, mentioned as a possible running mate to Trump, on Sunday called Trumps comments inexcusable. I was surprised at Newt, Trump told the Fox & Friends program.

BuzzFeed terminates Republican ad deal over Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online media outlet BuzzFeed has pulled out of an advertising deal reported to be worth $1.3 million with the Republican National Committee over objections to the partys presumptive nominee Donald Trump. In an e-mail to employees on Monday, BuzzFeed founder and CEO Jonah Peretti wrote: We dont run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we wont accept Trump ads for the exact same reason. The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs, Peretti wrote in the note, which was posted to BuzzFeed.com.  BuzzFeed declined further comment. Neither BuzzFeed nor the RNC would confirm the exact value of the deal, reported by Politico to be $1.3 million. According to an RNC official who declined to be identified, the deal was less than 1 percent of the partys ad budget of about $150 million and was effectively a reservation for ad space, not a firm commitment to place ads with BuzzFeed. Trumps campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she had nothing to add.    The RNC provides national leadership for the Republican Party. Trump is expected to be officially nominated as the partys candidate for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election at the Republican National Convention in July.  ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 ",1
"From 'Hillarycare' debacle in 1990s, Clinton emerged more cautious","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich remembers the day 23 years ago when Hillary Clinton, notebook in hand, came to see him and other senior Republicans to talk about Hillarycare. It was early 1993. Clinton, on behalf of her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, was leading a healthcare reform drive that vaulted her onto the national stage. Hillarycare would famously collapse after a fierce debate. In interviews with Reuters, some participants looked back on it as a crucible for the Democratic presidential front-runner that helped shape her approach to politics and governing. The experience, they said, may have tempered her ambitions for the capacity of government and made her more of an incrementalist.  Back then, she seemed to have more of a taste for the big theory and the big plan, said Republican activist and editor Bill Kristol, who wrote anti-Hillarycare strategy memos for Republicans in the 1990s. Kristol said that since then, Clinton, who is vying to face off against presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 U.S. election, seems to have learned that the appearance of a massive government imposition on the citizenry doesnt go over well in America. Clinton walked into the 1993 meeting with Gingrich and said she wanted to learn from him and other leaders who were already studying healthcare. He was then the Republican whip in the U.S. House of Representatives. She was the highly accomplished wife of the Democratic Partys new superstar and a Yale-educated lawyer.  Gingrichs advice to her was simple: Do a series of small reforms year to year. Dont do a comprehensive plan. You wont be able to pass it, Gingrich said he warned Clinton in the meeting, also attended by then-House Republican Leader Bob Michel and then-Representative Dennis Hastert. It will fall of its own weight ... She listened to us carefully and promptly went off and did whatever she wanted to, recalled Gingrich, now a political commentator often mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate to Donald Trump. Later that year, the Clinton White House delivered an ambitious and complex, 1,342-page proposal for universal health insurance for all Americans. The first lady led the charge and testified in a series of lengthy congressional hearings. She wowed lawmakers with her energy and intelligence. But she could not convince enough of them to back the plan. Conservatives and healthcare industry interests attacked it. One negative TV ad campaign paid for by health insurers memorably featured the fictional couple Harry and Louise. In the end, Hillarycare failed, and never even received a floor vote in the House or Senate, although both chambers had Democratic majorities. Aided by the backlash that followed against big government Democrats, the Republicans in 1994 won a majority in the House for the first time since the 1950s, and Gingrich became speaker in early 1995.  Even Clinton supporters acknowledged that the size and scope of Hillarycare unsettled some Americans. She has learned that excessive disruption in this country creates great angst. And also division, said Chris Jennings, who was the first ladys congressional liaison during the 1993-94 battle, and is now an informal adviser on healthcare to Clintons campaign. Reuters did not speak with Clinton for this story. But Clinton wrote in her 2003 autobiography Living History that our most critical mistake was trying to do too much, too fast. That said, I still believe we were right to try. Clinton has also pointed out that while she was still first lady, she rebounded from the Hillarycare setback by urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a health insurance program for children in low-income families.  Clinton was elected in 2000 to the U.S. Senate, where she displayed bipartisanship and caution, said Jim Manley, who was a junior staffer for Senator Ted Kennedy in 1993-94 and later the spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. Once she got to the Senate, she was determined to work with Republicans, Manley said. The senator I saw was someone who was very cautious. She picked an issue and worked very hard to build consensus. Now, having run unsuccessfully for president in 2008 and having served as secretary of state, Clinton is on course to take on Trump, a former reality television personality and luxury real estate developer. On the campaign trail she talks about building on President Barack Obamas 2010 Affordable Care Act, which made health insurance more accessible to millions of Americans. She favors a public option, or government-run plan, being added to the Affordable Care Act. She also has suggested allowing some working Americans to buy into the Medicare government health insurance system for the elderly. What she (Clinton) doesnt believe at this moment in time is that we can or should just start all over again on healthcare, said Jennings, her former congressional liaison.

Clinton clinches Democratic nomination: AP delegate count,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has reached the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, the Associated Press said on Monday, putting her on course to become the first woman to head a major U.S. party ticket. Clinton, a former secretary of state, reached the 2,383 delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee  with a decisive weekend victory in Puerto Rico and a burst of last-minute support from superdelegates, the AP reported. Clinton has 1,812 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses. She also has the support of 571 superdelegates, according to an Associated Press count. The Democratic Party holds its convention in Philadelphia in July to formally choose its nominee for the Nov. 8 election against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Trump University lawyers ask judge for another shot at ending class action,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump asked the California federal judge he attacked last week as biased based on his Mexican heritage to end the Trump University fraud class action currently scheduled to go on trial in November.  In filings late on Friday, Trumps lawyers argued the case should not continue as a class action including all students who took the classes in California, New York and Florida. The lawyers claimed the students cases were too dissimilar to be heard as a class because they were exposed to different marketing and advertisements and were told different things by Trump University employees. San Diego U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel is overseeing two class action lawsuits over Trump University. Last week, the presidential candidate said Curiel had treated him unfairly because he was a Mexican opposed to Trumps proposal to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. Trumps lawyers on Friday sought permission from Judge Curiel to renew an earlier motion to decertify the class. The judge previously ruled the case could proceed as a class action on the issue of liability, though each student would have to prove damages separately. In April, Trumps lawyers also filed a motion to decertify the class in the other California case. The judge has not yet ruled on that motion. If the judge were to decertify the classes, former Trump University students would have to bring individual lawsuits.  Trump and his for-profit real estate seminars have been accused of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 for an opportunity to learn the businessmans real estate investment strategies. The students claim they were defrauded, including by false claims that he had handpicked instructors to teach them his secrets.  Given TU students radically different experiences, plaintiffs cannot showthat TU students were exposed to the same core misrepresentations, Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Trump, wrote in Fridays filing.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to comment on the filing. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1
"Obama lauds Denver Broncos, Peyton Manning for Super Bowl win","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama welcomed the Denver Broncos to the White House on Monday to congratulate the Super Bowl champions for their victory over the Carolina Panthers and send off retiring quarterback Peyton Manning with words of praise.  I have to say Im so pleased to be able to host Peyton here at the White House before I left.Anybody who has been a football fan has watched what is one of the greatest Hall of Fame careers ever, Obama said, with the team standing behind him in the White House Rose Garden. We were all obviously a little disappointed to see him hang it up this spring.But as somebody who is just a little bit older than he is, I was sympathetic to the idea that running around with these guys, it takes its toll, Obama, 54, said of Manning, 40. Obama leaves office in January. As he often does, Obama noted he remained a fan of his hometown team, the Chicago Bears, but he conceded that the Broncos had a good year. I will continue to root for the Bears, he said to laughter. But Ive got to give this organization credit for having done an extraordinary job. And this is a well-deserved celebration of an extraordinary season. The Broncos won their third National Football League championship with a 24-10 win over Carolina in the Super Bowl in February. The following month, Manning retired after an 18-year career with the Indianapolis Colts and Denver that established him as one of the games greatest quarterbacks. ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1
U.S. appeals court weighs revealing 'Bridgegate' co-conspirators,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday heard nearly two hours of argument on whether to release publicly a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the Bridgegate criminal case involving allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The three-judge panel at the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia did not immediately rule, and a rapid-fire volley of skeptical questions aimed at lawyers for both sides made it difficult to predict how the court was leaning. A lawyer representing an individual on the list, identified only as John Doe, urged the court to throw out a lower judges decision to release the information sought by a group of media companies. Its not about what they would like to know, said Does attorney, Jenny Parker. Its about what they are legally entitled to know. But Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for the media, argued the publics right to know was paramount. This is an extremely important issue that goes to how deeply this conspiracy went into the government, he said. The list could shed light on the extent of the scheme to shut down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in 2013 in what prosecutors claim was an act of political revenge against a local mayor. Christie, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination this year, has denied any knowledge of the plot, but the scandal has remained a source of embarrassment. The list includes individuals that prosecutors believe were part of the conspiracy but are not facing criminal charges. Prosecutors have given defense lawyers the information as part of pretrial proceedings. Mondays argument largely focused on a technical issue: whether the list was a bill of particulars, a document that can be subject to public release, or an informal discovery letter that would normally stay sealed. Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, argued in support of Does position, saying prosecutors should be allowed to hand over such information to defendants without fear it will be revealed. As an alternative, the court is considering whether to release all the names but that of John Doe, an option both Doe and the government oppose. Three people have been charged in the case. William Baroni, a former official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Kelly, Christies former deputy chief of staff, are scheduled to face trial in September. David Wildstein, also a former official at the Port Authority, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 ",1
Which ‘La Raza’? Trump comments cause confusion over group's role,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps attacks on a federal judge of Mexican heritage have ignited hundreds of postings on social media about an advocacy group for Latinos that some Trump supporters are calling a terrorist organization. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has said that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, an Indiana native whose parents are Mexican immigrants, is making unfair rulings against him as the presiding judge in a class-action lawsuit over Trump University because of his plans to crack down on illegal immigration, including a promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. As evidence of what they say is Curiels bias, Trump and some of his supporters have pointed to the judges membership in La Raza Lawyers of San Diego, a local group for Hispanic lawyers that is affiliated with the Hispanic National Bar Association. Some Trump supporters have incorrectly linked La Raza Lawyers to the National Council of La Raza, a 50-year-old civil rights group that has been strongly critical of Trumps proposals on immigration, as well as his idea to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.  The NCLRs non-profit designation bars it from engaging in political campaigns, and the groups website describes it as a nonpartisan voice for Latinos.  A conservative blog, GotNews.com, first noted Curiels membership in the lawyers group, which it identified simply as La Raza, on May 31. A day later, another conservative website, The Daily Caller, made a link to the NCLR. After the NCLR was first named, Trump fans on Twitter began attacking it. Judge #TrumpHater #GonzaloCuriel is a member of the #TERRORIST group #LaRazza #BANLaRazza #GonzaloCuriel #RESIGN, wrote a user @WillysBaldSpot, whose profile describes her as a Trump supporter.  I would never have known the La Raza organization existed without Trumps controversial comments. #genius, wrote @asamjulian, another self-proclaimed Trump fan. Trump on Sunday repeated his attack on Curiel in an interview on CBSs Face the Nation. Hes a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say hes got bias, Trump said in the interview.  This judge has treated me very unfairly. Hes treated me in a hostile manner, and theres something going on, he added. The words La Raza translate from Spanish to mean the race, which Trump fans cite as proof the NCLR is a group of people who hate anyone who isnt Hispanic.  Lisa Navarrete, an NCLR spokeswoman, rejected that interpretation, saying that thousands of groups had names that included La Raza as a nod to our common heritage. The attacks on the advocacy group are the latest signs of the increasing racial tension in the 2016 presidential race. Critics have said Trumps calls to deport undocumented immigrants and ban Muslims amount to racism. His supporters say hes defending the country from terrorism and violence.  Some supporters of the New York businessman have blamed the NCLR for the violent clashes between anti-Trump protesters and Trump fans at a San Jose, California, rally last week. Thank you La Raza for putting California into play for Trump, wrote another supporter, @magnifier661. Your violent fascism turned off the voting class #MAGA (a hashtag meaning Make America Great Again).  The NCLR has been criticized in the past for its leaders statements on immigration - the group supports a path to citizenship for people who entered the United States illegally - but Navarrete said it has never before attracted the ire of a presidential candidate.  Over the past week, she said, she and other NCLR officials have been calling journalists and pundits they believe are mischaracterizing the group.  Weve been doing a lot of correcting the media and making sure theyre not repeating what supporters of Mr. Trump are saying, she said. Were sitting around arguing the minutiae of banking regulation, not running around in hoods. Hope Hicks, Trumps spokeswoman, declined to comment. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 ",1
California or bust? Clinton hopes to strike gold in pivotal vote,"WASHINGTON/LONG BEACH, California (Reuters) - If Hillary Clinton ends up losing California to Bernie Sanders, it will be because of voters like Nallely Perez. Perez personifies what a Clinton supporter was supposed to look like: a 24-year-old Latina who grew up idolizing the former first lady as a groundbreaking woman in politics. But when she votes in Californias Democratic presidential nominating contest on Tuesday, Perez will be supporting Sanders.   Everything that I would stand for, he has said it, said Perez, a student at California State University, Long Beach, who said she likes Sanders promises of tuition-free college and universal healthcare. We found our voice in him.  California is the final big contest in the long, bitter fight for the Democratic nomination. Opinion polls show the Democratic race there tightening in recent weeks. Where Clinton, a former secretary of state, once held a big lead over Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, the two now are nearly tied.  A University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll released on Friday showed Sanders with a one-percentage-point lead over Clinton in the state, 44 to 43 percent, a swing from March when Clinton held a nine-point edge.  On the Republican side, Donald Trump has earned the nomination for the Nov. 8 election, and Clinton is close to capturing the number of delegates she needs to head the Democratic ticket. Her campaign expects that a win in New Jersey earlier on Tuesday will secure the nomination.  But a loss in a populous Democratic stronghold like California could lend credence to Trumps claim that she is a weakened candidate.  Clinton would like to go to the nominating convention with the wind at her back and tamp down the perception that she doesnt excite Democrats, said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist in Washington. A Sanders victory will not clear the way to his nomination unless it triggers a defection by scores of superdelegates - party office-holders and officials - from Clintons camp, an unlikely outcome.  Sanders has vowed to use California as a springboard to the party convention in Philadelphia in July. A win, especially a big one, would validate the self-described democratic socialists decision to stay in the race to the end and give him leverage to influence Clintons policies and cabinet picks. The game he is playing is to be able to draw as many concessions as he can out of the party and the Clinton campaign, Mollineau said. The area around Long Beach, part of the 47th congressional district in California, has emerged as a key battleground. Sanders campaigned there a week ago; Clinton was in the area on Friday and may return again before Tuesdays vote. The districts congressman, Representative Alan Lowenthal, remains one of the few uncommitted Democratic members of the House of Representatives to either Clinton or Sanders. His district once leaned Republican, but is becoming increasingly liberal thanks to an influx of Latino and Asian-American voters who comprise the majority of  residents.  The large minority population might be expected to translate into an advantage for Clinton, who has consistently shown strength with such groups. But a Reuters reporter who toured the area observed an abundance of Sanders supporters.  In the Belmont Shore neighborhood of Long Beach, Sanders  volunteers Gordon Winiemko and Jon Fellman manned a table on the sidewalk outside a coffeehouse.  They had a long discussion with Shawn Coleman, a 24-year-old film student, who told them he preferred Sanders to Clinton because I think Im a little bit more for what Bernie has in mind for the future, I think hes right, and Hillary doesnt really seem on it. Lia Roldan, a 42-year-old set decorator in the film industry who lives in Long Beach, said she was voting for Sanders because he has a lot of experience in standing up for causes that benefit the working class. Roldan said she would reluctantly support Clinton in a contest against Trump. Ill vote for her only because I dont want a Republican to win, but I dont really feel in my heart that I would vote for her otherwise, she said.  Stopping Trump was on the minds of those who said they would vote for Clinton on Tuesday. I love Bernie, said Sami Reed, 42, the CEO of a corporate wellness business, interviewed in a thrift shop, but Ill probably vote for Hillary just because I dont want Trump to win.  A second-term congressman, Lowenthal told Reuters he has come under a tremendous amount of grief and pressure from Sanders people to support him, but he would not say for whom he would vote. At California events, Clinton has been careful to focus her criticism on Trump, not Sanders, while talking up her national security experience. She will almost certainly need the support of passionate Sanders backers to defeat the outspoken Trump in November. ",politicsNews,"June 5, 2016 ",1
New York City ad campaign supports transgender bathroom rights,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday announced a citywide advertising campaign supporting a persons right to use bathrooms corresponding with his or her gender identity, wading into a debate that has pitted more than a dozen states against the federal government. The advertisements, which de Blasio described as the nations first government-sponsored citywide campaign of its kind, will appear in subway cars, at bus stops, on phone booths and in both online and traditional publications. The ads feature transgender New Yorkers and encourage residents to look past pink and blue, among other messages. In March, de Blasio signed an executive order ensuring that transgender people can use the bathroom of their choice in any city-owned building without being asked for identification by employees. City law already allows transgender individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. While other cities and states are legislating intolerance and taking away individuals right to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity, we are proudly standing with our transgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers, de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement. President Barack Obamas administration in May released guidance telling public schools across the United States that they must allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. The letter, which offered the U.S. governments interpretation of anti-discrimination law, contained the implicit threat of cutting off federal funding for schools that do not comply.  Officials from more than a dozen states have either sued or plan to sue the Obama administration, challenging the directive as unconstitutional. North Carolina and the U.S. Department of Justice exchanged federal lawsuits last month over the states law banning people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to their gender of their birth.

Clinton hires Latino as voter outreach deputy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As she looks ahead to the November White House election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has hired the leader of a group that seeks to built political power among Latinos to help mobilize key voting communities. CristobalAlex, president of the non-partisan Latino Victory Project, will be the Clinton campaigns new deputy director of voter outreach and mobilization, starting later this month, an aide said. Alex will work under Addisu Demissie, the national voter outreach and mobilization director.  Minority voters have been major blocs for Clinton as she has built a commanding lead over Senator Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic nomination, and they could prove a crucial factor in the general election.  Among those minority voters are Latinos, a fast-growing group that, many activists say, has recently seen a spike in voter registration. Many activists point to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump as the spur for those registrations. Seeking to portray himself as tough on illegal immigration, Trump has angered Latinos by saying Mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers over the border, and pledging to build a border wall that he says he will make Mexico pay for. Most recently, he has drawn criticism, including from senior Republicans, for saying a Mexican-American federal judge overseeing lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University cannot do his job properly because of his Mexican heritage. In contrast, both Clinton and Sanders have actively wooed Latino voters, releasing ads in Spanish and promising to hire Latinos to key cabinet positions.  But one complication when courting these voters is the difficulty in polling multi-lingual, multi-cultural communities. Throughout the election cycle we know that we are going to see a lot of really bad Latino polling, said Matt Barreto, co-founder of research firm Latino Decisions and pollster for the Clinton campaign for Latino issues. Barreto said that he has used large sample surveys of Latino voters for the campaign. We are very confident that the Clinton campaign is taking all the necessary steps to gather the most accurate data possible on Latinos voters, he added. Clinton added to her delegate lead Sunday, when she won Puerto Ricos primary. Primaries on Tuesday, when Clinton hopes to wrap up the nomination, include delegate-rich California, with a diverse population including Latinos, African Americans and Asian Americans. Latino activists have warned Democrats that merely attacking  Trump is not enough to win their votes, pressing for engagement on a range of issues. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 ",1

Clinton picks up win in Puerto Rico's Democratic primary: NBC News,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton won the Puerto Rico Democratic primary on Sunday, moving her a step closer to prevailing over her rival, Bernie Sanders, in the fight for her partys presidential nomination.  Clinton was the projected winner over Sanders in the U.S. island territory, according to NBC News. The win gives the former secretary of state a boost ahead of a big night on Tuesday, when six states, including New Jersey and California, will hold nominating contests. Clinton is hoping to cross the threshold of 2,382 delegates needed to secure the nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election as early as 8 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, when polls close in New Jersey. She and Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, are in a dead heat in California. But delegates in the state are awarded on a proportional basis, so even a loss there for Clinton would not be likely to stop her from securing her partys nomination and a likely general election contest with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Ahead of Puerto Ricos nominating contest, Clinton had been just 60 delegates shy of clinching the nomination, when including superdelegates, who consist of party leaders and elected senators, members of Congress and governors. Sanders is bracing for a prolonged fight that will run into the Democratic convention at the end of July. Networks reported huge voter turnout and long lines in Puerto Rico, with just over 430 polling stations open compared with over 2,000 in 2008.  The island is suffering through a severe debt crisis, which has hampered basic government services. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2016 ",1
"On shrinking U.S. corporate tax base, presidential candidates differ sharply","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The corporate income tax is a major revenue source for the U.S. government, but it has been shrinking for decades and the three main presidential candidates could not differ more dramatically on what to do about it. Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have starkly contrasting plans, some more detailed than others, for taxing corporations. The tax paid by companies on their profits accounted for 30 percent of the U.S. federal tax base in the 1950s; last year, it was only 11 percent, Internal Revenue Service data show.  The decline, experts say, has many causes: loopholes that cut corporations taxes; a lower corporate tax rate; rising overseas profits that are lightly taxed; and a shift away from incorporation toward partnerships and other business structures that pay no corporate tax. Despite the dwindling corporate tax base, Trump, the Republicans presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election, wants to ease the burden on companies by slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. In this regard, he shares the same view as most Republicans. Trump, a real estate developer, has described his proposals as revenue neutral, saying reduced tax rates would be paid for by eliminating some tax breaks and repatriating corporate cash held overseas. However, the Tax Policy Center, a centrist tax research group in Washington, said that under Trumps plan, corporate income tax revenues would fall $1.9 trillion from 2016 to 2026. A cut on that scale would hugely expand the federal budget deficit, unless severe budget cuts or alternative tax hikes were also made, the center said. Steven Rosenthal, a Tax Policy Center senior fellow, said Trumps plan is a standard business-focused approach, but the drafting is incomplete, so we cant tell exactly what hes thinking.   A Trump campaign spokeswoman pointed to the proposals on the campaign website but declined to comment further. Republicans generally support corporate income tax cuts because, they say that would help corporations compete globally. In addition, some question the validity of the tax, which they say is passed on to consumers and investors. Taxing businesses is the Democrats version of manna from heaven: someone else supposedly is paying for the government. But all citizens are hurt through lower growth, higher prices, lower wages, said Grover Norquist, a Republican tax activist. Taxes should be transparent. It should be clear who is paying them. The corporate income tax is designed to hide the tax burden, said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a small-government group that opposes tax increases. Democrats tend to view the corporate income tax as a fair levy on businesses that benefit from the security, services and infrastructure provided by government. Corporations have been taxed by Washington since 1909. Clinton, a former secretary of state and the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has not promised a corporate tax cut. Like Trump, she has called for closing loopholes that corporations use to avoid taxes. But unlike Trump, her plan would raise corporate tax revenues by $136 billion over 10 years, the Tax Policy Center said. Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the candidates proposals go further to prevent the erosion of the corporate tax base by ensuring corporations pay their fair share. But the Clinton campaign has yet to release its full plan. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, would make more drastic changes and boost the corporate tax take by $1 trillion in the same decade, mostly by raising taxes on overseas profits, according to the Tax Policy Center. Virtually all of the revenue raised by Senator Sanders corporate tax plan would come from large, multinational corporations that have shifted their profits offshore to avoid taxes, said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels.  The question of whether businesses pay their fair share of taxes strikes a chord with Americans on the campaign trail. An April Gallup poll found 67 percent of U.S. adults said corporations do not pay enough tax.    Since the mid-1950s, income tax receipts from individuals  have held steady at 40-50 percent of federal revenues, while payroll taxes, deducted from the paychecks of wage-earners, have soared to 34 percent last year from 5-10 percent in the 1950s. Meanwhile, Congress has steadily reduced the corporate tax rate, now 35 percent. That is down from 46 percent in 1986, and 52 percent in 1956. Over that period, corporations have also carved out various loopholes that let them avoid paying the full rate.  The corporate tax applies only to incorporated businesses, while other business structures have been gaining in popularity. In 2003, the share of U.S. business income generated by incorporated companies fell below the share made by partnerships and other kinds of companies that pay no corporate tax.  Whatever candidates may say on the campaign trail, no changes can occur without agreement by Congress. And despite years of talk about the importance of tax reform, neither President Barack Obama nor lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been able to agree on a reform agenda that many say is needed to boost the economy and bring sanity to a tax code of Byzantine complexity.

Senior Republicans criticize Trump's remarks on Hispanic judge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. Republicans distanced themselves on Sunday from Donald Trumps comments about a Mexican-American judge, saying they were worried that the tone of his presidential campaign could enrage Latinos, who are a growing U.S. voting bloc. Trump has accused U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of harboring a bias against him in lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University, the New York business mans now-defunct real estate school. The presumptive Republican nominee has suggested Curiels Mexican-American heritage had influenced the judges opinion because of Trumps campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he couldnt disagree more with Trumps comments about the judge. I am concerned about the Hispanic vote, America is changing, McConnell told Meet The Press. I think its a big mistake for our party to write off Latino Americans. I am concerned about that and I hope he will change his direction on that. Democrats have accused Trump of racially tinged rhetoric about Latinos, including his description of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists in the speech he gave a year ago launching his campaign. Such rhetoric has exacerbated friction between Trump and Republican party leaders such as McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. For the past few years, the party has been trying to broaden its appeal with Latino voters and senior Republicans are concerned that Trumps comments could cost the party votes, not only in the presidential race but in congressional races as well. Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been mentioned as a possible running mate to Trump, called Trumps comments about the judge inexcusable. This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made, Gingrich told Fox News. Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican-immigrant parents. He is a member of a club or society very strongly pro Mexican, which is all fine. But I say hes got bias. I want to build a wall, Trump said in an interview on Sunday on Face the Nation. Asked if he believed a Muslim judge would be biased against him based on Trumps call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, Trump replied, Its possible. Yes. McConnell said America is a nation full of immigrants  pointing out that his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, came to the United States when she was eight and didnt speak English. All of us came here from somewhere else, McConnell said. Senator Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on ABCs This Week that he did not condone the comments that Trump made about Curiel. Legal scholars on the right and the left have criticized Trump for attacking the judge, saying it could harm judicial independence should he become president.  Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is of Mexican descent, was one of the few Republicans to defend Trump. Gonzales argued in a column in The Washington Post that Trump should be allowed to question a judges fairness, saying that questioning a judge is crucial to ensuring public trust in the courts.  But when asked about the racial element in an interview on Sunday on Fox News, Gonzales criticized Trump.  I certainly would have taken a different approach, he said. Whenever you say something about a judges nationality, I think it demeans the office and hurts the judiciary as a whole. ",politicsNews,"June 5, 2016 ",1
"Farah breaks Moorcroft's 3,000m British record","(Reuters) - Double Olympic champion Mo Farah continued his build-up to the Rio Games by breaking David Moorcrofts 34-year-old British record in the 3,000 meters at a Diamond League meeting in Birmingham on Sunday. Farah, the 5,000 and 10,000m gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, won in seven minutes 32.62 seconds after striding out at the front in a determined effort to beat Moorcrofts 1982 time of 7:32.79. Did I get it?, the 33-year-old, who pulled out of the meet last year after being angered by allegations surrounding his coach Alberto Salazar, who denied violating anti-doping rules, asked a BBC interviewer. Thats incredible... I thought Id just missed it. It was a bit tight on the last lap, I had to dig in, added Farah, who paid tribute to his boyhood hero Muhammad Ali before the race by striking a boxing stance. Former Olympic and world heavyweight champion Ali died on Friday aged 74 and Sundays meeting held a minutes applause for the man known as The Greatest. He was a big hero of mine and I send all my condolences to his family and friends, said Somali-born Farah, who will defend  his titles in Rio in August. Kenyas Mathew Kiptanui was second in 7:44.16 with compatriot Hillary Maiyo third. Kenyan David Rudisha, the Olympic 800m champion and world record holder, ran the second fastest 600m ever with his time of 1:13.10, not far off the world best of 1:12.81 in the little-run distance. He felt he could have gone faster. I think I lost it in the last 100 meters, he said. Apart from Farah and Rudisha, there were four other world leading times at the meet including for Conseslus Kipruto of Kenya in winning the mens steeplechase in 8:00.12 and for his  compatriot Asbel Kiprop who took the 1,500 in 3:29.33. Qatars Mutaz Barshim won the mens high jump with a world leading leap of 2.37 meters, while Cubas Yarisley Silva produced a years best of 4.84 in the womens pole vault.    Britains Greg Rutherford, another 2012 Olympic champion, was beaten in the long jump for the first time since last July. He said after his jump of 8.17 left him fifth, with American Marquise Goodwin winning comfortably with a mark of 8.42, that he was struggling with a mild neck injury from the previous round in Rome last week. We have tried to get it 100 percent ready in time. Sadly I have made it worse on the first landing and I am currently unable to move my neck, he said. The doctor thinks it is a bad whiplash but it wont affect my Olympic bid. I am positive the British Athletics medical staff will be able to fix it over the next week. Australias Sally Pearson, the Olympic 100 meters hurdles champion, made her competitive return a year after shattering her wrist in a fall in Rome but finished seventh in a race won by American Kendra Harrison in 12.46 seconds.

Kerry hails Mongolia as 'oasis of democracy' in tough neighborhood,"ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hailed Mongolia as an oasis of democracy sitting in a tough location between Russia and China as he made a rare visit by a cabinet-level U.S. official on Sunday. Arriving from Paris, Kerry made the visit to Mongolia en route to Beijing to attend the eighth Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the high-level talks held between the United States and China each year. The Obama administration has sought to cultivate Mongolia as a partner, given its location between two increasingly assertive U.S. rivals  China and Russia, countries Mongolia relies on heavily for trade and energy imports. U.S. officials regularly tout Mongolia, a country of three million people, as an inspirational story of democratic transition since winning independence from the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago. You really set a great example, Kerry told Mongolian and American embassy staff at the U.S. ambassadors residence. Youve got China on one side of you, and Russia on the other side of you, and there are always a lot of pressures, and here you are in this oasis of democracy fighting for your own identity. But Mongolias democratic and human rights records have come under scrutiny. The 2015 State Department report on human rights in Mongolia noted vague laws and a lack of transparency in legislative, executive, and judicial processes that undermined government efficiency and public confidence and invited corruption. Parliamentary elections are to be held this month, and democracy advocates have criticized a rule change by parliament last month that is expected to disadvantage smaller parties. The lack of transparency in business regulations has hampered foreign investment, officials say, badly needed in an economy where growth has all but halted, far from a peak of 17.5 percent in 2011.  Falling prices for its chief exports, coal and copper, and weak demand from China, by far Mongolias biggest trading partner, are behind the slowdown. Kerry said it was important the Mongolian government implement a transparency agreement with the United States, which would provide greater business confidence to foreign investors.  The Mongolian and U.S. governments signed the agreement in 2013 after years of negotiations but its final implementation has been mired in red tape.  The agreement would commit Mongolia to publish in English an explanation for proposed regulations, and allow for public comments on those regulations, among other measures. The implementation of this agreement is really key, a very important step to be able to attract foreign direct investment, Kerry said. ",politicsNews,"June 5, 2016 ",1
Clinton hits rivals on immigration in California campaign swing,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton fought on two fronts in California on Saturday as she sought to wrap up her battle with Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination, taking aim at him and at Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, with attacks on their immigration stances. Both Clinton and Sanders campaigned across California, stopping in immigrant communities, big cities and the agricultural heartland on the final weekend before Tuesdays primary in the nations biggest state. Clinton used a stop at a Los Angeles-area college to criticize Trump for making hateful, very prejudicial statements about immigrants and Sanders for voting against a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill. I was in the Senate then, so was President Obama and so was Senator Sanders. President Obama and I voted for it, Senator Sanders voted against it. And that ended it, Clinton said. It was heartbreaking, she added. Latinos comprise almost 40 percent of Californias population of roughly 39 million. Clinton, also a former secretary of state, is expected to sew up the party nomination on Tuesday, when California is one of six state holding nominating contests. Except for Washington, D.C., those states are holding the last Democratic nominating contests before the partys July convention. Clinton needs a win in heavily Democratic California to begin unifying her party. Though Sanders, a U.S. senator of Vermont, faces nearly insurmountable odds to become the Democratic nominee, he has invested heavily in California, where a win could pressure the party to adopt some of the populist policies that have driven his campaign. Polls show Sanders has chipped away at Clintons lead in the state, where Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have built a vast network of supporters, including increasingly powerful Hispanic voters. Recent tracking polls showed Clinton having a 2 to 10 percentage point lead over Sanders in California. At a town hall in Los Angeles, Sanders promised to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and said that trade deals, over which he and Clinton have frequently sparred, funnel cheap corn into Mexico and drive small family farmers off their land. California is home to one-fourth of the immigrant population in the United States, at around 10 million people, and also home to one-fourth of the 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the country. Clinton, with 2,312 delegates, needs 71 more to reach the required 2,383 for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has 1,545. California, the most populous U.S. state, has 548 delegates who are awarded proportionately to the popular vote. The other states holding nominating contests on June 7 are Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. Clinton also slammed Trump on immigration at a rally in Oxnard, a city of about 200,000 located northwest of Los Angeles that is almost 75 percent Hispanic. Trump on Friday escalated his attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a lawsuit involving fraud at a failed Trump business, Trump University. Trump suggested that Curiels Mexican-American heritage was influencing his opinion on the lawsuit. Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants. This is not just another outlandish insulting comment from Donald Trump and it is not normal politics, this is something much, much more dangerous, Clinton said. Judge Curiel is just as much of an American as I am and just as much of an American as Donald Trump is, Clinton said. The New York billionaire businessman has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. ",politicsNews,"June 4, 2016 ",1
Clinton opens up double-digit lead over Trump nationwide: Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton has opened up a double-digit lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, regaining ground after the New York billionaire briefly tied her last month, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.  The shift in support comes as Clinton steps up her attacks on the real estate moguls policy positions, and as Trump fends off criticisms of his eponymous university and the pace at which he doled out money that he raised for U.S. veterans.  Some 46 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton, while 35 percent said they supported Trump, and another 19 percent said they would not support either, according to the survey of 1,421 people conducted between May 30 and June 3.  Trump had briefly tied Clinton in support among likely U.S. voters in mid-May, raising expectations for a tight race between the two likely contenders in November's presidential election.  Trump has all but sealed the Republican nod after a string of big wins in state nominating contests forced his party rivals to drop out, while Clinton is still fending off a long-shot bid for the Democratic spot on the ballot by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  Clinton is hoping to seal the nomination next week, when a slew of big states including New Jersey and California will hold primaries, allowing her to consolidate her partys support ahead of a general election matchup against Trump.  Clintons polling surge comes as Trump is been harangued by criticisms over his Trump University, the target of a trio of lawsuits that claim it misled thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about Trumps investment strategies. Trump has defended the school and said he will relaunch it once the litigation ends.  Trump this week also outlined the recipients of millions of dollars in donations he raised at an event in January for veterans groups, in a bid to end speculation that he had not yet handed over all of the money.  On Thursday, Clinton used a foreign policy speech in California to paint Trumps policy platform as dangerously incoherent and cast her Republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure.  Trump responded by saying she lied about his positions and by ripping her record as secretary of state, which he says was marred her handling of government emails and the death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya.

U.S. flexes muscles as Asia worries about South China Sea row,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The United States stepped up pressure on China on Saturday to rein in its actions in the South China Sea, with top defense officials underlining Washingtons military superiority and vowing to remain the main guarantor of Asian security for decades to come. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the U.S. approach to the Asia-Pacific remained one of commitment, strength and inclusion, but he also warned China against provocative behavior in the South China Sea. Any action by China to reclaim land in the Scarborough Shoal, an outcrop in the disputed sea, would have consequences, Carter said. I hope that this development doesnt occur, because it will result in actions being taken by the both United States and ... by others in the region which would have the effect of not only increasing tensions but isolating China, Carter told the Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional security forum in Singapore. The United States will remain the most powerful military and main underwriter of security in the region for decades to come  and there should be no doubt about that. The South China Sea has become a flashpoint between the United States, which increased its focus on the Asia-Pacific under President Barack Obamas pivot, and China, which is projecting ever greater economic, political and military power in the region. Carter however said he would welcome Chinas participation in a principled security network for Asia. Forward thinking statesmen and leaders must ... come together to ensure a positive principled future, he said, adding that the network he envisaged could also help protect against Russias worrying actions and the growing strategic impact of climate change. The deputy head of Chinas delegation to the forum said the United States should reduce its provocative exercises and patrols in the region and said any attempts to isolate China would fail. This is a time of cooperation and common security, Rear Admiral Guan Youfei told reporters. The U.S. action to take sides is not agreed by many countries. We hope the U.S. will also listen to the other countries. Other Asian leaders said the situation in the South China Sea was viewed with concern across the region. All countries in the region need to recognize that our shared prosperities and the enviable rate of growth that this region enjoys over past decades will be put at risk by aggressive behavior or actions by any one of us, Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar told the forum.  Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said his country would help Southeast Asian nations build their security capabilities to deal with what he called unilateral, dangerous and coercive actions in the South China Sea. In the South China Sea, we have been witnessing large-scale and rapid land reclamation, building of outposts and utilization of them for military purposes, Nakatani said. No country can be an outsider of this issue. A Chinese official responded by saying Japan should be careful not to interfere and stir up problems in the waterway, while Chinas foreign ministry also weighed in regarding the U.S. and Japanese comments. Counties outside the region should stick to their promises and not make thoughtless remarks about issues of territorial sovereignty, the ministry said in a statement. Trillions of dollars of trade a year passes through the South China Sea, which is home to rich oil, gas and fishing resources. Besides China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have claims in the area, and rising tensions have been fuelling increasing security spending in the region. The uncertainty of Chinas future trajectory is arguably the main driving concern about possible military competition now and in the future, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said. Carter said that for decades some critics had been predicting an impending U.S. withdrawal from the region, but this would not happen. Thats because this region, which is home to nearly half the worlds population and nearly half the global economy,  remains the most consequential for Americas own security and prosperity. In an apparent counter to America-first policies expounded by prospective Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, including suggestions that U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Asia, Carter stressed bipartisan support for continued engagement. The Shangri-La Dialogue is being held ahead of a significant ruling expected in coming weeks on a case filed by the Philippines in the International Court of Arbitration challenging Chinas South China Sea claims, which Beijing has vowed to ignore. The United States has been lobbying Asian and other countries to back the judges statement that their ruling must be binding, a call echoed by Japan on Saturday. China has lobbied on the other side for support for its position that the court lacks jurisdiction in the case. ",politicsNews,"June 4, 2016 ",1
Vietnamese general says first purchase of U.S. weapons some way off,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The recent lifting of the U.S. arms embargo against Vietnam boosted trust between the former enemies, but significant weapons purchases are some way off, a senior Vietnamese military official said on Saturday. Deputy Defence Minister Nguyen Chi Vinh told Reuters possible weapons buys were part of a long-planned strengthening of Vietnamese-U.S. relations across economic, political, cultural and security fronts. We are not sure what we can buy from the U.S. or what we want to buy, Vinh said in some of the first public comments from a Vietnamese defense official since U.S. President Barack Obama lifted the embargo in Hanoi last month. It is at a very, very first step, I should stress, he said. The removal of the embargo is not just significant in terms of trade, but also in terms of improving high-level trust and confidence. An evolving military relationship between the United States and Vietnam is being closely watched across the region as Hanoi seeks to deter its giant neighbor China over its more asserted stance on claims in the disputed South China Sea. The United States is eyeing closer military relations with Hanoi as it seeks to expand its so-called strategic pivot back to Asia amid concern over Chinas rising power in the region. Vietnam has rapidly increased military spending over the last decade, relying on its Cold War-era patron Moscow for purchases of state-of-the-art submarines, jet fighters and advanced missile systems.   U.S. weapons manufacturers are eager to tap a new market in Vietnam but regional security experts believe Hanoi will move only gradually in easing its dependence on Moscow.  The relatively high cost of U.S. weapons is another factor but regional military sources believe Vietnam is keen to first acquire improved surveillance and communications equipment to help it keep a better watch on China. This could include maritime patrol aircraft. Speaking privately, U.S. officials say Vietnam has yet to start detailed discussions with Washington about its specific needs and gaps in its capabilities, a factor which they believe reflects decades of habitual secrecy. Speaking on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore, Vinh did not detail Vietnams first planned U.S. procurements but repeatedly stated Vietnams military improvements were defensive. Vietnam, like China and Taiwan, claims all the Paracel and Spratlys archipelagos in the South China Sea and Hanoi officials say privately that rising tensions in the South China Sea have complicated otherwise solid relations with Beijing.

"Japan, South Korea to set up direct line between defense ministers","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said on Saturday that Japan and South Korea agreed to expand an emergency communication system between their defense ministries, including adding a new direct line between defense ministers. Tensions have been high in the region since early January when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. It has followed that with a satellite launch and tests of various missiles, most recently a failed launch on Tuesday. What it means is that we will make use of phones for emergency communication, when security-related emergencies such as a missile launch occur, and communication and coordination between the defense authorities of the two countries are needed, Nakatani told reporters at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional security forum in Singapore. He said such emergency phone lines would be expanded to include a new direct link between the two countries defense ministers.  Nakatani said talks would continue on sharing and safeguarding sensitive information on Pyongyangs missile and nuclear programs.  Under the framework, South Korea would pass relevant information to the United States, with which Seoul already has a legally-binding pact to share and safeguard intelligence called General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). The United States would then pass the information on to Japan. It would work similarly the other way around since the United States has also signed a GSOMIA with Japan.  Some South Koreans have voiced concerns about signing a security pact with Japan, their one-time colonial ruler.  Besides historical issues stemming from Japans annexation of the Korean peninsula that ended in 1945, ties have been chilled by a long-running territorial dispute over a group of tiny islets.

Treasury's Lew: China pause on reforms would have 'very bad consequences',"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Friday China would see very bad consequences for its economy and bilateral U.S. relations if it backs away from its stated goals to open its markets and rebalance its economy toward consumer-led growth. Lew, in an interview with Reuters in Seoul, said he would keep the pressure on Chinese officials during talks in Beijing next week to stick to their reform commitments and execute pledges to reduce excess industrial capacity that is distorting world markets. China faces diminished economic prospects in the medium and long term if it fails to continue its reforms, Lew said. Frankly, if China takes a time-out or a step back on the reform agenda, that will have very bad consequences for Chinas economy and it will flow over and not be good in terms of our bilateral economic relations, Lew said. The U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue meetings on June 6-7 in Beijing come at a time of increasing trade tensions between the worlds two largest economies. The U.S. Commerce Department has recently imposed steep anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on a wide-range of Chinese steel products, while U.S. business groups have complained about new Chinese regulations they say favor local firms. Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan is plumbing five-year lows against the dollar, raising concerns about the potential for another devaluation as the Federal Reserve prepares to resume interest rate increases after pausing for the past few months. Lew said China had largely been keeping its G20 commitments to avoid competitive currency devaluations, adding that its action in recent months to spend reserves to support the yuan, also known as the renminbi or RMB, have been consistent with those commitments.   Chinas intervention in the last year has not been to devalue but its been largely to support the RMB, Lew said. I think the test of whether Chinas moved decisively in an orderly way to a more market-oriented exchange rate is whether theyre willing to tolerate movement in both directions. Likewise, Lew said South Korea also needed to resist temptations to intervene in currency markets when there is upward pressure on the won. He said Seoul had refrained from active interventions for the past six to nine months. We have made it clear that weve recognized that. But weve also said that that has to be a durable policy. It has to be a policy that can withstand pressure when markets are going in both directions, he said. He said South Koreas interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade bloc, assuming the deal is ratified,  would provide an incentive to improve its exchange rate policy. A currency side-agreement to the TPP would require transparency in interventions and commitments to avoid interventions to gain trade advantages. The U.S.-China economic and foreign policy talks in Beijing will also provide a forum to air U.S. business groups concerns about regulations in China that they say favor domestic firms. For example, foreign insurers have raised concerns about new cyber security regulations that require secure and controllable information technology. Whether its an anti-monopoly law, or a national security law, if its being either designed or implemented in a way thats designed to create undue burdens on foreign competition, thats problematic, Lew said. Lew said it was important for the next U.S. president to continue the Strategic and Economic Dialogue because otherwise such disputes may not be discussed on a bilateral basis. At a separate meeting on Friday with South Korean Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho, Lew said that coordinated global action was needed to increase pressure on North Korea to drop its pursuit of nuclear weapons. A senior Treasury official said that this would require additional actions by China to adhere to new sanctions aimed at cutting off North Korea from the international financial system until it changes its behavior.

"Trump campaigns in California, denounces protesters at rally as 'thugs'","REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday denounced protesters in California as thugs a day after another demonstration outside one of his political rallies turned violent ahead of the states presidential primary. Demonstrators traded blows on Thursday evening in the street outside the San Jose Convention Center, videos posted to Twitter and online by media showed. Hundreds of protesters waved Mexican flags, chanted anti-Trump slogans and burned Trump hats and at least one U.S. flag. Speaking before a packed crowd in the northern California city of Redding on Friday, Trump described the previous nights rally as a love fest inside. No problems whatsoever. But then his supporters walked out and they got accosted by a bunch of thugs, he said. The protesters, many angry over Trumps rhetoric against illegal immigration, have gathered at Trump rallies for months. Trump, now the Republican Partys likely presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, canceled a rally in Chicago in March after clashes broke out between his supporters and protesters. The San Jose Police Department reported 300 to 400 protesters had gathered outside the Trump rally on Thursday, where police formed lines to protect attendants exiting the convention center. A number of the skirmishes occurred beyond police lines on nearby streets and at a parking garage, a Reuters photographer said. One sergeant suffered minor injuries after a protester struck him with a metal object. Police reported four arrests. Over 250 officers staffed the all-hands on deck event, said San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia. In hindsight, wed say that wasnt enough, said Garcia. For future events of that scope, we would need more officers with an absolute, number one goal of keeping both parties separate as much as we can. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, told the Associated Press that Trump needs to take responsibility for his supporters conduct at the rallies. But Trump, speaking in Redding on Friday, made light of the mayors concerns. You know what I say when we have a protestor, which isnt very often, I say, Be very gentle, please dont hurt him ... If he punches you in the face, smile, Trump said. Violence has peppered Trumps recent rallies in New Mexico and California, the U.S. state with the largest immigrant population, in advance of primary elections there on Tuesday. The latest violence followed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons scorching critique of Trump in a speech on Thursday in which she derided the real estate developer as a dangerous man with an angry, fearful world view. Clinton told CNN on Friday that Trump had set a low bar regarding violence at political events. Now is it a surprise that people who dont like him are stepping over that bar? I dont think it is, Clinton said. But Friday afternoons rally was peaceful as supporters from Redding and neighboring towns gathered as early as 8 a.m. local time (1500 GMT) to catch a glimpse of the candidate, many wearing hats emblazoned with Trumps signature slogan: Make America Great Again. Despite the unrest in San Jose, attendees said they felt at ease at Fridays event. Were both retired law enforcement, Heather Jimenez, a 45-year-old Cottonwood resident, said of herself and her husband. No worries. Although no formal protests broke out in Redding, the event attracted some who disapprove of Trump, but wanted to witness his high-flying campaign style in person. Weve been hearing his nonsense, said Rachel Ochoa, a 57-year-old Redding resident who teaches English as a second language. All we hear is him attacking the opponents and others. Trump has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists across the U.S. border and has promised to build a wall between the two neighboring countries and make Mexico pay for it. Were gonna build that wall, folks, Trump said on Friday as the crowd chanted its support. Trump also lamented the loss of American jobs to other countries, a key theme in his campaign. The message resonated in Redding, which residents say has been hit hard by the economic downturn. Weve got a lot of people here out of work, said Joyce Tausch, a 78-year-old retiree who lives in Redding. Trump is gonna do things for us. ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 ",1
Obama to Democrats: 'I want us to run scared' in election,"MIAMI (Reuters) - President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Friday that they need to work hard to defeat likely Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election but must avoid violence like that at a rally in California this week. Strange things can happen in an election like this if were not working hard, if were not engaged, if were not participating, Obama told donors at a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee. I want us to run scared the whole time, he said. Obama decried the clashes between supporters of likely Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and protesters on Thursday at a rally in San Jose, California. We saw in San Jose these protesters starting to pelt stuff at Trump supporters; thats not what our democracys about, Obama said. Theres no room for violence. Theres no room for shouting. Theres no room for a politics that fails to at least listen to the other side, even if you vehemently disagree, he said. Obama spoke to about 90 people who paid $10,000 to $30,000 for the dinner at the home of Robert Rubenstein, a personal injury lawyer. He noted the constant television coverage of Trump, saying celebrity and fame is such a driver in this culture. Obama said Republicans have no coherent economic theory. Rather it is feeding resentments and looking for a they to blame for whatever frustrations people understandably feel at any given point in time, he said. Being able to say its immigrants or its gays or its somebody that is taking something away from you - thats the essence of the message that the Republican nominee is delivering, he said.

Trump seizes on U.S. jobs report to target Democratic economic policies,"WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said a U.S. jobs report on Friday that showed the weakest hiring in more than five years proved that Democratic economic policies are pushing the country in the wrong direction. The report gave Trump his biggest opening yet to target Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on the economy, after months of mostly solid economic indicators. Its going the wrong way folks. Theyve been kidding themselves, theyre playing games. Its going the wrong way, Trump told a rally in Redding, California. Clinton, the front-runner to be the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has credited President Barack Obama for reviving the U.S. economy after the 2008 recession but has also said that the recovery is not over. In a CNN interview, Clinton acknowledged the figures were disappointing to anybody. I think President Obama inherited a terrible situation and Ive said that repeatedly over the past year and weve come a long way out of the ditch we were dropped into by failed Republican policies, Clinton told CNNs Jake Tapper. The unemployment rate in May fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent, the lowest level since November 2007, but that was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force. Overall, nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs in May.  If disappointing jobs reports continue, Trump could use Clintons pledge to build on Obamas work against her to woo working-class voters in states such as Ohio. The state has lost well-paying manufacturing jobs and is also a key presidential battleground - closely competitive because it does not lean heavily Republican or Democratic. Clinton, a former secretary of state, is likely to finally clinch the Democratic nomination over challenger Bernie Sanders on Tuesday when six states hold nominating contests. One is California, the most populous U.S. state, with the most Democratic delegates of any other state and where both candidates have been campaigning heavily. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, some 46 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton, while 35 percent said they supported Trump, and another 19 percent said they would not support either. The survey of 1,421 people was conducted between May 30 and June 3. Trump, a real estate developer, has already sewn up the Republican nomination. In the general election campaign, job creation plans are expected to be a priority, particularly in states that have been hit hard by manufacturing-sector job losses.  Trump has promised to toss out international trade deals to revive U.S. manufacturing and sweep away a slew of environmental regulations to bolster the ailing energy sector.  Job creation in the manufacturing and construction sectors fell sharply in May, according to Fridays jobs report.  Trump has already begun working economic numbers into his stump speeches. He has said he could put 15 states that have voted for Democratic presidents in recent elections in play, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, which have all lost manufacturing-sector jobs. Peter Morici, a conservative economist and professor in the business school at the University of Maryland, said the poor jobs numbers reflected trends that have driven voter frustration and fueled the populist campaigns of both Trump and Sanders.  He said Trump needed to add detail to his economic policies, such as detailing changes to social programs like Medicaid, which provides healthcare for the poor. We cant just turn around and cut income taxes without doing something about those things, Morici said. Republican strategists agreed that Fridays jobs report created an opportunity for Trump to differentiate his policies from Obamas or Clintons. It allows Donald Trump to tout how he would do things differently as president and focus on some of the job-creation plans that he has, Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said, adding it would also allow Trump to talk about his record as a businessman.     Trump has been fleshing out his foreign policy ideas and has released a tax plan, but he has been light on other details, such as how he would oversee the U.S. financial system.

Trump defends attacks on Mexican-American U.S. federal judge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump defended his attacks on a Mexican-American judge on Friday, resisting pressure from top Republicans to moderate his tone out of concern he is hurting his chances to win the White House. Trumps bomb-throwing rhetoric helped him defeat 16 Republican rivals for the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. But facing a tough fight with expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, many Republicans want him to present a more disciplined image. Feeling confident his method has been a winner, Trump so far has waved off some of the advice from Republicans who support him but want less loose talk. In a CNN interview, Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the son of Mexican immigrants who is the presiding judge in lawsuits involving fraud allegations against Trump University, the New York businessmans defunct real estate training school. Trump suggested Curiels Mexican heritage was influencing the judges opinion about the case because Trump has campaigned on a platform of building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to stop illegal immigration. Hes proud of his heritage, Trump said. Hes a Mexican. Were building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people cant even believe. This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment, Trump said.  The judge a week ago unsealed documents related to the case. Comments from the two top elected U.S. Republicans, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reflected continued worries among establishment Republicans about Trump. Ryan, who endorsed Trump on Thursday, said the comments from Trump about the judge were out of left field. He clearly says and does things I dont agree with. And Ive had to speak up ... (from) time to time when that has occurred. And Ill continue to do that if thats necessary. I hope its not, Ryan told a Milwaukee radio station. McConnell, speaking on MSNBC, raised concerns about Trumps criticism of New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, a rising star in the Republican Party who can appeal to Hispanic voters. After attacking her record last week, Trump on Thursday moderated his tone and said he would like her endorsement. We ought to be trying to unify, he ought to be trying to unify the party behind him, McConnell said of Trump. Most of us are committed to supporting him and trying to bring the party together, and I think he needs to play his role on all of that as well.  Trump received 32 percent support from Latino voters in an NBC News/Survey Monkey poll this week, a respectable number given his critical comments throughout the campaign about illegal immigrants, most of whom come from Mexico and other Latin American countries. But the specter of Trump as the nominee has worried some Hispanic Republicans. This week, Ruth Guerra, who is a Mexican-American, resigned as the Republican National Committees chief of Hispanic media relations. A source familiar with her departure said she was not comfortable with Trump as the nominee. More broadly, Reince Preibus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been trying to persuade Trump to moderate his tone as a way to heal fissures in the party, at a time when Trump will need to rely on deep-pocketed Republican loyalists to finance a $1 billion campaign. He needs one thing and one thing only: discipline, said a senior party official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But if a Trump rally in Redding, California, was any indication, the candidate feels his method is working. Temperament is a very important word, Trump said, referring to Clintons charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the White House. We need toughness in tone. We need toughness in temperament. Stung by attacks on him from Clinton on Thursday, Trump dredged up scandals from the 1990s to hit her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, saying they are dishonest. He cited Bill Clintons affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. First of all, shes always got problems: Whitewater (a controversial real estate deal), impeachment, lies. He didnt have sex with that woman, Trump said. These are lying people. We dont need, folks, another four years of the Clintons. ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 ",1
Obama commutes prison terms of 42 non-violent drug offenders,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama commuted the prison terms of 42 non-violent drug offenders, nearly half of whom were serving life sentences, in his latest batch of clemency decisions, the White House said on Friday. The individuals have more than repaid their debt to society and earned this second chance, Neil Eggleston, the White House counsel, wrote in a blog. They were convicted under drug sentencing laws put on the books before Obama became president that were outdated and unduly harsh, Eggleston wrote.  Obama has worked to reform the U.S. criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for drug crimes. It is one of the few areas in which the Democratic president has received support from Republican lawmakers.  Many of the convicts had been serving time for crack cocaine charges. Crack offenders have for years faced stiffer penalties than offenders of powder cocaine, even though the two substances are molecularly similar. Critics have said the disparity has unfairly hurt minority communities.  Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years in April, 2014. The program has struggled under a deluge of thousands of unprocessed cases.  Some legal experts, including Rachel Barkow, faculty director at the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University, have urged Obama to move faster on the program, saying unless he does, the program will remain a lottery for thousands of other convicts. Fridays commutations bring the total to 348, more than granted by the previous seven presidents combined, the White House said. George W. Bush commuted the sentences of 11 individuals, Bill Clinton granted clemency to 61 and George H.W. Bush granted clemency to three people, the White House said.  We are confident that there will be many more commutations in the months before Obama leaves office in January next year,  Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general, said in a release. The White House also said Obama is committed to strengthening drug rehabilitation programs. ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 ",1
Kerry: video cut 'clumsy and stupid and inappropriate',"PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It was stupid, clumsy and inappropriate for someone to edit the video of a State Department briefing in 2013, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday as two U.S. lawmakers demanded information about the incident.  A Republican congressman asked the State Department inspector general to investigate why part of a public briefing that dealt with Iran nuclear talks was cut before it was posted online while another demanded documents about the incident. The excised portion of the Dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the United States was holding secret direct nuclear talks with Iran. The spokeswoman had denied there were such talks, which were later made public. The State Department this week said she did not know about the secret talks when she denied their existence. Speaking to reporters in Paris, Kerry sounded chagrined about the episode, which has drawn Republican criticism. Whatever happened was both clumsy and stupid and inappropriate, Kerry said. Asked if he wanted people who tampered with the historical record working for him, he replied: Of course not. I just said, its inappropriate. The State Department initially said it believed a glitch caused the gap but on Wednesday said an internal inquiry found it was a deliberate omission. However, it said no rules were broken because none existed governing the integrity of the briefing video. Rules are now being put in place. U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the technician who excised part of the video told investigators she got a call asking her to do so, discussed the request with her supervisor and concluded it came from a level of credibility and authority high enough that they should act on the request. The State Department has said the technician does not remember who called her. On Friday the department said it cannot use internal phone records to trace who requested the cut to the briefing video because it keeps such data for only 24 hours. Top officials in the Bureau of Public Affairs in late 2013, including former Assistant Secretary Doug Frantz, former spokeswoman Jen Psaki, former deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, and deputy assistant secretaries Dana Smith, Valerie Fowler and Moira Whelan have all denied asking for the video to be excised. In tampering with this video, the Bureau of Public Affairs has undermined its mission to communicate timely and accurate information with the goal of furthering U.S. foreign policy, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said in a letter released by his office that asked the departments inspector general, Steve Linick, to investigate the matter. Separately, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, also a Republican, on Tuesday wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry asking for documents related to the edited video to be turned over to his panel by Wednesday.

"U.S. lawmakers probe Fed cyber breaches, cite 'serious concerns'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee has launched an investigation into the Federal Reserves cyber security practices after a Reuters report revealed more than 50 cyber breaches at the U.S. central bank between 2011 and 2015. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology on Friday sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to express serious concerns over the central banks ability to protect sensitive financial information. The letter cited the Reuters report, which was based on heavily redacted internal Fed records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. The redacted records did not say who hacked the banks systems or whether they accessed sensitive information or stole money. These reports raise serious concerns about the Federal Reserves cyber security posture, including its ability to prevent threats from compromising highly sensitive financial information housed on the agencys systems, said the letter, signed by House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, and Barry Loudermilk, a Georgia Republican and chairman of the panels oversight subcommittee. A Fed spokesperson said the central bank had received the panels letter and will respond to it. The panel asked the Feds national cyber security team - the National Incident Response Team - to turn over all cyber incident reports in unredacted form from Jan. 1, 2009, to the present. It also asked for incident reports from the Feds local incident response teams. Global policymakers, regulators and financial institutions have become increasingly concerned about the security of the international banking system after a string of cyber attacks against banks in Bangladesh, Vietnam and elsewhere linked to fraudulent transaction messages sent across the global financial platform SWIFT. The probe into the Feds security practices followed a separate inquiry by the same committee into the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks handling of the cyber theft of $81 million from one of its accounts held by the central bank of Bangladesh. The committee said it has jurisdiction over the Feds cyber security because the panel is tasked with oversight of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency responsible for developing federal cyber security standards and guidelines, under a 2014 federal information technology law. The panel also requested a detailed description of all confirmed cyber security incidents from 2009 to the present, all documents and communications referring or relating to higher impact cases handled by the Feds NIRT team, all documents and communications with the Feds Office of Inspector General related to confirmed cyber incidents, and an organizational chart detailing the Feds top cyber security personnel. The committee requested a response to its inquiry by June 17. (Click here to read the letter: tmsnrt.rs/1VBXvSz) The Feds computer systems hold confidential information on discussions about monetary policy that drives financial markets. The central banks staff suspected hackers or spies were behind many of the breaches, the records obtained by Reuters show.  The Fed had declined to comment on the records, which represent only a slice of all cyber attacks on the central bank because they include only cases involving the Washington-based Board of Governors, a federal agency that is subject to public records laws.

Clinton attacks Trump's foreign policy as a threat to U.S. safety,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lambasted  Donald Trumps foreign policy platform as dangerously incoherent in a speech on Thursday that cast her Republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure. In remarks that at times resembled a comedy roast, Clinton unleashed a torrent of polished zingers and one-liners to attack Trumps policies and character, suggesting Trump might start a nuclear war if elected to the White House simply because somebody got under his very thin skin.  Donald Trumps ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent, she said to a room of supporters in San Diego, California. Theyre not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies. Clinton, the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee, delivered her speech as she seeks to shift her attention to the Nov. 8 election against likely rival Trump and away from Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, who is continuing his long-shot bid for the nomination. Clinton was speaking in San Diego ahead of Californias June 7 primary election. Democratic Party leaders have fretted about how to best oppose Trump, who managed to knock out all 16 rivals for the Republican nomination in part with his uninhibited style of assailing them with personal insults. Trump revels in referring to Clinton as Crooked Hillary and dredging up the infidelities of her husband, Bill Clinton, the former president. Clintons remarks were intended in part to show she would not be cowed and that she could go toe-to-toe with him in scornful put-downs. He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia, she said as the crowd guffawed, and she suggested Trump would run the U.S. economy like one of his casinos. During her speech, Clinton predicted Trump, who has been deeply critical of Clintons foreign policy record, would take to his Twitter account to insult her, and he did. Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! ran one posting during the speech, which included a typo. Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesnt even look presidential! Trump has said previously that Clinton is distorting his actual policies. Amid the laugh lines, Clinton cited her own experience as secretary of state, in particular her role advising President Barack Obama during the mission to kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, to suggest her approach to foreign policy was the more serious. He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends, including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the pope, Clinton said, listing some of the allies with whom Trump has verbally sparred in the last year. Obama, who has also been repeatedly mocked by Trump, has criticized Trump as being ignorant or cavalier about world affairs and has said that Trumps rise has rattled foreign leaders. Trump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by Obama. Trump has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and said he would ask members of the 28-nation NATO alliance to pay up or get out. He has said he would sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyangs nuclear program. Clinton derided these and other positions, promising she would do a better job keeping the United States safe. Standing in front of a backdrop of 19 large U.S. flags, an unusual abundance even by the standards of presidential campaign events, Clinton painted the election as a choice between two very different visions. One thats angry, afraid and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline, she said, summing up Trumpism. The other is hopeful, generous and confident in the knowledge that America is great, just like we always have been. Trump has criticized Clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as secretary of state, including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. He cites Clintons support for the war in Iraq, launched by former Republican President George W. Bush, as another example of her shortcomings. Democratic challenger Sanders echoed Clintons concerns about Trump after her speech, though he also criticized Clintons foreign policy. I agree ... that Donald Trumps foreign policy ideas are incredibly reckless and irresponsible, Sanders said in a statement. In criticizing Clinton, Sanders cited her vote for the war in Iraq, calling it the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history, and said she has been a proponent of regime change, as in Libya, without thinking through the consequences. In assailing each others suitability for the White House, Clinton and Trump are reflecting a negative voter mood ahead of next months party conventions that will choose the presidential nominees. Both Clinton and Trump are facing record-low favorability ratings. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Friday through Tuesday shows half of Trump supporters say the primary reason they are going to vote for him is I dont want Hillary Clinton to win, while 41 percent of Clinton supporters cite their primary reason as not wanting Trump to win.

NATO's top soldier says Trump comments play into hands of Putin,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - NATOs top military officer, General Petr Pavel, denounced U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday for criticizing the alliance as obsolete and said such comments played to the hands of its opponents. In unusual criticism of a presidential candidate, Pavel, chairman of the NATO Military Committee, said in an interview that Russian President (Vladimir) Putin and some others may be pleased by this approach. To take such an approach would be a great mistake, he said. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, has criticized the decades-old NATO alliance with mainly European nations - a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy - as obsolete and too costly for the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was set up in a different era, Trump has said, when the main threat to the West was the Soviet Union. It was ill-suited to fighting terrorism. Pavel, a former Czech Republic army chief, said the NATO alliance formed in 1949 was not perfect but it had great potential as well as the chance to be improved. Statements like these are not necessarily damaging, but they are not useful, Pavel said in Singapore on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asias biggest security summit. On Thursday, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton also lambasted Trumps foreign policy platform as dangerously incoherent. Trumps emergence as a strong presidential candidate has been a talking point at the Shangri-La Dialogue. Carl Thayer, an Australian security expert, said the prospect of Trump in office would have to be dealt with realistically. Australias experience had shown that you damn well have to work with the U.S. president, he told a news conference. At the meeting, Pavel was to discuss regional issues, including rival claims in the South China Sea and rising tension in Northeast Asia, where North Korea has been stepping up its testing of nuclear capabilities. China and the United States have traded accusations of militarizing the South China Sea, which is claimed almost entirely by Beijing. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have claims to parts of the waters, through which trade worth trillions of dollars is shipped every year. Freedom of navigation in this region, through the South China Sea, is crucial for any further development in the region and its difficult to imagine that without this freedom, there will be stability and peace in this region, Pavel said. NATO could not act on the issue using military means, but mainly political means, he added. North Korea, which conducted its fourth nuclear test in January and followed that with a satellite launch and tests of various missiles, was a great concern for NATO, Pavel said. Western sanctions have not been successful in deterring Pyongyang from developing its nuclear capabilities. The only country which may change the equation is China, Pavel said, pointing to the fact that 90 percent of North Koreas trade is with its big neighbor. Pavel also said he hoped an upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw would agree cyber as an operational domain of war, along with air, sea, land and space. ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 ",1

"Michigan House approves, sends school funding package to state Senate","(Reuters) - Michigan lawmakers on Thursday approved paying off a $467 million deficit incurred by Detroit Public Schools and to fund costs associated with creating a new school system, online legislative records showed and local media reported.  The states Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved the bill package, sending the legislation to the state Senate which could take up the legislation when it convenes on Tuesday, according to online records.  This plan saves Detroits school system and returns local control to the city, preventing a disastrous bankruptcy that would have affected every community in the state, House Speaker Kevin Cotter, a Republican, said in a statement.  The legislation has the state paying off $467 million in operating deficit incurred by the cash-strapped school system and providing $125 million to create a new debt-free school district, the news website MLive.com reported.  TheDetroitpublic school system, or DPS, has nearly 46,000 students. It has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency. Thursdays legislation comes less than a month before DPS was expected to run out of money to pay employees.  House Democrats said in a statement that the legislation would force the closing of DPS schools and allow failing charter schools to proliferate. House Republicans are playing games with the Detroit Public Schools, and the children of Detroit are the ones who will lose, House Democratic Leader Tim Greimel said.  Democrats also opposed the legislation because it does not include a Detroit Education Commission, a body that would work to prevent low-performing schools from opening and ensure schools are placed in underserved areas, MLive.com reported.

Trump escalates attacks on judge in Trump University suit: WSJ,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his attacks on the federal judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University, saying the judge had an absolute conflict because of his Mexican heritage, the Wall Street Journal reported. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, is fighting lawsuits that accuse his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaires real estate investment strategies. In an interview with the newspaper, Trump said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had an absolute conflict in presiding over the litigation given that he was of Mexican heritage and a member of a Latino lawyers association. Trump said the background of the judge, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants, was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern U.S. border, the Journal said. Im building a wall. Its an inherent conflict of interest, Trump said, according to the newspaper. The New York businessman also alleged the judge was a former colleague and friend of one of the Trump University plaintiffs lawyers, the newspaper said. The judge and the lawyer once worked together as federal prosecutors, but the lawyer, Jason Forge, in an interview with the Journal, said he had never seen the judge socially. Neither Judge Curiels ethnicity nor the fact that we crossed paths as prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys Office well over a decade ago is to blame for Trumps actions, Forge told the Journal. An assistant in Curiels chambers said he was not commenting on the matter, the newspaper said. At a rally in San Diego last week, Trump lashed out at Curiel.  I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. Hes a hater, Trump said. Were in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, Trump said, adding he believed Curiel was Mexican. Legal scholars said Trump could face consequences for slamming the judge, although many have speculated that Curiel was unlikely to sanction him formally. Trump has drawn criticism for his comments about immigrants from Mexico, some of whom he has said were criminals and rapists. He has proposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration and requiring Mexico to pay for it. ",politicsNews,"June 3, 2016 ",1
U.S. election's anti-trade tone 'concerning': Union Pacific CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rhetoric against free trade from both likely U.S. presidential nominees poses a risk to the economy and consumers who would lose out if international trade is restrained, the chief executive of the largest U.S. railroad said on Thursday. Global trade is not getting a fair shake in the dialogue, Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) CEO Lance Fritz said during a discussion with Reuters journalists. Weve devolved to a form of populism in the rhetoric and that strikes me as having a lot of negative consequences. Free trade agreements and their impact on U.S. workers have been a major theme in the 2016 campaign for the presidential election on Nov. 8. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and promised to rip up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has criticized the partnership deal, which was signed in February but has not yet won congressional approval.  Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific has a growing business serving cross-border trade with Mexico, and over the past decade has reported increased shipments of containers full of consumer goods, many of which come from Asia. Fritz said both candidates are arguing that NAFTA is a bad thing, even though Trump has been more vocal than Clinton in warning about losing jobs to foreign competition and threatening to slap tariffs on imported goods. Thats concerning to me, Fritz said. Thats telling the U.S. public that free trade is a bad idea, and thats patently not in the interest of the U.S. consumer. We are worried and thinking about what-ifs, Fritz said when asked how his company would deal with a Trump or Clinton administration. What Im hoping is we get a little more clarity as we get closer (to the election) and it starts making sense and we can plan around it. Fritz, who has served as Union Pacific CEO since February 2015, also noted that despite low fuel prices, U.S. consumers still have not taken up the slack in the broader economy. We havent seen a strong consumer in a little while, he said. Fritz said he did not know when the railroad would meet its target of an operating ratio, a measure of efficiency, of 55 percent. The ratio expresses operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, so the lower the figure the better.  Were going to get there as soon as we can in a reasonable fashion, he said. Union Pacific posted a first-quarter operating ratio of 65.1 percent. U.S. railroads generally have a significantly higher operating ratio than the 58.9 percent reported in the first quarter by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) and Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO). Fritz also said Union Pacific would have an anti-collision system mandated by Congress in place by the deadline of 2018. But the company would need the two one-year extensions allowed to debug the Positive Train Control (PTC) system, he added. Last year, Congress extended the deadline for the systems implementation beyond 2015, despite opposition from some lawmakers following a fatal Amtrak crash in Pennsylvania in May 2015.

"Lawsuit filed over Baltimore primary election, citing irregularities","(Reuters) - Activists have filed a federal lawsuit asking for a new primary election in Baltimore, alleging irregularities during the tight April 26 mayoral vote. The lawsuit was filed by Voters Organized for the Integrity of City Elections, or VOICE, late on Wednesday against the city and state election boards. It asks the U.S. District Court to declare the primary election results invalid, order a new election and appoint federal observers to oversee the procedure. State Senator Catherine Pugh narrowly won the Democratic mayoral primary, defeating former Mayor Sheila Dixon. Pugh had backed law enforcement reform as Baltimore recovers from unrest in April 2015 sparked by a black mans death from an injury suffered while in police custody. An investigation by the state election board found that Pugh won the nomination by 2,400 votes. About 1,700 ballots cast in the primary were handled improperly, the probe found. Dixon said on Wednesday that she would not file a lawsuit challenging the election outcome. Spokesmen for the two election boards did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit alleged improper handling of the ballots. It also alleged that voters were hampered by polling places that opened late and by a letter mistakenly sent by election officials to ex-offenders saying they might not be able to vote because of their convictions.

"India's Modi goes to Washington as U.S. partner, but not yet full ally","NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two years ago there were questions over whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could get a visa to enter the United States. Next week he visits Washington as one of President Barack Obamas closest international partners. Obama invited Modi for one of the last big visits by a world leader before his term ends in January. Although the trip wont feature a lavish state dinner, the Indian leader will address both houses of Congress, considered a rare honor. This will be their seventh meeting since Modi became prime minister in May 2014, an impressive tally for a U.S. president and a leader who is not a formal ally, said Ashley Tellis at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. The personal relationship between the president and the prime minister ... is really one of the unanticipated surprises of the past two years, said Tellis, an expert on India. The developing relationship is seen as an Obama foreign policy success. Washington views India as an important part of its rebalance to Asia and as a counterweight to China.  The two countries are finalizing agreements that would make it possible for their militaries to cooperate more closely, and for U.S. defense manufacturers to both sell and make high-tech weaponry in India. A deal on logistics would govern issues such as how the two countries account for costs of military exercises. Another involves encrypted communications and geospatial data transfer. A history of colonial rule followed by decades of non-alignment has, however, made New Delhi wary of an embrace by the more powerful United States, which has overtaken Russia as Indias top arms supplier. It is neither a strategic partnership nor an alliance, said Nitin Gokhale, founder of defense portal Bharat Shakti. It can be a long-term arrangement, but to call it a strategic partnership would be premature.  There are frustrations, too, on the U.S. side. The two countries reached a civil nuclear agreement in 2005, but it has yet to yield any contracts for U.S.-based companies. Only now is Westinghouse, a unit of Japans Toshiba, approaching the finish line on a deal to build six reactors in India. The visit gives Modi a chance to network with U.S. lawmakers who may feature in a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton administration but, as it coincides with the California primary, he is not expected to meet either. Modi is generally popular with U.S. lawmakers, who extended his invitation to address Congress. But they criticize what they see as lingering unfriendliness to U.S. firms and a stifling bureaucracy, and question New Delhis record on human rights. The economic engagement between our two countries should increase and it should be more accessible for U.S. companies, Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a telephone interview.  Obama and Modi are expected to discuss Indias desire to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a 48-member club of nuclear trading nations. India was shut out for decades because of its weapons program, and the civil nuclear agreement with the United States gave it access to foreign suppliers without giving up its arms. Obama administration officials have said they backed Indias desire to join the group, but the idea faces resistance among some on Capitol Hill, as well as from China, an ally of Indias arch-rival Pakistan. Existing NSG guidelines were established to guard against nuclear proliferation, and we should not create exceptions for particular countries, Corker said. There is lingering concern in Washington over Modis handling of communal riots in 2002 that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, in Gujarat. Modi was chief minister of the state at the time and, though a court-ordered inquiry found insufficient evidence to prosecute him, the issue prevented him from getting a U.S. visa for years. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised human rights on a visit to New Delhi this week, saying the two largest democracies had special obligations to set the highest standards. Congress Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission has scheduled a hearing on India for June 7, the day Modi arrives in Washington and the day before his address to the combined House of Representatives and Senate. He leaves the United States on June 8. Corker promised to asked Modi about Indias record on human trafficking, which he brought up recently in an emotional Senate hearing with Obama administration officials. The country we believe has 12-14 million slaves, which is close to half the number we believe exists worldwide, Corker said. Its obviously a very significant issue and when hes here, its one I certainly plan to raise. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 ",1
Republican House Speaker Ryan backs Trump after long courtship,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican, ended a long period of soul-searching and endorsed Donald Trump for president on Thursday, a step toward unifying party loyalists behind the insurgent candidate despite concerns about his candidacy. Ryan had been a high-profile holdout to supporting Trump for the Nov. 8 presidential election out of concern about the presumptive Republican nominees bellicose rhetoric and break with party orthodoxy on issues including trade and immigration. The House of Representatives speaker announced his support in a column for the Janesville Gazette newspaper in his home state of Wisconsin. It surfaced in the middle of a speech by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in which she launched a far-reaching attack on Trumps foreign policy credentials. Ryan did not specifically use the word endorse in his column, but his spokesman, Brendan Buck, made clear that Ryans move should be seen as an endorsement. The speaker had criticized the Republican candidate several times, including Trumps proposal in December to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States because of national security concerns. The 46-year-old Ryan was the only member of the Republican congressional leadership who had not formally embraced Trump. In a tweet, Trump responded: So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again! Ryans backing of Trump could give cover to more reluctant Republicans to get behind the billionaire businessman as their best chance to win the White House. I think the endorsement is significant because it shows the falling in line of the establishment Republicans from the top, said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. It should also help Trump make the case that he can bring the party together as he girds for a Republican nominating convention in July that many party leaders plan to skip. It also represents a blow to Republicans who have been trying to organize a third-party bid to give party loyalists who cannot abide Trump someone else to support. The never Trump crowd includes 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. Ryan was Romneys vice presidential running mate. While Ryans decision could push some Republican leaders off the fence, many holdouts remained, such as two former rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Aides to both said their positions had not changed. Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid described Ryans move as abject surrender, adding: The GOP is Trumps party now. Ryan met Trump in a high-profile meeting last month and they have since had a number of telephone calls. Its no secret that he and I have our differences. I wont pretend otherwise, Ryan wrote. And when I feel the need to, Ill continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement. Ryan said he and Trump had spoken many times in recent weeks about how, by focusing on issues that unite Republicans, we can work together to heal the fissures developed through the primary. Through these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve peoples lives. Thats why Ill be voting for him this fall, Ryan said. Announcing he will vote for Trump should make it a bit more comfortable for Ryan to chair the partys nominating convention in Cleveland. While Ryans endorsement was significant for Trump, there remain many concerns about him within the party. Longtime Republican financier Fred Malek drew attention to worries about Trump in a column in the Washington Post on Thursday. He cited Trumps criticism last week of New Mexicos Republican governor, Susana Martinez, considered a rising star in the party with the ability to appeal to Hispanics. These attacks on fellow Republicans must stop as we move closer to the general election, Malek wrote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, who has said he will support Trump, told CNN that Trumps proposed Muslim ban was a bad idea and that his criticism of Martinez was ill-advised. Ryan said he too still had concerns about Trumps tone. It is my hope the campaign improves its tone as we go forward and its all a campaign we can be proud of, Ryan told the Associated Press.

Sanders to offer Puerto Rico debt bill that would protect pensioners,"(Reuters) - Three days before Puerto Ricos Democratic presidential primary, Bernie Sanders leveled a blistering attack on a restructuring bill moving through the U.S. Congress and offered a radically different approach to fixing the territorys $70 billion debt problem. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who is giving front-runner Hillary Clinton a tougher-than-expected challenge for the Democratic Partys presidential nomination, will formally introduce his legislation next week, a spokesman said on Thursday. Unlike a bipartisan House of Representatives bill that would establish a federal oversight board to renegotiate the massive debt with investors, Sanders bill would create a Reconstruction Finance Corporation of Puerto Rico that would protect public pensioners from cutbacks and concentrate losses among vulture funds, according to a summary. It is morally reprehensible that Wall Street vulture funds are demanding that Puerto Rico fire even more teachers, close more schools, cut pensions and slash the minimum wage so that they can reap huge profits off the misery of the people of Puerto Rico, Sanders said in a statement. The term vulture funds is a derogatory reference to specialized investing in deeply discounted or distressed assets, typically bonds, by buying them up on the cheap in hopes of profiting on the expectation of a credit restructuring Clinton has backed the House bill. Last week, a House committee with oversight of Puerto Rico approved a debt restructuring measure that backers hope will be enacted into law before July 1, when the island is faced with making good on $1.9 billion in debt payments. Sanders proposal comes as the nominating contests for the presidential election are winding down. Along with Puerto Rico, California and a handful of other states are holding their nominating contests in the coming days. Sanders bill sets out to strip the ability of hedge funds to profit off their investments in an attempt to protect pensions ahead of creditors. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation would consist of seven members, all full-time residents of Puerto Rico and mainly chosen by the Puerto Rican legislature and governor. The House bill, by contrast, would give Republicans in the U.S. Congress a say in recommending the majority of the proposed oversight board members. While the House bill boasts no cost to U.S. taxpayers, Sanders wants $10.8 billion for infrastructure improvements in Puerto Rico. He proposes raising federal reimbursements for the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs for the poor, elderly and disabled. Sanders also wants elections by Jan. 31, 2018, in Puerto Rico to decide whether it should become a state, an independent country or reform its current status. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 ",1

"Some officials worry about briefing Trump, fearing spilled secrets","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that Donald Trumps shoot from the hip style could pose national security risks as they prepare to give him a routine pre-election briefing once he is formally anointed as the Republican presidential nominee. Eight senior security officials told Reuters they had concerns over briefing Trump, whose brash, unpredictable campaign style has been a feature of his rise as an insurgent candidate. Despite their worries, the officials said the Top Secret briefing to each candidate would not deviate from the usual format to avoid any appearance of bias. Most of the officials asked for anonymity to discuss a domestic political issue. Current and former officials said that the scandal over Hillary Clintons use of emails also raises concerns about her handling of sensitive information. The likely Democratic nominee is facing an FBI probe into whether security was compromised and laws were broken by her use of a private email server for government business while she was Secretary of State. The only candidate who has proven incapable of handling sensitive information is Hillary Clinton, said Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. If there is anyone they should be worried about it is Hillary Clinton. But Trumps lack of foreign policy experience, his volatile style, and his little known team of foreign policy advisers make him a unique case, the officials said.   People are very nervous, said one senior U.S. security official.  Intelligence and other security and foreign policy officials are also trying to determine who on (Trumps) team are trustworthy, the official added. Weve never had a situation like this before. Ever. A spokesperson for Trumps campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Other officials downplayed such worries, noting that the traditional briefing, while classified as Top Secret, is mostly a broad overview of national security issues and does not include the most sensitive government secrets about intelligence sources and operations.  In the post-Second World War era, confirmed U.S. presidential nominees have traditionally received the briefing from intelligence officials  including spy agency chiefs  covering a broad range of national security issues. The nominees are usually briefed shortly after their party nominating conventions, and are allowed to include one or two aides who must undergo security checks. Current and former officials say the nominees are explicitly warned not to share the contents of the briefing, which includes detailed intelligence assessments.  After election day, presidents-elect receive the same Presidential Daily Brief, or PDB, that the sitting president gets, complete with material on the intelligence agencies sources, methods, and covert operations. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told Reuters that he shared some of the concerns over how Trump, who has never held public office, might use information from the briefing.     I would be very concerned with Mr. Trumps ability to know what he can and cant discuss publicly about the contents of an intelligence briefing, said Schiff, who has endorsed Clinton for president. Schiff said one consequence of intelligence agencies worries about Trumps reputation as a loose cannon could be that briefers circumscribe some of the information they provide to Trump and Hillary Clinton, his prospective Democratic opponent. Trump has tended to make broad-brush statements on foreign issues rather than delve into policy nuances. He drew criticism from some former national security officials last month when, without evidence, he quickly tweeted that the downing of an EgyptAir flight appeared to be a terrorist attack.   Clinton is honing in on national security as a key potential weakness for Trump, and is set to deliver a foreign policy speech on Thursday designed to portray the billionaire businessman as unfit for the White House.  Officials familiar with the views and policy of Director of National Intelligence James Clappers Office, which will give the in-person briefings, say it will do its utmost to avoid any suggestions of political favoritism or bias.  Officials say the spy agencies intend to follow past practice and give identical briefings to both nominees. One former intelligence official said Clinton could have an advantage in the briefing because she would likely ask more probing questions than Trump, a newcomer to foreign policy. The briefings provide an overview of pressing issues and hot spots around the world, said former CIA officer David Priess, who briefed attorneys general and FBI directors, but not presidents. One U.S. intelligence official said that Trumps style may not be such a risk because the briefings are general in nature and often track publicly available information. If he reads the papers every day, he wont hear much that will surprise him, the official said. Current and former officials said that covert operations and the intelligence agencies sources and methods, which are among the nations most tightly guarded secrets, are never discussed in the pre-election briefings.

Use it or lose it: Occasional Ohio voters may be shut out in November,"CINCINNATI (Reuters) - When Larry Harmon tried to vote on a marijuana initiative in November in his hometown of Kent, Ohio, the 59-year-old software engineer found his name had been struck from the voter rolls. Two hours south in Zanesville, restaurant worker Chris Conrad, 37, was also told he was no longer registered. Both men later found out why: they had not voted often enough. As the Nov. 8 elections loom, officials in Ohio have removed tens of thousands of voters from registration lists because they have not cast a ballot since 2008.  All U.S. states periodically cleanse their voter rolls, but only a handful remove voters simply because they dont vote on a regular basis. And nowhere could the practice have a greater potential impact in the state-by-state battle for the White House than Ohio, a swing state that has backed the winner in every presidential election since 1960. Voters of all stripes in Ohio are affected, but the policy appears to be helping Republicans in the states largest metropolitan areas, according to a Reuters survey of voter lists. In the states three largest counties that include Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, voters have been struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods. Thats because residents of relatively affluent Republican-leaning neighborhoods are more likely to vote in both congressional elections and presidential contests, historical turnouts show. Democrats are less likely to vote in mid-term elections and thus are more at risk of falling off the rolls.  In the three biggest counties, at least 144,000 voters have been removed, the Reuters analysis found. The statewide total is unclear. Each of the states 88 counties manages its own voter rolls, which generally are not made public.  Unlike other voting-rights disputes that have sparked protests and lawsuits, the practice doesnt appear to be driven by one specific party. Both Republican and Democratic officials in Ohio have purged inactive voters over the past 20 years. But neighborhoods that have a high proportion of poor, African-American residents are hit hardest, the Reuters analysis found. Its absolutely unfair, said Donna Porter-Jones, an organizer at Amos Project, an interfaith group that aims to register 30,000 voters from some of Cincinnatis poorest neighborhoods ahead of November.  Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, says canceling registrations for voters who missed three straight federal elections helps keep voting rolls current. Since 2011, the state has cleared out more than 2 million records of people who have moved or died, he said.  Those who dont vote over a six-year stretch or respond to a postcard mailed to their address have only themselves to blame, he said. If this is really important thing to you in your life, voting, you probably would have done so within a six-year period, he said in an interview. People who dont respond to the postcard can be removed from voting lists if they sit out the next two federal elections. Many other states only remove voters from the rolls if they have died or moved to a new address. You shouldnt be struck of your right to vote because you skipped an election, said Kathleen Clyde, a Democratic state representative who has been fighting the practice. Four civil liberties groups sued to end the practice last month, arguing that it violates federal law and unfairly targets low-income and minority voters.   Voting-rights advocates say they are concerned that many infrequent voters who helped drive turnout to a record in the 2008 presidential election wont be able to vote in this years likely matchup between Democrat Hillary Clinton, vying to become the first female president, and Republican Donald Trump, the celebrity billionaire. The Ohio lawsuit is one of a number being fought across the country. Photo ID requirements and other efforts to tighten voting laws have spurred fierce partisan battles and protests in recent months. They follow a Supreme Court decision in 2013 that struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, a signature achievement of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. The Ohio dispute, by contrast, centers on a practice that has been in place for decades but is receiving new attention from civil liberties groups and Democrats ahead of November.  We are pleased the courts are reviewing the states actions, said Pratt Wiley, national director of voter expansion at the Democratic Party in Washington. Republican party officials at the local and national level, as well as the Trump campaign, did not respond to requests for comment. But Tom Fitton, the head of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has pushed Ohio and other states to keep their voting lists up to date, described the lawsuit as a power play by civil liberties groups to ensure that candidates they like are able to steal elections if necessary.  Federal law prohibits states from removing voters solely because they havent voted, but it also requires them to keep voter lists up to date. Ohio residents who are removed from voting lists must re-register at least 30 days before an election.  Harmon, the software engineer, backed President Barack Obama in 2008 but has sat out presidential and congressional elections since then. He says he initially thought he had done something wrong to get kicked off the voting rolls. I felt embarrassed and stupid at the time, said Harmon, who is involved in the Ohio lawsuit. The more I think about it, the madder I am, he said. In Clevelands Cuyahoga County, 5 percent of voters in neighborhoods that backed Obama by more than 60 percent in 2012 were purged last year due to inactivity, according to the Reuters analysis of the voter lists. In neighborhoods where Obama got less than 40 percent of the vote, 2.5 percent of registered voters were removed for that reason. In Franklin County, home to the state capital Columbus, 11 percent of voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods have been purged since 2012 due to inactivity. Only 6 percent of voters in Republican-leaning neighborhoods have been purged.  The disparity is especially stark in Hamilton County, where affluent Republican suburbs ring Cincinnati, which has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the country. In the heavily African-American neighborhoods near downtown, more than 10 percent of registered voters have been removed due to inactivity since 2012. In suburban Indian Hill, only 4 percent have been purged due to inactivity.  Overall, 30,000 voters have been removed due to inactivity since 2012, a larger figure than Obamas margin of victory that year.  On a recent rainy afternoon, Amos Project canvasser Marcia Mackey tried to get some of those voters back in the system. Wielding a clipboard and a smile, Mackey asked pedestrians in the Over the Rhine neighborhood north of downtown Cincinnati when they last cast a ballot. If they couldnt remember, she encouraged them to register again. People dont know theyve been purged until they go to the election site and get turned away, Mackey said. We need to make sure that people have voices. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 ",1
Obama's Supreme Court lawyer to step down,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administrations top Supreme Court lawyer is leaving office at the end of June having won a string of major cases including fending off challenges to President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law and legalizing same-sex marriage. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has served in the Justice Department post since June 2011. He also held two other positions in the Obama administration. Verrillis deputy, Ian Gershengorn will take over, the Justice Department said in a release announcing Verrillis departure. For five years, Solicitor General Don Verrilli has fought in our nations highest court for a better future, winning landmark cases that moved America forward, Obama said in a statement. Verrilli twice successfully defended the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, against conservative challenges. In 2012, the court ruled 5-4 to uphold the law against a broad legal attack. Three years later, the justices rejected a second challenge on a 6-3 vote. Thanks to his efforts, 20 million more Americans now know the security of quality, affordable health care, Obama said. In other major victories, Verrilli urged the justices to strike down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which barred the recognition of same-sex marriages for the purposes of federal benefits. The 5-4 ruling striking down the law in June 2015 helped pave the way for the courts 5-4 landmark 2015 decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide, which Verrilli also advocated for.  In another case, Verrilli successfully persuaded the court in 2012 to strike down provisions of a harsh anti-immigrant law in Arizona on a 5-3 vote. Through these and many other cases  and through his thoughtful counsel and principled advocacy  Don has built a legacy of inclusion, expanding opportunities and civil rights for all Americans and moving our country forward, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement. Setbacks included the courts 2013 ruling on a 5-4 vote striking down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, a law enacted to protect minority voters. He also lost a case 9-0 in which a company challenged Obamas authority to appoint members of the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate was in recess. The court has yet to rule in several major cases Verrilli argued this year, including a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law and his defense of Obamas executive action that would protect more than four million immigrants from deportation.

Native Americans move to frontlines in battle over voting rights,"BELCOURT, North Dakota (Reuters) - Elvis Norquay, a member of the Chippewa Indian tribe, has lived most of his 58 years on North Dakotas remote Turtle Mountain reservation and says hes never had a problem voting. That was before 2014, when he hitched a ride with a friend to cast a ballot in local and congressional elections and was turned away. Embarrassed, he asked why he couldnt vote. He was told he lacked proper ID under new state requirements. He has no phone, no current drivers license and his tribal ID lacks a street address. When we left, my friend said, thats not right, said Norquay, who has lived on disability since 2002 in a rural county near the Canadian border. Norquay is among a growing number of Native Americans embroiled in court battles over changes to voting laws that could influence the outcome of some tight races in the November 2016 presidential and congressional elections. While the Native American population is small nationally, lawsuits involving tribes over voting problems have proliferated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. North Dakota is one of 17 states that have new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Many of these changes have sparked lawsuits and accusations that black, Hispanic and other minority voters could be disenfranchised. Five federal lawsuits involving Native Americans have been filed since the Supreme Court decision, including three this year alone. Suits in North Dakota, Utah, South Dakota and Arizona claim new voting rules passed in majority Republican states are discriminatory and could reduce voting by tribal members, who tend to back Democrats. A suit in Alaska, for example, claimed the state violated federal rules by failing to translate voting materials for tribal voters. The tribes say changes to voting rules in those states disproportionately affect Native Americans, an allegation the states and counties deny. The Native American vote is not big enough to flip a safe Republican state such as North Dakota into the Democrat column in this years presidential election, but Native Americans are a growing proportion of the population and a majority in some counties where increased voter turnout in recent years has tipped the balance in some congressional races. In many states, the number of Native Americans is growing faster than the population as a whole. Between 2000 and 2010, the Native American population rose by 26.7 percent to 1.1 million, compared to 9.7 percent growth in Americas overall population, census data showed. Recent changes to voting laws, such as North Dakotas new voter ID law, are part of a much broader, deliberate, and concerted effort by Republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters on election day, said Pratt Wiley, head of voter protection issues at the Democratic Party in Washington. Those voters are more vulnerable today than they were before the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, he said of Native Americans. Republicans deny that voting law changes passed by Republican-dominated legislatures are discriminatory and say they are intended to reduce fraudulent votes. These are popular common sense laws to protect elections from fraud, said Lindsay Walters, national spokeswoman at the Republican National Committee. At issue in North Dakota are revisions pushed largely by Republican state legislators in 2013 and 2015 to a 2003 state elections law that eliminated a provision that had allowed people without proper identification such as Norquay to vote if they were recognized by a poll worker or if they signed an affidavit swearing to their identity. Norquay and six other members of his tribe sued the secretary of state in January in U.S. District Court in North Dakota. They said they were refused the right to vote in November 2014 because many old tribal IDs such as Norquays dont list a current residential address.  It says some tribal members cant afford a new tribal ID or struggle to obtain proper identification because there are no state offices that provide drivers licenses on the reservations.  Richard McCloud, chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, said widespread unemployment and poverty among tribal members meant that some struggle to afford the $10 needed to obtain a new tribal card.  Ten dollars is three pounds of hamburger and some macaroni for a family, said McCloud at the tribes headquarters on the reservation of about 4,274 people a few miles (km) south of the Canadian border. Maybe its no big deal if you work, but its a big deal to people that dont have access to $10, he said. North Dakotas secretary of state, Al Jaeger, the only defendant in the suit, said in an interview that the law is not discriminatory and simplifies the voting process in the only state in the country that does not require voters to register ahead of an election. He said his office has spent heavily on ad campaigns to educate voters about what IDs are accepted. Jaegers deputy, Jim Silrum, said the ID requirements are not a barrier for the 97 percent of state residents with drivers licenses, an accepted form of ID, so the number of people affected by the changes is miniscule. Those with no drivers license, can get a non-driver state ID allowed at the polls from the motor vehicle department for free. Jaeger and Silrum said they could not respond directly to an assertion in the lawsuit that residents on reservations have to travel long distances to obtain a state ID. Republican state Representative Jim Kasper from Fargo repeated his partys argument that the changes were aimed at reducing the risk of voter fraud, but Silrum said there was little evidence of such irregularities. In the 2012 presidential election, there were only nine cases of people voting twice, but that was because they used the same ID rather than a lack of proper identification, he said. State Representative Kylie Oversen, a Democrat from Grand Forks, said the changes could alter tight elections in favor of Republicans. She said Republicans pushed for the bill after Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012 by less than 3,000 votes. In sparsely populated states such as North Dakota, with just 739,000 people, congressional elections have been decided by just a few thousand votes. Rolette County, surrounding Norquays reservation, is one of two counties in the state where about 75 percent of the population is Native American. Those two counties were the only places in North Dakota that gave President Barack Obama more than 70 percent of the vote in 2012. After the changes in the ID law were implemented in North Dakota, voter turnout in Rolette County dropped by more than 12 percentage points between the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections, more than any other county in the state, election data from the secretary of states office shows. What has happened is the Native American vote has become something that can tip elections, said Jean Schroedel, a professor at Claremont Graduate University in California who studies Native American voting. The Native American Rights Fund, a non-profit law firm representing Norquay and other members of his tribe in the lawsuit against the state, plans to file a motion by June 30 requesting that the court invalidate the changes to the ID law ahead of Novembers election, according to court documents.

Thousands of voters in limbo after Kansas demands proof they're American,"WICHITA, Kansas (Reuters) - After moving to Kansas, Tad Stricker visited a state motor vehicle office to perform what he thought was the routine task of getting a new drivers license and registering to vote. It was a familiar procedure for Stricker, 37, who has moved from state to state frequently in his work as a hotel manager. He filled out a voter registration form and got his drivers license. He was not asked for more documents, he said. So he was stunned when he tried to cast a ballot in November 2014 and was told he was not on the voter rolls. A month later, a letter from the state said why: His registration had been placed in suspense because he had failed to meet a state requirement he did not know about - proving he was an American. Spurred by Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a national leader in pushing for anti-immigration and voting changes, more than 36,000 Kansas residents have joined Stricker in limbo since early 2013 under a state law that raises a new and higher barrier to voting in the United States: proof of citizenship. While you must be a U.S. citizen to vote in American elections, most states allow those wishing to register to simply sign a statement affirming they are citizens and provide a drivers license number, Social Security number, or other proof of residency. A Reuters analysis of the Kansas suspense list shows the law disproportionately hits young voters, who often do not have ready access to the needed documents, as well as unaffiliated and Democratic voters in the Republican-controlled state. What a shock, said Stricker, who was born in Missouri and moved to Kansas with his wife from Illinois. I was under the impression I had registered to vote, I had done everything I needed to. I just thought, This cant be happening. While the law wont affect its status as a safe Republican state in Novembers presidential election, it thrusts Kansas into a national debate over voting restrictions that has accelerated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. Kobachs involvement has raised the stakes in the fight against the Kansas law. Democrats and voting rights advocates say his influence with conservatives could help spread the concept to other states. His critics scored a victory on May 17 when a federal judge weakened the law. Kobach quickly appealed. The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, and Stricker was a plaintiff in the case. Photo identification laws and other voting measures have proliferated in recent years in Republican-held states, but the one that gets me most nervous is the proof of citizenship requirement in Kansas, said Pratt Wiley, director of voter expansion for the Democratic National Committee. What you will see is that what is learned in one state, or doesnt work in one state, there is a small adjustment and then its applied in a different state, Wiley said, calling Kansas patient zero in that process. Kobach has gained a national reputation for pushing a series of voting and anti-immigration measures across the country, leading one Democratic congressman to dub him the dark lord of the anti-immigration movement - a label he wears proudly. I dont know if I would call it a badge of honor but it reflects that Im moving the ball in what I think is the right direction, Kobach said in an interview in his Topeka office across from the state Capitol. Three other states have adopted proof of citizenship laws championed by Kobach, although officials said two of them had not implemented them. Bills have been introduced in at least nine other states to create a similar law since 2012, although none have advanced very far, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The law Kobach spearheaded in Kansas requires registrants to prove their citizenship by providing one of a series of documents, including birth certificates and passports. They are placed on the suspense list if they cant. Since late last year, those who did not complete the requirements for registration have been purged from the voter rolls after 90 days and had to begin the process over again. About 14 percent of Kansans who tried to register between the laws onset in 2013 and late 2015 failed to meet the requirement and went on the suspense list, according to documents filed in a lawsuit challenging the requirement. Its created a system that is needlessly complex and very discouraging, particularly for young people, said Steve Lopes, head of the Johnson County Voting Coalition, which helps register voters. Now people just say, Forget it, Im not going to vote. Kobach rejects accusations the law is designed to suppress voter turnout, particularly among minority and low-income voters who tend to back Democrats. He says it is aimed at stopping what he describes as a rampant problem of non-citizens voting in U.S. elections - even though there is little evidence of the problem. Every time an alien votes, it cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen. Thats real disenfranchisement, its happening every election and its happening in every state, Kobach said, estimating thousands of non-citizens are on voting rolls in big states with large immigrant populations. Citing that threat, Kobach convinced the Kansas legislature in 2015 to give him the power to prosecute voter fraud. But he has won just four misdemeanor illegal voting convictions, mostly involving people who owned at least two properties and cast votes in both locations. None involved non-citizens voting, although Kobach said more complaints will be filed. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson, who issued a May 17 order that Kansas begin to register more than 18,000 voters kept off the rolls by the proof of citizenship law, noted Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and the onset of the law in 2013. The court cannot find that the states interest in preventing non-citizens from voting in Kansas outweighs the risk of disenfranchising thousands of qualified voters, she wrote. Of the 16,775 people on a late-April suspense list obtained by Reuters, more than half were ages 17 through 21, and more than 60 percent were age 25 or under. They were clustered in the high-population areas of Wichita, Topeka and the Kansas City suburbs, and the college towns of Lawrence and Manhattan. About 41 percent were unaffiliated, more than the approximately 30 percent of registered Kansas voters who are unaffiliated. About 35 percent of those on the list were Democrats, compared to 24 percent of registered voters. Twenty-three percent were Republicans, compared to 45 percent of registered voters, according to a Reuters analysis of the data. Younger voters, who are more likely to register as unaffiliated or Democrats, have a harder time getting the documents needed and have less patience with what has become an unwieldy process, said Michael Smith, a professor at Emporia State University who has studied the Kansas suspense list. Kobach said it was natural that young people were heavily represented on the suspense list because they are the majority of new registrants. He rejected criticism that a proof of citizenship requirement created a higher barrier for registrants. If you define a barrier to voting as just having to do something before you vote, every state has that barrier, virtually every state requires proof of address, he said.  In her court ruling, Robinson said the Kansas requirement conflicted with a federal law designed to make it easier to register while getting a drivers license. She ordered Kansas on June 14 to begin registering Stricker and other residents who had submitted voter applications through state motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of citizenship. They will be able to vote in federal elections for the presidency and U.S. Congress.   But Robinsons ruling did not end the proof of citizenship requirement for Kansans who register by mail or at locations other than motor vehicle offices, and it left even those registering while getting a drivers license ineligible to vote for state and local offices. For now, that has created a chaotic two-tier system where some Kansans can vote in state elections and some cannot, some need to provide proof of citizenship and others do not, and many county election officials are uncertain how to proceed.

Commentary: How long before North Korea can nuke a U.S. city?,"Its the near future, and North Koreas regime is on the brink of collapse. As rumors swirl of palace coups, forces on both sides of the worlds most militarized border are on heightened alert. The U.S. military faces a much bigger problem. Somewhere in the Pacific, a North Korean submarine is believed to be carrying nuclear warheads and the missiles to deliver them. And nobody knows where it is.  It sounds like the plot of a Hunt for Red October-style technothriller. But if Pyongyangs technicians continue at their current pace, experts say it is becoming ever more likely.  One thing is certain: North Korea is plowing considerable resources into building its nuclear capability. And it is clearly making progress  even if Tuesdays failed missile test shows it still has a long way to go.  Japanese officials said what appeared to be a conventional Musudan rocket, which theoretically has the ability to reach Japan and the U.S. territory and military base of Guam, exploded either as or shortly after it left its launcher. North Korea is estimated to have some 20 to 30 of the missiles  first deployed in 2007, but yet to be launched successfully.  What North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wants, most analysts believe, is simple  a rocket that can fire a nuclear warhead at least to regional targets. His ultimate ambition, however, is to be able to hit U.S. cities on the West Coast, most likely from a submarine that could hide itself at sea.  North Korea has been steadily improving its rockets  which can also carry conventional explosives  for decades. It detonated its first nuclear device in 2006 but most experts believe it has yet to build one small enough to be placed on a missile. Having the credible ability to do all of that and get the missiles to sea could take well over a decade, perhaps considerably more.  Once it happens, however, it will be a strategic game changer. At worst, U.S. cities on the West Coast would have to deal with the prospect, however remote, that they might be struck by a North Korean atomic weapon. At the very least, a North Korea armed with nuclear submarines would hugely complicate the calculus for any U.S. president handling a crisis on the Korean peninsula itself.  That, of course, is exactly the plan.  The fact that Pyongyang has conducted so many tests this year, some experts believe, suggests Kim is pushing his scientists harder than ever to deliver working rockets and warheads. North Korea is believed to have tagged the expertise of Russian Cold War-era scientists, and while its capabilities on both fronts lag well behind established nuclear states such as Russia and China, it is already believed to be well ahead of Iran.  In April, South Korean and U.S. officials said a North Korean submarine successfully launched a ballistic missile that traveled some 18 miles  a major step forward.  Technical experts say TV footage appeared to show a solid fuel rocket successfully launching from underwater, essentially the same system used by Western forces to achieve the same goal.  When she testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in April, the incoming head of the U.S. Northern Command  responsible for defending the mainland United States  delivered a stark warning.  The North Korean threat is real, U.S. Air Force General Lori Robinson  previously head of U.S. air forces in the Pacific  told lawmakers. For now, its a medium range but they are trying very hard to be able to hit the homeland.  Its impossible to know exactly how much money and expertise the North Koreans are expending. The scale of the effort, however, is seen as large  in many ways, the same level of commitment the United States gave to the Manhattan Project to build the worlds first atomic bomb during World War Two. Pyongyangs reason is clear: building that kind of credible ability to strike is seen as central to the long-term survival of the Kim dynasty and its ruling party.  Earlier this month, at the first meeting of its ruling party in 36 years, Kim said North Korea was a responsible nuclear weapons state and would never use its weapons  unless it were threatened. That seemed a clear warning to outside powers, particularly Washington, to steer clear of any attempts to destabilize or attack the regime.  Getting a submarine-based deterrent would be a very big deal  and not just because it might allow the North Koreans to move the launch point much closer to the target. Submarines are central to what nuclear weapons states call a second strike capability, the ability to launch missiles even in the aftermath of an overwhelming and perhaps surprise preemptive attack.  The United States, Russia, Britain and France all retain what they call a continuous at sea deterrent, at least one submarine offshore at all times ready to fight back even if the homeland and all other military forces are completely taken out. Israel is also believed to have the ability to mount nuclear cruise missiles on its Dolphin-class conventional submarines, while China is now moving quickly towards new ballistic missile submarines for its own at sea deterrent.  This technology isnt new  the United States and Russia developed it in the late 1950s based in part on plans originally developed to hit Nazi German U-boats in the dying days of World War Two. There is no good reason it should not eventually work for North Korea, too.  If and when it does, Pyongyang is likely to try to keep its submarines very close to its coastsand its home defensesat first. Still, once the first nuclear-armed submarine exists, Japan and the United States might feel political pressure to destroy it.  That would come with considerable risks. The North is known to have huge volumes of conventional artillery based along the South Korean border, much of it in range of Seoul and its 10 million residents. The risk of those weapons inflicting massive casualties is one of the key factors that has deterred multiple U.S. administrations from considering the kind of preemptive strike on Pyongyangs weapons programs that the United States has threatened against Iran.  The Korean War  frozen by its 1953 cease-fire but never otherwise resolved  may not be over yet.  ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1
"North Korea says Trump isn't screwy at all, a wise choice for president"," SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has backed presumptive U.S. Republican nominee Donald Trump, with a propaganda website praising him as a prescient presidential candidate who can liberate Americans living under daily fear of nuclear attack by the North.  A column carried on Tuesday by DPRK Today, one of the reclusive and dynastic states mouthpieces, described Trump as a wise politician and the right choice for U.S. voters in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.  MORE FROM REUTERS: Tesla gets vote of confidence from a top investor at Fidelity Breakingviews:Banking ghosts haunt Clinton in Philadelphia How oil traders fell for Yahoo It described his most likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, as thick-headed Hillary over her proposal to apply the Iran model of wide sanctions to resolve the nuclear weapons issue on the Korean peninsula.  Trump instead has told Reuters he was prepared to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyangs nuclear program, and that China should also help solve the problem.  North Korea, known officially as the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK), is under U.N. sanctions over its past nuclear tests. South Korea and the United States say its calls for dialogue are meaningless until it takes steps to end its nuclear ambitions.  DPRK Today also said Trumps suggestion that the United States should pull its troops from South Korea until Seoul pays more was the way to achieve Korean unification.  It turns out that Trump is not the rough-talking, screwy, ignorant candidate they say he is, but is actually a wise politician and a prescient presidential candidate, said the column, written by a China-based Korean scholar identified as Han Yong Muk.  DPRK Today is among a handful of news sites run by the isolated North, although its content is not always handled by the main state-run media.  It said promising to resolve issues on the Korean peninsula through negotiations and not war was the best option for America, which it said is living every minute and second on pins and needles in fear of a nuclear strike by North Korea.  The North has for years called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South as the first step toward peace on the Korean peninsula and demanded Washington sign a peace treaty to replace the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.  Its frequently strident rhetoric also often threatens nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States.  ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 ",1
U.S. expects to continue strong Philippines alliance despite Duterte signal,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The United States expects to maintain its strong security relationship with the Philippines, including a recent accord on the rotational stationing of U.S. forces, U.S. officials said on Thursday, despite signals from the incoming Philippine president that he will chart a more independent course. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, speaking en route to a security conference in Singapore at which a case over disputed South China Sea territory brought by the previous Philippine government against China will be a key talking point, said Washington took its treaty alliance with the Philippines very seriously. Its long standing, it is, we say, ironclad, he told reporters. They have a new government there and we look forward to working with them, talking with them about our alliance, about security affairs in the region. Asked about an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) he signed in Manila weeks ago giving the United States rotational access to five bases in the Philippines, Carter replied: Our plans for EDCA and implementation are on track; we havent changed our plans at all. On Tuesday, Philippines President-elect Rodrigo Duterte, who is due to take over on June 30, signaled greater independence in dealing with China and broader security issues, when he told reporters future policy would not be dependent on America. We have this pact with the West, but I want everybody to know that we will be charting a course of our own, Duterte said, when asked if he would push for bilateral talks with China. On Wednesday, Dutertes incoming foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay, told Reuters Manila would honor treaties with the United States, including the EDCA, but it should not be a lackey of any nation. The outgoing Philippines government has been one of Washingtons staunchest supporters in its standoff with China over its expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, a vital global trade route. Washington has been supportive of a case Manila has brought in the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague challenging Chinas claims. Carter is expected to urge regional nations attending the annual Shangri-la Dialogue to rally around the U.S. position that the courts ruling, which is expected to go in Manilas favor, must be binding. Another U.S. defense official, who did not want to be identified, said Washington expected to continue its strong alliance with the Philippines, but added: We certainly understand the Philippine desire to chart their own course and everything we do with respect to our alliance ... is designed to allow the Philippines to chart its own course. Asked whether the United States had detected any decrease in desire on the part of the Philippines to take part in joint South China Sea patrols or to commit to more force rotations under the EDCA, the official replied: Its too early to tell. Well get together with the government when they come in and Im sure we will have very thorough discussions about all of this when the time comes. The first tranche of forces has rotated out. And we will be discussing with the Philippines possible future (deployments). Duterte has yet to name a defense minister and Carter said he had no meeting planned with the Philippines delegation at the Singapore meeting.  Carter also said he did not plan a separate meeting with the Chinese, but looked forward to seeing members of their delegation over the three-day conference from Friday.

U.S. takes further steps to block North Korea's access to financial system,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday declared North Korea a primary money laundering concern and moved to further block its ability to use the U.S. and world financial systems to fund its weapons programs. The U.S. Treasury Department called for a prohibition on certain U.S. financial institutions opening or maintaining correspondent accounts, which are established to receive deposits from or make payments on behalf of a foreign institution, with North Korean financial institutions. Crucially, Treasury also prohibited the use of third parties U.S. correspondent accounts to process transactions for North Korean financial institutions. The announcement came days after the latest failed missile launch by the isolated state. Tensions in the region have been high since January when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test and then followed that with a satellite launch and test launches of various missiles, in defiance of UN resolutions. Those efforts have all fueled calls in Washington, and abroad, for a clampdown on Pyongyang. U.S. law already generally prohibited U.S. financial institutions from engaging in transactions with North Korean institutions, but Treasurys latest actions would impose additional controls, especially the prohibition on the use of third-country banks U.S. accounts to process transactions for North Korea. This is meaningful, said Victor Cha, Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. This is designating the entire country, which means essentially that any entity that is interested in interacting with U.S. financial institutions should no longer have any business with North Korea. Most, if not all, entities, if faced with the choice of having access to the U.S. financial system or doing business with North Korea, are going to make the obvious choice, Cha added. South Koreas foreign ministry on Thursday welcomed the move, which it said in a statement would boost the effectiveness of existing sanctions on the North and have a broader impact than a 2005 U.S. Treasury measure that targeted a bank in the Chinese territory of Macau. But China, North Koreas most important backer despite Beijings anger at Pyongyangs nuclear program and support for U.N. sanctions, expressed concern. We have consistently opposed any county using its domestic law to impose unilateral sanctions on another country, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. About $24 million of North Korean funds was frozen at Macaus Banco Delta Asia (BDA) after the U.S. Treasury accused it of helping to channel earnings from the Norths illicit activities, leading to a frantic attempt by Pyongyang to retrieve the money. The North has since developed tactics to skirt financial restrictions by resorting to informal means to transfer money, including the use of bulk cash hand-carried by officials.      Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said Washington expected other governments and financial authorities to make similar moves to prevent Pyongyang from abusing global financial institutions to support its development of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. The regime is notoriously deceitful in its financial transactions in order to continue its illicit weapons programs and other destabilizing activities, Szubin said in a statement. The Treasury was required to assess North Koreas status as a money laundering jurisdiction under the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, passed nearly unanimously by the U.S. Congress in February. A U.N. Security Council resolution in early March also required member states to sever correspondent banking relationships with North Korean financial institutions within 90 days.

Trump blasts PGA Tour for plan to move golf tournament to Mexico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a golf resort developer who has railed against Mexico in the 2016 campaign, lost an important golf tournament to that country on Wednesday when the PGA Tour said it would leave his Trump Doral course in Miami. Although the PGA Tour said it was not a political decision, Trump said in a statement the move was akin to decisions by some U.S. companies to move jobs to Mexico, which has been a refrain of his presidential campaign. The PGA Tour has put profit ahead of thousands of American jobs, millions of dollars in revenue for local communities and charities and the enjoyment of hundreds of thousands of fans who make the tournament an annual tradition, he said. This decision only further embodies the very reason I am running for president of the United States. The PGA said the World Golf Championship event would move from Trump National Doral to a site in Mexico City and be sponsored by the Grupo Salinas conglomerate. PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said the move was necessary once it became apparent that we would not be able to secure sponsorship at levels that would sustain the event and help it grow at Trump National Doral. From a golf standpoint, we have no issues with Donald Trump. From a political standpoint, we are neutral. The PGA Tour has never been involved or cares to be involved in presidential politics, Finchem told a news conference in Dublin, Ohio. Cadillac has been the title sponsor for the event in recent years including this years tournament in March. Cadillac representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Trumps son Eric Trump said Cadillac had been willing to continue. Cadillac is ready, willing and able to continue as title sponsor for the tournament, he told Reuters. And I also can say that Cadillac is an amazing company and a longtime partner to the Trump Organization and we have an impeccable relationship. The Doral tournament is one of the biggest pro golf events of the year, drawing top golfers from around the world competing for a $6 million purse. The Doral course has hosted a PGA tournament since 1962. Trump, whose golf empire includes 18 courses, purchased the golf resort in 2012 and led a $250 million renovation of its Blue Monster course where the PGA tournament has been played. The news about Doral surfaced on the same day that Trump announced he would step away from the campaign trail later this month to travel to Scotland for the reopening of the Turnberry golf resort, which he bought in 2014.

Obama says transgender bathroom directive based on law,"ELKHART, Ind. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday the decision to direct public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice was based on the law and the best interests of the children. Speaking at a town hall event broadcast by the PBS television network, Obama, a Democrat, said the federal government waded into the controversial issue after school districts asked the Education Department for guidance. Republicans have blasted the directive as executive branch overreach, and more than a dozen states have sued the Obama administration to block it.     What happened and what continues to happen is you have transgender kids in schools. And they get bullied. And they get ostracized. And its tough for them, Obama said. My best interpretation of what our laws and our obligations are is that we should try to accommodate these kids so that they are not in a vulnerable situation, he said. On May 13, the federal government told public schools they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The non-binding guidance contained the implicit threat of cuts in federal funding if it was not followed. It relied on an interpretation of Title IX, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education initiatives that receive federal financial assistance. The directive came as the Justice Department and North Carolina battled in federal court over a North Carolina state law approved in March that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to the sex on their birth certificates. Other states are weighing similar measures. We should deal with this issue the same way we would want it dealt with if it was our child and that is to try to create an environment of some dignity and kindness for these kids, Obama said. Obama said there are a lot of things more pressing than the transgender bathroom controversy, including Islamic State, the economy and jobs. Somehow people think I made it an issue. I didnt make it an issue, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 ",1
"Battling to hold off Sanders, Democrat Clinton to assail Trump on foreign policy","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clintons campaign on Wednesday signaled plans for a big assault on Republican Donald Trump, even as she battles to hold off rival Bernie Sanders in California. Clinton, a former secretary of state, is to deliver what her campaign described as a major speech on Thursday in San Diego to underscore what she feels would be the threat posed by Trump to U.S. national security if he is elected president on Nov. 8. Her language to describe Trump has grown more aggressive by the day. On Wednesday, she seized on testimony released in a lawsuit against Trump University, in which some former workers said they believed Trumps for-profit school was fraudulent. Trump and his employees took advantage of vulnerable Americans encouraging them to max out their credit cards, empty their retirement savings, destroy their financial futures, all while making promises they knew were false from the beginning, Clinton told a campaign event in Newark, New Jersey. This is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud. Lawyers for Trump have said most students were satisfied with Trump University, dismissing the former workers testimony as discredited. Trump, anticipating Clintons foreign policy attacks on him, tried to raise doubts about her leadership skills at a rally in Sacramento, Calif. She is a person with absolutely no natural talent, he said. All you have to do is watch her speak. Repeatedly referring to Clinton as crooked Hillary, Trump sharply criticized her handling of foreign policy, including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamic militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador. She went to sleep, Trump added. Clintons effort to define Trump as unfit to be commander in chief comes as she faces fierce opposition from Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who has insisted on staying in the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination despite Clintons nearly insurmountable lead. Californias primary next Tuesday is shaping up to be pivotal in the Democratic contest, with Clinton holding a 13-point advantage over Sanders, 51 percent to 38 percent, according to the Hoover Institutions Golden State Poll in the state. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll gave Clinton a much narrower lead of 49 percent, to 47 percent for Sanders. Clinton, with 2,312 delegates, needs 71 more delegates to reach the required 2,383 for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has 1,545. At stake in the California primary are 548 delegates who are awarded proportional to the vote. Five other states also vote next Tuesday, including New Jersey, which could also turn the tide for Clinton. Despite Clintons perceived advantage, there are lingering concerns among some Democrats about possible weakness, given the protracted battle with Sanders, a democratic socialist whose calls for free college tuition have energized young voters. Doug Schoen, a Democratic pollster, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that California voters appeared to be leaning toward Sanders in recent days. Sanders has been holding events every day this week in the state. Clinton canceled a New Jersey event planned for Thursday to go to California a day earlier than anticipated and is to stay there until Monday. The inevitability behind Mrs. Clintons nomination will be in large measure eviscerated if she loses the June 7 California primary to Bernie Sanders, Schoen wrote. That could well happen. Other Democrats expressed confidence in Clintons position and her move to assail Trump on foreign policy. I think she has to, said Democratic strategist Jim Manley. Leaving aside California, I think they cant just ignore Donald Trump in that they should be spending a majority of time focusing on him instead of Sanders at this point, because based on the math Sanders cant win. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has faced criticism for a variety of positions on foreign policy, such as his willingness to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his idea that Japan and South Korea might need to develop nuclear arsenals. On the other hand, past Republican presidents and current Democratic President Barack Obama have, like Trump, said NATO nations should pay more for their defense to ease the U.S. burden. Trump, however, has declared NATO obsolete and in need of reconfiguring. A Clinton aide said Clinton, the wife of former President Bill Clinton, would say Trump had not outlined a coherent foreign policy doctrine and had proven himself to be temperamentally unfit to serve as president.

California Assembly passes gun control bills,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The California Assembly on Wednesday passed a package of gun control bills, including a measure to ban so-called bullet buttons which allow quick changes in the magazine of a military-style weapon. The bills, which lawmakers are pushing the Senate to consider this month, are among several gun control measures that leaders of both houses want to pass in advance of a gun control referendum headed for the November ballot.  The measures include a ban on so-called bullet buttons which supporters say allow gun manufacturers to bypass the states prohibition on removable ammunition magazines. Weapons owned by the shooters in Decembers San Bernardino massacre were equipped with bullet buttons. The bill passed on the same day that the University of California, Los Angeles campus was shut down in the wake of a murder-suicide shooting.  Also passed was a bill to allow employers, co-workers, mental health workers and school employees to ask a judge to ban someone from possessing a gun for up to a year. The state already allows family members to seek such a ban, known as a gun violence restraining order, against relatives whom a judge rules are at high risk of committing violence against themselves or others with a firearm. A spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition was not immediately available for comment.      Last month, the California State Senate passed its own package of bills, which would prohibit possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require greater scrutiny of ammunition purchasers and seek to better keep guns out of the hands of violent felons. Led by Senate Democratic leader Kevin de Leon, California senators are rushing to pass the gun control bills in part to defuse a ballot initiative on the same subject backed by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. Democrats in the Legislature fear that Newsoms measure, a centerpiece of his campaign so far, along with an initiative to legalize marijuana, will draw Republicans who oppose gun control to the polls, potentially influencing other races. De Leon, who has not endorsed Newsom or announced his own plans for 2018, has said he believes that laws passed by the Legislature are more nuanced and easily adjustable than those instead created through a referendum. Second amendment advocates have steadfastly opposed all of the measures. ",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 ",1
Archived State Department briefing video deliberately cut,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Part of a U.S. State Department briefing video about secret U.S.-Iran nuclear talks was deliberately deleted at the request of an unknown official before it was posted to an online archive, the department said on Wednesday. The excised portion of the Dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the United States was holding secret direct nuclear talks with Iran. The State Department initially said it believed a glitch caused the gap but on Wednesday said an internal inquiry found it was a deliberate omission. However, it said no rules were broken because none existed governing the integrity of the briefing transcript and video. Rules are now being put in place. The inquiry was carried out by the departments Office of the Legal Adviser at the request of State Department spokesman John Kirby, who is also assistant secretary of the departments Bureau of Public Affairs. In so doing, they learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made, Kirby told reporters at his daily briefing. The video editor who received the request by telephone does not remember anything other than that the caller was passing on a request from someone else in the (Public Affairs) bureau, Kirby added. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. State Department official said the editor discussed the request with her supervisor and concluded that it came from a level of credibility and authority high enough that they should act on the request. Kirby said the video had been replaced some time ago with a full version that was archived with the Defense Department. He said the transcript of the briefing had always been available online and had not been modified. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 ",1
Obama slams Trump for promising to roll back Wall Street reforms,"ELKHART, Ind. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama slammed Donald Trumps proposal to weaken Wall Street reforms and touted his own economic record on Wednesday during a trip to a city he visited three weeks into his presidency that has recovered from its recession lows. Obamas remarks in Elkhart, Indiana, foreshadowed the arguments he is likely to make on the campaign trail this fall against the likely Republican presidential nominee. Obama did not mention Trump by name, but he lambasted the billionaires policy proposals, particularly his promise to dismantle most of the U.S. Dodd-Frank financial regulations. How it is that somebody would propose that we weaken regulations on Wall Street? Have we really forgotten what just happened eight years ago? Obama said, sounding exasperated. The notion that you would vote for anybody who would now allow them to go back to doing the same stuff that almost broke our economys back makes no sense. I dont care whether you are a Republican, or a Democrat or an independent, why would you do that? Obama, who leaves office in January, is eager to have a Democrat succeed him to ensure his legacy on the economy, healthcare reform and climate change continues. By going to Elkhart, the president sought to illustrate the success of his policies in the face of Republican opposition. His trip to the city in early 2009 came in the middle of a fight for the U.S. Congress to pass a roughly $800 billion economic stimulus package. Elkhart had an unemployment rate as high as 19.6 percent in 2009, the White House said; it is now around 4 percent.  Indianas Republican Governor Mike Pence said the city had recovered despite Obamas policies, not because of them. I believe the people of Elkhart ... have brought our economy back in spite of the burdens that higher taxes, mandates and increasing regulations from Washington, D.C. have placed on them, he wrote in an opinion piece published in The Elkhart Truth. Obama has not endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her race for the Democratic presidential nomination against Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, but he has made his eagerness to campaign for the winner clear. He name checked Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, by noting deficits had fallen under both of their administrations, and he said Republicans had helped the rich by blaming poor people, minorities, feminists, and immigrants for squeezing the economic wellbeing of the middle class. The primary story that Republicans have been telling about  the economy is not supported by the facts. Its just not, Obama said to a largely supportive crowd at a local high school.

Former Los Angeles mayor starts anti-Trump campaign,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said on Wednesday he had formed a political action committee and started raising money to help fight Donald Trumps Republican presidential campaign in key states with large Latino immigrant populations. Im focusing all my efforts from now to November on stopping Trump, Villaraigosa said in a conference call with reporters.  Calling Trump a racist and misogynist, Villaraigosa said his committee, called Building Bridges, Not Walls, would focus on organizing immigrants to oppose the presumptive Republican nominee in California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida in the campaign for the Nov. 8 election. Opened with his own $1,000 contribution, the committee would seek donations to pay for its activities, Villaraigosa said.  Villaraigosa, a Democrat who was Los Angeles mayor from 2005 to 2013 and also served as speaker of the California Assembly, is perhaps the states highest-profile Latino leader. He has said he is considering a run for governor in 2018.  His anti-Trump campaign is among the first efforts to formally turn concern among immigrants about the billionaires campaign into political action. Last week, Democrats in San Diego organized an anti-Trump demonstration that drew about 400 people. Trump has made concern over illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign. He has accused the Mexican government of sending rapists and criminals across the border, pledged to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and called for a temporary halt to Muslim immigration amid fears that radicalized immigrants will commit terrorist acts. Last week in the border city of San Diego, Trump called a judge hearing a case against one of his businesses hostile and a hater and said he believed the judge was Mexican. Both Democrats and Republicans are horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency, Villaraigosa said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Obama says the Democratic nominee will be clear next week: PBS,"ELKHART, Ind (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he expected the winner of the Democratic presidential nominating race would be clear next week after Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders compete in races in California and New Jersey.

Starr steps down as Baylor chancellor after sex assault scandal,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Former Baylor University President Kenneth Starr resigned as chancellor of the worlds largest Baptist university on Wednesday after being implicated in a report for not doing enough to probe sexual assaults by athletes. Starr, who rose to prominence for his exhaustive investigation of sex scandals surrounding then-President Bill Clinton, stepped down as chancellor but will keep his post as a professor in Baylors law school. With sorrow, earlier this morning, I announced my resignation effective immediately as chancellor of Baylor University as a matter of conscience, Starr said in an exclusive interview on ESPN televisions Outside the Lines. Starr added he was unaware of what was happening but still accepted responsibility. We need to put this horrible situation behind us, he said.  One of the victims of sexual assault at Baylor, identified only as Sarah, told the show she sent a letter to Starr about being raped. She finds it hard to believe that he did not know about other sexual assaults. Baylors board of regents accepted the resignation, the school said. Last week, the central Texas university in Waco removed Starr as president and fired head football coach Art Briles after an independent report found administrators mishandled sexual abuse cases involving football players. The investigation found actions by Baylor administrators directly discouraged students from reporting sexual assaults. In one case, the actions included retaliating against a complainant for reporting a sexual assault. We were horrified by what we learned from the investigation and again express our public acknowledgment and deepest apologies, the board said in a statement on Wednesday. In March, a former student at Baylor brought a negligence lawsuit in federal court against the school, claiming it acted callously and indifferently after she was raped by a Baylor football player. In a separate scandal, Baylor football player Sam Ukwuachu was sentenced last year to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a fellow student in 2013. Starr became Baylors president in 2010, promising to promote the schools great tradition in the Christian world. A former appeals court judge, Starr was appointed as a special counsel to investigate Clinton over a real estate investment and other matters. His probe widened to include Clintons sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and led to Clintons impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Republicans could not muster the two-thirds majority in the Senate needed to remove Clinton from office. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 ",1
Kansas is latest U.S. state to challenge Obama transgender directive,"(Reuters) - Kansas vowed on Wednesday to sue the Obama administration over a directive telling U.S. public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identities. The announcement by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt made the state the 13th to wade into an acrimonious debate about the rights of transgender Americans. It comes a day after a federal appeals court refused to reconsider its ruling that gave a Virginia transgender high-school student access to the bathroom of his gender identity. The courts decision means our only option is to pursue a more direct challenge to the Obama administrations unlawful efforts to unilaterally rewrite Title IX, Schmidt, a Republican, said in a statement. President Barack Obamas administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority. The letter relied on an interpretation of Title IX, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education initiatives that receive federal financial assistance. The letter did not have the force of law but contained an implicit threat that schools that do not abide by the directive could lose federal aid. Schmidt called the directive an attempt to expand federal power. Also on Wednesday, the Kansas Senate passed by 30-to-8 a resolution opposing the Obama administrations guidance on transgender students bathroom use that said state and local officials, and not federal officials, should decide school policy and that the directive threatens students privacy and safety.  Officials from 11 U.S. states - Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin - sued the Obama administration last week, calling its directive a massive social experiment. Mississippis Republican governor said on Thursday he planned to join the lawsuit.  Schmidt said he is reviewing whether Kansas will join the lawsuit by the 11 states, led by Texas, or file a separate, similar lawsuit. North Carolina sued the federal government last month, seeking to protect a state law passed in March that bans people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. But while many states have protested the Obama administration directive, others have acted to protect the rights of transgender individuals. Massachusetts lawmakers on Wednesday were voting on a measure that would make the state the 18th to ban discrimination based on gender identity. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 ",1
"As Puerto Rico government frays, bondholders might get paid","SAN JUAN (Reuters) - As struggling Puerto Rico enters a bitter election season, discord in the U.S. territorys ruling party is reaching new heights, which could benefit bondholders. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has pushed to force hedge funds, mutual funds and other investors to take losses on the $70 billion Puerto Rico owes them because it cannot repay the debt in full. He says the island's staggering poverty and lack of money to ensure basic services constitutes a humanitarian crisis. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Garcia Padilla, deeply unpopular with exhausted political capital, has dwindling allies among campaigning lawmakers now distancing themselves from him. They may adopt more creditor-friendly policies to counter his populist ideals, experts say. Puerto Rican residents vote in local primaries this Sunday with some members of Garcia Padillas Popular Democratic Party locked in tight battles, including Rep. Rafael Tatito Hernandez, who runs Puerto Ricos House finance committee. The islands election cycle is unique, with all posts decided on the same day every four years, making political campaigns especially heated. Election day, Nov. 8, is a holiday, and voter turnout averages more than 80 percent. The governor will not seek a second term, and financial markets have never given him much credibility. His administration has yet to publish fiscal 2014s audited financial results. That has fed a perception of irresponsible government, and spurred PDP members to try to distance themselves from his administration. The dynamic could play into the hands of creditors. Garcia Padilla set aside about $200 million in the fiscal 2017 budget toward the $800 million payment due on GO debt July 1, but Hernandez has said he will lobby to earmark enough to pay it all. There is a lot of lobbying here by bondholders, and one of the big issues is whether to include money to pay that debt in next years budget, Sergio Marxuach, a San Juan-based economist, said in an interview. A law signed in April, giving the governor authority to issue moratoriums on debt payments, could be scaled back, said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who follows Puerto Rico. Our base case has been that the budget will be used as leverage to amend back parts of the moratorium, Hanson said.  While these local fights play out, the U.S. Congress has been debating a bill that would pull Puerto Ricos finances under federal oversight and allow the government to restructure its bond debt. The governor, though never wildly popular, has had some success pushing his agenda. But lately the wheels have come off, even though his party has controlled the House and Senate since 2013. Key party leaders, like Hernandez and former Secretary of State David Bernier, the PDPs gubernatorial candidate, have openly criticized him. Garcia Padillas own economy minister, Alberto Baco Bague, publicly questioned the legitimacy of the humanitarian crisis, telling local media in May the narrative was a political strategy. Baco declined to comment for this story. Last week, in a boon for businesses, the legislature repealed a new round of tax hikes on professional services, the same bill it had approved just last year on the strength of Garcia Padillas message of financial desperation. Adding to the chaos, a group of Puerto Rico creditors sued Garcia Padillas administration over the legality of the debt moratorium, despite having signed an agreement barring lawsuits while sides negotiated a restructuring. The move reflected ever-growing acrimony between the government and its creditors, Hanson said. A spokeswoman for Garcia Padillas office had no immediate comment. Like Bacos criticism, much of the internal discord turns on whether there is actually a humanitarian crisis. But while that argument may be losing political steam, it should not be disregarded, Marxuach said. The message has resonated with Democrats in Washington, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Rep. Raul Grijalva, who made separate visits to Puerto Rico in May to stress the dire human circumstances on the island.  Puerto Rico is at a moment of necessity and crisis, Lew said May 9 in San Juan. Marxuach said the crisis is not so much a ticking time bomb, its a slow burn. Public pensions covering 330,000 beneficiaries are the worst-funded of any state-level U.S. pension this century, set to run out of cash in three years.  Hospitals face staffing shortfalls as doctors flee to better-paying jobs on the mainland. The islands poverty rate is at 45 percent; unemployment is near 12 percent, and higher in rural towns. Puerto Ricans ability to emigrate to the mainland is an escape hatch that mitigates the economic stress and political pressure to fix it. But for those without the ability to escape the burdens just grow. The debt stays the same, said Marxuach, but the economy grows even less. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 ",1
NY mayor criticizes Trump's closing public atrium for campaign events,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A showdown between New York City and Donald Trump over one of the most potent symbols of Trumps candidacy, the glitzy atrium of Trump Tower, intensified on Wednesday as the mayors office criticized his closing of the towers public space for campaign events. Lined with pink marble and indoor waterfalls and a popular tourist attraction, the atrium has become a favorite event backdrop for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. presidency, who frequently boasts to voters of his wealthy lifestyle and his success as a building developer. City officials are now investigating whether Trumps using the atrium for private campaign events without permission is in breach of a long-standing agreement between Trump and the citys planners. Trump had agreed to maintain it as a public space as a zoning concession when the tower was built.  A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, weighed in on Wednesday to register City Halls displeasure, which may yet force Trump to find an alternative setting for his events for the five months remaining before the November presidential election.  Despite what he may think, the rules and laws of this city apply to everybody, including Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump should honor his agreement with the city to keep the space open to the public, Austin Finan, the spokesman, said in a statement. In order to build his flagship Fifth Avenue skyscraper taller than zoning rules would have otherwise allowed, including the penthouse where Trump lives, Trump agreed to keep the atrium open to the public from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day. The atrium, opened in 1983, is one of scores of privately owned public spaces across the city, an effort to balance the wishes of developers to build taller while preserving pockets of space for New Yorkers in crowded neighborhoods. Since launching his campaign by descending an escalator into the atrium last June, Trump has held at least half a dozen campaign events where Reuters reporters have seen his security staff prevent anyone but a few pre-approved journalists from entering parts or all of the atrium.  City officials, whose investigation was first reported by Reuters on Tuesday, say they have no evidence of Trump seeking or getting permission to close the space for a private event, which is allowed to happen up to four times a year.  Michael Cohen, an executive vice president for the Trump Organization, said on Tuesday he could neither confirm nor deny if there had been a violation of the agreement while his staff tried to locate the paperwork. He did not respond to questions on Wednesday. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 ",1

Congress probes NY Fed's handling of Bangladesh Bank heist: letter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee has launched a probe into the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks handling of the cyber theft of $81 million from one of its accounts held by the central bank of Bangladesh, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The letter, addressed to New York Fed President William Dudley and sent Tuesday from the House of Representatives Science Committee, requests all documents and communications connected to the February heist, the banks oversight of the global financial network SWIFT and the status of any reviews related to the Feds information technology conducted since the attack occurred. The letter follows similar probes launched last month by Tom Carper, the Senate Homeland Security Committees top Democrat, and Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat. The latest inquiry comes as policymakers, regulators and financial institutions around the world increase scrutiny into the heist and related attacks on banks in Vietnam and Ecuador, in which hackers sent fraudulent transaction messages across the SWIFT. In light of the recent cyber attacks on our global financial systems, the Committee believes it is imperative to receive information from the NY Fed about its response, its oversight of SWIFT, the status of the investigation, and any remedial steps taken to address vulnerabilities, states the letter, signed by House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican. A New York Fed spokeswoman said it intended to respond to the new request for information. The bank has so far denied responsibility for the Bangladesh Bank intrusion. The letter said it was deeply troubling that cyber security experts believe more attacks will be uncovered as banks review their security systems, and that Bangladesh Banks systems appeared to be the weak link in the February attack. SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, last week urged banks to bolster their security, saying it was aware of multiple attacks. Banks around the world rely on SWIFT to issue payment instructions to each other. The committee requested a response from the New York Fed by June 14. ",politicsNews,"June 1, 2016 ",1
New York probing Trump's closing of Trump Tower atrium for campaign events," (This May 31 story corrects atriums opening times in sixth paragraph: between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. instead of between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.) By Jonathan Allen NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City is investigating Donald Trumps practice of closing down the public atrium in Trump Tower for presidential campaign events that are off limits to the public.   In order to add more floors than zoning rules would otherwise allow, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, agreed to create a two-story public atrium on the ground and lower floors of the building, which opened in 1983 on Manhattans Fifth Avenue. But security staff wearing Trump badges spent several hours shooing away a growing crowd of New Yorkers and tourists from the doors on Tuesday morning after Trump decided to hold a news conference in the atrium to discuss his fundraising for veterans groups. Department of Buildings inspectors will be investigating the allegations that the (public atrium) was closed contrary to the building owners agreement with the city, Joe Soldevere, a department spokesman, told Reuters on Tuesday. There are scores of privately owned public spaces, or POPS, throughout New York City, intended as a trade-off between developers who want to build taller and preserving space for the public in the citys densest neighborhoods. In the case of Trump Tower, the 6,000-square-foot public atrium, which is lined with pink marble, must be open to the public between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. every day, a fact advertised in large gold letters over the buildings Fifth Avenue entrance. As with other such spaces, it can be closed up to four times a year for a private event after permission from city officials.  Trump has held several events in the public areas of Trump Tower since launching his campaign in the atrium there last June. Officials at the Department of City Planning, which grants permission to close a POPS for an event, and the Department of Buildings, which investigates violations, said they had no record of Trump ever seeking or being granted permission to shut out the public for a campaign event. The investigation was prompted by media reports of the news conference.  Inspectors will seek evidence that the public was denied access without the citys permission, including testimony from anyone turned away. Violations carry a $4,000 fine. Michael Cohen, an executive vice president for the Trump Organization, said his staff was trying to locate the text of the agreement with the city, and could not immediately confirm or deny the suggestion that closing the atrium was a violation. Trump lives in a penthouse in the tower with his family and has his main office there. He previously battled with the city over the space, most recently after he replaced a bench there with a kiosk selling Trump merchandise. A city judge ruled the kiosk violated Trumps agreement with the city, and Trump agreed to removed the kiosk in January and pay a $4,000 fine. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1
Trump says to visit UK to open golf resort on June 24,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would visit Britain for the opening of his Scottish golf resort on June 24, his first trip to the UK since a spat with Prime Minister David Cameron over comments he made about Muslims. Relations between Cameron and Trump, whose visit comes the day after Britain holds a referendum on its membership of the European Union, have been tense since the British leader called his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States dangerous and stupid. Trumps idea for a boycott of Muslims, mooted last December, also led to calls from some lawmakers for him to be banned from Britain, with almost 600,000 people signing an online petition to keep him out. While Cameron and his ministers rejected that call, the prime minister did suggest that Trump would unite the nation against him if he visited Britain.  Trump responded by saying he was unlikely to have a good relationship with Cameron, although both men have since tempered their language after Trump effectively became the presumptive Republican Party nominee. Cameron has said he would be happy to meet him, although no date had been fixed, and Trump said they could have a good relationship after all. A spokesman for Cameron said there were no firm plans for a meeting, although it was a long-standing practice for a prime minister to meet presidential nominees if they visited Britain. Trumps visit will coincide with the result of Britains EU referendum, and while Cameron is leading the campaign for Britain to stay in the bloc, Trump has said he thinks Britons would be better off outside. In a statement, Trump made no mention of any potential Cameron meeting, saying only that his visit to Britain was for the official opening of his golf resort at Turnberry following a 200 million pound ($290 million) refurbishment. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the date of the opening had been planned long in advance and that it was just a coincidence it came the day after the EU vote. The date would not be changed, she added. The golf course has itself pitted Trump against British politicians after Scotlands devolved government approved plans for an offshore wind farm nearby which led Trump to denounce Scottish ministers as foolish, small minded and parochial.

Venezuela's Maduro rooting for 'revolutionary friend' Sanders in U.S. campaign,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelas embattled president, Nicolas Maduro, said on Tuesday night he supported Bernie Sanders in the U.S. presidential race, adding that the candidate, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, would win if the vote were free.  Maduro, a socialist who sees himself as the political heir to his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, has long railed against the United States, blaming it for Venezuelas economic crisis and accusing Washington of attempting to topple him. Bernie Sanders, our revolutionary friend, ought to win in the United States, Maduro said during an hours-long televised broadcast.  If the elections were free ... Bernie Sanders would be president of the United States, he said, criticizing the U.S. Electoral College system as unrepresentative of popular sentiment.  Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. In an email to supporters in September, Sanders called Chavez a dead communist dictator. Venezuela is reeling from a brutal economic crisis that has seen food and medicine running short and spiraling inflation destroying incomes.  The United States and Venezuela have had troubled relations since Chavez became president in 1999, and the countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010. Maduro suffered a blow on Tuesday, when the head of the Washington-based Organization of American States called an urgent meeting to discuss whether Venezuela was violating basic democratic principles, paving the way for a vote that could suspend it from the regional diplomatic body. (reut.rs/1P1h0ND) Maduro is also under pressure from Venezuelas opposition, which is pushing for a recall referendum to remove him from office this year, although authorities have said there would be no such vote.

Illinois ends spring session without a FY 2017 budget,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - The Democrat-controlled Illinois Legislature ended its spring session late Tuesday, failing to produce a full fiscal 2017 budget to tackle financial woes or even a plan to fund schools. Hours before the session ended Republican Governor Bruce Rauner chastised Democrats for their stunning failure on the budget front. Were like a banana republic. We cant manage our money, he said at a news conference. A House-passed budget that Rauner vowed to veto for being more than $7 billion short on revenue failed badly in a Senate vote. Illinois has limped through fiscal 2016 as the only U.S. state without a complete budget, operating under court-ordered spending, and continuing and stopgap appropriations.  The governor last year vetoed all but a school funding bill in the Democrats budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30.  The impasse between Rauner and Democrats showed no sign of easing and could leave the nations fifth-largest state runningon a similar autopilot as the new fiscal year begins July 1. Vendors, social services providers, state universities, community colleges and others that have received partial or no funding over the last year are reaching breaking point. That in turn could bring widespread operational problems if the state is unable to obtain food, utilities, fuel and other essentials. Real people are going to suffer. Real people are going to die, warned Democratic State Representative Jack Franks. The legislature also failed to approve a stand-alone K-12 education budget. A $15.7-billion bill to ensure schools open in the fall passed the Senate but was soundly defeated in the House.  Its demise leaves the financially struggling Chicago Public Schools (CPS) without an additional $475 million in funding in part to help pay for rising contributions to teacher pensions. CPS officials have warned of draconian spending cuts to deal with a $1 billion budget deficit. Democratic leaders on Tuesday refused to immediately take up Rauners short-term budget plan, shunting it off to a bipartisan working group. Future budget deliberations will be complicated by the fact that a tougher, three-fifths voting majority to pass a bill kicks in on Wednesday.  House Speaker Michael Madigan has made clear his chamber will meet every week during June to work on a budget.  The inability to send Rauner a spending plan exposed an unusual level of dysfunction within the Democratic Party, whose super majorities in both legislative chambers were racked by infighting over how best to confront the 11-month impasse with the governor. The Senates refusal to adopt a budget plan bearing the clear imprint of Madigan, the state party chairman, represented a stinging rebuke to the longest-serving statehouse speaker in America and a setback Rauner allies called a catastrophe for Democrats. Within the 39-member Senate Democratic majority, some senators complained they were unable to have input in the House-passed plan, which arrived last week as a take-it-or-leave it proposition, one of Madigans legislative hallmarks over the years in his dealings with Illinois upper legislative chamber. There was a lot of resentment over the way it was passed, said Senate President John Cullerton. Without a budget, Illinois, which already has the lowest bond ratings among the 50 states, risks harming its credit standing further. Credit rating agencies have warned of downgrades if the state fails to tackle its $111-billion unfunded pension liability and huge structural budget deficit. The governors budget office has hired consultants to help disengage from interest rate swap pacts that could cost the state more than $100 million if its ratings fall below specified levels.

"Combative Trump says he raised $5.6 million for vets, bashes media","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday detailed $5.6 million in contributions he raised for military veterans, and staged a fiery news conference where he attacked reporters for questioning him for months about the money.                  Appearing at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the billionaire accused the media of failing to give him credit for raising the funds at an event in January in Iowa. His tirade, in which he called one reporter a sleaze and sarcastically described another as a real beauty, overshadowed what otherwise should have been an upbeat event for the presumptive Republican nominee. The press should be ashamed of themselves, he told reporters gathered before him. You make me look very bad. Ive never received such bad publicity for doing a good job. While Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media, questions about the donations to veterans touched a raw nerve with him as he tries to build a conservative base ahead of the Nov. 8 general election.     Reporters have been persistently asking whether Trump in fact raised all the money he said he had in January and why it took so long to hand donations over to veterans groups. A number of veterans groups listed by Trump on Tuesday as recipients confirmed they had received the donation as listed, ranging from $25,000 to, in one case, $1.1 million, which went to the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation. Some of the donations arrived in February or March, some as recently as last week around the time a critical article appeared in The Washington Post. The money arrived in the form of a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation. We received a $75,000 gift early last week from the Trump Foundation, it was not restricted or earmarked in any way, said Katherine Fritz, director of development at Americas Vetdogs. Trumps criticism of the media dashed the hopes of some Republican leaders who want him to tone down his rhetoric and become more magnanimous now that he has sealed the Republican presidential nomination. The Washington Post said Trump only handed over a personal donation of $1 million last week - four months after announcing it - once the newspaper started asking about the money. Trump said the news coverage of his veterans group donations had been close to libelous. Asked whether he would maintain an adversarial stance with reporters if elected president, Trump said: Yeah, its going to be like this. A reporter told Trump he seemed resistant to the kind of scrutiny that comes with the office of U.S. president. But Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, said the news media should stop fretting about how Trump treats them. My advice to the press: Stop interviewing yourselves about Trumps attack on the press. Dont worry about it. Just do your jobs and be fair, he said. The contretemps took place on the same day documents were disclosed from a lawsuit involving Trump University, a now-defunct education program that ran a real estate training program. Trump has attacked the presiding judge as hostile to him.  The university documents showed Trump University created a special class to teach students how to cash in on U.S. mortgage foreclosures when the United States was struggling with an entrenched housing crisis in 2009. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton sought to take advantage of Trumps discomfort over the media scrutiny he has faced. She told CNN that Trumps tendency to attack his critics is a recipe for gridlock in Washington. Clinton defended her own policy toward dealing with the news media, saying she has conducted 300 interviews this year alone. Unlike Trump, she rarely holds news conferences. Her last one was last December. Clinton leads Trump by 11 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. According to the May 27-31 survey of likely voters, 46 percent support the former U.S. secretary of state while 35 percent back Trump.   California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Clinton for the Democratic nomination, saying it was the only way to stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump.            At his news conference, Trump also bristled at the possibility that Republicans opposed to him might run a third-party candidate as an alternative to Trump or the expected Democratic nominee Clinton. He said a leader of that effort, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard magazine, looks like such a fool. Let me tell you these people are losers, said Trump, adding that a third-party candidacy would guarantee Clinton wins the White House and deny Republicans the chance to put conservatives on the Supreme Court. What youre going to do is lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court, he said. Trump read out a list of veterans organizations that had received money from the January event, which he attended instead of participating in a Fox News-sponsored candidates debate. He said the money was benefiting 41 groups and that the total cash raised could climb as more comes in.  He turned the microphone over briefly to Al Baldasaro, a Trump supporter and a veteran from New Hampshire who also skewered the news media, saying reporters should get your head out of your butt, focus on the real issues.

Trump University told students how to 'cash in' on housing crash,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps eponymous business seminar program created a class to teach students how to cash in on U.S. mortgage foreclosures during the housing crisis. Trump University promised in 2009 that its Fast Track to Foreclosure Investing would teach students how to take advantage of the crisis, according to university documents unsealed last week in a lawsuit against the now-defunct program.  The release will likely stoke criticism from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who last week accused her likely rival in the Nov. 8 presidential election of having cheered on the 2008 housing crash as an investment opportunity. A spokeswoman for Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although Trump reacted to Clintons criticism last week, saying: What am I going to do? Im in business. A Trump University advertisement released in the case said one of its free investor workshops would explain how to Cash in on one of the greatest property liquidations in history! Trump University instructors were to teach students how to capitalize without harm and find ways for sellers to move on without shame, according to a December 2008 summary of the seminar. An earlier 2007 memo to enrollment counselors stated that about 1.5 million U.S. homeowners would face foreclosure that year and laid out how they should advise students to seize the tremendous opportunity to purchase properties at major discounts in hot markets such as Arizona, Florida and Texas. The roughly 400 pages of documents included playbooks on how to recruit students, directions for how instructors should deal with the media and other details about Trumps seminar program. They were unsealed on Friday by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Trump called hostile and a hater, adding he believed the judge was Mexican. New Yorks attorney general slammed Trump on Tuesday for his comment on the judges ethnicity. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law. Clintons attack on Trump last week was prompted by recently released audio that Trump recorded in 2006 for Trump University. In remarks on a possible bubble burst, Trump said in the recording: I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy to make a lot of money.

NY attorney general slams Trump's comment on judge's ethnicity,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New Yorks attorney general, who has filed a lawsuit against Donald Trumps education venture, Trump University, slammed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday for his attack on a U.S. district judges ethnicity. Trump, a New York billionaire businessman, is fighting a trio of lawsuits that accuse his education program of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about his real-estate investment strategies. This was a fraud from top to bottom. Hes using every trick he can to delay the release of documents, to delay the trials, attacking the judge for his ethnicity, attacking me and accusing me of conspiring with the president of the United States, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, told CNN. Days after Judge Gonzalo Curiel ordered some documents in one case involving the school to be unsealed, Trump called Curiel hostile and a hater and said he believed the judge was Mexican. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law. Schneiderman, re-elected as attorney general in 2014, dismissed a question about Trumps allegation that Curiels ruling was politically motivated, saying that in three individual cases against the university, every judge has said these are valid fraud claims. Hes taking it to New Yorks highest court for one more round of appeals, but no judge has dismissed this, Schneiderman said. Asked about Trumps efforts to downplay the case,  Schneiderman called it hugely important for the way it cast Trump as someone who is absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people. He blasted some of the universitys specific tactics, including the way instructors would persuade students to ask their credit card companies for an increased credit limit as a step toward being successful in real estate, and then persuade them to use it to buy more Trump seminars.

Massachusetts governor would sign transgender rights bill,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said on Tuesday he is ready to sign a transgender rights bill if it passes in its current form in the state House of Representatives amid an acrimonious debate across the United States about the issue. Baker, a socially liberal Republican, had come under fire this year for refusing to say whether he would approve the bill, which would ban discrimination against transgender people in public restrooms and other public buildings. It passed the state Senate last month. No one should be discriminated against in Massachusetts because of their gender identity, Baker said in a statement. I would sign the House version in its current form should it reach my desk. The Massachusetts House is due to vote on the measure on Wednesday. It is expected to pass by a wide margin in the Democratic-controlled chamber. The House version of the bill differs from the version passed by the Senate in that it directs the state attorney general to issue guidelines to law enforcement on how to handle people who claim transgender rights for an improper purpose. That language is a nod to one of the main concerns of opponents of people using bathrooms or locker rooms that do not correspond with their birth gender - that sexual predators will claim transgender status to access potential victims. The measure would make liberal-leaning Massachusetts the 18th U.S. state to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. The issue of transgender rights has become the latest front in Americas culture wars. Some supporters of the Massachusetts measure described it as a rebuke to a law put in place in March in North Carolina prohibiting people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to the sex on their birth certificates.

U.S. says North Korea's nuclear ambitions on table in China talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to use upcoming talks with top Chinese officials to discuss ways to bring greater pressure to bear on North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday. The outcome that were looking for is North Korean agreement to negotiate the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel told reporters. We have a vastly improved chance of getting that with Chinas full cooperation, and we intend to use the (U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue) to game out how we can speed up the outcome that were both working to achieve, he said.

U.S. urges North Korea to curb actions that raise tensions in northeast Asia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday condemned an attempted missile launch by North Korea and urged Pyongyang to refrain from actions that create tensions in northeastern Asia. The United States, and the rest of the international community, calls on North Korea to refrain from actions including this failed missile test that further raise tensions in the region and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The United States strongly condemns North Koreas missile test, he told a news briefing. The U.S. militarys Strategic Command assessed that North Korea attempted to launch an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Monday but that the test was a failure. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1
Justice Department asks for hold on court sanctions in immigration case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday filed an emergency motion to stop sanctions imposed by a federal judge in Texas that  included mandated ethics classes for federal prosecutors, as part of ongoing litigation over immigration policy. The sanctions were ordered on May 19 by District Judge Andrew Hanen, who ruled in February 2015 that President Barack Obamas executive actions on immigration were outside the bounds of the presidents authority. Hanen also ordered the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a state-by-state review of immigrants who were given three years of safeguards from deportation under Obamas previous immigration action instead of two.  The case has been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Justice Department asked Hanen to put a hold on the sanctions while it seeks a review from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department will ask the Fifth Circuit for an appeal of the decision, a mandamus order or both to block the sanction order.  In the court filing, in Houston, the Justice Department said it takes with utmost seriousness the public trust committed to it to represent the interests of the American people in the courts of the United States, and insists that its attorneys adhere to the high standards of ethical conduct and professionalism required to carry out that critical mission.     The courts order to turn over immigration records would undermine trust in the Department of Homeland Securitys ability to maintain the confidentiality of personal information, which is essential to its mission, said Patrick Rodenbush, a spokesman for the Justice Department, in connection with the review ordered by Hanen.

Supreme Court rejects union appeal over Trump casino bankruptcy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a unions appeal of a lower courts ruling that allowed Atlantic Citys Trump Taj Mahal casino, founded by Donald Trump but now owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, to break its contract with union workers to secure a bankruptcy rescue deal. The high courts decision not to hear the appeal by Unite Here Local 54 leaves in place a January decision by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that cleared the way for the casino to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The struggling casino has since emerged from bankruptcy and is now owned by Icahn Enterprises LP. It was the New Jersey citys largest casino when Trump opened it in 1990 but it later fell on hard times along with other Atlantic City casinos. Trump, the billionaire real estate developer and presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee, founded the casino and it bears his name, but he has said he no longer has a stake in it. In 2014, the casinos owner, Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc, filed for bankruptcy. Last year, it convinced a U.S. bankruptcy judge that it had to impose a new lower-cost contract on unionized workers in order to secure Icahns rescue deal. The union appealed, arguing that because the collective bargaining agreement expired before the bankruptcy, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction. The appeals court sided with Trump Entertainment, saying a bankruptcy judge must be free to evaluate a labor contract that may determine the fate of a business. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1
Supreme Court rejects constitutional challenge to death penalty,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to hear an appeal asserting that the death penalty violates the U.S. Constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment filed by a Louisiana man convicted of fatally shooting his pregnant former girlfriend. Two of the eight justices, liberals Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said they would have accepted the case, repeating concerns about the death penaltys constitutionality they raised in a different case last year. The justices, who have sharply disagreed among themselves over capital punishment, declined to consider the appeal brought by Lamondre Tucker, who was sentenced to death for the 2008 murder of 18-year-old Tavia Sills in Shreveport. Sills, nearly five months pregnant, was shot three times and her body was dumped in a pond. Tucker, who is black, had argued in part that black males had an increased likelihood of being convicted of murder and sentenced to death in Louisianas Caddo Parish due to endemic racism. At the time of Tuckers conviction, a Confederate flag, symbol of the pro-slavery Southern states that lost the U.S. Civil War that ended in 1865, flew outside the county courthouse, his lawyers said in court filings. Breyer wrote that Tucker may well have received the death penalty not because of the comparative egregiousness of his crime, but because of an arbitrary feature of his case, namely geography. One could reasonably believe that if Tucker had committed the same crime just across the Red River in, say, Bossier Parish, he would not now be on death row, Breyer said. Breyers comments echoed similar remarks he made in June 2015 when the court upheld Oklahomas lethal injection procedures.  The shorthanded court has steered clear of taking major cases since the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but even at full strength may not have accepted this one. There is no indication the court is any closer to taking a case that would challenge the death penalty directly, with the courts two other liberals, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, not joining Breyers opinion. Four votes are needed for the justices to hear a case.  The pregnant Sills had told Tucker she believed he was the father. Later testing showed Tucker, 18 at the time of the murder, was not the father. The fetus did not survive. The Supreme Court left in place a September 2015 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that rejected Tuckers legal arguments and upheld his conviction and death sentence. In the United States, 31 states have the death penalty and 19 do not. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1
Pressure rises on Marco Rubio to run for Senate re-election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday joined a chorus of Republican stalwarts publicly urging Marco Rubio to run for a second Senate term in Florida, as the party faces an uphill fight to maintain its control of the Senate. Were doing everything to encourage him to run, McConnell said during an interview on MSNBCs Morning Joe program. Some political strategists and Senate Republican aides see a potentially weak field of Republican candidates for the Florida Senate seat and think Rubio could help Republicans hold their Senate majority if he entered the race. He has until June 24 to decide if he wants to run in the Aug. 30 Republican primary. Josh Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff, said in a telephone interview that unlike many of the current Republican candidates for the seat, Rubio still enjoys pretty high favorability and very high name ID ratings in Florida and the ability to raise a lot of money. Republicans now hold 54 of the chambers 100 seats. There are 44 Democrats and two independents who align themselves with the Democrats. McConnell is trying to hold onto his job as Senate majority leader but with 24 Republican seats up for grabs in the Nov. 8 elections and only 10 Democratic seats in play, it will be a difficult bid. Last week, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said in a statement that he had strongly encouraged Rubio to enter the race. Rubio, a freshman senator elected in 2010, decided to retire from the Senate and instead seek the U.S. presidency. But his effort came to an end in March after he was soundly defeated in the Florida Republican primary by Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election. In a CNN State of the Union interview that aired on Sunday, Rubio was asked he if would ever seek public office in the future. I think thats a safe assumption, he said, without elaborating. During the interview, Rubio also said he would like to become commissioner of the National Football League. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1
Supreme Court to hear State Farm case over Hurricane Katrina fraud claim,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear an appeal by State Farm contesting a jury finding that the insurance company defrauded the federal government when assessing damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 along the Gulf of Mexico coast. The court will review a 2015 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the verdict in a suit brought under the federal False Claims Act, which lets people sue over allegations that the government has been defrauded. The court will consider a lawsuit brought by sisters Cori and Kerri Rigsby, former claims adjusters who worked with State Farm after the hurricane. People win a portion of the damages if such a False Claims Act suit is successful. The jury found that the U.S. government had been defrauded of $250,000 over a house that had sustained Katrina-related damage in Biloxi, Mississippi. The Rigsbys said the damage was caused by wind, which would be covered by the owners policy with State Farm. But State Farm concluded that the damage was flood-related, which was covered by the federal governments flood insurance program. The court said State Farm would have to pay $758,000 in damages. The Rigsbys were awarded $227,000 under the False Claims Act. State Farm argued in part that the lawsuit should have been thrown out because the Rigsbys former lawyer, Dickie Scruggs, had distributed information about the lawsuit to members of the media. False Claims Act lawsuits are required to be filed under seal and remain private for 60 days. In 2008, Scruggs was convicted of conspiring to bribe a judge in a different case. He was sentenced to five years in prison. The court will hear oral arguments and issue a ruling in the case during its next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2017.

"California governor endorses Clinton, calls Trump dangerous","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, saying it was the only way to keep Republican Donald Trump out of the White House. I have decided to cast my vote for Hillary Clinton because I believe this is the only path forward to win the presidency and stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump, Brown said in a letter to California Democrats and independents posted online. Brown, a popular Democrat who has steered the nations most populous state on a centrist path, praised Clintons rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but noted that she had won about 3 million more votes and hundreds more delegates. In other words, Clintons lead is insurmountable and Democrats have shown  by millions of votes  that they want her as their nominee. California is the biggest prize of the six states that hold presidential nominating contests on June 7, with 475 delegates. Clinton has secured 2,310 delegates, 73 short of the number needed to clinch her partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election.  As he noted in his letter, Brown himself waged a populist presidential campaign in 1992, losing to then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, with themes similar to many espoused by Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist. Running on the slogan We the People, Brown railed against the influence of money in Washington and said politicians were bought and paid for. But Brown said Democrats need to stop fighting each other so they can focus on beating Trump, who he said presents a danger to immigrants, the environment and world peace. The stakes couldnt be higher. Our country faces an existential threat from climate change and the spread of nuclear weapons. A new Cold War is on the horizon, Brown wrote.  Hillary Clinton, with her long experience, especially as secretary of state, has a firm grasp of the issues and will be prepared to lead our country on day one. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1
State lawmakers override bill veto to ease Chicago pension payments,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago will be able to spread out state-mandated higher payments to its police and fire pensions after the Illinois Legislature on Monday overrode the governors veto of a bill that became entangled in a political impasse. The Senate voted 39-19 and the House voted 72-43 to undo Republican Governor Bruce Rauners veto on Friday that the city claimed would lead to a $300 million property tax hike. The bill gives Chicago short-term budget relief but will add to the citys big pension funding gap.  The override bolsters Democrats, who control the legislature, as they battle with Rauner over state assistance for Chicago and its public school system, which is seeking state money for its teachers pensions. The political impasse had left Illinois without a complete budget 11 months into fiscal 2016. Rauner called the bill terrible policy, while Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel accused him of using the city as a political pawn. Rauners spokeswoman Catherine Kelly released a statement reiterating the governors contention that the measure would end up costing Chicago taxpayers $18.6 billion over time. The measure alters a 2010 state law that boosted Chicagos payments to its public safety workers pensions in order to reach a 90 percent funded level by 2040. Under that law, Chicagos contribution will jump to nearly $834 million this year from $290.4 million in 2015, according to city figures. The new law reduces the payment to $619 million and allows for smaller increases through 2020 than under the 2010 law. It also gives the police and fire funds until 2055 to become 90 percent funded. The police system is 26 percent funded and the fire system 23 percent funded. Chicagos fiscal 2016 budget assumed the bills enactment by lowering the citys contribution to police and fire pensions by about $220 million. The city council also approved a $543 million phased-in property tax to exclusively cover higher contributions to the two retirement systems. House Speaker Michael Madigan was clearly delighted as he addressed reporters after budget talks with Rauner. I think it was interesting the governor had nothing to say about the override. I was raised not to cause embarrassment for people so I didnt raise it, Madigan said. The city must still deal with underfunding problems for its municipal and laborers retirement systems after the Illinois Supreme Court in March tossed out a 2014 law that cut benefits and increased contributions to keep the pension funds from insolvency.

Animal rights activists briefly disrupt Sanders' rally in California,"(Reuters) - At least five animal rights activists on Monday rushed the stage as presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke at a rally in Oakland, video posted online showed. The protesters were led away by several Secret Service agents before they were able to reach the Democrat, whose speech was briefly interrupted by the disturbance, a video posted by CNN showed. A Secret Service agent rushed to Sanders side, grabbed him and wrapped his arms around the presidential candidate during the ruckus.    We dont get intimidated easily, said Sanders, as he resumed his speech. Animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere claimed responsibility for the protest, saying in a statement that it hoped to persuade Sanders to take a tough stance against factory farms.  Bernie Sanders claims to support the good farms, activist Rachel Ziegler said in the statement. But as our repeated investigations have shown, even the good farms are horrific.  The organization posted a video online showing at least five protesters being led away by security personnel after they climbed onto the stage.   Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is running far behind Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  In March, a man stormed the stage as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump spoke in Vandalia, Ohio before being held by several agents. ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1
Illinois Democrats poised to defy governor's budget veto threat,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - Illinois long-running budget stalemate was set to spill into the summer on Monday, as Democratic lawmakers worked to pass a 2017 spending plan that Republican Governor Bruce Rauner has threatened to veto, possibly jeopardizing public schools re-opening in August. As a midnight Tuesday deadline to pass legislation approaches, Rauner and his Democratic rivals who control the state legislature reported no headway toward ending the 11-month long dispute that has left Illinois as the only state without a full operating budget for the current fiscal year. The second-year governor says the budget is $7 billion short on revenues. He has insisted that the budget should be tied to a series of labor-weakening, business-friendly changes that Democrats argue will harm the states working class. In recent weeks, legislative working groups convened by Rauner have tried to bridge differences between the governor and top Democrats. Rauner and the Democratic legislative leaders met for less than a half hour on Monday with House Speaker Michael Madigan declaring plans to keep his legislative chamber in session during June, when a tougher three-fifths majority vote is required to pass a budget. My view is that if theres no agreement (Tuesday) night, I would ask the governor to keep his working groups functioning on a regular schedule because the House is going to be in continuous session, Madigan told reporters after the meeting. Senate President John Cullerton signaled his chamber could vote on a budget bill passed by the House last week, or on an alternative plan he declined to outline. He also said he was trying to round up votes for the House budget bill. [Tuesday] would be a good day to call it, Cullerton said. Republican legislative leaders slammed Democrats for their refusal to accept pieces of Rauners non-budgetary agenda or offer revenue sources to pay for their spending plan. Theyre just forcing a tax increase. Thats what theyre doing, said Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno, adding that Democrats plan a post-November election tax hike vote. Contained within the Democratic spending package is a $760 million increase in funding for Illinois public-school system for the fiscal year that begins July 1. A complete Rauner veto of the package would mean schools would be left without adequate state funding in August when schools are set to open for the fall, a gambit Cullerton predicted the governor could not risk.

Judge criticized by Trump unseals documents in Trump University case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge, called a hater by Donald Trump for his handling of a lawsuit related to the businessmans Trump University real estate school, has unsealed documents related to the case. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election, is fighting a lawsuit that accuses his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaires real estate investment strategies. In an order signed on Friday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said that materials, including Trump University procedures on dealing with students and the media, should be unsealed.  He noted they had already been published by the media organization Politico and that a magistrate judge described them previously as routine and commonplace. At a rally in San Diego on Friday, Trump criticized Curiel for his handling of the Trump University case. I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. Hes a hater, Trump said. Were in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, Trump said, adding he believed Curiel was Mexican. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law. Legal scholars said Trump could face consequences for slamming the judge, although many speculated that Curiel was unlikely to sanction him formally.  Mr. Trumps conduct could be subject to sanction for indirect criminal contempt of court, said Charles Geyh, a legal ethics expert at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law. He has impugned the honesty of the judge in a pending case, and has done so in the context of a political rally that seems calculated to intimidate by inciting anger among his supporters, he said. Arthur Hellman, an expert on federal courts and judicial ethics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, said the judge was in a difficult position. He cant respond directly. Hes not supposed to talk out of court about proceedings before him. Judges have gotten into trouble defending themselves from attacks. The judges hands are really tied, he said. Trump has drawn criticism for his comments about immigrants from Mexico, some of whom he has said were criminals and rapists.  He has proposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration and requiring Mexico to pay for it. Hispanics are a critical voting bloc in U.S. presidential elections. Last week, Trump knocked one of the highest-profile Hispanic women in the Republican Party, criticizing New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez for her handling of the states economy.  Her office said his criticisms were not substantive. Martinez has been touted as a potential vice presidential pick for a Republican ticket. ",politicsNews,"May 29, 2016 ",1
"Illinois governor blasts House budget, Chicago mayor","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - Just days before the end of the Illinois legislatures spring session, the governor said on Sunday he would veto a House-passed budget, which includes school funding, and fired back at an angry Chicago mayor. Lawmakers face a midnight Tuesday deadline to pass a fiscal 2017 budget and adopt a 2016 spending plan that has remained elusive for the past 11 months, leaving Illinois as the only state without a complete budget for the fiscal year ending June 30.  The impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature showed strong signs of extending into fiscal 2017, with Bruce Rauner pushing for pro-business and anti-union reforms and Democrats in the House of Representatives last week passing a spending plan short about $7 billion in revenue.  Adding fuel to the fire was Rauners veto on Friday of a bill allowing Chicago to spread out payments to its public safety workers retirement systems as the city struggles with a structural budget deficit and other pension woes. Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Sunday chastised the governors callous decision, saying it would lead to a $300 million city property tax hike at the same time Rauner wants local property taxes capped. Rauner, who needled Emanuel for not coming to the capital, Springfield, to address the citys pension-driven financial woes, called the bill terrible policy, saying it would cost Chicago taxpayers $18.6 billion more over the next 30 years by not fully funding pensions.  Where is the mayor? Hes not here, Hes not asking for real reforms, Rauner told reporters outside his office. He also confirmed previous statements from his staff that he would veto the House-passed budget if it was approved by the Senate. He urged lawmakers not to hold schools hostage, by sending him a clean bill to fund K-12 public schools. He also asked Democrats to break from longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan. The speaker is perfectly fine having deficit spending and borrowing. Hes perfectly fine crushing the economy, crushing our taxpayers. Hes been fine with it, and we need his members to say: No, Mr. Speaker, no more, Rauner said. Madigan said his members were prepared to be in continuous session through the summer, blaming Rauner for injecting non-budget demands into the process. Well be here (Monday), Tuesday and through the remainder of the summer, he said. Passing a budget beyond Tuesdays deadline will require tougher-to-get three-fifth majority votes in each chamber.

"Against a backdrop of motorcycles, Trump pledges to help veterans","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a move to bolster support among veterans, Republican Donald Trump joined a leather-jacket-wearing, motorcycle-riding crowd in Washington on Sunday to honor fighters who served in foreign wars and advocate for those still missing in action. Riders from across the country converged on the National Mall near the Lincoln Memorial for the annual Rolling Thunder rally and to listen to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who hopes to be commander in chief next year. Were going to rebuild our military and were going to take care of our veterans, Trump told the crowd of thousands, many of whom wore leather vests, veterans hats and biker insignia. Trump, the billionaire businessman who has promised to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico if he becomes president, said illegal immigrants in many cases got better care in the United States than military veterans. Were not going to allow that to happen any longer, he said. Trump, 69, who did not serve in the military, upset veterans last year when he said Senator John McCain of Arizona was not a war hero.  McCain, a Navy fighter pilot who went on to become the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was imprisoned and tortured after being shot down during the Vietnam War. Trump made no mention of McCain during his remarks on Sunday, and the crowd cheered him enthusiastically, with some waving signs including Bikers for Trump and Make America Great Again. Supporters cheered when Trump mentioned veterans and booed at the mention of Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. I dont know if he can fix (veterans issues), but hes the only one I think will try, said Leonard Westberry, 68, of Richmond, Virginia, a U.S. Army veteran who served in Vietnam in 1967. Westberry said he planned to support Trump in the Nov. 8 election. Its awesome that Trump is here. ... Thats a good thing, said Ralph Giannola, 65, who said he had not decided whether to support Trump in November. I just dont want to see any rioting. I mean, protests are OK. I dont want to see anybody get hurt, he said. There were no protest interruptions during Trumps nearly 20-minute address on Sunday, a rarity for similar events. I know one thing, youre going to all behave yourselves, right? Trump said to positive affirmations from the crowd. And I know another thing - there wont be any paid agitators in this group, he added to cheers. ",politicsNews,"May 29, 2016 ",1
"Rubio warms to Trump, but won't be his vice president","WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Sunday ruled out becoming Donald Trumps vice presidential running mate, but said hed be honored to play some kind of a role in helping him win the White House. Rubio, who clashed bitterly with Trump in the brutal race for the Republican nomination, said his policy differences with the real estate mogul were too great for Rubio to join the ticket. I wouldnt be the right choice for him, Rubio said in an extensive interview with CNNs State of the Union program. Donald deserves to have a vice president - hes earned the nomination - and he deserves to have a running mate that more fully embraces some of the things he stands for. Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, ended his White House bid in March after an embarrassing loss in his home state. Trump, who has practically ensured he will emerge as the nominee from the Republican convention in July, derided Rubio as a lightweight and dubbed him Little Marco.  Rubio called the real estate mogul a con artist and quipped about his small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood. Rubio and Trump differed sharply on policy issues, with Trump eschewing the interventionist approach favored by Rubio and Rubio criticizing Trumps call for temporarily banning the entry of Muslims into the United States. Ahead of the July 18-21 Republican convention, Trump has sought to unify the party behind him and gain the backing of other prominent party figures. Rubio said he expected to attend the convention and did not rule out a speaking role. He said he wanted to be helpful to Trumps presidential run because he wants to see likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton defeated in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. I dont want Hillary Clinton to be president. If theres something I can do to help that from happening and its helpful to the cause Id most certainly be honored to be considered for that, Rubio said. In another olive branch to Trump, Rubio said he regretted making the small hands remark about his former foe. I actually told Donald at one of the debates. I forget which one - I apologized to him for that, Rubio said. I said Im sorry that I said that. Its not who I am. And I shouldnt have done it. ",politicsNews,"May 29, 2016 ",1
"Bashing Trump not enough for Democrats to win Latino vote, advocates warn","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Latino groups have criticized the Democratic Party for relying too heavily on Republican Donald Trumps inflammatory comments on illegal immigration to drive Hispanic voters to the polls, calling instead for the party to do more to address Latino concerns, according to meeting notes seen by Reuters. (W)e cannot rely on Trump as that will set us up for failure, according to notes summarizing a meeting on May 2 between Democratic Party officials and representatives of several Hispanic advocacy groups. Our values need to be uplifted, they continued. Hispanics make up around 17 percent of the U.S. population, making them a critical voter group in what is expected to be a tight race between Trump and the Democratic nominee.  Democratic operatives have called Trump an ideal spur for getting out the Latino vote because of his hard-line approach to illegal immigration, with some canvassers even using his picture to help encourage Hispanics to register..  The New York billionaire and now presumptive Republican nominee made waves early in his campaign by saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers over the border. He has vowed to make Mexico pay for building a wall to block them and promised to round up and deport the millions of undocumented immigrants now in the United States. By contrast, Democratic contenders for the White House, front-runner Hillary Clinton and rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both promised to provide undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. The have also promised to nominate Latinos to key posts in their prospective administrations. At least two Hispanics are also considered candidates to be the running mate to the eventual Democratic presidential nominee: Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.   While Latinos appear to be a solid part of the Democratic base right now, that can certainly change, said Brent Wilkes, the treasurer for the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda and the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, who was present at the meeting.  In the last election in 2012, Latinos constituted 10 percent of the electorate and voted for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney by 71 percent to 27 percent, according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic Center. Many Latino advocates also stressed to the Democratic Party that, as members of nonpartisan organizations, their concerns are in addressing issues within their communities, such as education and the economy, rather than backing any one party or candidate. The Democratic delegation at the meeting, which according to the notes included the new Hispanic outreach director, Bridgette Gomez, assured the advocates their Latino outreach strategy was not merely Trump-focused, one participant said.  Donald Trumps candidacy fits into a much longer term and more thoughtful approach than just one election cycle, Democratic National Committee spokesman Pablo Manriquez said on Friday. He added that the party is focused on broader issues such as voting rights and the concerns of Latino families for this election and beyond.    Participants at the meeting also told the party they didnt see enough Latinos in the pipeline for future leadership positions, including elected office around the country, according to the meeting notes. Its not just infrastructure for political participation, but how to get people to run for office, how to teach people to run their own campaigns, said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, which had a representative at the meeting.

Cleveland officials to outline security for Republican Convention,"(Reuters) - The mayor and police chief of Cleveland next week will outline what security measures they would take for the Republican National Convention, officials said after a civil rights group and a police union criticized aspects of the preparations.   Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has drawn intense protests at campaign stops this year. At times the demonstrations have resulted in violence between his supporters and opponents. Officials in Cleveland are gearing up for the thousands of demonstrators expected outside the convention, scheduled from July 18 to 21. The event will culminate with the party anointing the billionaire real estate developer as its nominee for the November general election. Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson will join the police chief and other city officials on Tuesday to present a comprehensive overview of security preparations for the convention, the mayor said in a statement. Despite rumors, the Division of Police is prepared and is on track with its planning goals, the statement said. The announcement comes after the American Civil Liberties Union on May 19 accused the city of taking too long to issue permits to protesters planning demonstrations at the convention.  The city has since said it will allow application for permits starting on Tuesday, the same day officials will outline security plans. The Cleveland Police Patrolmens Association also has objected to certain parts of the citys plan. The union filed a grievance over an order prohibiting officers from taking vacations for several days before and after the convention. That prompted an arbitrator to order the city to pay overtime to officers who would lose out on vacation time, according to a copy of the ruling posted at news website Cleveland.com. Cleveland officials are marshalling a force of about 5,000 officers, including police from other law enforcement agencies, to provide security for the convention, City Council members have said. Council members earlier this month raised questions about the lack of transparency in Clevelands plans for the convention. But Police Chief Calvin Williams has said the city must withhold certain information to stymie anyone seeking to disrupt the convention. He has declined to say how many officers will be assigned to the event. Protests against Trump dogged his appearance on Friday in San Diego, where more than 1,000 demonstrators turned up and 35 were arrested, and on Tuesday night in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters threw rocks and bottles at police.

"Trump's San Diego rally draws more than 1,000 chanting protesters","SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Donald Trump brought his message of walls and deportations to the doorstep of Americas busiest border crossing on Friday as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee greeted supporters in San Diego, amid one of the largest counter-protests organized against him. The scene inside the San Diego Convention Center during Trumps speech was relatively placid, while outside demonstrators opposed to his controversy-ridden White House bid marched and chanted, carrying signs criticizing his rhetoric against illegal immigration.  Waving U.S. and Mexican flags, more than 1,000 people turned out for anti-trump rallies in San Diego, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border whose San Ysidro port of entry sees nearly 300,000 people a day cross legally between the countries. San Diego is considered a binational city by many who live and work on opposite sides of the border, and about a third of the citys population is Latino. During Trumps speech on Friday, some protesters outside the convention center scaled a barrier and lobbed water bottles at police. One man was pulled off the wall and arrested as others were surrounded by fellow protesters and backed away from the confrontation.  After the convention center emptied, clusters of Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators began to mix in the streets, many exchanging shouted epithets and some throwing water bottles at one another.  Police in riot gear declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse, herding the crowd out of the citys hotel and restaurant-filled Gaslamp Quarter. San Diego police said on Twitter that 35 arrests were made during the protest. No property damage or injuries were reported, police said.  Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally, Trump tweeted to police afterwards.  Trump has weathered months of blowback from all ends of the political spectrum for his immigration policy, which calls for the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants who reside in the United States. Critics have said his plan is needlessly cruel and impossible to implement. At Trumps campaign stops, attendees often chant build the wall. While Trump is running unopposed in the June 7 California Republican primary, his stance on border control and deportation seems unlikely to resonate with the electorate at large in a state where political fallout from a Republican-backed crackdown on illegal immigrants 20 years ago cost the party dearly.     Friday was not the first time Trump has been greeted by civil unrest in California, which is home to the largest Latino population in the country. Late last month, a visit to the California Republican convention set off days of protests in the area, leading to several arrests.  Shortly before taking the stage in San Diego, Trump issued a statement ruling out a one-on-one debate with second-place Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, who was also in California, killing off a potentially high-ratings television spectacle. The suggested debate, an idea first raised during a talk show appearance by the New York billionaire, would have sidelined likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but given Sanders a huge platform ahead of California Democratic primary.     A day after saying he would welcome a Sanders debate, Trump called the idea inappropriate, declaring that he should only face the Democrats final choice. I will wait to debate the first-place finisher in the Democratic Party, probably Crooked Hillary Clinton, Trump said in a statement. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, expressed disappointment on Friday, and sought to goad Trump into reconsidering. Well, Mr. Trump, what are you afraid of? he said in a video clip posted on ABC News Twitter account. Trump suggested broadcast networks were unwilling to go along with his demand that at least $10 million raised from the encounter be donated to charity. Id love to debate Bernie, he told a rally in Fresno, California. But the networks want to keep the money for themselves.     Sanders is trailing Clinton in the race to secure their partys nomination, but opinion polls show he is slicing into her lead in California. Clinton has shown no interest in debating Sanders before the California primary, which will be part of a final slate of nominating contests. It is possible she will clinch the nomination by winning New Jersey earlier that day, making the outcome in California superfluous.  The former U.S. secretary of state has said she is looking forward to debating Trump later this year ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. Clinton leads Trump by 4 percentage points in the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. Democrats nationally remain evenly split between Clinton and Sanders.     ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 ",1
U.S. deportation raids target Central American families: lawyers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials have kicked off a new round of raids intended to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children who have entered the country illegally, according to a legal group that works with the immigrants. Immigration enforcement officers as of Friday had arrested about 40 women and children encompassing at least 18 Central American family groups in Texas, North Carolina, South Dakota and possibly other states, said Laura Lichter, an immigration lawyer and a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Reuters reported on May 12 that the raids were planned for May and June and likely would be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year after similar raids in which 121 people were arrested over two days in January. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea declined to confirm that the new round of raids had begun but defended the administrations deportation operations as a whole. We stress that these operations are limited to those who were apprehended at the border after January 1, 2014, have been ordered removed by an immigration court, and have no pending appeal or pending claim for asylum, Elzea said. The immigrants arrested in the latest raids have been sent to two ICE detention centers in Texas, according to Belle Woods, a spokeswoman for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The deportation operations are intended to deter illegal immigration from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and curb crossings of the U.S.-Mexican border by Central Americans, U.S. officials have said. Lichter said ICE was not following its own policy in the raids. Its the same thing we saw in January. These people deserve asylum, but didnt get a proper chance to have their cases heard, Lichter said. The issue of illegal immigration has figured prominently in the U.S. presidential campaign, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump promising to deport all roughly 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. The White House on May 13 defended its deportation policy after complaints from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and congressional leaders that the sweep targeting Central American illegal immigrants is inhumane. Im against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities, Clinton said at the time. ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 ",1
Bathroom lawsuit could send transgender rights to Supreme Court,"(Reuters) - A lawsuit brought by Texas and other states against the Obama administrations policy on bathroom access may move the United States closer to a resolution on transgender rights by putting the issue on a trajectory for the Supreme Court. Conservative officials from 11 states sued the federal government on Wednesday to overturn a directive that transgender students be allowed to use the bathroom matching their gender identity instead of being forced to use one corresponding to gender assigned at birth. The governor of a 12th state, Mississippi, said he planned to join the lawsuit. The countrys high court has never ruled on a main question of the lawsuit: Do federal legal protections against sex discrimination apply to transgender people? The plaintiffs picked a path that could get them two quick wins in lower courts. The lawsuit is expected to be heard first by an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and if there is an appeal by a conservative federal appeals court covering Texas. If that appeals court ruled against the Obama administration, the Supreme Court may feel compelled to take up the matter because of a likely conflict with a ruling last month from a federal appeals court in Virginia. That ruling revived a transgender teens lawsuit against his school district.  The Supreme Court is more likely to agree to hear a case when there is a split among different federal appeals courts, and such a conflict does not yet exist on transgender rights.  The plaintiffs have accused the administration of President Barack Obama of overreaching its authority and said the U.S. Congress, or individual states, should set policy.  At least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  When lawmakers passed the education amendments, they did not consider that the law could one day be applied to gender identity, said Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. The (administrations) lawless interpretation ignores the will of Congress in enacting Title IX, Tedesco said. Its a clear case of federal overreach. The Obama administration has argued that the education amendments encompass discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status. It said in a letter to school districts this month that their access to federal money depended on their compliance. The states that sued have two paths to victory, Tedesco said: a ruling that the Obama administration did not follow proper procedure for making new regulations, which would leave the larger issue unsettled, or that its interpretation of Title IX is inconsistent with the law. Without clear guidance from the courts, the question of transgender rights would remain open to interpretation by federal agencies, meaning a future president could take the opposite view of Obama. The Republican-controlled Congress has the power to end the dispute immediately, either in favor of transgender rights or against them, but it has shown few signs of acting, especially with a Democrat, Obama, in the White House. A series of decisions suggests courts are coming around to a more expansive definition of sex discrimination, said Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders. Federal agencies clearly have the authority to interpret civil rights law when its application is unclear, she said. To characterize (the administrations position) as extraordinary or overreaching shows a complete misunderstanding of what these agencies do, Levi said. The states countered in their lawsuit that the federal agencies went beyond mere interpretation of civil rights law and in effect created new regulations that should have gone through a notice-and-comment procedure. A court could also find that the states lawsuit was premature because the Obama administration has not yet moved to cut off funding to any state or school district, said Arthur Leonard, a professor at New York Law School and an expert on LGBT law.

Senators want Obama to impose sanctions on Congo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators called on President Barack Obamas administration on Friday to impose targeted sanctions on officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo responsible for violence and rights violations amid rising political tensions. Hoping to increase pressure on the government of President Joseph Kabila, three of Obamas fellow Democrats, senators Richard Durbin, Edward Markey and Christopher Murphy, said on Friday they had introduced a Senate resolution this week calling on Kabilas government to fulfill its constitutional mandate for a democratic transition of power late this year. They called for targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, until Kabila publicly commits to a peaceful transition of power. Their action reflected growing international worry over the situation in the African nation. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday voiced concern about reports of rising political tension due to uncertainty about the presidential election.  Dozens of Kabila critics have been arrested since last year as part of what the United Nations and rights groups say is an escalating crackdown on political dissent ahead of a presidential election scheduled for November. Kabila is ineligible to stand for re-election after serving two elected terms, but opponents accuse him of trying to delay the poll to hold onto power. Congos highest court ruled last week that the president could stay in power if elections did not occur by the end of his mandate. On Thursday, a protester and a police officer were killed in Goma, in the eastern part of the country, during protests against a possible elections delay. The United Nations said dozens of people were arrested. Opposition leaders accuse Kabila of stalling the vote in order to extend his 15-year rule, which the president denies. Democratic congressional aides said they expected to add more co-sponsors for the resolution after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess on June 6. There is bipartisan support for U.S. action to address the situation.  Republican Senator Jeff Flake, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committees Africa subcommittee, told Reuters in a brief interview this week that he felt sanctions would be appropriate and had discussed them with U.S. State Department officials. Hopefully were together on this, Flake said. I think we will be. We just want to make sure that whatever we do, pushes in the right direction. ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 ",1
N.J. Governor Christie signs Atlantic City rescue package into law,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday signed into law a package of legislation that provides distressed gambling hub Atlantic City with immediate cash help but also a potential state takeover if the city cannot fix its finances. The bills will help reform the citys overblown municipal government while protecting state and local taxpayers, Christie said in a statement while continuing to take shots at local officials. We all agree that Atlantic Citys government has not demonstrated the competence to properly manage the peoples money without state guidance and oversight, he said.  The legislation embraces my demand that Atlantic City immediately account for every dollar it receives and spends, and triggers a series of strict conditions and rigorous requirements the city must meet immediately, Christie said. Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Friday, Guardian marked the opening of summer beach season for the seaside resort city. The bills provide a $60 million, six-month bridge loan from the state to the city and establish $120 million of payments annually from casinos in lieu of property taxes, a move aimed at stabilizing the citys volatile, eroded tax base. In return, the city must prepare a balanced budget for fiscal 2017, which begins Jan. 1, and a five-year recovery plan. If it falls short, the state can move to take over operations and throw out collective bargaining agreements, among other powers. The package could prove positive for the citys credit rating, which is deep in junk territory at Caa3, because it provides much-needed financial relief and removes the immediate threat of default or bankruptcy, Moodys Investors Service said after the governor announced his signature. But a bond restructuring, which Guardian has said the city will likely pursue, would be considered a default if it includes bondholder impairment, Moodys said. The city has about $240 million of bond debt outstanding. ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 ",1
"Trump tower in Canada close to sale, future of name in question","TORONTO (Reuters) - Torontos Trump tower is close to being sold, a lawyer for its owner said on Friday, adding that the buyer could choose to drop the name, which has become more controversial since billionaire Donald Trump became the presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee. The Trump organization disagreed, saying the building must continue to carry the name. Symon Zucker, who represents Talon International Development Inc, said the 65-story hotel and condominium tower in the citys financial district has found a potential buyer and the sale will conclude hopefully shortly. The building is operated for Talon by the Trump Hotel Collection, presided over by Trump and his children.  Zucker said the current contract with Trump Hotel is exclusive with Talon and that the new owner can if he wishes retain a different manager and change the name of the hotel. Zucker declined to comment on the potential new owners intentions or the specifics of the deal. Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten disagreed, saying the agreement is valid for another 16 years and calling Zuckers view 100 percent false. The managements agreement between Trump and the condos would remain in full force and effect, he said in an email. We are not going anywhere.  Garten said if the new owner wants to change the name of the tower, the Trump Organization would take swift and appropriate action to prevent it and hold them liable for damages. Talon Chairman Alex Shnaider has been trying to change the buildings name through arbitration, though the sale is unrelated to that effort, said Zucker, who called the sale a routine business decision. Alex is moving on to other deals, he said. This is just one more thing hes bought that hes going to sell. Zucker said the deal was done through the real estate firm CBRE, which declined to comment.  The luxury building has had problems, and the intersection around it has been closed several times due to falling or unstable glass. The tower is also the subject of a Canadian lawsuit against Trump and associates by disgruntled investors who say they were misled in their deals.  A judge ruled against the investors, and a Toronto court is scheduled to hear their appeal in June. Zucker called their case frivolous. ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 ",1
Illinois budget talks fizzle amid partisan entrenchment,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - Bipartisan talks to reach a fiscal 2017 budget for Illinois ahead of a Tuesday deadline have derailed as the states Republican governor and top Democrat refused to budge from their demands. The two sides have been at an impasse since last year, leaving Illinois as the only state without a complete budget for the fiscal year that ends on June 30. Bipartisan, rank-and-file working groups pushed by Governor Bruce Rauner have been meeting, with sporadic reports that progress was being made on a budget for the new fiscal year. But following a short meeting on Friday with the governor, legislative leaders made it clear that common ground has not been reached. Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno accused Democrats of pulling the plug on negotiations. They want to push the balanced budget issue reforms off into the fall, after the election, she told reporters. Its clear their priority is political and not for the good of the state. House Speaker Michael Madigan defended the budget passed by Democrats in his chamber this week, saying he is not willing to hold residents hostage while the governor expands his demands for pro-business and anti-union reforms. There will be a complaint the state does not have sufficient money to pay for that budget, Madigan said. And Ive said for the last year and a half, Im prepared to negotiate with the governor to find the money to pay for those services. House Republicans blasted the $14.1 billion general funds budget passed on Wednesday and again on Thursday by Democrats as being $7.2 billion short on revenue because the spending plan does not include big costs like pensions and debt payments. Madigan, who has advocated a so-called millionaires tax, said his first revenue choice would be taxing the wealthy through exclusions and deductions in the Illinois income tax code, including the earned income tax credit. Rauner contended negotiations were continuing. But he warned that the fifth-largest U.S. state must stop spending money it does not have.  Well never have balanced budgets if we dont grow our economy and we need reforms to grow our economy, get more jobs and higher family incomes, he said.  House Republicans pleaded with Democrats during Fridays session to break with Madigan and continue to work with them. My request is that you dont give up, said House Republican Jim Durkin, who added that a deal was close. ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 ",1
Trump's pro-oil agenda poses dilemma for North Dakota's Indians,"TRENTON, N.D. (Reuters) - When Donald Trump laid out his plan this week to roll back U.S. environmental regulations to boost the ailing energy industry, it raised both the hopes and fears of the American Indians living near the heart of the countrys richest oil fields. The Republican presidential contenders agenda, laid out at an oil industry conference on Thursday in North Dakota, could bring desperately needed jobs to depressed communities that have come to depend on the oil drilling industry, but could also trigger worse pollution of Indian lands.  We would like to see more drilling, said Gene McCowan, human resources director for the Trenton Indian Service Area, which governs the six counties in North Dakota and Montana where 2,600 Turtle Mountain Chippewa live.  But we are caught in a bind because people are concerned about fracking and how that will affect the earth and water, he said. The dilemma facing North Dakotas American Indians represents the broader tensions at play in the U.S. presidential election between jobs and the environment, as Trump and his likely Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, clash over energy and climate change.  Trump on Thursday announced to a cheering crowd of roughly 7,700 people that he would sweep away initiatives by President Barack Obama to curb U.S. emissions and protect waterways from pollution, as ways to revive drilling and coal mining sectors that are in the middle of a steep downturn.  Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, have advocated a sharp move away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources to cut pollution and slow climate change. The split is felt sharply by the Chippewa, people who have been hard hit by both the global oil market crash since 2014, as well as the environmental impacts of the preceding drilling boom that spread drillpads and pipelines across the landscape. Twenty percent of our people have been laid off or seen cuts in salaries and its going to get worse, McCowan said, adding that he will likely support Trump as the best hope of reversing the crisis. Trenton is 14 miles southwest of oil boom town Williston. Until a year or so ago, locals were making $25-$30 an hour. Now, McCowan said, the number of people needing food stamps has risen 40 percent. Residents said Democratic candidate Sanders has the most to say about income inequality and Native Americans issues, but is also most likely to curb fossil fuel development, depriving people of what they see as their economic lifeline.  Trump could be a hard pill to swallow for other reasons, other Native Americans in North Dakota said. Ahead of his speech on Thursday, Nicole Robertson, a 41-year-old Cree Indian and communications strategist for the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara nations - known as the Three Affiliated Tribes - tried to ask Trump if he would recognize tribal sovereignty when it comes to land where oil is produced.Trump said he would have to look into it.  She later interrupted Trump when he launched an attack on Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, repeatedly calling her Pocahantas - a reference to her claim she is part Native American. Robertson shouted out that his comments were very offensive, interrupting his news conference. She said afterward that she felt it was important that Native Americans be consulted on oil policy, both because of its economic importance and its environmental impacts. A lot of opportunities have come with the boom in the Bakken region in North Dakota, she said. But we as indigenous people are original land stewards. Its in our genes. She did not say who she would vote for in the election.  AmericanIndians make up around 5 percent of North Dakotas population. Kenneth Hall, a tribal councilman for the Three Affiliated Tribes, said he was also rankled by Trumps speech - even though it promised a much-needed economic revival. We werent even mentioned by Mr. Trump ... and nearly a quarter of oil production in the state comes out of our reservation lands, he said. He said the tribes requested a meeting with Trump ahead of his energy speech but that Trumps team did not respond. ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 ",1
"Trump, Sanders explore staging unusual presidential debate","BISMARCK, N.D. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders on Thursday explored staging an unconventional U.S. presidential debate  that would sideline Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and create a television spectacle that could attract huge ratings. The two men - a billionaire and a democratic socialist - expressed interest in a one-on-one encounter in California even though Republican and Democratic presidential candidates traditionally do not debate each other until the parties have selected their nominees. Id love to debate Bernie, Trump told reporters in North Dakota, after he secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. I think it would get very high ratings. It would be in a big arena. Basking in his newly sealed nomination at a later campaign rally in Billings, Montana, Trump said he expected to put 15 states in play in the general election, compared with three or four for a traditional Republican. He named California, Washington and Michigan among others.  Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email there were no formal plans yet for a debate. But Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN there had been a few discussions between the campaigns about the details.         We hope that he will not chicken out, Weaver said. We hope Donald Trump has the courage to get on stage now that he said he would.     Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is running far behind Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  But a nationally televised debate with the presumptive Republican nominee would be a big boost to his chances in the California primary on June 7, when Clinton is likely to clinch the nomination.         Trump said a debate with Sanders could raise up to $15 million for charity. Id love to debate Bernie, but theyll have to pay a lot of money for it, he said. The idea was hatched during an appearance by Trump on ABCs Jimmy Kimmel Live late on Wednesday. Kimmel said he asked Trump about the debate at the suggestion of Sanders. Game on, Sanders tweeted. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary. Sanders himself appeared on Thursday night on the talk show, where he said Kimmel made it possible for a very interesting debate between two guys who look at the world very, very differently. Sanders added that the goal would be to have the debate in a stadium in California. He then had a warning for Trump.  If I become the Democratic presidential nomination, he said, were going to beat him and beat him bad. Clinton, who backed out of an agreement to debate Sanders before the California vote, said she did not think a Trump-Sanders showdown would happen. This doesnt sound like a serious discussion. Im looking forward to debating Donald Trump in the general election. I really cant wait to get on the stage with him, she told CNN in a phone interview. A Fox News spokeswoman confirmed the network was trying to host a forum with Trump and Sanders. Representatives from other networks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. If it does come to pass, it would generate enormous ratings, said Alan Schroeder, a Northeastern University professor who has written extensively about presidential debates. They are from two different planets. You have a real personality contrast. It would dominate media coverage. Sanders, who has promised to continue his campaign through the Democratic nominating convention in July, has said he will do everything he can to ensure that Trump does not win the White House.         Smart and bold move by Sanders, Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said. The Clinton people are furious but Bernie wins points for being so aggressive. Clinton has tried to woo Sanders supporters as she turns her attention to the general election. But some Democrats worry his supporters - who are largely young, working-class and disillusioned with the Democratic Party establishment - will turn instead to political neophyte Trump, who has championed a populist agenda.     The debate would give Trump a national forum to criticize Clinton and try to win over Sanders supporters ahead of an expected Trump-Clinton general election contest, Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said. I think Sanders should think long and hard about giving Trump a forum, Kofinis said. It crosses a line, but apparently in this election there is no line.           Dale Ranney, 62, a Trump volunteer who has been to 21 of his rallies, said she would be delighted to see Trump and Sanders debate. I think its a great idea, any time you can get more information to the people, absolutely, Ranney said. Having Trump debate a socialist? Absolutely. Go for it.    ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 ",1
Trump vows to undo Obama's climate agenda in appeal to oil sector,"BISMARCK, N.D. (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, promised on Thursday to roll back some of Americas most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he said would revive the ailing U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security. Among the proposals, Trump said he would pull the United States out of the U.N. global climate accord, approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and rescind measures by President Barack Obama to cut U.S. emissions and protect waterways from industrial pollution. Any regulation thats outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers or contrary to the national interest will be scrapped and scrapped completely, Trump told about 7,700 people at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismarck, the capital of oil-rich North Dakota. Were going to do all this while taking proper regard for rational environmental concerns.   It was Trumps first speech detailing the energy policies he would advance if elected president. He received loud applause from the crowd of oil executives. The comments painted a stark contrast between the New York billionaire and his Democratic rivals for the White House, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who advocate a sharp turn away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy technologies to combat climate change. Trump slammed both rivals in his speech, saying their policies would kill jobs and force the United States to be begging for oil again from Middle East producers.  Its not going to happen. Not with me, he said. Trumps comments drew quick criticism from environmental advocates, who called his proposals frightening. Trumps energy policies would accelerate climate change, protect corporate polluters who profit from poisoning our air and water, and block the transition to clean energy that is necessary to strengthen our economy and protect our climate and health, said Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist. But industry executives cheered the stance. Its simple. If Trump wins, oil field workers will be happy. If Clinton wins, oil workers will be unhappy, said Derrick Alexander, an operations manager at oilfield services firm Integrated Productions Services. Trump hit Clinton hard in his speech, saying the former secretary of state would be more aggressive than Obama on regulations. He repeated several times Clintons March comments that her policies would put coal miners out of work. Hillary Clintons agenda is job destruction, Trump said. Trump said slashing regulation would help the United States achieve energy independence and reduce Americas reliance on Middle Eastern producers. Imagine a world in which oil cartels will no longer use energy as a weapon, he said. The United States currently produces about 55 percent of the oil it uses, with another quarter of the total coming from Canada and Mexico, and less than 20 percent coming from OPEC, according to U.S. Energy Department statistics. Trumps advisers, including U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, have said they suggested Trump examine the role of OPEC in the global oil price slump since 2014, which has contributed to the demise of a handful of smaller U.S. oil companies. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have declined to cut production to support prices.          Until Thursday, Trump had been short on details of his energy policy. He has said he believes global warming is a hoax, that his administration would revive the U.S. coal industry, and that he supports hydraulic fracturing - an environmentally controversial drilling technique that has triggered a boom in U.S. production. Earlier this month, he told Reuters in an interview that he would renegotiate at a minimum the U.N. global climate accord agreed by 195 countries in Paris last December, saying he viewed the deal as bad for U.S. business. He took that a step further in North Dakota. Were going to cancel the Paris climate agreement, he said. Trump also promised he would invite Canadian pipeline company TransCanada (TRP.TO) to reapply to build the Keystone XL pipeline into the United States, reversing a decision by Obama to block the project over environmental concerns. I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits, Trump said. Thats how were going to make our country rich again. Trumps pledge briefly sent TransCanadas shares 29 Canadian cents higher to C$54.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, but the stock quickly leveled back off and close up 2 Canadian cents at C$53.86. In response to Trumps promise that he would seek more profits from the pipeline, TransCanada spokesman James Millar noted the project would create jobs, offer major contracts to U.S. suppliers and provide tens of millions in taxes for state coffers.  The pipeline will benefit American workers longer term as the companies they work for have signed contracts to ship and refine oil through Keystone XL, Millar said in an email.

Clinton says she understands U.S. voter concerns about emails report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Thursday she was confident voters would make the right decision despite concerns over findings by an internal government watchdog that her use of a private email server while secretary of state broke government rules. I know people have concerns about this, I understand that, Clinton said in an interview broadcast on MSNBC, referring to the findings by the State Department inspector general in a report made public on Wednesday. The email controversy and a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into whether laws were broken as a result of Clintons use of a server kept in her New York home have overshadowed the Democratic front-runners campaign. The report concluded that Clinton would not have been allowed to use the server in her home had she asked the department officials in charge of information security. Clinton said voters would look at the full picture of what she had to offer and the full threat that Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, posed to the country. And I have confidence that they are going to be making the right decision. Asked whether an FBI interview with her has been scheduled, she said: No, its not, but I have offered since last August and I am looking forward to see this matter wrapped up. She said it was up to them whether to conduct the interview before the fall campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Reiterating that the email arrangement was a mistake, Clinton said: I think the report has been consistent with what I have been saying, that the use of personal email was a practice by other secretaries of state and the rules were not clarified until after I had left.

Push to expand FBI surveillance authority threatens U.S. email privacy bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An effort in the U.S. Senate to expand the Federal Bureau of Investigations authority to use a secretive surveillance order has delayed a vote on a popular email privacy bill, casting further doubt on whether the legislation will become law this year. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday postponed consideration of a measure that would require government authorities to obtain a search warrant before asking technology companies, such as Microsoft  and Alphabet Incs Google , to hand over old emails. A version of the Senate bill unanimously passed the House last month. Currently, federal agencies do not need a warrant to access emails or other digital communications more than 180 days old due to a provision in a 1986 law that considers them abandoned by the owner.  But Republican party senators offered amendments Thursday that privacy advocates argued contravened the purpose of the underlying bill and would likely sink its chances of becoming law. Those amendments include one by Senator John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the Senate, that would broaden the FBIs authority to deploy an administrative subpoena known as a National Security Letter to include electronic communications transaction records such as the times tamps of emails and their senders and recipients. Senators Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee, the Democratic and Republican authors of the email privacy bill, agreed to postpone the vote to give time to lawmakers to review the amendments and other provisions of the bill that have prompted disagreement.  NSLs do not require a warrant and are almost always accompanied by a gag order preventing the service provider from sharing the request with a targeted user.  The letters have existed since the 1970s, though the scope and frequency of their use expanded greatly after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.  In 2015 requests for customer records via NSLs increased nearly 50 percent to 48,642 requests, up from 33,024 in 2014, according to a U.S. government transparency report. The Obama administration has for years lobbied for a change to how NSLs can be used, after a 2008 legal memo from the Justice Department said the law limits them largely to phone billing records. FBI Director James Comey has said the change needed essentially corrects a typo. The Senate Intelligence Committee this week passed a bill to fund the U.S. intelligence community that contains a similar provision that would allow NSLs to be used to gather email records.  Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, voted against the proposal and said it takes a hatchet to important protections for Americans liberty. ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 ",1
Vietnam restricted access to Facebook during Obama visit: activists,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Vietnamese government restricted access to Facebook Inc inside Vietnam for several days this week as part of a broader crackdown on human rights and political dissidents during a visit by President Barack Obama, two activist organizations said on Thursday.  Officials of Access Now, a digital rights organization, and Viet Tan, a Vietnamese pro-democracy group, said the social media site was restricted and at times blocked inside Vietnam from Sunday to Wednesday, citing reports from people inside the country on Twitter and to Access Nows digital security help service.  The move coincides with a trend toward restrictions on Facebook in countries including China, Uganda and Turkey during politically sensitive times as the 1.6 billion-person social network grows more powerful.  Obamas three-day visit to Vietnam ended on Wednesday. Obama largely focused on normalizing relations with Vietnam. But he also promoted human rights and chided Vietnam about restrictions on political freedoms after critics of its communist-run government were prevented from meeting him. The Facebook shutdown was part of a stepped-up campaign by the Vietnamese government to limit use of the social network for political protests, activists said in phone interviews.  Facebook was blocked several times earlier this month as street protests erupted over an environmental disaster that resulted in mass fish deaths, the two groups said. The social media site was also unavailable inside Vietnam ahead of parliamentary elections on Sunday as pro-democracy activists called for a boycott, members of the two groups said. Facebook declined to comment. Vietnamese government officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted via a government website.  Ugandas government blocked Facebook and Twitter Inc in February during presidential elections. In March, after a deadly bombing in Turkey, an Ankara court ordered a ban on access to Facebook and Twitter. And during the 2011 Arab Spring in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, social networks were repeatedly shut down.  Facebook is often shut down in Vietnam during politically sensitive times, Angelina Huynh, advocacy director for Viet Tan, which has members around the world, including in Vietnam, said in a phone interview.  People were using Facebook to call for protests. They did not want people to take to the streets, Huynh said.  ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 ",1
California mayors ask for governor's support for highway cameras after shootings,"(Reuters) - Five mayors in northern California on Thursday asked Governor Jerry Brown in a letter to have surveillance cameras installed on state highways in the area after a string of shootings that have gripped their communities.   The request came two days after a man was shot in the leg while traveling eastbound on I-80 in Hercules, California, the 28th such shooting on the state highway system east of San Francisco during the last six months, authorities said.   This is of increasing concern to our elected officials and residents who feel as if our communities are under siege, said the letter signed by the mayors of Pinole, Richmond and Hercules. The mayors of San Pablo and El Cerrito also signed the letter.  Since November 2015, four people have been killed and 12 wounded in shootings that authorities believe are largely gang related, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement. Local and state law enforcement agencies began targeting known gang members and increased patrols since the shootings began along the freeways, the patrol said.         The mayors asked Brown to support funding for the installation of surveillance cameras with recording capabilities on area freeway ramps and upgrades to current traffic cameras so they would be able to capture and retain images that could be used during investigations.  The mayors wrote the situation is a grave and growing risk  in their communities where freeways have become a battleground. Officials in Browns office were not immediately available for comment. San Pablo Mayor Rich Kinney said in an email to Reuters that the mayors, state transportation officials and governor staff are scheduled to meet to discuss the letter on June 6.  The California Highway Patrol said five suspects have been arrested in connection with the string of shootings, some of whom may have been involved in more than one incident.

Push for encryption law falters despite Apple case spotlight,"WASHINGTON/ SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - After a rampage that left 14 people dead in San Bernardino, key U.S. lawmakers pledged to seek a law requiring technology companies to give law enforcement agencies a back door to encrypted communications and electronic devices, such as the iPhone used by one of the shooters. Now, only months later, much of the support is gone, and the push for legislation dead, according to sources in congressional offices, the administration and the tech sector.  Draft legislation that Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Intelligence Committee, had circulated weeks ago likely will not be introduced this year and, even if it were, would stand no chance of advancing, the sources said. Key among the problems was the lack of White House support for legislation in spite of a high-profile court showdown between the Justice Department and Apple Inc over the suspect iPhone, according to Congressional and Obama Administration officials and outside observers. Theyve dropped anchor and taken down the sail, former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden said. For years, the Justice Department lobbied unsuccessfully for a way to unmask suspects who go dark, or evade detection through coded communications in locked devices. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation took Apple to court in February to try to open the iPhone in its investigation of the San Bernardino slayings, the cause gained traction in Washington. The political landscape had shifted - or so it seemed. The short life of the push for legislation illustrates the intractable nature of the debate over digital surveillance and encryption, which has been raging in one form or another since the 1990s. Tech companies, backed by civil liberties groups, insist that building law enforcement access into phones and other devices would undermine security for everyone-including the U.S. government itself. Law enforcement agencies maintain they need a way to monitor  phone calls, emails and text messages, along with access to encrypted data. Polls show the public is split on whether the government should have access to all digital data. The legal battle between the FBI and Apple briefly united many around the idea that Congress - not the courts - should decide the issue. But the consensus was fleeting. Feinsteins Democratic colleagues on the Intelligence Committee - along with some key Republicans - backed away. The House never got on board. The CIA and NSA were ambivalent, according to several current and former intelligence officials, in part because officials in the agencies feared any new law would interfere with their own encryption efforts. Even supporters worried that if a bill were introduced but failed, it would give Apple and other tech companies another weapon to use in future court battles. Burr had said repeatedly that legislation was imminent.  But last week, he and Feinstein told Reuters there was no timeline for the bill. Feinstein said she planned to talk to more tech stakeholders, and Burr said, be patient. In the meantime, tech companies have accelerated encryption efforts in the wake of the Apple case. The court showdown ended with a whimper when the FBI said it had found a way to get into the phone, and subsequently conceded privately it had found nothing of value. A week after the San Bernardino attack, Burr told Reuters passing encryption legislation was urgent because if we dont, we will be reading about terrorist attacks on a more frequent basis. FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee soon after that encryption was overwhelmingly affecting the investigation of murders, drug trafficking and child pornography. A week later, the Justice Department persuaded a judge to issue a sweeping order demanding Apple write software to open an iPhone used by San Bernardino suspect Sayeed Farook, who died in a shootout with law enforcement. Apple fought back, arguing, among other things, that only Congressional legislation could authorize what the court was demanding. Many saw the Justice Departments move as a way to bring pressure on Congress to act. President Obama appeared to tacitly support Comeys court fight and the idea that there should be limits on criminal suspects ability to hide behind encryption. But even as the drive for legislation seemed to be gaining momentum, consensus was dissipating. Senator Lindsey Graham, an influential Republican, withdrew  support in a sudden about-face. I was all with you until I actually started getting briefed by the people in the intel community, Graham told Attorney General Loretta Lynch during a hearing in March. Im a person thats been moved by the arguments of the precedent we set and the damage we may be doing to our own national security. On the Democratic side, Senator Ron Wyden vowed to filibuster what he called a dangerous proposal, that would leave Americans more vulnerable to stalkers, identity thieves, foreign hackers and criminals.  Senator Mark Warner advanced a competing bill to form a commission to study the issue.  A half dozen people familiar with the White House deliberations said they were hamstrung by a long-standing split within the Obama Administration, pitting Comey and the DOJ against technology advisors and other agencies including the Commerce and State Departments.[L2N16C1UC] They also said there was reluctance to take on the tech industry in an election year.

Ohio appeals U.S. court decision in favor of early voting,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The state of Ohio filed a federal court appeal on Thursday seeking to restore a Republican-backed limit on early voting and accelerated voter-registration measures that were seen by civil rights groups as boosting minority turnout. U.S. District Judge Michael Watson in Columbus ruled on Tuesday that Ohio violated voters rights by reducing the period that ballots could be cast before an election to four weeks   from five weeks. Watsons decision also struck down Ohios elimination of a seven-day window during which residents could both register to vote and cast their ballots all in the same week - a period known as Golden Week. Ohios Republican-controlled legislature abolished Golden Week and shortened early voting by seven days in 2014, drawing a legal challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Watson sided with the ACLU and NAACP in finding that both changes, which critics said directly limited opportunities for minority participation in elections, violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and were unconstitutional. On Thursday, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, petitioned the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review Watsons decision, which he said scrapped a court-approved settlement the state previously reached with the ACLU and NAACP on early voting. The settlement allowed voters to cast ballots on multiple Sundays leading up to a presidential election and provided for additional evening voting hours, according to ACLU documents. Husted said Golden Week had become an administrative problem for state elections officials and increased the potential for voter fraud, arguing its elimination had broad bipartisan support. The Ohio Democratic Party countered with a statement accusing Republican state officials of defending a law that clear data showed imposed a stark discriminatory impact on Ohios African-American voters. The appeal came a day after the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation that would require any resident or organization to post a cash bond with a local court in order to keep polling stations open later than scheduled on election day. Judges in Ohio have on occasion ordered some polls to extend their hours because of voting equipment problems, major traffic issues and severe weather, including during the 2016 primaries. Opponents of the bill have said it violates the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which expressly prohibits the imposition of a poll tax. ",politicsNews,"May 27, 2016 ",1

Flap in Congress over gender identity sinks spending bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The rancorous political debate over sexual identity unexpectedly prompted the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to reject an energy and water spending bill on Thursday after Democrats attached an amendment to protect the rights of transgender people. The legislation, which would provide funds for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, failed on a 112-305 vote, with 130 Republicans and 175 Democrats opposing the legislation. The outcome was such a surprise that the House Appropriations Committee initially announced the bill had passed and was forced to retract the statement.  Democrats blamed Republicans for opposing a Democratic amendment to bar federal contractors from government work if they discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Democrats failed to attach the same measure to a separate House spending bill last week. In turning against a far-reaching funding bill simply because it affirms protections for LGBT Americans, Republicans have once again lain bare the depths of their bigotry, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. But Republicans accused Democrats of working to sabotage the House appropriations process by voting 6-175 against the bill after they had succeeded in amending it. House Speaker Paul Ryan said his own decision not to keep legislation under tight control had created conditions for more amendments from both sides of the aisle ... and, yes, more unpredictability.   Thats what happened here today. Its unfortunate, because this is a very good bill, Ryan said. He vowed to continue pushing the energy and water bill, along with other appropriations measures. Democrats said they opposed two Republican amendments. One would prevent Washington from witholding federal funds from North Carolina over its law on LGBT bathroom use. The other would have stopped the Democrats LGBT amendment from affecting religious workplace exemptions. The White House had already threatened to veto the legislation over other provisions that Democrats said would undermine the Clean Water Act.  ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 ",1
Mississippi governor to join suit against Obama transgender policy,"(Reuters) - Mississippis Republican governor said on Thursday he planned to join a lawsuit by officials from 11 states to overturn an Obama administration directive that tells schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity. The lawsuit led by Texas, the most significant legal challenge to this months directive, said the federal government and Obama administration officials overreached their authority by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states. Our office has talked to the Texas attorney generals office and I intend, as soon as possible, to join the lawsuit against this latest example of federal overreach, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement. As with some of the other states, Mississippis governor and attorney general disagree on the suit, which challenges the administrations interpretation that federal civil rights laws against sex discrimination should apply to transgender people. Mississippis attorney general, Democrat Jim Hood, declined to participate in the lawsuit, according to Clay Chandler, a spokesman for the governor. Chandler said Bryant will work with an attorney in the governors office in joining the lawsuit. Hoods office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obamas administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority. Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizonas Department of Education and Maines governor. The lawsuit said the administration conspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights. Transgender rights advocates criticized the suit as a malicious attack, saying there have never been public safety incidents or invasions of privacy related toprotections for transgender people. While the department will review the complaint, the federal government has strong legal foundations to uphold the civil rights of transgender Americans, the Justice Department said in a statement on Wednesday.

"Sanders may debate Trump, not Clinton, before California contest","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An unconventional debate between a billionaire Republican and a democratic socialist is shaping up in California after presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders expressed an interest in squaring off against each other. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is still in a primary battle against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, while Trump effectively clinched the Republican Partys nomination earlier this month when his two remaining rivals dropped out. In an appearance on ABCs Jimmy Kimmel Live late Wednesday, Trump said he was willing to participate in such an event against Sanders. If I debated him, we would have such high ratings, the New York developer and reality television star said. I think I should ... take that money and give it to some worthy charity. Sanders appeared to agree in a post on Twitter on Thursday. Game on, he tweeted. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary. Trump and Sanders have gone through a series of debates against rivals within their parties but Republican and Democratic presidential candidates usually do not debate each other until the parties have selected a nominee. The hashtag #BernieTrumpDebate began trending in the United States with news of the possible debate. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email to Reuters on Thursday there were no formal plans yet for such an event. Representatives for the Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kimmel said he asked Trump about the debate at the suggestion of Sanders, who is scheduled to appear on the show Thursday night. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who was elected to Congress as an independent and has made economic equality a keystone of his campaign, had first challenged Clinton to a California debate. He said he was disappointed when the former secretary of state declined. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to a possible Trump-Sanders debate. Clinton has tried to woo Sanders supporters as she works to secure the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. But some worry his supporters - who are largely young, working-class and disillusioned with party establishment - will turn instead to political neophyte Trump, who has championed a populist agenda. Sanders has said he will do everything he can to ensure that Trump does not win the White House. ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 ",1

Oops! Senator's article tells of phantom meeting with Obama nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch wrote in an opinion piece published on Thursday that his meeting with Merrick Garland failed to change his view that the Senate should not act on President Barack Obamas U.S. Supreme Court nominee. The problem is that no such meeting had yet taken place. Later in the day, the Utah senator issued a statement announcing that he would meet with Garland on Thursday, calling the appeals court judge an honorable public servant who deserves our respect but reiterating that the Senate should not act now. Paul Edwards, executive editor of the Deseret News in Hatchs home state of Utah, said by email the article was a draft that was mistakenly published on newspapers website, and apologized to Hatch and the newspapers readers for this unfortunate error. Like many of my Senate colleagues, I recently met with Chief Judge Merrick Garland, Hatch wrote in the piece. Our meeting, however, does not change my conviction that the Senate should consider a Supreme Court nominee after this presidential election cycle, Hatch added. The 82-year-old Hatch, first elected to the Senate in 1976, is the longest-serving Senate Republican and is a long-time and influential member of the Judiciary Committee that considers Supreme Court nominees. Hatch has joined with the Senates Republican leaders in asserting that Obamas successor, to be determined in the Nov. 8 presidential election, should fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February. Democrats have accused Senate Republicans of ignoring their constitutional duties by refusing to consider Garlands nomination. A copy of the article was archived by Google after the Deseret News removed it. The electronic publication of this version, awaiting edits from the Senator following his meeting with Judge Garland, was inadvertent, Edwards added. The article illustrated how unshakeable Republican opposition has been to Obama, a Democrat, appointing a replacement for Scalia. If a Democratic president appoints Scalias replacement, that would likely end decades of a conservative majority on the court. Obama nominated Garland on March 16. Hatch helped break a partisan log jam in the Senate against Garland two decades ago when President Bill Clinton nominated him to an appeals court. Garland won Senate confirmation in 1997.

South Carolina governor to sign ban on abortion past 19 weeks,"CHARLESTON, South Carolina (Reuters) - Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley on Wednesday signed into law a bill banning most abortions after 19 weeks of pregnancy unless the mothers life is at risk, a spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.  The South Carolina legislature passed the bill last week, making it the 17th U.S. state to approve such a ban. A signing ceremony will take place on a date to be announced later, said Haley representative Chaney Adams.  The act, proposed last year in South Carolinas Republican-controlled legislature, passed after it was stripped of exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest. The law allows abortions at the 20-week mark if the pregnancy endangers a mothers life. It also includes a second exception if severe fatal abnormalities will mean the fetus would definitely die at full-term birth.  Sixteen other states have passed similar laws as conservatives have chipped away at the U.S. Supreme Courts landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion. Courts have overturned the bans in three states. I believe that life begins at conception and every step we can take to get back to that point is important, the bills sponsor, Republican Representative Wendy Nanney, told Reuters. In my view and many others, its inhumane to subject that baby to pain at 20 weeks. Critics have said the name of the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act goes against medical evidence showing that a fetus at 20 weeks cannot feel pain. The law also removes necessary medical options in the extremely rare instance that an abortion is recommended after 19 weeks, critics said.  We are incredibly disappointed in Governor Haley for signing HB 3114 into law today, Jenny Black, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement on Wednesday. This dangerous and politically-motivated measure bans abortion after 20 weeks with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest, and no consideration for a womans individual circumstances.

"Obama: Trump displays ignorance, seeks tweets over solutions","ISE-SHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama disparaged U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying the billionaire seeks tweets over solutions and has rattled  foreign leaders with his pronouncements. Obama accused the real estate mogul and former reality TV impresario of making cavalier comments for provocative effect, and he urged all presidential candidates to take the high road in a boisterous and harsh campaign. Weighing in on the race to succeed him with his strongest broadside yet against Trump, Obama said fellow leaders from the Group of Seven nations are surprised by the Republican nominee. They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements but they are rattled by them, the president told a news conference on the sidelines of a G7 summit in central Japan. For good reason, because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines, instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe, secure and prosperous and the world on an even keel.  Many U.S. allies fear Trump will feed insecurity in countries worried about Chinas growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obamas pivot to the Asia-Pacific.  Trump has also been accused of racism and bigotry for saying he would build a wall to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants and would temporarily ban Muslims from the United States. He has also made comments considered demeaning to women. The race between Trump on the one hand and the Democratic candidates, front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Senator Bernie Sanders, for the Nov. 8 election has become increasingly bitter and personal. Trump this week took his use of accusations against Clinton to levels unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential campaigns, making incendiary statements that television networks cannot resist covering, giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive. Obama said it was natural for journalists in such a campaign to elevate every roll, blink, speed bump, conflict, trash talkin, but urged, instead, that candidates from both sides  stick to the issues. Grumpiness arises where folks feel that were not talking about issues but personalities or character.  Obama, a Democrat, issued his most extensive analysis to date of his own partys race, while refusing to take sides. He rejected a suggestion that beating Trump would get more difficult as the two parties conventions approach in July, a period when the Democratic victor can focus on fighting Trump instead of the fellow Democrat, adding that the Democrat battle was tough. Arguing against your friends is more draining than arguing against political opponents, Obama said. He said there were no big ideological differences between Clinton, an establishment candidate who is a former First Lady and senator, and Sanders, a firebrand populist who identifies as a Democratic Socialist. The president said it was important that the race eventually end in a way that leaves both sides feeling proud of what theyve done. ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 ",1
No masking Trump's popularity at Chinese Partytime Factory,"JINHUA, China (Reuters) - Theres no masking the facts. One Chinese factory is expecting Donald Trump to beat his likely U.S. presidential rival Hillary Clinton in the popularity stakes. At the Jinhua Partytime Latex Art and Crafts Factory, a Halloween and party supply business that produces thousands of rubber and plastic masks of everyone from Osama bin Laden to Spider-Man, masks of Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton faces are being churned out. Sales of the two presidential candidates are at about half a million each but the factory management believes Trump will eventually run out the winner. Even though the sales are more or less the same, I think in 2016 this mask will completely sell out, said factory manager Jacky Chen, indicating a Trump mask. The firm was already beginning to stockpile the Republican candidates mask, he said. Just like with the sales of the $4-$5 masks, Trump is now running nearly even with Clinton among likely U.S. voters ahead of the November election, a Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 11 showed.  That is a big turnaround for the real estate billionaire once considered a fringe figure in the race, but now the Republican partys presumptive presidential nominee. Trump has been less than positive in his comments about China, asserting that the worlds number two economy had waged economic war against the United States, and used crafty business practices to steal American jobs. China has largely refrained from responding to Trumps barbs, but Finance Minister Lou Jiwei described him as an irrational type in an interview in April. Such issues are far removed from the Trump mask production line at the factory in Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai. Asked if he knew whose face he was making, 43-year-old worker Liu Dahua told reporters: Its the president of the U.S., right?

Obama says expects Taliban to continue strategy of violence under new leader,"ISE-SHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Thursday he expects the Taliban to continue a strategy of violence following the appointment of a hardline leader, adding that the United States aims to uphold Afghanistans fragile democratization and prevent its use as a base by Islamic State.   This continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan, said Obama, told reporters during a Group of Seven summit at Ise-Shima in central Japan. In the short-term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and blowing up innocent people.  Our goal right now is to make sure (Afghanistans) constitution and democratic process is upheld (and) maintain the counter-terrorism platforms that we need in the region so that al Qaeda and now ISIL are not able to take root and use it as a base to attack us in the United States, he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. The selection of cleric Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada as the new Taliban chief on Wednesday all but dashes Obamas hopes for opening peace talks before he leaves office, one of his top foreign policy goals, current and former U.S. defense and intelligence officials said. Akhundzada, a conservative Islamic scholar from the Talibans stronghold in southern Afghanistan, succeeded Mullah Akhtar Mansour four days after he was killed in a U.S. drone strike.  Some U.S. officials had expressed hope that Mansours death would eliminate an obstacle to peace negotiations between the Taliban and the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

Ohio legislature votes to allow limited medical marijuana use,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Ohio on Wednesday approved legislation that would legalize marijuana use for medical purposes under certain circumstances, less than a year after recreational marijuana use was soundly defeated by Ohio voters.   The bill, approved by both chambers of the states Republican-led legislature, heads to Republican Governor John Kasich for his signature as his office said on Wednesday that he will review the bill. During the last few years, state legislatures and voters in the United States have been much more receptive to making the use of marijuana legal for medical purposes than for recreational use.  Some 24 states and Washington D.C. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use while only a handful of states allow for recreational use. It remains illegal on the federal level.  The Ohio legislation is more limiting than some in that it only allows patients with specific medical conditions to use an oil, edible, tincture or vapor form of marijuana prescribed by a physician licensed in the state, starting in 2017.  This bill is not perfect, but its what Ohio patients need, Ohio Senator Kenny Yuko, a Democrat, said before his house approved the bill.  Marijuana is not a gateway drug, but a gateway off drugs. Medical marijuana users would not be allowed to smoke or grow their own marijuana under the measure, which also would  create a commission responsible for regulating and licensing of all operations of the drug. In November, Ohio voters soundly rejected a measure that would have made it the first U.S. Midwestern state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Lawmakers from both parties voted for and against the bill on Wednesday. Some opponents of the measure have said that the qualifying list of medical conditions is too limited.  The measure was fast-tracked to head off a possible less-restrictive medical marijuana ballot initiative in November.

Trump told staffers and supporters gathered backstage before a campaign rally in California on Wednesday that political director Rick Wiley should be fired for his handling of a fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee, according to the sources.  The RNC fundraising agreement included 11 states but not Nevada, where Republicans in the state are angling for key victories in the November elections. Three sources confirmed Trump said Wiley should be fired after Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald told Trump that Wiley was responsible for leaving Nevada out of the deal. McDonald did not return calls seeking comment. Wiley did not respond to emails, text messages and phone calls seeking comment. The move is the latest in a tug of war between Trumps original campaign team, including press secretary Hope Hicks and  campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and a group of professionals he brought in later to shore up support from more traditional corners of the Republican Party. The new arrivals, led by veteran strategist Paul Manafort, whom Trump hired in late March, have urged Trump to tone down some of his most provocative positions, such as his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. But Trump reprimanded Manafort, according to two sources familiar with the conversation, after Manafort told a gathering of RNC members at an April meeting in Florida that Trump was only acting when describing his proposed Muslim ban or his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Manafort hired Wiley on April 13. A statement issued by the Trump campaign said Wiley had been hired on a short-term basis as a consultant until the campaign was running full steam and it thanked him for for helping us during this transition period. Manafort did not responds to calls and emails seeking comment. ",politicsNews,"May 26, 2016 ",1
Illinois House Democrats advance FY 2017 budget amid veto threat,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill (Reuters) - Illinois took another step on Wednesday that is bound to lead nowhere in solving its strangled finances, with the Democratic-led House approving a new spending plan and Republican Governor Bruce Rauner immediately vowing to veto it, saying it was $7 billion out of balance. The fiscal 2017 budget, which passed in a 63-53 vote, allocates $14.1 billion for general funds spending against $33 billion in anticipated revenue.  However, the Democrats plan does not include billions of dollars the state automatically spends on pensions and debt payments, as well as for court-ordered social services spending under consent decrees, leading Republicans to blast the budget for needing $7.2 billion in additional revenue. The spending plan appeared destined to follow in the path of the Democrats fiscal 2016 budget, which was vetoed by Rauner, with the exception of K-12 school funding, on the premise it was $4 billion short on revenue. That has left Illinois the only state without a complete spending plan 11 months into a fiscal year that began July 1, 2015. The state has been relying on ongoing appropriations, stopgap funding bills and court-ordered spending, with a growing pile of unpaid bills as it limps through the fiscal year. This is a repeat of last year on steroids, said House Republican Leader Jim Durkin during the budget debate. But House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie said lawmakers must act to pass a budget.    It is unconscionable this state has failed to do its job during the current fiscal year and it would be even more unconscionable for us to leave this assembly without taking care of our responsibilities for the fiscal year to come, she said. The House-passed budget includes an additional $700 million to address funding inequities among K-12 school districts, most notably the cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools, which would also get an additional $100 million for pensions. The budget now moves to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where its fate was unclear. Comptroller Leslie Munger, a Republican, warned of catastrophic results if the House budget plan is enacted, predicting the backlog of unpaid bills would more than double to $15 billion and payments to schools, hospitals and others would take as long as nine months to process.  A coalition of unpaid social service agencies that sued Illinois for more than $100 million earlier this month filed an emergency motion on Wednesday asking the Cook County Court to order the state to immediately make bill payments that are more than 60 days late.

Eight protesters arrested at Trump rally in California,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (Reuters) - Some 100 people staged a boisterous but largely peaceful demonstration outside a Southern California rally by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, at times taunting his supporters before police moved in and arrested eight people. The activists carried signs such as Stop Nazi Trump and Dump Trump, and beat a pinata made to resemble the presumptive Republican nominee outside a convention center in Anaheim, just a few blocks from Disneyland, before they were driven from the scene by police on horseback. A spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department said seven adults and one minor were arrested on charges ranging from selling T-shirts without a permit to unlawful assembly. The arrests came one day after a Trump event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, erupted into chaos after hundreds of protesters tried to swarm the convention center where Trump spoke, knocking down barricades, waving Mexican flags and hurling rocks and bottles at police officers in riot gear. Police responded with smoke bombs and pepper spray. Albuquerque police said they made arrests both outside and inside the rally, where demonstrators continually interrupted Trumps speech. The police departments Twitter feed said officers were treated for injuries caused by thrown rocks. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Trump called the protesters in Albuquerque thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals! he said. In Anaheim, police warned in advance that they would take swift action if protests got out of hand, and the roughly 150 officers and sheriffs deputies on hand may have outnumbered the protesters.    Inside, Trump was interrupted by hecklers as he spoke, including one man who waved a Mexican flag. Do not hurt him, Trump said as a man was led out of the arena. I say that for the television cameras. Even though he is a bad person.  Many of those who protested outside the arena expressed anger over Trumps views on immigration, at one point ripping apart a piata resembling the candidate and spearing the paper-mache head on top of a flagpole with a large Mexican flag. Police largely stood by watching the demonstration, which became tense at times when anti-Trump protesters surrounded smaller groups of his supporters. At one point a brief shoving match broke out.  As Trumps campaign event neared its conclusion inside, outside a police helicopter circled overhead, ordering the throng to disperse or face arrest. Officers on horseback then drove the crowd from the scene, where several people were taken into custody for failing to disperse.  Trumps appearances in the U.S. West in areas with significant Hispanic populations have drawn large protests in response to his remarks that Mexico is sending criminals and rapists to the United States, made when he launched his campaign last year. Trumps problems with Latino voters could dampen his Nov. 8 election hopes. A poll by the political research group Latino Decisions found 87 percent of registered Hispanic voters view Trump unfavorably. States like Nevada and New Mexico have growing Hispanic populations that could tip the election. Trumps trip west came ahead of the California and New Mexico nominating contests on June 7. He also plans to hold several large fundraising events in California. It is the first high-dollar fundraising event the New York real estate mogul has held after largely self-funding his primary campaign. Mike McGetrick, one of two people carrying Latinos for Trump signs at the Anaheim rally, said he is part of a group called America First Latinos, whose website describes its members as believing in the rule of law, hard work and the American Dream. He said his neighborhood in nearby Orange is being overrun by undocumented immigrants. There are so many of them, and theyre everywhere, said McGetrick, 62, a retired city worker. I can tell an illegal from a regular person just like that. Trump supporters have been hopeful that his likely opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, will be dogged by her own problems to offset his difficulty with some populations. On Wednesday, Clinton faced renewed criticism about her use of a private email server for government business while secretary of state after a report by the State Departments inspector general said she had violated agency policies. Trump only briefly addressed the report in his appearance in Anaheim.  Not good, he said. Inspector generals report, not good.  ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
Chicago immigrant claims U.S. retaliated over her activism,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A Chicago activist sued U.S. immigration authorities on Wednesday alleging they denied renewal of her immigration status in retaliation for her political activity. Irere Unzueta, 29, who came to the United States from Mexico in 1994 when she was 6 years old, applied for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2013 and was granted immigration relief despite a history of arrests at demonstrations. But when she applied last year to renew her DACA status - which allows undocumented immigrants who entered the country before they were 16 to work legally and be exempt from deportation for a two-year period - it was denied. According to the lawsuit against the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency cited Unzuetas civil disobedience in its explanation of the denial, saying that Ms. Unzuetas case raised public safety concerns. The denial punishes her for engaging in constitutionally protected, peaceful political actions, Mony Ruiz Velasco, a lawyer who represented Unzueta in her application for DACA, said at a news conference on Wednesday. Unzueta told reporters she has lost two job opportunities while fighting to renew her immigration status and said she brought the lawsuit because she is worried that hundreds of other students who spoke up about immigration issues could be targeted. She has never been convicted of any crime. The media office at USCIS said they do not comment on individual cases.  President Barack Obama initiated DACA in 2012, and then tried to expand it in 2014. The Supreme Court is considering challenges by a number of states to the expanded DACA and to a separate Obama program that would have granted immigration benefits to parents of children who are legally in the United States. The DACA designation is not a path to permanent resident status but has been controversial because Obama enacted it unilaterally. Unzueta and her family participated in a wave of campaigns around the country to push for DACA. She attended high school in Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2009. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, asks the court to find that the immigration authorities erred in denying Unzueta the renewal she sought. Although her application for immigration relief was denied, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has not initiated deportation proceedings against Unzueta.",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
States ratchet up transgender battle with lawsuit against U.S.,"(Reuters) - Officials from 11 U.S. states sued the Obama administration on Wednesday to overturn a directive telling schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity, decrying the policy as a massive social experiment. Ramping up the simmering battles over contentious cultural issues in America, the states, led by Texas and most with Republican governors, accused the federal government of rewriting laws by administrative fiat. We are willing to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to, Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told reporters in Austin.  Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obamas administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority. The states lawsuit accused the federal government of overstepping its constitutional powers by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states. It also challenged the Obama administrations interpretation of federal civil rights law with regard to sex and gender. The lawsuit said the administration conspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights. Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizonas Department of Education and Maines governor. Paxton said, Its about parents who are upset, grandparents who are upset. They want to see that the safety of their children is taken care of. Transgender rights advocates argued it is transgender people who need protection, particularly transgender women who are disproportionately the victims of assaults and would be forced to use mens bathrooms if states succeed in forcing people to use bathrooms matching their sex at birth. Likewise, transgender men, many of whom grow facial hair, would be required to use womens bathrooms along with girls. This action puts students at risk for the sake of politics, said Alison Gill of the Trans United Fund advocacy group supporting transgender rights. Gill said the states lawsuit did not reflect the position of most school boards and administrators. The administrations letter to the schools said that to get federal funding under existing rules, schools must agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. That includes not treating transgender students differently from others of the same gender identity, officials said. Paul Castillo, a lawyer with Lambda Legal, which supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, said the lawsuit represented an unprecedented attack against transgender people across the United States. These states are demonstrating the great lengths they will go to in order to discriminate against transgender individuals, Castillo said. Nine of the 11 states that sued have Republican governors, including Maines Paul LePage. LePage broke with the Democratic attorney general, Janet Mills, who did not approve of the lawsuit, a spokesman for Mills said. School districts from Texas and Arizona also joined the suit, which names the U.S. government and a host of federal  agencies and officials as defendants. North Carolina sued the federal government on the transgender bathroom issue this month, seeking to protect its state law passed in March that bans people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. Ever since the 1960s civil rights movement, the federal government has asserted its authority to force states to extend equal protection under the law for all. The administration sued North Carolina on May 9, stating that its transgender bathroom law violated the U.S. 1964 Civil Rights Act. The 11 states lawsuit accused the administration of taking that argument too far and improperly, widening the scope of interpretation of civil rights law. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The administrations interpretation is that the word sex extends protection to transgender people, but the issue has not been settled in the courts. I agree with the Obama administration that sex includes gender, and gender includes gender identity, said John Pagan of the University of Richmonds School of Law in Virginia. Peter Lake of Stetson University College of Law in Florida said the U.S. Supreme Court has taken a narrow view of the meaning of sex under the law, but in recent years lower courts have been more likely to defer to the Obama administrations broader definition. My sense is a certain momentum is building for broader protection of (LGBT) rights, and we might be seeing a moment of federal civil rights law in long-term transition, Lake said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
"Clinton email server broke government rules, watchdog finds","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton broke government rules by using a private email server without approval for her work as U.S. secretary of state, an internal government watchdog said on Wednesday. The long-awaited report by the State Department inspector general was the first official audit of the controversial arrangement to be made public. It was highly critical of Clintons use of a server in her home, and immediately fueled Republican attacks on Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in an already acrimonious presidential race.  The report, which also found problems in department record-keeping practices before Clintons tenure, undermined Clintons earlier defenses of her emails, likely adding to Democratic anxieties about public perceptions of the candidate. A majority of voters say Clinton is dishonest, according to multiple polls.  The report concluded that Clinton would not have been allowed to use the server in her home had she asked the department officials in charge of information security. The report said that staff who later raised concerns were told to keep quiet. Several suspected hacking attempts in 2011 were never reported to department information security officials, in breach of department rules, it said. Shes as crooked as they come, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, said of Clinton at a campaign rally in Anaheim, California, adding that the reports findings were not good for her. Clintons campaign disagreed, saying the report rebutted Republicans criticism. The inspector generals office examined email record-keeping under five secretaries state, both Democratic and Republican. John Kerry, the current officeholder, and predecessors Madeline Albright, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice all agreed to speak to the inspector generals investigators. Clinton was the only one who declined to be interviewed, as did her aides. The report contradicted Clintons repeated assertion that her server was allowed and that no permission was needed.  Several other inquiries continue, including a U.S. Justice Department investigation into whether the arrangement broke laws. The inspector generals report cited longstanding, systemic weaknesses with State Department records that predated Clintons tenure, and found problems with the email record-keeping of some of her predecessors, particularly Powell, that failed to comply with the Federal Records Act.  But it singled out Clinton for her decision to use a private server in her home in Chappaqua, New York, for government business. OIG found no evidence that the Secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server, the report said, using an abbreviation for the office of inspector general. The report said Clinton should have discussed the arrangement with the departments security and technology officials. Officials told investigators that they did not - and would not - approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business. The reason, those officials said, is because it breached department rules and presented security risks. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he would not challenge those findings. He told reporters the department was aware of hacking attempts on Clintons server, but had no evidence that any were successful.  When two lower-level information technology officials tried to raise concerns about Clintons email arrangement in late 2010, their supervisor in Clintons office instructed them never to speak of the Secretarys personal email system again, the report said. Their supervisor told them that department lawyers had approved of the system, but the inspector generals office said it found no evidence this was true. Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman, said the report rebutted criticisms of Clinton made by her political opponents. The report shows that problems with the State Departments electronic recordkeeping systems were longstanding and that there was no precedent of someone in her position having a State Department email account until after the arrival of her successor, he said in a statement. He did not address the reports criticism of Clintons use of a private server, something no other secretary of state has done. Democrats, including fundraisers for Clintons campaign, said the report revealed nothing new. Its digging and digging and digging, Amy Rao, the chief executive of data company Integrated Archive Systems and a Clinton fundraiser, said in an interview, comparing the investigation to probes the Clintons faced in the 1990s. Trust me: Theres no there there. Its Whitewater. Current Secretary of State Kerry asked Steve Linick, the State Department inspector general, to investigate after Clintons email arrangement came to light last year. President Barack Obama appointed Linick to the role in 2013.  Republicans have used Clintons email practice to suggest she was trying to hide government records from scrutiny under public-access laws. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the findings are just the latest chapter in the long saga of Hillary Clintons bad judgment that broke federal rules and endangered our national security.

Puerto Rico rescue bill advances to full House vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday backed a plan to help Puerto Rico escape crippling debt and expand the economy, a move that could put a rescue before the House of Representatives within days. The House Natural Resources Committee endorsed the plan by a 29-10 vote and left intact most provisions endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. The plan would empower a federal oversight board to negotiate with investors and decide what they would recover from the roughly $70 billion they lent the island. Taxpayer money will not be spent in the rescue which would prevent a bailout, Ryans office said in a statement on Wednesday. Puerto Ricos Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla praised the bill for elements to help address insolvency, protect essential services and grow the economy. However, he reiterated reservations about the broad power of the oversight board. Puerto Ricans are Americans and our democratic rights need to be protected, just like those of American citizens living on the mainland, and the oversight provisions do not meet that obligation, he said in a statement, urging Ryan to amend the bill before it goes to the full House for a vote.     Under the plan, investors may not sue Puerto Rico while the oversight board does its work, and all the islands creditors could face a loss despite recent lobbying from Wall Street interest groups. Among Republicans who voted on Wednesday, more than half endorsed the rescue plan but a vocal minority warned that it would hurt investor demand for municipal bonds and force issuers to offer higher yields. Taxpayers across the country will have to pay ... as markets adjust to this new world, warned Congressman Tom McClintock of California. The bill, called the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, passed without significant changes. Speaker Ryan and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, in separate statements on Wednesday touted bipartisan support for the bill. If that holds, lawmakers may guide the rescue past the Senate to President Barack Obama before $1.9 billion in Puerto Rico debt is due on July 1. Republicans may demand more concessions while some Democrats find the oversight board too punitive. Democrats also want guarantees that the islands pension system, which has a shortfall of $40 billion, would be protected first. With the House and Senate set to begin a week-long Memorial Day holiday break at the end of this week, debate of the bill by the full House is not expected until sometime in June.

'Little House' star drops bid for U.S. congressional seat,"(Reuters) - Melissa Gilbert, best known for playing Laura Ingalls Wilder in the 1970s television drama Little House on the Prairie, has dropped out of the race for a U.S. congressional seat in Michigan for medical reasons.  Gilbert, 52, said continued problems from neck and back injuries from a 2012 accident forced her to give up her Democratic candidacy for the Republican-held seat. While I have received the best treatment and therapy I could have asked for, those injuries have only gotten worse, Gilbert said in a statement. As much as it breaks my heart to say this, my doctors have told me I am physically unable to continue my run for Congress. Gilbert, who lives with her husband, actor Timothy Busfield, in Howell, Michigan, about 60 miles (100 km) from Detroit, has no political background but served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 2001 to 2005. She is the author of three books, including Prairie Tale: A Memoir, about her role in the show about a Minnesota farm family in the 1870s and 1880s. Gilberts departure from the race improved the already strong odds that U.S. Representative Mike Bishop, a Republican, would win a second two-year term in the district, the Detroit Free Press reported.

"Funding battle begins with House bill on regulators, agencies","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The first shots in a political battle over funding for a range of federal activities rang out during a congressional subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, as Republicans and Democrats took opposing stances on a budget bill for financial regulators and other agencies. The legislation, which covers funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department, the judiciary branch and others, passed the House of Representatives Financial Services Subcommittee and now goes to the full Appropriations Committee. It then must win approval from the Republican-dominated House before being reconciled with a Senate version into a single bill for President Barack Obama to sign. Democrats at Wednesdays meeting made it clear they will press for changes at every step of the lawmaking process, saying the current bill is loaded with ideological policy riders that do not belong and that it could cripple important government work. Republicans, meanwhile, said the bill would reign in spending, make bodies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more accountable and boost funding for important issues. We cut funding for nearly two dozen agencies that can operate with a little less, said Republican Ander Crenshaw of Florida, the subcommittee chairman, adding that the cuts helped free up more money for antidrug trafficking efforts, the Small Business Administration, and the Treasury Departments Offfice of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. In total, the bill drops funding by 6.5 percent from current levels for all agencies, including the General Services Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, which bear the brunt of the reduction because they are the largest agencies in the bill and both have a recent history of inappropriate behavior, Crenshaw said. Republicans want to shake up the IRS after a 2013 scandal in which it allegedly targeted conservative Tea Party groups. The bill would also shave $50 million from the SECs budget. Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York, said the lower funding in the legislation would allow more tax cheats to go undetected and thwart the SEC in protecting investors.  The long list of riders turns a bad bill into an example of the Republican majoritys unnecessary culture war, she added, citing provisions to block the Federal Communications Commissions internet neutrality rule and to limit health coverage of abortions for federal employees. Calling the riders unnecessary, unwarranted, and unhelpful,  the senior Democrat on the subcommittee, Jose Serrano of New York, said they are an effort to appease the right wing of the right wing.

House Speaker Ryan says he hasn't decided on Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, on Wednesday continued to withhold his support from Donald Trump for the Republican Partys presidential nomination, saying he is not ready to endorse the real estate billionaire, a political neophyte. Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, brushed aside reports that he was ready to endorse Trump during a meeting with reporters in the Capitol. I havent made a decision, he said, adding that he had no timetable for doing so. The 46-year-old speaker is the only member of the Republican congressional leadership who has not formally embraced the presumptive Republican nominee. Ryan is expected to chair the partys nominating convention in July in Cleveland. Ryan and Trump were, however, scheduled to speak by telephone on Wednesday evening, a spokesman for Ryan said. This is not an endorsement call, spokesman Zack Roday said. Ryan set up the call with Trump to continue discussing the partys campaign agenda, a Ryan aide said. Trumps ascent has shaken the party establishment and raised concerns among some Republicans over whether they can unify behind him, given his harsh rhetoric and shifting policy positions in a brutal primary fight that once had 17 candidates. Ryan was asked Wednesday about Trumps comment this week that New Mexico Republican Governor Susana Martinez, who had declined to attend a Trump rally, was not doing her job.  Ryan said Martinez was a great governor and a friend of mine, and said he would leave it at that. Ryan said his staff and Trumps were in contact virtually daily. I want this to be a sincere deliberative process, Ryan said. He dismissed suggestions that the Trump campaign was trying to pressure him, saying, I dont worry about that stuff. The speaker faces some pressure from inside his party to smooth things over and form a united front against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November. Ryans statement earlier this month that he was not ready to support Trump was unusual and seen as an effort to keep some distance from Trump and protect Ryans own presidential prospects for 2020. Ryan said his staff and the Trump campaign have been discussing a wide-ranging policy agenda for the campaign, covering issues from healthcare to taxes and national security. Ryan said the policy agenda on poverty will be announced in the first week of June, with more details later in the month. He said the agenda was for 2017 and would feature the kind of things that you can get done only with a Republican president. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
"Trump, aiming to offset money disadvantage, escalates Clinton attacks","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump this week took his use of sordid accusations against Democrat Hillary Clinton to levels unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential campaigns, in the latest example of the Republicans unorthodox playbook. The presumptive Republican nominee is working to gain stronger footing and offset a big advantage Clinton is likely to have ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election: a huge campaign war chest that she and her allies intend to use to launch a barrage of attacks against him.  Trump is using the same strategy he used repeatedly during the Republican nomination fight against rivals like Ted Cruz: making incendiary statements that U.S. television networks cannot resist covering, giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive.  The strategy may already be working. Trump has raised more than a few eyebrows with his latest round of attacks against Clinton. He has turned history into headlines that play like a virtual reel in the 24-hour news world of cable TV and the internet. Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said the strategy makes sense. Clearly, shes going to have massive amounts of money, Lewandowski told Reuters. The difference is Mr. Trump has funded his campaign. What weve been able to do in this campaign cycle is to generate earned media based on Mr. Trumps ability to be a straight talker, and genuine and authentic, and I think thats what drives the news cycle. Trumps latest salvos include a rape accusation against former President Bill Clinton dating to the 1970s and the suicide of an aide to the former president in 1993 - events that the campaign links to Hillary Clinton. An online video released by Trump has various women accusing the former president of rape or unwanted sexual advances. Trump accused Hillary Clinton of helping to silence the women. The Clintons and their supporters have dismissed the charges as baseless and politically motivated. Then, in an interview with The Washington Post, Trump suggested that the Clintons may have been involved in the 1993 death of Vince Foster, a former aide to Bill Clinton and a friend of Hillary Clinton, even though more than five investigations, including one conducted by Republican special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, concluded that Foster committed suicide in a Virginia park. Trump was alluding to theories over the years that have been circulated in tabloid publications, in the depths of the internet and in books by the Clintons foes. On Wednesday, Trumps campaign accidentally sent an email to a reporter at Politico revealing that the Republican plans to next attack Clinton regarding Whitewater, a real estate scandal that plagued Bill Clintons administration. No wrongdoing by the Clintons was ever proven. The attacks have put Hillary Clinton on her back foot. Trump just continues to gobble news cycle after news cycle, said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who ran the Super PACs that backed Senator Ted Cruz in the primary and aggressively attacked Trump. Clinton is spending less time campaigning about the future and more time explaining the past than she would probably like.  The barrage puts Clinton in a bind. So far, she has opted to ignore Trumps personal attacks and her campaign has offered general pushback. But Clinton risks the negative onslaught dragging down her standing with the public and irreversibly damaging her general election hopes. I played a lot of hardball in my life, but I dont envy what the Clinton campaign is up against here. Trump himself has totally changed the political dynamic, said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who supports Clinton. What they cant afford to do is get in the gutter with the guy. He has absolutely no morals or scruples. Getting into the gutter with him is an absolute waste of time. Clintons campaign and the Super PACs supporting her will not be without funds to try to combat the attacks and launch her own. At the end of April, she had $30 million in her campaign account, compared with Trumps $2 million.  And the PAC supporting her, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, had $46 million at the end of April - a total that is likely to grow over the summer. The PAC backing Trump is just getting off the ground. Clinton will also depend on an army of surrogates to try to combat Trump without having to respond to him herself.  Trump has already proven he can dispatch opponents without spending much money by defining them to voters through aggressive appearances on news programs.  Republican rival Jeb Bush had a more than $100 million advantage going into the primary. But Trump painted him as low energy and defined him as inept, a characterization Bushs money was never able to overcome. The PACs backing Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz spent millions assailing Trump. Trump was able to leverage extensive coverage of his campaign by the media to combat their attacks while spending little money on advertising. Trump has been proven an expert at raising attack lines that have already been settled, but insisting that questions remain. He spent years demanding that President Barack Obama produce his birth certificate, despite myriad evidence that Obama was born in Hawaii, including government records of the presidents birth in Honolulu. For Trump, some of the attacks are targeted at young voters - those in their early 20s and 30s were too young to have been immersed in news about the scandals of the Clinton years.   You have a whole series of the population who either (a) dont know anything about it, or (b) werent paying attention at the time, Lewandowski said. A Clinton ally said Trump is simply trying to distract attention from his own liabilities - such as refusing to release his tax returns and his own history of problems with women. The more he raises these outrageous and outlandish charges, said U.S. Representative Xavier Becerra, of California, a Democratic leader in the House, the more he keeps you pedaling in a different direction.

Obama administration officials warn lawmakers over Iran sanctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Obama administration officials told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday they would oppose new sanctions on Iran if they interfere with last years international nuclear agreement, laying the groundwork for a potential fight over any legislation. If legislation were to undermine the deal, by taking off the table commitments that we had put on the table, that would be a problem, Adam Szubin, the acting Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told a House of Representatives hearing. Certainly our allies around the world would see us taking back major chunks of the sanctions relief as bad faith, Szubin told a Senate Banking Committee hearing later on Wednesday. House and Senate members are drafting new sanctions measures, accusing Iran of supporting terrorism, human rights abuses and violating its international commitments by testing ballistic missiles. They want to renew the Iran Sanctions Act, a broad U.S. law imposing sanctions over Irans nuclear and missile programs that expires at the end of 2016. Administration officials have urged Congress not to rush to renew the ISA. Lawmakers argue that new sanctions will help send a message that Washington will take a hard line, despite the nuclear pact. Every Republican in Congress and several of President Barack Obamas fellow Democrats opposed the agreement. I feel its not so terrible to have Congress come up with new sanctions if we feel Iran is violating its agreements, said Representative Eliot Engel, top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who opposed the nuclear pact. Szubin and Stephen Mull, the State Departments lead coordinator for implementing the nuclear deal, told lawmakers that, so far, the deal announced in July 2015 was being fully implemented. They said the administration was tightly tracking Irans compliance. We believe that we and our allies in the region are considerably safer, Mull said.  Members of Congress recently accused the administration of allowing sanctions workarounds that might provide Iran direct or indirect access to the U.S. financial system. Szubin reiterated the administrations assurances that it had no such plans. Despite the easing of nuclear sanctions under the international agreement, Tehrans hopes of rapidly ending its economic isolation have been complicated by companies concerns that doing business with Iran might violate non-nuclear sanctions that remain in place.

Congress moves to revamp toxic chemical law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation with bipartisan support that would revamp U.S. chemical safety law for the first time in decades is advancing in Congress, winning overwhelming passage in the House of Representatives as backers sought quick Senate action. Senate leadership aides said the timing was still being worked out for a Senate vote on the first update of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in about 40 years. The Houses 403-12 vote to pass the measure updating the regulation of toxic chemicals aided the bills chances, with the Senate also expected to strongly embrace the bill, according to leadership aides. By removing 40-year-old barriers and modernizing procedures, we reduce the risk to consumers. This means the chemicals and products we use every day will be safer for Americans, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Lawmakers have complained that under current law, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been unable to effectively regulate chemicals, including those that can be found in hardware stores for home improvements. Under current law, its become harder for the EPA to ban even substances that are known to cause cancer, such as asbestos, said Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, in calling for passage of the bill on Tuesday. According to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Absent EPA action under TSCA, some states, litigants and even consumer product retailers have been increasingly taking steps to restrict certain chemicals, not always relying on objective scientific analysis to make these decisions. Under the bill, the government would evaluate risks posed by chemicals without considering the cost of taking action. If there are indications that a chemicals use presents an unreasonable risk, the EPA would attempt to manage the risk, under the bill. Steps could range from labeling the product to banning it. Under the compromise bill hammered out by Republicans and Democrats, the EPA would have to consider the impact of a chemical on health and the environment, the chemicals benefits and the economic impact of regulation.

Senators urge House to move on aviation security bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top members of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have urged their counterparts in the House of Representatives to move forward on Senate legislation to boost aviation security and authorize the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration. In a May 24 letter released on Wednesday, the senate panels Republican chairman, John Thune of South Dakota, and its top Democrat, Bill Nelson of Florida, cautioned House lawmakers that Congress has only six weeks left to approve legislation before a temporary FAA funding patch expires in mid-July. The letter, addressed to House Transportation Chairman Bill Schuster of Pennsylvania and that panels top Democrat, Peter DeFazio of Oregon, urged movement on a Senate bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support last month. We believe that this legislation represents a model for House action, which is essential to avoiding another round of funding extensions that will be disruptive to the aviation industry and only delay much-needed reforms, Thune and Nelson said.  House lawmakers have not taken up the Senate bill but have focused instead on their own multi-year measure that stalled due to disagreement over a controversial plan to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system. Aides to Shuster were not available for comment.  But DeFazio said he agreed with the senators about the need to move forward.  We could pass comprehensive legislation with broad bipartisan support today if the Republicans drop their divisive scheme to privatize air traffic control, the Oregon Democrat said in a statement issued by his office.   Thune and Nelson described the Senate bill as the only viable opportunity this year to deliver comprehensive legislation to President Barack Obama for his signature. They added that the House privatization measure would face hurdles in the Senate even if the House reached agreement. We understand the commitment to this (privatization) proposal, but the Senate is far from reaching a consensus on this issue, the senators said. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1

The report shows that problems with the State Departments electronic recordkeeping systems were longstanding and that there was no precedent of someone in her position having a State Department email account untilafter the arrival of her successor, spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

"Protesters throw rocks, bottles at police outside Trump rally in New Mexico","(Reuters) - Protesters threw rocks and bottles at police officers who responded with pepper spray outside a rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump in Albuquerque, New Mexico, police said.     Hundreds of protesters tried to storm the convention center in New Mexicos biggest city, knocking down barricades and throwing objects at a door and then hurling rocks and bottles at mounted police in riot gear, the Albuquerque Police Department said on Twitter on Tuesday and video posted online showed.  Several police officers were injured, the police tweeted.  Protesters chanted anti-Trump slogans, held anti-Trump signs and waved Mexican flags before the demonstration descended into chaos with some protesters standing on top of police cars.   Television footage showed officers responding by using pepper spray and smoke bombs to disperse the crowd. Police said they made arrests both outside and inside the rally, where protesters continually interrupted Trumps speech.  No one at the police department was immediately available for comment. Protests have become common outside rallies for Trump, the partys presumptive nominee, who has polarized opinion with his rhetoric against illegal immigration. He abandoned a rally in Chicago in March after clashes between his supporters and protesters. He has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists across the U.S. border and has promised to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. According to CNN, his supporters chanted build that wall during his rally on Tuesday in Albuquerque where a little less than half of the population is Hispanic or Latino.

Obama to Asians worried about U.S. election: It's going to be OK,"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama sought on Wednesday to ease growing Asian worries about the raucous election campaign to succeed him which has been dominated by the incendiary rhetoric of  mogul Donald Trump, now the Republican Partys nominee. I think other people sometimes look at our election system and say what a mess, Obama told a townhall meeting with young leaders in Vietnams Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. But usually we end up doing okay because the American people are good people ... Sometimes our politics doesnt express all the goodness of the people, he said, without referring specifically to any of the presidential candidates. Obama made the comments just before ending a three-day trip to Vietnam, whose high point was an announcement that Washingtons ban on sales of lethal weapons to the country - a vestige of the Vietnam War - would be completely lifted. Obama repeatedly insisted that lifting the embargo was not a response to Beijings assertiveness in the South China Sea.  Critics accused Washington of throwing away a powerful lever it had to press communist-ruled Vietnam for improvements in human rights. White House officials say the arms move was a natural step to take with a country that, once an enemy, is now a key part of Obamas strategic rebalance towards Asia and an important trade partner as its economy grows apace. Obama also announced the Peace Corps would begin operating in Vietnam for the first time. Across Asia, policymakers have been startled by Trumps isolationist foreign policy pronouncements, which have challenged much of the status quo in Washingtons relations with the region. Many fear Trump will feed insecurity in nations worried about Chinas growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obamas pivot to the Asia-Pacific. At the townhall in Ho Chi Minh City, a young woman who had been an exchange student in Montana asked Obama what he thought of the prospects that Trump or Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders following him to the White House. Usually, eventually the voters make good decisions and democracy works, replied Obama, whose criticism of Trump has sharpened since he all but clinched the Republican nomination. Things are going to be ok. I promise. Thousands of people lined the streets of Ho Chi Minh City for a second day to cheer enthusiastically and wave mini-flags of Vietnam and the United States as Obama drove by on his way to the airport for a flight to Japan.  At his freewheeling townhall, where he was greeted with a standing ovation, Obama noted that two-thirds of the countrys population were born after 1975, when the war ended with North Vietnamese tanks rolling into Saigon to bring U.S.-backed South Vietnam under communist rule. Obama prodded Vietnams leaders on political freedoms during his visit after critics of the government were prevented from meeting him. When a woman rapper at the townhall asked himabout supporting arts and culture, he segued into an appeal for people to be allowed to express themselves. However, his unusually long one-country visit was warm and mostly about strengthening diplomatic and economic relations. Annual U.S.-Vietnam trade has swelled from $450 million when ties were normalized in 1995 to $45 billion last year. Washington is a big buyer of Vietnams televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood. Obama repeatedly touted the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, of which export-led Vietnam will be one of the biggest beneficiaries, if it survives opponents in Washington concerned about competition and a loss of U.S. jobs. He also talked about the challenges of climate change when asked about the drying-up of the Mekong River in the rice-bowl delta of southern Vietnam, urging Southeast Asian countries to work together. The Mekong River, which sustains 60 million livelihoods as it flows through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, is under threat from at least 39 hydro-electric dams being built or under development upstream of Vietnam, most of them in China. Low river levels have allowed seawater to penetrate inland, ruining vast swathes of cropland in the fertile delta. Obama did not name any of the upstream countries but said the United States would provide smaller member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with technical assistance and evaluations of what needs to be done. Hopefully ... that information can be used to negotiate on an international level to try to prevent some projects that might have very bad effects, he said. One of the things that weve seen in ASEAN is that when small countries band together as a unit, then the power magnifies.   Japan is the final stop on Obamas swing through Asia, where he is attending a summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations starting Thursday.  ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
"Trump advisers push him to target OPEC, regulations in big energy speech","WILLISTON, North Dakota (Reuters) - Two energy advisers to Donald Trump want him to call out members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for driving down world oil prices when he delivers a major energy policy speech this week.  The advisers, who said they had been asked by Trumps 2016 presidential campaign to contribute ideas for the speech, told Reuters they had also suggested he mention cuts to regulations and a streamlining of the federal tax code to make U.S. energy companies more competitive. The advisers, U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and another who asked not to be identified, said they had urged Trump to criticize the OPEC cartel for contributing to a crash in world oil prices by producing full throttle, a factor that has helped push many U.S. oil companies into bankruptcy. We have to look at the global playing field and see which of our partners - OPEC, Iran, Russia - are playing fair in the global marketplace, Cramer said about the advice he had been giving Trump. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not shied from targeting OPECs top producer, Saudi Arabia, in the past. He has said the United States should consider halting oil purchases from the kingdom if it does not provide troops to fight Islamic State militants who control swaths of Syria and Iraq. Trumps speech on Thursday at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in North Dakota, the heart of U.S. drilling country that has been hard hit by the oil price slump, may reveal for the first time how he will approach the energy sector if elected. A spokeswoman for Trumps campaign declined requests for comment and it was unclear whether Trump would use any the ideas provided by the advisers.      Trump has so far been mostly mute on details of his energy policy. He has dismissed climate change as a hoax, promised to renegotiate the U.N. global climate accord, and vowed a revival in the U.S. coal industry, which has been hobbled by low prices and rules that limit pollution emissions.   Environmental advocates and Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, have criticized his stance for underplaying the economic and social risks of climate change. Cramer, who cosponsored a bipartisan bill to investigate OPECs influence in the oil market, said Trump should examine Saudi and Venezuelan ownership stakes in U.S. refineries that import foreign oil instead of using domestic supply, if he is elected president.  One-third of (U.S.) refining capacity is owned by OPEC countries. How does this fit into (Trumps) America first policy? Cramer said. Cramers suggestions, and those of the second adviser Reuters interviewed, have been sent to Trump senior policy advisers including John Mashburn, who is expected to help draft Trumps speech, according to sources familiar with the campaign. Mashburn could not be reached for comment. The organizer of Thursdays conference, North Dakota Petroleum Council President Ron Ness, said 7,700 people were expected to attend, many probably hoping for assurances from Trump that he will help the oil industry be more competitive.  We can manage the cyclical nature of the market but what we are struggling with is the daily onslaught of punitive regulations, he said.    Cramer has suggested to Trump that he ease regulations like the Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at curbing emissions scientists believe contribute to global warming. He also wants Trump to consider the scope of waterways protected under the Clean Water Act. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
Tennis: Halep keeps her wits to reach round three,"PARIS (Reuters) - Former finalist Simona Halep survived a first-set wobble to reach the third round of the French Open for only the second time in her career with a 7-6(5) 6-2 win over Kazakhstans Zarina Diyas on Wednesday.  The Romanian sixth seed surrendered her serve twice in the opening four games to trail 4-1 but delved into her wealth of experience to finally subdue her 90th-ranked opponent 7-5 in the tie break. More exchanges of breaks followed in the second set before Halep finally found her groove to take a 5-2 lead and set up three match points on Diyas serve. The first one went begging but Haleps gritty baseline play paid off in the next point as Diyas bowed out after flicking a forehand long to end a 10-shot rally. The first set was very tough and I was very nervous as I seemed to be fighting for every point, Halep said in a court side interview. The good news for Halep is that the only previous time she reached the last 32, she made it all the way to the 2014 Roland Garros final. Halep and her bizarre black and white zebra print dress will be back on court on Friday when she takes on Japans Naomi Osaka for a place in the fourth round. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
Pro-EU group unveils Soviet-style mural of Trump kissing ex-Mayor Johnson,"LONDON (Reuters) - A giant mural of Donald Trump locked in a kiss with former London mayor Boris Johnson in the style of a legendary Soviet-era image has been unveiled by a group campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union. Painted on the side of a building in Bristol, southwest England - home of the celebrated graffiti artist Banksy - the image reprises a 1979 photograph of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and East German President Erich Honecker kissing, which was later turned into a mural on the Berlin Wall.  It was commissioned by pro-EU campaign group We are Europe as what they call a warning of things to come if Britons vote to leave the 28-member bloc on June 23, as advocated by both Johnson and Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate in Novembers U.S. presidential election. Johnson is the Out campaigns best-known leader and Trump has said Britain would be better off without the EU, which he has blamed for Europes migration crisis. The 15-foot (4.5 meter) mural is accompanied by the slogan Not #IN for this? and a plea for people, especially the young, to register to vote by a June 7 deadline. People need to look at this image and think - is this the future I want, said Harriet Kingaby, a spokesperson from We Are Europe. Galvanizing the youth vote is a key issue for the In camp. Surveys show young people are far more likely to be in favor of remaining in the EU but also much less likely to bother to vote. A survey of 2,000 students this month found that 63 percent did not know the exact date of the referendum, while 54 percent were not aware it was being held in June. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
Trump unlikely to be able to renegotiate climate deal: U.N. climate chief,"COLOGNE (Reuters) - Donald Trump would be highly unlikely to be able to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected U.S. president, the U.N.s climate chief said on Wednesday, as doing so would require the agreement of 195 countries.  Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told Reuters earlier this month he was not a big fan of the climate accord and would seek to renegotiate elements of the deal. As we all know, Donald Trump relishes making very dramatic statements on many issues, so it is not surprising, but it is highly unlikely that that would be possible, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, told journalists at the Carbon Expo event in Cologne. The accord, struck in Paris last December, saw countries agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 with the aim of limiting the rise in the global average temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius. An agreement that has been adopted by 195 countries would require 195 countries to agree to any new negotiation, she said. She added the current U.S. administration was a strong supporter of the deal because it benefits the country. Many of the accords backers say it is in U.S. interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions, partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels would also mean less air pollution, a big cause of disease.  Trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business. The Paris Agreement will formally enter into force when 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. China and the United States, representing 38 percent, say they will join this year. Figueres said if this happens the agreement could come into force as early as 2017. It would then be even harder for the U.S. to pull out, as rules state any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of the agreements entry into force - the length of a U.S. presidential term.

Democratic presidential candidate Sanders seeks recount in Kentucky,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Tuesday requested a recount in the close Kentucky presidential primary against front-runner Hillary Clinton, state election officials said on Tuesday. The recanvass will take place at all 120 county boards of election on Thursday, according to the Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Grimes. Clinton won Kentucky by just 1,924 votes, according to the unofficial totals posted on the secretary of states elections page. She won Jefferson County, which includes Louisville and is the largest by far of the states 120 counties, by nearly 10 times that amount In his filing on Tuesday, Sanders requested a full check and recount of every voting machine and absentee ballot from all precincts in the counties, according to Grimes website. My office is notifying all county boards of elections that Sen. Sanders has requested a recanvass, and we are reminding them of the laws and procedures to be followed, Grimes said in a statement. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, narrowly defeated Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, in the May 17 presidential nominating contest in Kentucky, a state she had not been expected to win.  A Sanders campaign representative said the recount request was important for the integrity of the Democratic presidential contest, in which Sanders is continuing to challenge Clinton despite her formidable lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination. I think the point is just transparency, its not just about Kentucky, Sanders aide Larry Cohen said on CNN. Its about trying to create a context, now and at the (Democratic) convention, that these primaries and caucuses need transparency, they need to be authentic, they need to build confidence among voters, particularly younger voters, that this is not rigged.  Sanders has generally drawn more support from young voters than Clinton. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1
Obama prods Vietnam on rights after activists stopped from meeting him,"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama chided Vietnam on political freedoms on Tuesday after critics of its communist-run government were prevented from meeting him in Hanoi, a discordant note on a trip otherwise steeped in amity between the former foes. Tens of thousands turned out to welcome Obama on the second leg of his visit, Ho Chi Minh City, which was called Saigon until April 1975 when North Vietnamese tanks rolled in to bring U.S.-backed South Vietnam under communist rule. Many in the crowds lining the streets chanted Obama, Obama, some held handwritten signs reading Obama, we love you, and one woman held a boy dressed in a Captain America costume, complete with shield. Underlining the importance of the growing economic ties between the countries, Obama held an open forum with young  entrepreneurs and laid out the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact between 12 Pacific Rim countries. The high point of his visit came on Monday, with an announcement that Washington was scrapping its embargo on the sale of lethal arms to Vietnam. That clears the biggest hurdle remaining between two countries drawn together by concern over Chinas military build-up. Critics said that by removing the ban, a vestige of the Vietnam War, Washington had put concerns about Beijings assertiveness in the South China Sea first and given up a critical lever to press Hanoi for improvements in human rights. One prominent intellectual, Nguyen Quang A, told Reuters that about 10 policemen had come to his house at 6:30 a.m. and put him in a car that was driven out of the capital until Obama was about to leave. An outspoken lawyer, Ha Huy Son, said he was also stopped from joining Obamas meeting with six other civil society leaders. Human Rights Watch said a journalist who was also invited had been arrested on Monday. Quang A, a former IT entrepreneur, was one of more than 100 Vietnamese who tried to run as independents for last weekends election to the parliament, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party. Almost all failed to get on the ballot. Before he was taken away, Quang A posted on Facebook a photograph of himself dressing for the meeting with Obama, with the message: Before going. May be intercepted, arrested. Advising so people know. Vietnams foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Obama noted that several activists had been blocked from meeting him and said this was an indication that, despite some modest legal reforms there are still folks who find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around issues that they care deeply about. There are still areas of significant concern in terms of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, accountability with respect to government, he said. U.S. officials said that lifting the arms embargo would make it easier for Washington to engage with Vietnam on such issues. In Washington, members of the U.S. Congress, including Republicans as well as some of Obamas fellow Democrats, criticized the policy shift alongside about a dozen Vietnamese human rights activists. This is the definition of a bad deal, Republican Representative Chris Smith said at a news conference. This is not smart diplomacy, it is surrender of U.S. interests and values. Democratic Representative Adam Lowenthal said, I am very disappointed that we lost yet another opportunity to elicit any kind of commitment from the Vietnamese government on improving the human rights of the Vietnamese people.  In a speech before leaving Hanoi, Obama stressed the importance of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, where China has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and harbors. Big nations should not bully small ones. Disputes should be resolved peacefully, he said, without naming China, which claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. Chinas Global Times, run by the Communist Partys official Peoples Daily, said the decision to lift the embargo showed a willingness to relax standards on human rights for the sake of containing China. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Ho Chi Minh City with Obama, told reporters that Washingtons efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam were not aimed at China. This is not about China. Nothing that we did here or (are) arguing here is focused on China. It is focused on the fastest-growing marketplace in the world, Kerry said.  Obama interviewed three entrepreneurs at Ho Chi Minh Citys Dreamplex, which hosts budget tech start-ups with support of angel investors and Silicon Valley funds. He also touted the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, especially for unlocking entrepreneurial innovation. Vietnams manufacturing and export-led economy is seen as the biggest TPP beneficiary. Annual U.S.-Vietnam trade swelled to $45 billion last year from $450 million when ties were normalized. Washington is a big buyer of Vietnams televisions, smartphones, clothing and seafood. But the TPP, which would remove tariffs across a 12-nation bloc worth a combined $28 trillion of gross domestic product, is not a done deal. Opposition is expected in Washington amid concern about competition and a loss of U.S. jobs. ",politicsNews,"May 23, 2016 ",1
Clinton knocks Trump for cheering housing bubble burst,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton, seeking to dampen Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps growing appeal with working-class voters, on Tuesday accused him of having cheered on the 2008 housing market crash. Clintons campaign released an ad with audio that the presumptive Republican nominee recorded in 2006 for his now-defunct Trump University venture. Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, in remarks on a bubble burst, said: I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy property and make a lot of money. Clintons campaign and her surrogates used the recording to argue that she would take better care of the U.S. economy. Clinton is seeking to blunt the inroads that Trump has been making with voters in crucial states such as Florida and Ohio. Trump defended his comments on Tuesday evening at a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, saying buying when the housing market was down showed smart dealmaking skills that he would bring to the White House. Im a businessman, thats what Im supposed to do, Trump said. I feel badly for everybody. What am I going to do? Im in business. The New Yorker also impersonated Clinton on the campaign trail, who he said screams, and said other big names in business did similar deals as he did before the housing crisis. Trump has never held elected office and often touts his history as a businessman in response to accusations that he is unprepared to assume the presidency. Anti-Trump protestors and police clashed outside the Albuquerque convention center on Tuesday when protestors tried to storm the center, calling for an end to the Trump rally. Albuquerque police said on Twitter that protestors threw rocks and bottles and a door to the facility appeared to have been hit with something. Police said the only arrests so far had been inside the rally, where Trump was interrupted multiple times by protestors.  Opinion polls in key states show Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and Trump in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Nationally, Trump has been rising in polls to pull roughly even with Clinton. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is a favorite of financial reformers, bashed Trump in prepared remarks released ahead of a speech in Washington on Tuesday. Trumps 2006 comments, she said, amounted to rooting for people to get thrown out on the street. The rest of us were horrified by the 2008 financial crisis, Warren said in the comments. But Donald Trump was drooling over the idea of a housing meltdown  because it meant he could buy up a bunch more property on the cheap. Warren also criticized Trump for saying in a Reuters interview last week that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, enacted in response to the crisis, made it hard for bankers to operate. Let me find the worlds smallest violin to play a sad, sad song, Warren said. Can Donald Trump even name three things that Dodd-Frank does? Seriously, someone ask him. Trump did not directly respond to Warrens comments on Tuesday, but he called her a total failure as a U.S. senator during the rally. Clinton surrogates from Ohio and Florida held a conference call with reporters about Trumps housing statements. Her campaign hosted related events in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada, which will all be battlegrounds in Novembers general election. How could Trump possibly champion the collapse of the housing market and our economy? U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said on the call. Clinton is still fighting on two fronts as she seeks to wrap up her primary battle with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont. Clinton and Sanders both campaigned on Tuesday in California, which is among six states holding Democratic nominating contests on June 7. California, the most populous U.S. state, has more Democratic delegates than any other state, and Sanders has invested heavily there. Clinton needs a solid win in California for a strong finish heading into her partys national convention in July and to dispel questions about whether she can unite the party after a drawn-out, increasingly bitter primary race. Clinton on Monday turned down an invitation by Fox News to debate Sanders in California despite having agreed previously to a May debate. Her campaign said Clintons time would be better spent meeting directly with California voters. Sanders said her refusal was an insult to California voters. Sanders on Tuesday requested that the state of Kentucky review his loss there last week to Clinton by fewer than 2,000 votes. Kentuckys secretary of state, Alison Grimes, said in a statement that the state will recanvas the results at all 120 county boards of election. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1
Obama to return to Indiana city after seven years to highlight progress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama plans a return visit to Elkhart, Indiana, next week, some seven years after going to the city on his first trip as president, to highlight economic progress there and across the United States, the White House said on Tuesday. The repeat visit to Concord High School on June 1 will feature a town hall hosted by broadcaster PBS, as Obama looks to burnish his legacy in the final year of his administration. Unemployment in Elkhart, a manufacturing center for recreational vehicles and band instruments, has fallen to 4.1 percent from 19.6 percent in 2009, according to a White House statement that also noted improvements in high school graduation  and mortgage foreclosure rates. The White House also touted improved healthcare coverage in Indiana and nationally under Obamas signature Affordable Care Act.

"Rocker Neil Young, a Canadian, talks U.S. presidential politics"," (Reprise Records corrects release date of next album to June 24 from June 17, last paragraph) By Jane Ross (Reuters) - Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, cant vote in the upcoming U.S. presidential election - but the 70-year-old rocker has plenty to say about it.  In a video interview with Reuters ahead of the release of his new album Earth, the Grammy-award-winning singer-songwriter excused Donald Trump for using his music without asking his permission.  Trumps use of Rockin in the Free World during the Republican nominees campaign launch raised heckles last June. Youngs management company released a statement at the time saying that Trump was not authorized to use the song in the announcement of his presidential candidacy. Young now says he has nothing against Trump using his song. He just would have liked to have been asked.  The fact that I said I was for Bernie Sanders and then he didnt ask me to use Rockin in the Free World doesnt mean that he cant use it, said Young, who has long lived on a ranch in California.  Young confirmed the Trumps campaign statement that the campaign had a license agreement with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for the right to play the recording. He actually got a license to use it, Young said. I mean, he said he did and I believe him. So I got nothing against him. You know, once the music goes out, everybody can use it for anything.  But if the artist who made it is saying you never spoke to them, if that means something to you, you probably will stop playing it. And it meant something to Donald and he stopped. Young says his support for Sanders in the election race was still strong, despite Hillary Clintons lead in the contest for the Democratic nomination.  Hes the only one talking about the issues, about issues that matter to me, the issues on my mind - problems of corporate control of democracy and everything slipping away and not being able to have six major companies owning all the media in the United States, Young said.  Young has retained his Canadian citizenship. Although becoming a U.S. citizen would allow him to vote in the countrys November presidential election, he dismisses the notion. Oh, that would be a big ruse. Im a Canadian. Theres nothing I can do about that, he said.  But, he says, he will keep on talking politics, in his music and in public.  I vote in my own way, by making a lot of noise. If you dont want to listen to me, fine. If you dont want to vote like I would, dont. But I still have a voice. Youngs latest album, featuring live recordings of songs from throughout his career, will be released on June 24 on Reprise Records. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1
Alabama House speaker's ethics trial roils state politics,"(Reuters) - Opening statements in the ethics trial of Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard got underway on Tuesday in a political drama that could rattle the Republican Party controlling the state, where two other top party leaders are ensnared in separate scandals. The proceedings against Hubbard, a powerful Republican who faces 23 ethics violations, involve actions taken in office and while he was a state party chairman. Alabamas governor and chief judicial officer also face scrutiny in other matters.  Governor Robert Bentley, a Republican, is under fire for his relationship with a former political advisor, prompting efforts to begin impeachment proceedings this spring. Bentley is among the state party leaders who could be called to testify in the Hubbard case, according to local media. Meanwhile, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended this month amid an ethics inquiry over his urging state probate judges not to grant marriage licenses to gay couples, despite a U.S. Supreme Courts ruling that legalized gay marriage last year. Hubbard was indicted by a state grand jury in October 2014 on charges of using his elected office, along with his former post as chair of the state Republican Party, for personal gain.  He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing, describing his prosecution as politically motivated, local news outlets have reported. Hubbards office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During opening arguments on Tuesday, state prosecutors said Hubbard used his powerful roles to send money to businesses that he had an interest in. He sees an opportunity and he takes it, state prosecutor Matt Hart, who oversees a special prosecutions division, told the courtroom, the Montgomery Advertiser reported. Hubbards defense said it would show he had not committed the alleged felony crimes. Theyre not going to prove anything, said defense attorney Bill Baxley, according to the Advertiser newspaper. If convicted, Hubbard could see prison time and removal from office, local news outlets reported. The office of State Attorney General Luther Strange, a Republican, declined further comment, noting that the judge in the case has imposed an order restricting comments to media.

Lawmakers see path ahead for Puerto Rico rescue plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Congressional plan to help Puerto Rico shed billions of dollars in bad debt can win enough support to make its way to a vote in the House of Representatives, U.S. lawmakers who support the measure said on Tuesday. Under the rescue plan, an independent panel would erase some of Puerto Ricos $70 billion debt load that has crippled the island state already facing a 45 percent poverty rate and the Zika epidemic. U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, a Republican, has endorsed the fix and the fate of the measure could help define his tenure as party leader which began in October. But Ryan can rely on some Democrats who say the rescue will aid the ailing island even if some of the legislations provisions are too punitive of Puerto Rico. This is the only bill that will attract enough support from our colleagues on the Republican side to pass in a Congress they control, said Rep. Raul Grijalva, the leading Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee. Grijalva of Arizona said he expects lawmakers will ratify the plan when they write the fine-print of the legislation at a hearing on Wednesday. Rep. Rob Bishop, the panels chairman, postponed a law-writing session in April because of opposition to the Puerto Rico rescue but on Tuesday he said he was hopeful. Ryan and Democratic leaders stress the aid plan for the island means relief without federal spending though investors will see a cut in their Puerto Rican bond holdings and they are fighting for terms that could limit the hit to their portfolios. A leading voice for investors, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), on Tuesday backed the plan which expects Puerto Rico to control deficit spending. A Puerto Rico oversight panel, or control board, could veto Puerto Rico spending measures that it finds irresponsible and SIFMA endorsed such broad powers to enforce and monitor fiscal discipline. The oversight board would have the power to push creditors to accept a write-down of debt, even over the objections of holdout investors. The plan would also ask the oversight board to protect the interests of Puerto Rico pensioners who rely on a system that is now under funded by at least $40 billion. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2016 ",1
Ohio violated voting rights by reducing early voting: U.S. judge,"(Reuters) - A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that Ohio violated voters rights in 2014 by cutting the number of days in which people were allowed to cast early ballots to 28 from 35. Judge Michael Watson of U.S. District Court in Columbus ordered Ohio to reinstate the 35-day period and also to grant residents a week-long opportunity to register and cast a ballot at the same time - a period known as Golden Week. If the ruling stands, voters in Ohio will be able to vote a full 35 days before the general election on Nov. 8. Watson said the earlier changes violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and were unconstitutional.  Ohios Republican-controlled legislature changed the system two years ago. The move was challenged by the states chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union.  The two groups argued that the limited opportunities for early voting directly affected minorities. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday: It is disappointing that a federal judge would again change the election rules after the current laws were upheld in the same federal district court by a settlement agreement we reached with the NAACP and the ACLU. Husted said in a statement.  The settlement between Husted and the organizations allowed residents to vote on multiple Sundays leading up to a presidential election and gave access to additional evening voting hours, according to ACLU documents.  Husted said he plans to consult the leaders of the state Senate and state House of Representatives before deciding how to proceed.",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1

Senator Durbin cites problems with House Puerto Rico debt bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the chambers second-ranking Democrat, expressed deep reservations on Tuesday with a Puerto Rico debt relief bill being debated by a House of Representatives panel this week. I want to see the final product. The initial draft, I have some real problems with it, the Illinois lawmaker told reporters. He added that some other Democrats had also expressed strong reservations with the measure. Durbin said he was concerned that the bill that could move through the House would cut the minimum wage and overtime pay for some Puerto Ricans and fail to increase federal payments for Medicare and Medicaid, the healthcare programs for the elderly, poor and disabled, on the island. He also said there were deep concerns whether bondholders ought to be able to be paid back in full under any debt restructuring plans that would be overseen by a newly created oversight board at a time when social services are being cut on the island.  Lawmakers are trying to enact a bill to prevent further economic and social chaos in Puerto Rico, where the government faces a July 1 debt payment of $1.9 billion. The island, a territory of the United States, has a total debt of roughly $70 billion. The Republican chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee is hoping his panel votes by Wednesday to approve a Puerto Rico debt bill he negotiated with leading House Democrats and the Obama administration and send the measure to the full House for debate and passage. Durbin told reporters he heard strong opposition to the House bill during a meeting in Chicago on Monday with Puerto Rican community leaders. Durbin spoke following a weekly closed meeting of Democrats in which the Puerto Rico legislation was discussed. There wasnt a single person (speaking) in support of the bill during that meeting, he said.     ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1
"Puerto Rico crisis bill strengthens creditors, but cram-down remains","SAN JUAN (Reuters) - The Congress latest attempt to solve Puerto Ricos debt crisis appears to strengthen some - though not all - creditor positions in what has been a robust fight to influence the writing of a bill that lawmakers started to debate on Tuesday. The House Natural Resources Committee presented the legislation, formally called the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act or PROMESA, last week after several false starts. The bill would put Puerto Ricos finances under a federally appointed oversight board, while allowing the U.S. territory to restructure a $70 billion debt load that threatens to collapse an economy already hamstrung by rampant emigration and a 45 percent poverty rate. While that structure is unchanged from prior drafts, several small tweaks seem to benefit bondholders, including restricting the governments ability to override decisions of the seven-member board. Still, other elements of the bill are ambiguous, experts say - including the ability of Puerto Rico to enforce cuts to creditors debt portfolios through a bankruptcy-like court process without their consent. This is also referred to as a cram-down. It doesnt strike me that there are obvious winners and losers, said David Skeel, a bankruptcy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, adding, a lot will depend on who ends up on the control board, and what stance the control board takes. The bill also allows provisions for Puerto Ricos 18 distinct debt-issuing agencies to try to come to terms consensually with creditors, through a cooperative process where creditors would be able to vote on debt restructuring plans. Two-thirds of a creditor class would need to support a plan for it to take effect. PROMESA, also referred to as H.R. 5278, gives significant latitude to the board to manage Puerto Ricos books and form a plan to stabilize its finances. In a change from a prior version released in April, the bill would strengthen language barring the Puerto Rican government from passing any laws to curb the boards authority. At the end of the day, the real virtue and vice of this bill is the strength of the control board, Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who follows Puerto Rico closely, said in an interview.   The latest draft would also restrict the governments ability to transfer property on which creditors have liens. In the case of a proposal to cut repayments to creditors, it would compel a judge to assess the fairness of the proposal against Puerto Ricos constitution, a protection absent from the April draft. Such protections seemed to modestly reassure markets when the bill was unveiled last week and investors bid up prices on Puerto Ricos benchmark July 2035 general obligation debt. The revised language is certainly more positive for the commonwealths GO (General Obligation) and GO-guaranteed bondholders as it attempts to preserve the constitutional protections they currently enjoy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote clients. CRAM-DOWN Still, the new bill retains enough ambiguity to make some creditors nervous. Most significantly, it preserves cram-down power and in one sense makes it easier to start the process. That is because the latest draft of PROMESA removes a pre-condition to cram-down which would have required Puerto Rico to first complete consensual workout talks with creditors, allowing them to vote on a restructuring plan. The current bill merely requires Puerto Rico to make good-faith efforts toward a cooperative deal before initiating a cram-down action. Determining when Puerto Rico had satisfied that fuzzier standard would be up to the oversight board, giving the board more leeway on deciding when to push Puerto Rico into bankruptcy, and thus more leverage in creditor talks, said Melissa Jacoby, a bankruptcy expert and professor at University of North Carolina School of Law. Its important that the restructuring provisions are strong enough to provide the leverage to encourage voluntary deals, Jacoby said in an interview. This bill asks a lot of Puerto Rico in some respects, and therefore, its not a good deal for Puerto Rico unless it has a robust restructuring possibility. One creditor source who was not authorized to speak to the press voiced concern over how the good-faith efforts standard would be assessed: We dont know how the it will be enforced and those are the questions well be asking.

Senate rejects new U.S. retirement rule; Obama ready to veto,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted along party lines on Tuesday to repeal a new Labor Department rule on retirement advice after a debate that stretched over the course of the day. The resolution, approved by a vote of 56 to 41, is a largely symbolic move that President Barack Obama has already threatened to veto. The House of Representatives passed a similar version last month. Obamas administration in April released the rule setting a fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients best interests ahead of their own bottom lines. Tuesdays arguments revolved around what is best for middle- and lower-income workers. Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, say the rule will be expensive for brokers and force them to get rid of Main Street clients and small businesses that offer 401(k) plans. They also say the rule does not take into account existing regulations on financial advice.  Democrats say profit-hungry advisers have exploited middle- and lower-class workers by recommending retirement products that mostly serve to line their own pockets. Kicking off the debate, the most powerful Republican in the Senate, Kentuckys Mitch McConnell, said blocking the rule would help smaller savers.  I have sincere concerns about what this could mean for the ability of investment advisers to provide quality financial advice, but also for the ability of consumers to seek affordable retirement options, he said. Nevadas Harry Reid, the most powerful Democrat in the chamber, countered that there was nothing wrong with a rule that would require investment advisers to act in the best interest of their investors. One Republican, Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson, described the rule as a solution in search of a problem, while fellow party member Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said we should call this the Only the Rich Retire rule. Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey said the rule would allow people to retire with dignity and without worries that an adviser will exploit you. Fellow Democrat Patty Murray of Washington said: Some financial advisers have lined their own pockets by steering clients toward complicated investments. Some have recommended that retirees make transactions that come with hidden fees. And some get commission when they sell a financial product, even if it doesnt make sense for a client, she said.  We finally have a new protection that would right that wrong.   ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1
Bill to cloak U.S. 'dark money' seen as harmful to charity fraud fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fighting charity fraud could become more difficult under a Republican bill in Congress to prohibit the U.S. Internal Revenue Service from collecting the names of top donors to charities and other nonprofit groups, critics warned on Tuesday. Meant to protect the privacy of wealthy individuals who make anonymous, or dark money donations to politically active nonprofit groups, the bill would eliminate a decades-old IRS donor-identity disclosure requirement for a range of tax-exempt groups that includes hospitals, universities, community and sports organizations. Backers of the legislation say donor lists have sometimes been disclosed to the public even though the names and addresses are supposed to be private.   In a related development, the IRS itself plans to propose new regulations eliminating donor-reporting requirements for most tax-exempt organizations, according to a document posted on a White House Office of Management and Budget website. It is unclear which groups would still be subject to disclosure under the regulations, which are expected in December.  But either move would deprive resource-strapped state law enforcement authorities of ready information used to look into wrongdoing by charities, state officials told Reuters. Its important forensic data to us state regulators. Its evidence we can consider using in an investigation to determine whether a charitys board has breached its fiduciary duty, said Hugh Jones, deputy state attorney general for Hawaii. The Republican measure was approved by a tax committee in April and awaits a House of Representatives vote. If approved it would go next to the Senate, where its outlook was unclear.  With dark money and other forms of cash pouring into U.S. politics, the 2016 presidential contest is expected to cost $5 billion, double that of 2012. Campaign committees and political action committees raise most of that cash, but dark money, or spending whose sources are not disclosed, could exceed $500 million this year, up from only $6 million in 2004. Known as 501(c)s for the tax law section that covers them, these groups, under current law, must disclose donor information on a confidential basis to the IRS on Schedule B of tax Form 990. But they do not have to identify their donors publicly, which makes the groups attractive to wealthy, publicity-shy individuals with a political agenda to pursue. Representative Pete Roskam, an Illinois Republican steering the bill, said his measure is needed to protect 501(c) donors from having their identities leaked by the IRS. Such leaks could expose them to intimidation by political adversaries and infringe on their free-speech rights, he said. The IRS is ill-equipped to deal with sensitive data, and theres a great deal of vulnerability, Roskam told Reuters. Confidentiality breached chills First Amendment rights.  IRS officials declined to comment. Although Roskams bill is geared to address the concerns of political donors, critics say it will have another impact. State authorities investigating charity fraud sometimes ask nonprofit groups for their Schedule B forms, which can help investigators spot conflicts of interest and suspicious movements of money and in-kind donations between charities.  We would otherwise not have a clue that there was any relationship between charity A and charity B or charity C and D and E and F, said Karl Emerson, former director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Charitable Organizations. Experts said charity scams affect at least 1 percent of annual U.S. giving, or about $3.6 billion a year. Backers of the Roskam bill say Schedule B is not widely used in fraud inquiries. I dont know of one case where a fraud was proven by the IRS having had the Schedule B, said David Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United. Bossies organization won a landmark 2010 Supreme Court case that opened the way to unlimited spending on political campaigns by individuals, corporations, unions and other groups.   Backers of the Roskam bill include Citizens United and billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who donate to a number of politically active nonprofit groups. The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity Foundation and other groups argue that government-mandated disclosure of Schedule B information to state authorities is unconstitutional. The groups have filed lawsuits to stop Democratic attorneys general in California and New York from obtaining Schedule Bs as a part of state-level nonprofit registration procedures. In its lawsuit against California Attorney General Kamala Harris, Americans for Prosperity said more than 1,400 Schedule Bs showed up on a public state website, court documents said. The Roskam bill would preserve some disclosure by requiring nonprofits to continue to report contributions from board members, officers and top salaried employees. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1

Louisiana governor to sign law making police killings hate crimes,"(Reuters) - Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards plans to sign legislation making it a hate crime to kill a police officer or another first responder, bolstering penalties for an offense that already qualifies for the states death penalty, his office said on Tuesday. The legislation adds language to an existing law enhancing penalties for crimes targeting people based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and other identity categories to include actual or perceived employment as a law enforcement officer, firefighter or emergency medical services personnel.     Edwards, a Democrat whose relatives have served as law enforcement officers, is expected to sign the bill sometime this week. The state legislature unanimously approved the measure last week.  Police officers and firefighters often perform life-saving acts of heroism, oftentimes under very dangerous circumstances, and are integral in maintaining order and civility in our society, he said in a statement. The members of the law enforcement community deserve these protections.  Supporters say police officers are facing increased threats simply because they wear a badge. Advocates for the law have dubbed the Louisiana measure Blue Lives Matter, a reference to the color of uniforms often worn by police. The name draws on a prominent national movement, known as Black Lives Matter, which has generated wide protest over the killings of unarmed black citizens by police officers. Yet opponents argued that the bill was unnecessary because state law already makes it a capital offense to kill police officers in the course of duty. Critics say it could weaken the hate crimes law by including a professional distinction that a matter of choice, in contrast to the color of someones skin.  Adding professional categories to the current Hate Crimes statue deters efforts from protecting against identity-based crimes, Allison Padilla-Goodman, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, said in a statement earlier this month. Louisiana would be the first state to use a hate crimes statute to enhance penalties for crimes against police officers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but other states allow for similar outcomes using different approaches.

Senators renew push to overhaul military handling of sex assault,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators renewed an effort on Tuesday to shift the militarys handling of sexual assault cases from top commanders to independent prosecutors, insisting that the current system has left victims too fearful of retaliation to report crimes. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat who has fought to overhaul the system for three years, introduced the legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass annual bill that sets policy for the Pentagon. The measure failed to pass the Senate in March 2014, though Gillibrand, who sits on the armed services committee, said those votes were cast amid false and misleading information the Pentagon used to bolster its own argument. We know far more now about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did a year ago, and its clear that nothing has changed, Gillibrand said at a news conference alongside both Democratic and Republican senators. The current system requires military commanders to handle sexual assault cases within the ranks. Supporters of the bill say the system is flawed because commanders can be unwilling to prosecute such cases and victims, fearing retaliation, are often afraid to report them.  Top military leaders at the Pentagon contend that prosecutions must remain with commanders to maintain good order and discipline. Nobody should be forced to go to their boss to report a rape, Republican Senator Rand Paul said. The bill failed by 55-45 in 2014. Gillibrand said she has attempted to contact every senator who previously voted against the bill and is very hopeful the measure will this time gain the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. I think many senators that weve spoken to are concerned, deeply concerned, she said. The military continues to say, We got this, ... but its not shown in the data. Its not shown in the survivors testimony. She said the bill has not gotten support from Republican Senator John McCain, the chairman of the armed services committee, though she has spoken to him several times about the issue. Samantha Jackson, who said she was raped by her husband when he was in the Army, said the military told the U.S. attorneys office they would investigate, only to drop her case without pursuing charges. Jackson called her treatment a profound betrayal, adding, I dont understand how the Army could fail to hold my rapist accountable. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1
Republican push to impeach U.S. IRS chief hit by Democrats,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A hard-line Republican effort to impeach the top U.S. tax collector came under fire on Tuesday from Democrats who called it an unsubstantiated partisan attack that could undermine the credibility of Congress. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen faces  allegations before the House Judiciary Committee of ignoring congressional subpoenas and misleading lawmakers. The accusations stem from a 2013 scandal in which the IRS was criticized for targeting conservative Tea Party groups applications for tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Some Republicans want the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives to vote on impeaching Koskinen before Congress leaves for its midyear break in July. Democrats oppose the effort.  This resolution fails by every measure. It arises from the worst partisan instincts. It is not based in the facts, Representative John Conyers said at the outset of the first of two Judiciary Committee hearings to examine charges against Koskinen. When a vote for impeachment is divided on party lines ... we undermine our credibility, added Conyers, the panels top Democrat. Koskinen angered critics by declining to testify, but submitted a statement saying the charges are without merit and fail to meet the constitutional impeachment standard of treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors. In his absence, the committee heard from Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which investigated the Tea Party scandal and concluded that Koskinen failed to preserve evidence that was later destroyed. This is really a simple case in my mind. When Congress asks you a question, youre expected to give a truthful answer. When Congress issues a subpoena, compliance is not optional, House oversight panel Chairman Jason Chaffetz testified. Chaffetz described impeachment as the remedy Congress has for officials guilty of breaching the public trust. But Democrats noted that IRS and Federal Bureau of Investigation probes produced no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or deliberate efforts to mislead Congress. They said the case against Koskinen showed little more than agency mismanagement and misstatements. Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte offered no direct criticism of the impeachment push, but avoided using the term other than to name impeachment as one of several options that include the power to write the laws, the power of the purse ... and the power to censure.

Lifting of Vietnam arms ban not aimed at China: Kerry,"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (Reuters) - Washingtons decision to lift its ban on the sale of lethal weapons to Vietnam is not aimed at China, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday, describing the move as very normal and not provocative. Kerry, who is accompanying President Barack Obama on a trip to Vietnam, also urged China to peacefully resolve disputes with its neighbours, including Vietnam, in the South China Sea. Nothing we are doing here is focused on China, Kerry told reporters in Ho Chi Minh City, a day after the lifting of a three-decade-old arms embargo on Vietnam. That is very normal, not out of order and certainly not inflammatory, he said, referring to the embargo. I hope China will read this correctly because our hope is for normal respect for maritime law and for the relationships that are so key in this region.     Kerry called on China to engage diplomatically with Vietnam and other neighbours to resolve disputes over territorial claims in the South China Sea. Chinas island reclamation there has stoked tensions with the United States   I would caution China, as President Obama and others have, to not unilaterally move to engage in reclamation activities and militarization of islands and areas that are part of the claims that are in contest, Kerry added, repeating that the United States welcomed the rise of a strong China. Were not saying China is wrong in its claims, were simply saying resolve it peacefully, resolve it through a rules-based structure, said Kerry. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1
"Democrats, seeking unity, give Sanders say in party platform","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Democratic Party said on Monday it would give U.S. presidential contender Bernie Sanders a prominent say in writing its platform this year, a gesture that could ease tensions between Sanders camp and party leaders, whom Sanders has accused of favoring rival Hillary Clinton.  Sanders has remained steadfast in his long-shot battle with Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, even though he lags her in the delegate count with only a few state contests remaining. The divisiveness among the Democrats stands in contrast to the Republicans, whose party leaders are slowly rallying behind Donald Trump, their presumptive nominee. Sanders tenacity appeared to be paying off. The U.S. senator from Vermont will be allowed to name five members to the 15-member committee that writes the platform at the Democratic National Convention in late July in Philadelphia even if he is not the nominee. Clinton will name six. The party said in a statement the split was based on the results of state votes to date in an effort to make this the most representative and inclusive process in history. The partys chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, will name the committees final four members. The Democratic Partys rules allow the chair to name all 15 members, suggesting the party was trying to accommodate Sanders and his fervent supporters, who still pack rallies by the thousands as he campaigns in California, which will hold its primary on June 7. Sanders did little to dispel the acrimony between himself and the party, which he joined only last year after more than two decades in Congress as an independent, when he said over the weekend he was endorsing Wasserman Schultzs Democratic opponent in her Florida congressional district. On Monday, he repeated some of his criticisms of Clinton, who he has suggested is vulnerable to influence by corporate donors to her campaign, which she denies.  Sanders also told the Associated Press in an interview that if Democratic leaders open the conventions doors to working-class people and young people and create the kind of dynamism that the Democratic Party needs, its going to be messy. Democracy is not always nice and quiet and gentle but that is where the Democratic Party should go, he added. The Clinton campaign said it was pleased to see Sanders represented, describing the party as a big tent. Hillary Clinton is committed to continue welcoming different perspectives and ideas, spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement. Sanders, who has criticized Clinton for being too biased toward Israel, has named a pro-Palestinian activist and a prominent environmentalist among his picks for the committee. Clinton has said she now considers herself the de facto Democratic nominee. Increasingly, she has turned her attention to attacking Trump as a bully when speaking at campaign events while urging Sanders supporters to rally to her side. She told labor union members in Detroit on Monday that if elected, she would embrace issues important to Sanders supporters, including reform of campaign financing and reducing income inequality. Underlining Clintons confidence that she will become the Democratic candidate, her campaign said on Monday she would not participate in a debate with Sanders in California, despite having previously agreed to attend the event hosted by Fox News.     Trump is steadily escalating his criticism of both Hillary and Bill Clintons relationship with women, using rhetoric that has little precedent in U.S. presidential politics.  On Monday, Trump circulated a new online video that shows images of Bill Clinton, the former president, as voices of women play on the soundtrack saying he had assaulted them, before ending with the sound of Hillary Clinton, his wife, laughing. Although none of the women are identified in the video, one of the voices is that of Juanita Broaddrick in an NBC interview from 1999 in which the former nursing-home manager accused Bill Clinton of raping her in a hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1978. The Clintons lawyer, David Kendall, said in 1999 that the accusation was false. The Clintons have declined to discuss the accusation and are ignoring his personal attacks, with Hillary Clinton saying instead she will defend vulnerable Americans from the consequences of Trumps proposals. Trump economics is a recipe for lower wages, fewer jobs, more debt, she told the union members on Monday. He could bankrupt America like he bankrupted his companies. I mean, ask yourself: How can anybody lose money running a casino, really? ",politicsNews,"May 23, 2016 ",1
Vietnamese dissident says prevented by police from meeting Obama,"HANOI (Reuters) - A prominent critic of the Vietnamese government said he was taken by police from his home early on Tuesday so that he would be unable to meet U.S. President Barack Obama in Hanoi with other civil society figures.

Obama says several Vietnam activists prevented from meeting him,"HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said several civil society members in Vietnam were prevented from meeting him on Tuesday and that, despite great strides made by the country, Washington still had concerns about the limits it puts on political freedom. Obama said during a meeting with about six activists that there were significant areas of concern about political freedom and praised those Vietnamese who were willing to make their voices heard. Obama announced on Monday the end of an arms ban on Vietnam, which Washington had long said hinged on the extent to which the countrys human rights record had improved.

Facebook changes policies on 'Trending Topics' after criticism,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Monday that it had changed some of the procedures for its Trending Topics section after a news report alleging it suppressed conservative news prompted a U.S. Congressional demand for more transparency. The company said an internal probe showed no evidence of political bias in the selection of news stories for Trending Topics, a feature that is separate from the main news feed where most Facebook users get their news. But the worlds largest social network said in a blogpost that it was introducing several changes, including elimination of a top-ten list of approved websites, more training and clearer guidelines to help human editors avoid ideological or political bias, and more robust review procedures. Earlier this month, a former Facebook contractor had accused the companys editors of deliberately suppressing conservative news. The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor.  The report led Republican Sen. John Thune to write a letter demanding that the company explain how it selects news articles for its Trending Topics list. (bit.ly/1Tvv3Nm) Two days after Thunes letter, Facebook published a lengthy blogpost detailing how Trending Topics works even though it rarely discloses such practices. Previously, it had never discussed the inner workings of the feature, which displays topics and news articles in the top right hand corner of the desktop homepage for its more than 1.6 billion users. Facebook said its investigation showed that conservative and liberal topics were approved as trending topics at nearly identical rates. It said it was unable to substantiate any allegations of politically motivated suppression of particular subjects or sources. But it did not rule out human error in selecting topics. Our investigation could not fully exclude the possibility of isolated improper actions or unintentional bias in the implementation of our guidelines or policies, Colin Stretch, Facebooks General Counsel, wrote in a company blogpost.  Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg met last week with more than a dozen conservative politicians and media personalities to discuss issues of trust in the social network. In his letter, Thune had called on Facebook to respond to the criticism and sought answers by May 24 to several questions about its internal practices. Any attempt by a neutral and inclusive social media platform to censor or manipulate political discussion is an abuse of trust and inconsistent with the values of an open internet, Thune said.

"U.S., Vietnam agree to allow Peace Corps into Vietnam for first time","HANOI (Reuters) - The United States and Vietnam on Tuesday signed an agreement allowing the U.S. Peace Corps to work in the country for the first time. The signing, which comes amid a historic three-day visit by President Barack Obama, follows more than a decade of negotiations between the two countries to establish a Peace Corps operation in Vietnam. The program, which is expected to begin over the next two years, allows Peace Corps volunteers to teach English in schools in the countrys two largest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, said Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet, who signed the agreement with Vietnams ambassador to the United States, Pham Quang Vinh. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who was present for the signing, said the agreement marked a further normalizing of relations between the United States and Vietnam. For 20 years now we have had what we call a normal relationship, said Kerry, who in 1968 served as a young U.S. naval officer in the Vietnam War.  This is normal, having the Peace Corps being able to move forward, having young Americans come here, not always young, to be able to teach English in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh is the next step forward to building the relationship between the United States and Vietnam, he added. After the signing, Hessler-Radelet turned to Kerry saying: Youve waited for this for a long time. ",politicsNews,"May 24, 2016 ",1
House rejects bill requiring carriers to share phone location,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted down on Monday a measure that would have compelled cell phone carriers to disclose a phones location with law enforcement in the event of an emergency, amid a last-minute lobbying effort from privacy advocates opposed to it. Lawmakers voted 229-158 to pass the Kelsey Smith Act, falling short of the two-thirds threshold necessary due to rules invoked to expedite the bills vote. The rejection was considered surprising, as House leadership rarely schedules a vote on legislation it is not confident will pass. However, Civil liberties groups aggressively opposed the bill on Monday, arguing that while well intended, it would create a warrant loophole and could lead to expanded government surveillance.  R Street, a libertarian-leaning think tank, said phone companies already possess the authority to share cell phone location data in emergency situations and did so frequently, making the legislation largely unnecessary. The bill is named after a deceased 18-year-old Kansas woman who disappeared following a visit to a local Target store in 2007. Smith was found murdered four days later only after Verizon, her cell phone provider, shared the location of her phone with authorities, according to Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican and author of the bill. While Im disappointed in tonights outcome, I look forward to the bill being brought back to the House floor when a simple majority vote can get it passed. Yoder said in a statement. Smiths parents were in attendance in the House chamber during the vote, according to Yoders office. More than 20 states have already adopted versions of the law since Smiths death.

Clinton turns down Fox News offer to debate Sanders again,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, turned down on Monday an invitation by Fox News to debate rival Bernie Sanders in California, despite having agreed previously to a debate in May. We believe that Hillary Clintons time is best spent campaigning andmeeting directly with voters across California and preparing for ageneral election campaign that will ensure the White House remains in Democratic hands, her campaign said in a statement. Sanders had already agreed to participate in the event to be hosted by Fox News, following a series of heated exchanges during their fifth debate in April in New York. I am disappointed but not surprised by Secretary Clintons unwillingness to debate before the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process, Sanders said in a statement. The U.S. senator from Vermont has remained steadfast in his long-shot battle with Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, although he lags her in the delegate count with only a few state contests remaining.Naturally, Fox News is disappointed that Secretary Clinton has declined our debate invitation, Bill Sammon, Fox News vice president and Washington managing editor, said in a statement, especially given that the race is still contested and she had previously agreed to a final debate before the California primary.

Judge halts Ohio law that blocked funds for Planned Parenthood,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A federal judge in Cincinnati temporarily blocked the implementation of a state law that would have effectively de-funded 28 Ohio Planned Parenthood clinics, in a ruling on Monday. U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett granted a two-week stay halting the diversion of federal funding in a ruling on a May 11 lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Southwest Ohio. The Ohio law signed in February by Republican Governor John Kasich stripped $1.3 million in federal taxpayer funds from any healthcare organization that provides abortion services. The law was scheduled to go into effect on Monday. The new rules affected funding for Planned Parenthood programs for mothers and infants health, HIV counseling and testing, and sex education. Planned Parenthood offers abortions in some of its Ohio clinics, but not all of them. In a 20-page opinion, Barrett said the law was enacted to make it difficult for women to obtain an abortion, and said that Planned Parenthood had shown it could successfully win its legal action. He wrote that Planned Parenthood would be forced to end health care and education programs and terminate employees, depriving thousands of Ohioans of high-quality, affordable health care services and education programs. Ohio already has a law barring the use of state funding for abortions. The lawsuit was one of a number of legal actions filed by Planned Parenthood over access to healthcare at its centers since mid-2015, when anti-abortion activists began releasing videos purporting to show group officials negotiating prices for aborted fetal tissue. Ohio Right to Life president Mike Gonidakis chastised Barrett as an activist judge for the ruling. Despite the will of the people, Planned Parenthood will continue to feed at the trough of taxpayer dollars for another two weeks. Today, Planned Parenthoods greed and power are on full display in Ohio, Gonidakis said in a statement. Jerry Lawson, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio, applauded the ruling. This ruling is a victory for the tens of thousands of Ohioans that rely on Planned Parenthood for care each year, he said in a statement. Planned Parenthood attorneys had argued that the new law would be an unconstitutional burden on abortion rights and that it violated the equal protection clause by treating the organization differently from other healthcare providers.

Leading House conservative wants IRS chief impeached,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a hard-line Republican conservative faction in the U.S. Congress wants to impeach the nations top tax officer and said lawmakers could do this without accusing him of any crime. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen should be impeached within weeks, said Jim Jordan, chairman of the House of Representatives Freedom Caucus, in an interview. Jordans demand comes amid numerous Republican attacks on the IRS in recent months. Bashing the tax-collecting agency is a perennial Capitol Hill practice, but Jordan and a handful of other conservatives have been pushing it further than usual. He said Jordan could be impeached simply because he had betrayed the trust put in him by the U.S. public to carry out his job correctly. When someone violates the public trust in such a way as this individual has, and that agency has, then thats what warrants ... impeachment, Jordan said. Impeachment is a formal charge of wrongdoing for a trial that would occur in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is necessary for removal from office. Republicans control only 54 of the 100 Senate seats, making such a vote unlikely. Asked when the House should act, the Ohio Republican replied: I hope before we leave for the summer break.    The IRS said in a statement that Koskinen has provided Congress with full cooperation and truthful testimony and remains focused on serving U.S. taxpayers. On Tuesday, Republicans will detail their complaints about Koskinen at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. Never popular with lawmakers, the IRS angered Republicans in 2013-2014 in a controversy over its handling of applications from conservative political groups for tax-exempt status. The episode caused a shake-up of top IRS personnel. Koskinen was brought in by the Obama administration in late 2013 to restore order. But the House has since approved several bills attacking the IRS and its budget has been sharply cut.      Jordan said a second hearing in June would be about determining the standard for impeachment. The grounds for impeachment listed in the Constitution are treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Koskinen has declined an invitation to testify on Tuesday. He is accused of failing to comply with a congressional subpoena and misleading investigators. Republicans have said his inaction resulted in the destruction of thousands of key emails. Up to now, impeachment has been used against two presidents, a cabinet secretary, a senator and 15 federal judges, according to the Congressional Research Service.   ",politicsNews,"May 23, 2016 ",1
Senate poised to vote to repeal new retirement advice rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday will take up, and likely pass, a resolution to repeal a new Labor Department rule aimed at protecting retirement savers from profit-hungry brokers, a move that President Barack Obama has threatened to veto. A notice sent to senators on Monday showed that a debate and vote on the resolution were scheduled for Tuesday morning, less than a week before the chamber recesses for the Memorial Day holiday. The vote requires a simple majority, which Republicans command in both houses of Congress. The House of Representatives passed its version of the resolution last month, in a vote along party lines.  But the resolution will have a short life span. Obama has threatened to veto legislation undoing a key financial initiative of his second term. His administration in April released the rule to set a fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients best interests ahead of their bottom lines.  Republican leaders and some in the financial industry said complying with the rule would be expensive for brokers and result in higher costs for retirement advice that many Americans could not afford. They also said the rule did not take into account other laws and regulations on financial advice. The Senate fight started early, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, saying on Monday that Republicans wanted to make it easier - easier - for giant Wall Street financial institutions to cheat Americans out of their retirement savings. Speaking on the Senate floor, the advocate for stricter financial regulation also said the vote was motivated by election-year politics and that the resolution will sure help fill up the campaign accounts of the Republican senators who vote for it.

U.S. justices rule against Virginia Republicans in black voters case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court ruling that Virginias Republican-led legislature unlawfully considered race when drawing U.S. congressional districts by packing black voters into one in a move opponents said diluted black electoral clout. The case focused on the composition of a majority-black U.S. House of Representatives district, stretching from Richmond to Norfolk, held by the only black member of Virginias congressional delegation, Democrat Bobby Scott. The justices ruled 8-0 against a group of current and former Republican U.S. House members who challenged a June 2015 lower court ruling that invalidated the districts boundaries after several voters who lived there filed suit in 2013. Virginias Democratic attorney general decided not to appeal the 2015 ruling, but the Republican lawmakers took up the case. The Supreme Court on Monday found that those lawmakers lacked legal standing to bring the case in part because they could not show they were harmed by the lower court decision. The voters who sued in 2013 said Scotts district was racially gerrymandered by state legislators in 2012 to cram black voters into it and reduce black influence in neighboring districts in violation of the U.S. Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of equal protection under the law. Michele Jawando, a lawyer with the liberal advocacy group Center for American Progress, called the ruling good news not only for Virginia voters and voting advocates, but also for other states currently dealing with constitutional issues around their congressional district maps. A just and fair democracy necessitates that all voters can access the ballot without worrying about political games and racial discrimination, Jawando added. Democrats have accused Republican legislators around the country of drawing electoral maps to minimize the influence of black and Hispanic voters, who tend to cast ballots for Democratic candidates. Republicans have accused Democrats in Democratic-led states of using the so-called redistricting process to minimize the clout of Republican-leaning voters. Following the 2015 ruling, the boundaries of an adjoining district, currently represented by white Republican Randy Forbes, were redrawn to add some black voters from Scotts district. This could make the district a possible Democratic pickup in the Nov. 8 election. Forbes is one of the Republicans who appealed to the Supreme Court. Two of the others, Robert Wittman and David Brat, said they had legal standing to bring the case because their chances of re-election would be reduced by having more Democratic voters in their districts.

North Korean envoy rejects Trump overture to meet leader,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps proposal to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a kind of propaganda or advertisement in his election race, a senior North Korean official said on Monday. Trump, in a wide-ranging interview with Reuters in New York last week, said he is willing to talk to the North Korean leader to try to stop Pyongyangs nuclear program, proposing a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation. It is up to the decision of my Supreme Leader whether he decides to meet or not, but I think his (Trumps) idea or talk is nonsense, So Se Pyong, North Koreas ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters on return from Pyongyang after attending the first ruling party congress in 36 years. Its for utilization of the presidential election, thats all. A kind of a propaganda or advertisement, he said. This is useless, just a gesture for the presidential election. There is no meaning, no sincerity, So added. As a candidate, U.S. President Barack Obama made unfulfilled campaign promises to meet the leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK), he said. North Korea conducted a fourth nuclear test in January and launched a long-range rocket in February, triggering tougher international sanctions and the adoption of a more hardline position by South Korean President Park Geun-hye. So, who is also North Koreas ambassador to the U.N.-backed Conference on Disarmament, reiterated that his country was prepared to return to stalled six-party talks on its nuclear program. China and Russia backed the idea, but the United States and its allies South Korea and Japan reject it, he said. As a responsible nuclear state ... we will never use them first, So said. If the United States use their nuclear weapons first, then we have to use also that one.  If the United States gives up their hostile policies and changes their attitude, then we also (can) have relations as a normal country, So said. To South Korea, we proposed high-level military talks but South Korea refused now. South Korea dismissed on Monday a North Korean proposal for military talks as a bogus peace offensive and said it was formally rejecting the overture because it lacked a plan to end the Norths nuclear program. So said that North Korea would not share nuclear technology with other countries. As a responsible nuclear state, we keep and observe the obligations of non-proliferation of nuclear technology.

"Sanders rejects deal on Puerto Rico, offers alternative","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday rejected a bipartisan deal reached in the House of Representatives on legislation to address Puerto Ricos debt crisis, calling it a concession to Wall Street. Breaking with the Obama administration, Sanders called on Senate colleagues to instead back an alternative he has proposed to allow the U.S. territory the same access to restructure its debt in bankruptcy court that is afforded to municipalities. Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives last week unveiled a bill, hammered out in talks between lawmakers from both parties, that included a framework for restructuring Puerto Ricos $70 billion in debt and putting the islands financial operations under the control of a federal oversight board. A House vote is expected in the first week of June, ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due on July 1, but any legislation would have to clear the Senate as well. Democratic congressional leaders have acknowledged disagreements with some parts of the bill but said negotiations had led to a workable compromise, and the Obama administration has urged Congress to quickly pass it. It is critical that Congress pass this as there are very significant bond payments due in July, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said last week. Time is of the essence. Sanders rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, has also backed the legislation. But Sanders, who represents Vermont as an independent but who caucuses with Democrats, said Wall Street would benefit at the expense of Puerto Ricos workers. This legislation looks out for the needs of Wall Street vulture funds first and foremost. That is unacceptable, he wrote in a letter to Senate colleagues on Monday. He cited provisions exempting residents from new overtime protections and allowing minimum wage on the island to dip to $4.25 for a period of up to five years, far lower than the U.S. minimum wage of $7.25.  Instead, Sanders said the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury Department could find other solutions, such as providing loans to Puerto Ricos electric authority and water agency, and directly purchasing new bonds issued by the U.S. commonwealth.

Virginia GOP sues governor over restoring voting rights to felons,"RICHMOND (Reuters) - Virginia Republicans on Monday sued to nullify Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffes order restoring voting rights to 206,000 felons, a move that could affect the November presidential election. The lawsuit in the Virginia Supreme Court asked justices to require the voting registrars not to sign up felons based on McAuliffes April 22 order and to cancel felons registrations since the order was issued. Republicans argued that McAuliffes order was unconstitutional. The lawsuit was headed by leaders of the Republican-controlled state legislature. The Governor is authorized to restore the voting rights of any convicted felon through an individualized grant of clemency, but he may not issue a blanket restoration of voting rights, the lawsuit said. Virginia is considered a key swing state in the 2016 election. The governors order could tip the balance in favor of the Democratic candidate who wins the partys nomination. House Speaker William Howell said in a statement that  McAuliffes order violated 240 years of practice. Governor McAuliffes executive order defies the plain text of the Constitution, flouts the separation of powers, and has no precedent in the annals of Virginia history, Howell said. McAuliffe and other Democrats have hailed the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation as being long overdue. Since signing the order, McAuliffe has said that nearly 80 percent of the felons whose rights were restored are nonviolent offenders who have been free for more than a decade. Caucasian felons made up 51.5 percent of the total whose rights were restored, and African-Americans 45.9 percent. Before McAuliffes order, felons had to petition the governor individually for restoration of their voting rights.  About two dozen states have eased restrictions on felons casting ballots over the past two decades, according to the Sentencing Project, a prison reform advocacy group.

"Looming U.S. abortion ruling could be 'dangerous,' says top attorney","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As a Supreme Court decision on abortion rights is highly anticipated in the United States, few are as uniquely positioned to assess its impact as reproductive rights attorney Kathryn Kolbert, who argued the last major abortion case before the high court. In that 1992 challenge, the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion survived, but the Supreme Court allowed for such state regulations as waiting periods. The decision was written by Justices Sandra Day OConnor and David Souter, who have retired, and Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy is seen as pivotal in the current case which picks up, in a sense, where the earlier case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, left off. This time, the court is deciding if Texas has created an undue burden for women by imposing stiff regulations on abortion clinics and doctors. Critics say the rules are a backdoor means to restrict access to abortion, known as TRAP laws. More than half of Texas clinics have closed, leaving fewer than 20, advocates say, to serve the state of 27 million people. Hardest hit have been rural, poor women for whom distance and cost have put abortions out of reach, they say. Supporters of the laws say they protect womens health, however. The regulations require clinics to upgrade to hospital standards and doctors performing abortions to have formal agreements to admit patients to local hospitals.  Kolbert, who heads the Athena Center for Leadership Studies at New Yorks Barnard College, talked with the Thomson Reuters Foundation about the Supreme Court and abortion rights. She co-founded the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, which is representing Whole Womens Health, the chain of clinics challenging the Texas regulations. THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION: It seems the issues being addressed in the Texas case come out of the Casey case, that the regulations are an undue burden. KOLBERT: The main issue in the case is how the undue burden standard will be interpreted going forward. The whole question comes down to Justice Kennedy and how he sees that standard, and he frankly is much more in the middle. Does he come back to what he articulated in Casey, or is he pushed a little bit to the right with the influence of the other justices? For me, the biggest concern is Justice OConnor, who he clearly listened to, is no longer on the court. TRF: What do you think in essence underlies the abortion issue? KOLBERT: Its an issue that ties together the coalitions on the right, the fundamentalists, the Catholics, the people who basically are business conservatives. Its about power. Its about equality. Theres a lot of pushback in America still about giving women the ability to go beyond what they are, their life as a wife and mother, which is the culturally dominant view.  TRF: TRAP laws are often hard to explain because they seem so benign. KOLBERT: Thats a strategy. Those who are writing these restrictions are looking for things that sound reasonable but in practice are incredibly problematic for women, particularly those who have less political power. So young women and poor women are the first that are going to be affected negatively. If you look at every restriction thats been introduced since 1973, they are all under the guise of reasonableness. TRF: Texas is the case being tested. Is it safe to say there are similar situations in other states? KOLBERT: All over the country, yes. Frankly, if this is upheld the same statute will be enacted in 25 states within three years. Thats what makes it so dangerous. TRF: What are the possibilities of what the Supreme Court could do? KOLBERT: Remember the court has got only eight justices right now, so the option is really one of three. We win five to three, which means that we have (Justice Elena) Kagan, (Justice Stephen) Breyer, (Justice Sonia) Sotomayor, (Justice Ruth) Ginsberg and Kennedy.... Kennedy wrote Casey, so thats a reasonable assumption. The second possibility is that the court would not make a decision right now and would send the case back for taking of additional evidence ... which is what I think of as looking for an out. They could remand the case for a determination of whether or not there are a sufficient number of clinics within the state to handle the excess capacity of women needing abortions that would happen when you close so many clinics. So we could win, there could be an out or we could lose. If the court divided four-four..., then the lower court decision would be upheld. That would be interpreted as a major win for the anti-abortion groups, and we would see laws like this in every state in the country. TRF: If you had to put your money on any of those three options, which one do you see more likely? KOLBERT: I certainly hope that we can keep Justice Kennedy. If not, then I think theyll send it back for more evidence. TRF: Whats it like to argue a case before the Supreme Court?  KOLBERT: Its pretty awesome, its scary. For me though it was all about the women we were representing. Its the doctors and the clinics, the providers who do the hard work, who meet with women facing unintended pregnancies every single day. It was being able to be a spokesperson for them and to explain their plight and explain what theyre going through that was the most gratifying part of the job. ",politicsNews,"May 23, 2016 ",1
Sanders steps up feud with Democratic establishment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cranked up his fight with party leaders on Sunday, backing a challenger to the Democratic National Committees chairwoman and accusing the partys establishment of trying to anoint Hillary Clinton as the nominee for president. In a series of television interviews, Sanders remained defiant despite what he acknowledged was an uphill fight to overtake front-runner Clinton.  Clinton has said she already considers herself the de facto nominee and is increasingly turning her attention to Donald Trump, saying on Sunday that the rhetoric of the presumptive Republican nominee was dangerous. Sanders told ABCs This Week program that Americans should not have to choose between the lesser of two evils in the Nov. 8 election. Sanders said that if he won the White House, he would not reappoint U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chairwoman. He also endorsed law professor Tim Canova, who is challenging the Florida congresswoman in the August Democratic primary. Do I think she is the kind of chair that the Democratic Party needs? No, I dont, Sanders told CBS Face the Nation. Frankly, what the Democratic Party is about is running around to rich peoples homes and raising obscene sums of money from wealthy people. What we need to do is to say to working-class people  we are on your side, he said. The defiant tone by Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has worried some Democrats anxious to see Clinton begin to unify the party and turn her attention to an election showdown with Trump. Clinton painted Trump as a risk of the sort voters had not seen before in an interview with NBCs Meet the Press that aired on Sunday. I do not want Americans, and, you know, good-thinking Republicans, as well as Democrats and independents, to start to believe that this is a normal candidacy, she said. It isnt.  Trump has gained ground in opinion polls as Republicans begin to rally around his candidacy. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Sunday showed Trump with a 2-point lead over Clinton, within the margin of error. In early March, Clinton led Trump by 9 points in the same poll. But Sanders has ignored growing Democratic calls to step aside and repeated his vow to stay in the race until the partys July 25-28 nominating convention in Philadelphia despite Clintons nearly insurmountable lead in pledged convention delegates who will choose the nominee. He said he wanted to do away with superdelegates - party leaders who are free to support any candidate. Their rush to back Clinton even before votes had been cast amounted to an anointment process, Sanders said. He promised to influence the party platform and party rules even if he was not the nominee, but said if Clinton did not move toward his views on reining in Wall Street, reducing income equality and other issues, shes going to have her problems. I dont want to see the American people voting for the lesser of two evils. I want the American people to be voting for a vision of economic justice, of social justice, of environmental justice, of racial justice, he said on ABC. After Sanders endorsement of her opponent, Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that she would remain neutral in the  Democratic presidential race. Democratic worries about party unity were exacerbated by last weekends state party convention in Nevada, where unhappy Sanders supporters disrupted the proceedings in a dispute over rules. That raised fears about possible chaos at the national convention in Philadelphia. But Sanders disputed media reports describing the Nevada incident as violent. What happened is people were rude, thats not good, they were booing, thats not good, they behaved in some ways that were a little bit boorish, not good, but lets not talk about that as violence, he said on ABC. Sanders said he was not encouraging protests at the Philadelphia convention, but of course people have the right to peacefully assemble and make their views heard.     Clinton said in the NBC interview that she would talk to Sanders about his policy demands and take them into account when hes ready to talk. ",politicsNews,"May 22, 2016 ",1

U.S defense secretary apologizes after American charged in Japanese woman's death,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter called his Japanese counterpart on Saturday to express regrets after an American working at a U.S. military base in Japan was arrested on suspicion of dumping the body of a Japanese woman. The case in Okinawa has sparked a protest from Tokyo and could add to resentment of the large U.S. military presence on the island, where Japanese have long been upset by crimes committed by Americans. It also is likely to stir anti-U.S. sentiment as President Barack Obama visits Japan next week. In his call to Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, Carter extended his sincere apologies to the victims family and friends, Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement. He also expressed his sympathies to the people of Japan, the statement said.  A 32-year-old American working at the base on Okinawa admitted to abandoning the corpse of a 20-year-old Japanese woman but did not comment about whether he had killed her, an Okinawa police spokesman said earlier this week. The Pentagon has said the man was a contractor but did not name him. The Pentagon statement said the Defense Department would cooperate with the Japanese government in the investigation and work to prevent similar incidents. Obama is going to Japan for a Group of Seven summit and also will become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima, a city destroyed by a U.S. atomic bomb 71 years ago in World War Two. Okinawa, the site of a bloody World War Two battle, hosts the bulk of U.S. military forces based in Japan since the war     with U.S. installations taking up about 18 percent of the island. Earlier this year, a U.S. serviceman stationed in Okinawa was arrested on suspicion of raping a woman. In the most infamous post-war case involving Americans on Okinawa, three American servicemen raped a 12-year-old girl in 1995. ",politicsNews,"May 21, 2016 ",1
Trump rallies gun owners with fiery anti-Clinton speech,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump assured gun owners on Friday he would protect their constitutional right to bear arms and eliminate gun-free zones if elected, accusing Democrat Hillary Clinton of wanting to weaken gun rights. Trump, who will almost certainly be the Republican presidential nominee, picked up the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, a politically powerful lobbying group which claims more than 4 million members.  Trumps remarks at the NRAs national convention in Louisville, Kentucky, were not a surprise, but they could solidify his status among conservatives who see protecting the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment as a top priority.  Trump also planned to meet on Monday with U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a source close to the Trump campaign said. The two are expected to consult on foreign policy. The source said Corker remains on Trumps list of potential vice presidential running mates. Clinton, who is close to clinching the Democratic Partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election, has vowed to take on the gun lobby and expand gun control measures to include comprehensive background checks for gun buyers, including at open-air gun shows and online. Trump, who is trying to unite the Republican Party behind him after a brutal primary battle, accused Clinton, a former secretary of state to President Barack Obama, of wanting to end the 2nd Amendment, which says in part that the peoples right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment, not change it; she wants to abolish it, Trump said. Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Maya Harris said Trump is peddling falsehoods and denounced Donald Trumps conspiracy theories. She said Clinton believes there are common-sense steps we can take at the federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while protecting the Second Amendment. Trump told the NRA he would eliminate gun-free zones imposed in some areas, noting that the 2015 shooting deaths of four U.S. Marines at an armed forces recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, took place in a gun-free zone. The Second Amendment is on the ballot in November, he said. The only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person you know: Donald Trump. The NRAs convention took place on the same day that a man brandished a gun at a checkpoint near the White House in Washington and was shot and wounded by a law enforcement officer. The New York billionaires NRA speech was another step in his drive to make more conservatives comfortable with his candidacy. Earlier this week, he released a list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees who are conservative jurists, a step well-received on the right. Many conservatives, who had backed other Republican candidates in the 2016 race, worry that Trump is a closet liberal on many issues. But Chris Cox, executive director of the NRAs Institute for Legislative Action, said it was time for them to get over their qualms about the 69-year-old candidate. If your preferred candidate is out of the race, its time to get over it, Cox told the NRA audience. Are there valid arguments in favor of some over others? Sure. Will any of it matter if Hillary wins in November? Not one bit. In another step toward trying to unify the party, Cox has invited members of Congress to a small roundtable discussion with one of Trumps sons, Donald Trump Jr., on Wednesday at the Capitol Hill Club near the U.S. Capitol, a copy of the invitation said.

Trump loaned White House campaign $7.5 million as he nears Republican nomination,"(Reuters) - Donald Trump raised $1.7 million from donors and loaned his White House campaign $7.5 million in April as he moved closer to becoming the Republican nominee for president, according to documents filed with the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Friday. The New York businessman had loaned his campaign a total of $43.5 million as of the end of April, the filings showed. More recently, he has made moves to build up his fundraising operation with an eye toward the Nov. 8 general election. Trump became the Republican Partys presumptive nominee in early May, when both of his rivals dropped out of the race. Trump self-funded much of his primary run, but he has said he will not rely as heavily on his own money for the general election, when he will face the Democratic nominee. Both people seeking the Democratic nomination have raised more than Trump. Hillary Clinton, the partys front-runner, brought in $26.4 million in April, including funds from a joint fundraising effort with the Democratic Party.  An outside Super PAC supporting her campaign raised $8.6 million. A Super PAC is a fund-raising group that must operate separate from political campaigns but can raise unlimited sums. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clintons rival for the Democratic nomination, raised $26.9million in April. He has disavowed Super PACs. Trump has criticized them too, though a long-time Republican operative in May joined one Super PAC backing the real estate mogul. In May, Trump hired investor Steven Mnuchin as his national finance chairman and entered a joint fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee that will allow donors to write much bigger checks. Fridays FEC filings do not reflect these moves, but they show that Trumps fundraising dipped in April, after he brought in about $3 million and loaned himself $11.5 million in March.  He also spent less in April, $9.4 million compared with $13.8 million a month earlier, when more states held nominating contests. Trump spent $2.6 million on advertising in April, less than half the $6.3 million he spent in March. By comparison, Sanders spent $17.3 million and Clinton spent $9.3 million on advertising in April.     Trumps consulting and payroll spending also dropped about 30 percent to a total $1.7 million in April, even as he added experienced political staff. At the end of March, he hired veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort.      Trump ended April with $2.4 million on hand, after starting the month with $2.1 million at the ready.

Some in Oklahoma statehouse urge Obama impeachment over bathroom rule,"OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Republican state lawmakers in Oklahoma have introduced a resolution urging the states congressional delegation to start an effort to impeach President Barack Obama over a White House recommendation that schools accommodate transgender students. The Obama administration told U.S. public schools last week that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. The recommendation upset Republicans and raised the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. The Oklahoma resolution, introduced on Thursday night, calls on the states members of the U.S. House of Representatives to file articles of impeachment against Obama, the U.S. attorney general, the U.S. secretary of education and others over the policy. A vote has not yet been scheduled on the resolution. Legal experts told local media the impeachment call is on shaky ground since the recommendation offered non-binding guidance and did not have the force of law. Lawmakers in the socially conservative state took up another measure on Friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students. That bill, introduced on Thursday night and referred to a Senate committee on Friday, could force schools into costly construction, which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a $1.3 billion state budget shortfall.  State Representative John Bennett, a Republican, said in a statement the White House policy was biblically wrong, and a violation of state sovereignty. The Oklahoma bill would allow for segregation at school restrooms, athletic changing facilities and showers if a request is made to accommodate religious beliefs.   It also allows the attorney general to file lawsuits to implement the changes.  Impeachment advocates say Obama overstepped his constitutional authority. Troy Stevenson, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an LGBT advocacy group said the measure promoted fear-mongering and was out of place In a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth, he said in a statement. The measure was introduced just hours after state lawmakers approved a bill that would make abortions a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for doctors who perform them.  Governor Mary Fallin, an anti-abortion Republican, vetoed the bill because it would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge, her office said. ",politicsNews,"May 20, 2016 ",1
U.S. panel probing Benghazi attack to report within month: chair,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House panel investigating the 2012 Benghazi attack that killed Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans will release its report on the incident in the next month, the congressman leading the inquiry told MSNBC on Friday. Representative Trey Gowdy, who is in charge of the two-year-old investigation in the House of Representatives, told MSNBC the committees report would be finished and released before Republican and Democratic political parties hold conventions in July to nominate candidates for the 2016 presidential elections. Were going to get the report out. Itll be in the next month, Gowdy told MSNBC in an interview, adding that he had wanted to finish the investigation last summer but hadnt been able to get all the documents he needed from the administration. I cant stop an investigation because an executive branch agency wont give me documents, and were still owed documents, Gowdy said, adding the report would say what were missing and which agencies hadnt reported fully. The Republican-led panel has been criticized for allowing the investigation to drag on for so long and accused of politicizing the incident. Hillary Clinton, the leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of state at the time of the attack and Republicans have accused the State Department of being slow to hand over documents it needed.

Oklahoma governor vetoes bill to jail abortion doctors,"(Reuters) - Oklahomas Republican Governor Mary Fallin vetoed a bill calling for prison terms of up the three years for doctors who performed abortions, saying the legislation would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge, her office said on Friday. The bill, which was approved a day earlier in the Republican-dominated legislature, would have made performing an abortion a felony. It also called for revoking the license of any doctor who conducted one. The bill allowed an exemption for an abortion necessary to save the life of the mother. The bill is so ambiguous and so vague that doctors cannot be certain what medical circumstances would be considered necessary to preserve the life of the mother, Fallin said, in a statement from her office, where she was described as the most pro-life governor in the nation. Abortion rights groups had promised a bruising legal battle if the bill were signed into law, which would have resulted in an expensive legal battle.  Cash-strapped Oklahoma is battling a $1.3 billion budget hole that has caused it to cut education funding and other state programs. Had the bill been approved, the state would have been the first to use its codes of professional conduct to implement a measure that would effectively serve as an abortion ban, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which backs abortion rights but whose data is used by both sides of the debate. Other states that have tried to impose outright abortion bans after the Supreme Courts landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision have seen their laws struck down by courts, it said. Supporters have said the bill could withstand a legal challenge because the state was within its rights to set licensing requirement for doctors. Legal experts have said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is legal in the United States and Oklahoma must abide by the courts decision. Since Fallin took office in 2011, Oklahoma has been one of the leaders in adding restrictions to abortions. Governor Fallin did the right thing today in vetoing this utterly unconstitutional and dangerous bill, said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive officer of the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group.

"India's Modi to meet Obama, address Congress next month","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington next month to discuss security and other issues and the Indian leader will be granted the rare honor of addressing both houses of Congress. The White House said Obama and Modi will discuss economic growth, climate change, clean energy, and security and defense cooperation during their June 7 meeting.  It will be Modis fourth trip to the United States since he became prime minister in 2014.    The visit will highlight the deepening of the U.S.-India relationship in key areas, the White House said in a statement on Friday. The two countries partnership is seen as critical in Washington, which is seeking to counterbalance Chinas increasing power.  Modi will address a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress, an opportunity extended to few foreign leaders, the day after the White House meeting, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a tweet. The invitation is a sharp turnaround for Modi, who was once barred from the United States over massacres of Muslims. Last  year there were only two joint addresses to Congress - by Pope Francis and by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, another important U.S. ally in Asia. In 2005, then-U.S. President George W. Bushs administration denied Modi a visa, citing a 1998 U.S. law barring entry to foreigners who have committed particularly severe violations of religious freedom. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots in Gujarat in 2002 when Modi had just become the states chief minister. Modi has denied any wrongdoing, and Indias Supreme Court in 2010 ruled there was no case. Obama, who has adopted a pivot to Asia strategy and is keen to encourage a greater Indian military role in East Asia, quickly dismissed the issue by inviting Modi to the White House as soon as he called to congratulate him on winning the 2014 election. The United States is also keen to encourage greater business and trade with India. Progress has been only gradual, but in late March, the chief executive of U.S. nuclear reactor maker Westinghouse Electric said he expected to sign a deal in June to build six  reactors in India after marathon negotiations that began more than a decade ago. The deal would be the first nuclear commercial power project since the United States and India agreed in 2008 to cooperate in the civil nuclear arena. Westinghouse is owned by Japans Toshiba Corp.

"NRA, the top U.S. gun lobby group, endorses Trump in presidential race","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Rifle Association endorsed Republican Donald Trump for U.S. president on Friday and he responded by promising to serve the countrys top gun lobby group well.  Trump, his partys presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8  presidential election, praised the NRA and took a swipe at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, saying she wants to abolish the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms. The billionaire businessman has opposed gun-free zones and promised to protect Americans rights to self-defense. I will not let you down, Trump told the gathering in Louisville, Kentucky.

"The very idea of a President Trump scares some, bolsters others in Asia","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Donald Trumps isolationist foreign policy pronouncements are feeding insecurity in some Asian nations fearful of Chinas growing power, and risk emboldening nationalists and authoritarians in the region. The real estate developer, who is very close to securing the Republican nomination for Novembers presidential election, has with undiplomatic abandon challenged much of the status quo in U.S.-Asia relations. Overall, his comments have sounded like a death knell for the pivot to Asia strategy adopted by President Barack Obama five years ago. Trump has said U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea should pay more toward their defense, warned he could withdraw U.S. troops from bases in Japan, and mulled whether Japan and South Korea should have their own nuclear arms. This week he told Reuters he is willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which would represent a major shift in U.S. policy.  In a television interview on Friday, Trump told MSNBC that while he was open to talks, he would never go to North Korea.  Trump has also threatened to rein in Chinas big trade surplus with the United States, saying he will threaten to impose heavy duties on Chinese goods. And Trump says he will rip up and then renegotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact agreed to by the U.S., Japan, and 10 other countries in February.  Furthermore, Trumps call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States risks undermining moderate leaders in Muslim countries like Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh. If he becomes president and adopts his own version of foreign policy, the U.S. will cease to be a Pacific power. Thats the end result, said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat, who served in both Beijing and Baghdad.  Its not that we would adopt Japan First, but if the U.S. leaves, there will be a vacuum and  China will try to fill it, said Miyake, research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies. Its a survival issue for all allies of the United States. Trump could, of course, lose the election to the likely Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, who is well known by many Asia policymakers.  And if he is elected he could act much differently in office. But Asian diplomats and policy advisers say that initial impressions count. Trumps idea of making Japan and South Korea pay up rather than enjoy a cheaper ride under the U.S. security umbrella sent shudders through Tokyo and Seoul.  Trump reiterated his stance on Friday. They have a lot of money, both of those nations, he told MSNBC, pointing to Japans auto sales and South Koreas electronics industry. We have to get reimbursed.  In addition, his comments about the possibility of a local nuclear deterrent fanned fears among Asian diplomats that the world could become an even more dangerous place.  It is here that Trump is most scary, Lalit Mansingh, a former Indian ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in New Delhi, though he also noted it may be just election rhetoric.. Japans nationalist-led government has already boosted defence spending and has reinterpreted its pacifist constitution to allow its military to come to the aid of allies under attack even if Japan itself if not attacked, a major shift in Japans post-war security stance. His position is causing anxiety, especially in East Asia, said a senior lawmaker in Japans ruling coalition. It is really hard to comprehend because conservatives have supported a stronger military presence and more engagement. Mansingh said he expects China to test the foreign policy resolve of whoever occupies the White House next, and the South China Sea looms as one of the most likely flashpoints. Tensions over Chinas land-building and installations on islets in the disputed waters flared on Tuesday, when two Chinese warplanes carried out what the Pentagon called an unsafe intercept of a U.S. military reconnaissance aircraft. Theyre building a massive fortress in the South China Sea. Theyre not supposed to be doing that, Trump told Reuters, without saying what he would do about it. At least, according to Mansingh, Chinas leaders and Trump shared the mentality of dealmakers, which could help settle diplomatic wrangles before they get out of hand. Jia Qingguo, an adviser to Chinas government on foreign affairs, said Trump sounds like an isolationist who doesnt want the United States to become too active internationally. So, he doesnt sound that aggressive, said Jia, the dean of the School of International Relations at Chinas elite Peking University. Chinese tend to think that too much so-called internationalism on the part of the U.S. is not that good. A senior Japanese government official said Washington could lose influence in Asia if there was any perception it was softening its stance on issues like the South China Sea. And it would be very difficult to get it back, he warned. Mansingh says those fears are overblown as the United States self-interest lay in protecting access to the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  What would American withdrawal mean? Does it want to hand over the affairs of the world to China? Would that serve anybodys interest? I dont think so. There are also fears that the TPP could unravel, or become worth a lot less to Asian partners, should Trump renegotiate the pact, as he has said he wants to do. The deal has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress, but Obama has warned that delay could allow China to steal a march through its own proposed regional trade deal with 15 other nations.  I think its hard to imagine that TPP would survive a Trump presidency, said a top trade official in a major country in the region, who declined to be more closely identified. Less intervention would be a small benefit compared to the massive damage to the world from a USA that becomes more isolationist and more crassly commercial under Trump, he said.  The lack of priority Trump appears to give to issues that dont serve his America first agenda could mean hell soft-pedal on human rights and democratic values, some critics said. That would come at a time when generals are running Thailand, a strong man has just been elected as president of the Philippines, and Malaysias prime minister has silenced independent media. Lets hope that someone on his team realizes that respect for human rights must be a core U.S. foreign policy value and not just a reality show line, said Phil Robertson, deputy director for Human Rights Watchs Asia division. On the other hand, Panitan Wattanayagorn, an adviser to Thailands defence minister, Prawit Wongsuwon, expressed confidence that Trump wouldnt apply pressure to countries like his. All in all, if Trump arrives, the chances of stronger ties will be good because he would want allies, said Panitan. ",politicsNews,"May 20, 2016 ",1
UK on Trump invite to 10 Downing Street: Not just yet,"LONDON/WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday that British Prime Minister David Cameron had asked him to visit, but a UK spokesman said no invitation had been extended. The apparent crossed signals were the latest sign of tension between the presumptive Republican Party nominee and the leader of a major U.S. ally, who has criticized Trumps call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump, in a morning interview with MSNBC, said Cameron extended the invitation to visit 10 Downing Street two days ago and that he might do it. He gave no other details. A spokesman for Camerons office said it was a longstanding practice for the prime minister to meet with the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees if they visited Britain.  Given the parties have yet to choose their nominees, there are no confirmed dates for this, the spokesman said. However, a Downing Street source said a formal invite would not be sent out to presidential candidates.        Trumps comments followed a transatlantic exchange between the two men over Camerons criticism.  In December, Cameron called Trump divisive, stupid and wrong and suggested Trump would unite Britain against him if he visited the United Kingdom.  After Trump clinched his partys nomination this month, Cameron acknowledged the achievement but said he stood by his earlier comments and would not apologize.  Trump fired back this week, saying on Monday that he was likely not to have a good relationship with Cameron.    But the next day he said he expected to have a good relationship and on Friday Trump said Cameron had invited him to London. I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think hes a nice guy. I will do just fine, Trump told MSNBC. But they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street - and I might do it. Cameron has said he will work with the winner of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election and is committed to maintaining the special U.S.-UK relationship, his spokesman has said. Trumps proposed ban also drew criticism from Sadiq Khan, who was elected mayor of London this month and is the first Muslim to hold the post. Khan said last week that Trumps ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe. ",politicsNews,"May 20, 2016 ",1
Lawmakers vote down LGBT rights measure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shouts of Shame, shame, shame, erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors. The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough yes votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber. But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212. All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 no votes were from Republicans. Eight House members - three Republicans and five Democrats - did not vote. Lawmakers are allowed to change their vote in the few minutes between voting and the result being declared.     LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates bakers religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people. Democrats chanted Shame, shame, shame, at Republicans. House Republicans are so committed to discriminating against LGBT Americans, that they broke regular order to force their members to reverse their votes and support Republicans bigotry, Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said in a statement. Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory. Thursdays emotionally-charged vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included religious freedom language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language. The House also backed by 265-159 a separate Democratic amendment to the spending bill that limits the display of the Confederate battle flag on flagpoles at federal veterans cemeteries. The measure angered some conservative Republicans from southern states, who argue that the flag is a symbol of their heritage. Some lawmakers have been seeking to limit displays of the Confederate banner since a racially motivated murder of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S.C.  last year.

"Trump's Supreme Court list: all conservative, some provocative","Scroll to the bottom of the page for an interactive graphic.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - William Pryor, in urging the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 to uphold a Texas law banning gay sex, argued against the notion that the U.S. Constitution should safeguard a persons choice of partners.  Pryor, who then was Alabamas attorney general and now serves on a federal appeals court, was one of 11 conservative jurists who presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has named as people he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court, if elected.  A constitutional right that protects the choice of ones partner and whether and how to connect sexually must logically extend to activities like prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia, Pryor said in a legal filing to the Supreme Court.  Pryor has a record of provocative remarks, as do some others on Trumps list. But many have established solid conservative judicial records that likely would appeal to Republicans in the Senate, which has the power to confirm Supreme Court nominees, and have steered clear of inflammatory rhetoric.  Trumps list, unveiled on Wednesday, included judges who have indicated support for various conservative causes, range in age from 41 to 58 and hail primarily from conservative and Republican-governed states. The eight men and three women all are white.  The lists release seems to have reassured some conservatives who may have doubted Trump would name a genuine conservative to the high court, which has a vacancy following the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.  Ive heard nothing but positive about this. People in the Senate say this is going to relieve a lot of people, said Republican Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a key Trump supporter in the Senate.  The Republican-led Senate has refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obamas nominee, Merrick Garland, arguing the winner of the Nov. 8 election to determine Obamas successor should get to fill the post. Scalias replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, now evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals.  Don Willett of Texas is one of five state supreme court judges on the list. His job is an elected one.  Don Willett helped defend the right of Texas to display the (Bibles) Ten Commandments and fought the liberals who tried to remove the words under God from our pledge of allegiance, his campaign said in a 2012 advertisement.  Before becoming a judge, Willett was part of Texas legal team that won a Supreme Court battle to display the Ten Commandments on a monument in the state Capitol despite opponents concerns that it amounted to government endorsement of a religion.  During Pryors stint as Alabama attorney general from 1997 to 2004, he described the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide as the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.  Some of the judges on Trumps list have ruled against abortion and birth control rights.  Federal appeals court judges Diane Sykes, Steven Colloton and Pryor all ruled in favor of Christian objections to the mandate under Obamas healthcare law that health insurance covers birth control for women.  Federal appeals court judge Raymond Gruender wrote a 2012 ruling upholding a South Dakota law that requires doctors to inform patients that women who have abortions are more likely to commit suicide. Colloton, who sits on the same court, joined the opinion.  As on abortion and contraception, the U.S. Supreme Court is closely divided on the scope of the individual right to bear arms under the Constitutions Second Amendment.  In a 2013 case, Thomas Hardiman, another federal appeals court judge, dissented when the majority on his court upheld a New Jersey law regulating the possession of handguns in public. Hardiman endorsed a broad reading of Second Amendment gun rights that would protect carrying weapons outside the home for self-defense.  The list also includes David Stras, a member of Minnesotas Supreme Court. In 2014, that court waded into the contentious subject of when a person who is incapacitated may be taken off life support and allowed to die.  The court ruled, in the case of a 57-year-old man with irreversible brain damage, that a guardian who was given medical-consent power could authorize the removal of life-sustaining treatment when interested parties agreed it would be in the incapacitated persons best interest.  Stras dissented, writing that because the man had already died when the case was heard, the matter was moot and the court should have stayed out of it.  ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
Arizona governor declares victory in $3.5-billion education vote,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizona voters have narrowly approved a plan to pump $3.5 billion into education coffers over the next decade and put an end to a long-running legal battle, Republican Governor Doug Ducey said late on Thursday. The measure, approved by state lawmakers and Ducey last year, provides for Arizona to tap its land trust fund and provide an additional $300 for each student, from kindergarten through 12th grade, in public and charter schools. Arizona has historically ranked near the bottom of states in funding education. The latest unofficial results from Tuesdays special election showed the measure garnering 50.82 percent of votes cast throughout the southwestern U.S. state, and while some 30,000 votes remained to be counted, Ducey declared victory. This is a huge victory for public education in Arizona, Ducey said in a statement. After years of lawsuits and fighting, we are moving forward and funding our teachers, students and schools  instead of lawyers. Voter approval was required because the measure involved a change to the states constitution. The narrow margin of the result proved that a sizeable number of voters disliked the plan, said Morgan Abraham, chairman of the No campaign. This tells me that voters want to fund education the right way, not through the trust fund, but with general funds, Abraham said, adding that he was disappointed by the outcome of the vote. Much of the controversy during the campaign centered on the funding, with critics saying Arizona was jeopardizing its future by taking too much money from its land trust fund. About 60 percent of the new money will come from the trust fund, and the rest from the states general fund. The governors office brokered the deal in a bid to end a 2010 lawsuit by a group of school districts and organizations that charged Arizona with failing to fund mandated inflation adjustments to schools during a recent recession.  The states highest court already had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and the court case was being appealed by the state at the time of the deal. ",politicsNews,"May 20, 2016 ",1
"Obama grapples with Vietnam arms ban, human rights on eve of trip","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is still grappling with a historic decision on whether to lift the U.S. arms embargo on Vietnam just days before he travels there, the White House said on Thursday, signaling that human rights concerns could be a sticking point. Support has grown within the U.S. administration and on Capitol Hill to fully remove or at least further ease the ban on weapons sales, bolstering ties between former wartime enemies Washington and Hanoi to counter a rising China. But Obama also faces stiff opposition in some quarters. Ending the embargo - something Vietnam has long sought - would sweep away one of the last major vestiges of the Vietnam War era as Obama makes his first trip there beginning on Monday. It would also anger Beijing, which condemned Obamas partial lifting of the ban in 2014 as interference in the region. The U.S. deliberations come amid increased  tensions in the disputed South China Sea. Beijing demanded an end to U.S. surveillance in the area on Thursday after two of its fighter jets carried out what the Pentagon said was an unsafe intercept of a U.S. military reconnaissance aircraft. Ben Rhodes, Obamas deputy national security adviser, said the administration has not yet finalized a decision on lifting the three-decade-old embargo but dodged a question on when  or even whether  an announcement might be made soon. It will be a subject of discussion with the Vietnamese, he told reporters in a preview of Obamas trip, saying the president would explain his thinking to the countrys communist leadership. Its something that we obviously have been looking at  in the context of our broader relationship. White House officials made clear that the final decision would be linked in part to Vietnams human rights situation. Concerns remain, especially among rights advocates and some U.S. lawmakers, over the governments heavy-handedness toward political opponents and treatment of workers. There is also worry that Washington will lose some leverage if it gives up the arms embargo without securing concessions for reforms. Still, some of Obamas aides are mindful that a failure to satisfy Vietnams calls for rescinding the ban could inject a sour note into a visit meant to open a new chapter in security and economic relations. Some Vietnamese officials are suspicious that the United States seeks to undermine their one-party rule. What we want to demonstrate with this visit is a significant upgrade in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam as partners on many issues even as we have significant areas of difference, Rhodes said. Obama, who will make stops in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, will meet Vietnams new president, Tran Dai Quang, as well as its new prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong. He will also meet dissidents and will deliver a speech to the Vietnamese people, Rhodes said U.S. officials say that no matter the decision on the weapons ban they expect Obamas visit to yield tangible steps to boost military cooperation. Washington is looking for increased port visits by U.S. warships, possibly including access to the strategic port at Cam Ranh Bay, and to holding naval exercises, according to a person close to U.S. thinking on the subject.

Incoming U.N. climate chief seeks swift action: at odds with Trump,"OSLO (Reuters) - The United Nationss incoming climate chief said on Thursday she will push for rapid action under a U.N. accord to slow global warming and expressed hopes that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will drop calls for a renegotiation if elected. Mexicos Patricia Espinosa, a former foreign minister appointed on Wednesday to head the Bonn-based U.N. Climate Change Secretariat from July, urged all governments swiftly to ratify the 195-nation accord hammered out in Paris in December. She told Reuters that its not impossible that the agreement, seeking to transform the global economy away from fossil fuels this century, could enter into force as early as this year, giving it strength in international law. Espinosa is at odds with Trump, who is skeptical that man-made emissions cause climate change. He told Reuters on Tuesday that he was not a big fan of the Paris accord and that at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements. Asked about Trumps threat, Espinosa said the Paris deal was a hard-won compromise by more than 190 nations. It would not be easy for anybody to just say I want to renegotiate this, she said. Nations who agreed in Paris range from top greenhouse gas emitters China and the United States, small island nations fearful of rising sea levels and OPEC members who depend on income from oil. Renegotiation is really not a scenario that in a multilateral process you can see as something feasible, she added. Espinosa said she would be respectful of everybody who has a role to play in any country but at the same time seek to build momentum for action. Many other backers of the accord have expressed dismay at Trumps call. The Paris Agreement will enter into force once 55 nations responsible for 55 percent of global emissions formally ratify the deal.  So far, 16 nations have ratified, accounting for just 0.03 percent of emissions. Many nations, including China and the United States which together represent 38 percent of emissions, say they will join this year.  Espinosa, 57 and now Mexicos ambassador to Germany, will succeed Christiana Figueres of Costa Rica, who is stepping down after six years.  Espinosa said she also will seek to link action to curb climate change to all aspects of development in coming years. She agreed with Figueres, who has said governments will have to toughen existing pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit a rise in temperatures linked to more droughts, floods and rising seas. I think its possible but very difficult, not reachable with the commitments we have on the table, Espinosa said of the toughest goal in the Paris Agreement, to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

"Trump delegate indicted on weapons, child pornography charges","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Maryland man who is a delegate for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been indicted for illegally shipping explosives, owning a machine gun and producing child pornography, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. Caleb Bailey, 30, was indicted by a grand jury in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Wednesday. He was elected to be a delegate for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and is still listed as one on the states board of elections website.  Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, confirmed Bailey had been indicted and told Reuters the party was asking Bailey to resign from the delegation. I dont know too much about him beyond what Ive read, said Cluster, who declined to comment further. Bailey had hundreds of illegal weapons stored in a bunker beneath his garage, including dozens of machine guns, smokeless grenades and gas canisters, along with ready-to-eat meals, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Telephone calls and emails seeking comment from Bailey, from the Trump campaign and from the Maryland board of elections were not returned on Thursday. Trump has been working to unify the Republican party going into its presidential nominating convention in Cleveland in July. In March, a New Hampshire man who co-chaired Trumps veterans coalition in the state was extradited to Nevada to face charges of helping organize the high-profile 2014 armed standoff with federal agents at the ranch of Cliven Bundy. The four-count indictment against Bailey alleges that he used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct to produce child pornography and illegally owned a machine gun. Authorities became aware of Bailey after he tried to ship explosives and ammunition from Maryland to Wisconsin through the U.S. mail in February, said an affidavit filed by a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  Some of the types of cartridges Bailey was sending to Wisconsin are no longer used by the U.S. military because they are too dangerous, the law enforcement official said, so shipping them was not only illegal, but posed a significant public risk. The Wisconsin recipient is under investigation as well, according to the official. Bailey attempted to ship five such packages in total, but one broke open at the post office, prompting the facility to call law enforcement, according to the affidavit.

House seeks to tighten restrictions on Pakistan aid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are looking to use a defense policy bill to increase restrictions on military aid for Pakistan, expressing frustration with what they see as Islamabads failure to crack down on Afghanistans militant Haqqani network. The $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, passed by the House of Representatives late on Wednesday would block $450 million in aid to Islamabad unless it does more to fight the network, which lawmakers see as a major threat to U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  The bill requires the Pentagon to certify that Pakistan is conducting military operations to disrupt the Haqqani network, not letting the network use North Waziristan as a safe haven and actively coordinating with Afghanistans government to fight the network along their border. As they finalized the 2017 version of the annual bill, House members added three amendments related to Pakistan. All passed by unanimous voice vote. One added a fourth requirement to the release of the aid, that the administration certify Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani network senior leaders and mid-level operatives. Another required that the Secretary of Defense certify  Pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment provided by the United States to persecute minority groups. And a third added a sense of Congress that Shakil Afridi is an international hero and calls for his immediate release from prison. Afridi is a Pakistani doctor believed to have helped the CIA hunt down Osama bin Laden. Pakistan sentenced Afridi in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to a militant group, which he denies. That sentence was overturned and Afridi is now awaiting trial on another charge. Pakistan says its courts will decide Afridis fate, and has angrily criticized U.S. politicians, including Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, over calls to release him. The House version of the NDAA is not the final version of the legislation. It must be combined with a Senate bill before being sent to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign, or veto. However, there is also strong criticism of Pakistan in the Senate. This month, Senator Bob Corker used his authority as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to bar the use of any U.S. funds for Pakistan to buy American F-16 fighter jets.

"Bipartisan Puerto Rico crisis bill introduced, debt looms","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legislation to help address Puerto Ricos unpayable debt burden, which now threatens a full-blown humanitarian crisis. Released close to midnight on Wednesday, the House Natural Resources Committees revised bill includes a strong oversight board to direct how and when the island pays its bills and leaves many earlier proposals in place.  Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its roughly $70 billion in debt while trying to cope with a 45 percent poverty rate among its 3.5 million U.S. citizens. In addition, it is reeling from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. Language allowing Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, known as a cram-down, remains. The bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders, but the language remains muddied, one analyst surmised. Tonight, we introduced legislation to responsibly address the crisis in Puerto Rico. The revised bill incorporates technical refinements and input from all stakeholders, committee Chairman Rob Bishop said in a statement. For a link to a factbox on the bill, click. While both Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives welcomed the bill after several delays, how more conservative Republican lawmakers view the legislation is an open question. A vote on the bill by the House is expected in the first week of June, ahead of a looming $1.9 billion debt payment due on July 1. In recent months, the debt crisis has threatened a deepening humanitarian crisis as hospitals close wards, social services decline and emigration saps more economic activity. After long bipartisan negotiations, we believe we have achieved a restructuring process that can work, U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Thursday. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who faces opposition to the bill from within his own Republican ranks, highlighted the bipartisan effort as he will need Democrat votes to get it passed. Right now, the stability of the U.S. territory is in danger, as the Puerto Rican government continues to default on major loan payments. We have insisted that our response meet basic principles, and first among them is protecting taxpayers from a bailout, Ryan said in a statement. The bill, formally known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), seeks to return the island to solvency, rebuild a base for economic growth and maintain its ability to access capital markets in the future. The White House called the bill an important first step in creating a fair process for restructuring Puerto Ricos debt and economy after a decade of recession. The U.S. territorys governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, said he was encouraged by the bill but chafed at the oversight board, which he believes undermine the islands self-governance. Choosing the members of the oversight board has been a sticking point in the talks leading up to the introduction of the bill. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Thursday he was pleased the bill includes restructuring tools for Puerto Rico that are comprehensive and workable but expressed disappointment that proposals to promote economic growth were left out of what he called a tough bipartisan compromise.        In the early drafts of the bill, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, said he was not satisfied, meaning a potential hurdle for passing the bill could remain. A conservative Tea Party favorite, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, said he was reviewing the bill but told Reuters he thought a majority of Republicans would support it through both houses of Congress. Many creditors lobbied for a bill that does not create new precedents for how they might be treated in a restructuring which would potentially set up future legal fights on the U.S. mainland that are far away from the islands current crisis. The bill, which creates a control board and allows for bankruptcy, is highly controversial and does not definitively protect any creditors. We believe the legislation is more positive for both GO and COFINA creditors than the legislation previously under review, wrote Heights Securities analyst Daniel Hanson. Hanson said the bill lacks clarity over the treatment of constitutionally protected bondholders versus pensioners. A local bondholder group said it supported the bill. As imperfect as it may be, the bipartisan bill is the pause that is desperately needed so everyone can come together to forge a bright future for all Americans living in Puerto Rico, said Jorge Irizarry, president of the Backyard Bondholders, which represents more than 60,000 resident bondholders in Puerto Rico.   GO, or General Obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the island and are senior to all debt, while COFINA debt is backed by sales tax revenues. This territories-clause bill, which will bring all creditors to the table and establish a strong and independent fiscal oversight board, should appeal to conservatives who were concerned about a bailout or contagion, the COFINA Senior Bondholders Ad Hoc Group said in a statement.  Investors bid up prices on Puerto Ricos benchmark July 2035 GO debt to 66, a gain of 0.50 point in price to yield 12.797 percent, according to MSRB data. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
Illinois Senate passes grant program for needy college students,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Illinois Senate on Thursday earmarked $227.2 million for low-income college students whose need-based financial aid has been imperiled by the states 11-month budget impasse. But Republican Governor Bruce Rauner offered no sign of supporting the measure for Monetary Award Program recipients after members of his party pilloried the funding package as a farce because it did not identify a specific revenue stream to pay for it. Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelley declined to say whether the governor intends to sign or veto the legislation, saying only Governor Rauner remains committed to reaching a balanced budget alongside meaningful reforms in a bipartisan manner. Illinois public universities and community colleges and the MAP program have only received a fraction of what they had expected from the state since July because Rauner and the Democratic-led legislature have yet to agree on a Fiscal 2016 spending plan. A stopgap $600 million higher-education funding package enacted by Rauner last month offered some relief, but an early-May effort to appropriate an additional $454 million on top of the April total stalled in the Illinois House of Representatives after passing the Senate. In fiscal 2015, the last year in which Illinois had a full operating budget, the state appropriated $357.1 million to the MAP program. That amount provided for income-based grants of up to $4,968 to 128,399 students, the Illinois Student Assistance Commission reported.   State Senator Donne Trotter, a Chicago Democrat and the legislations chief sponsor, said the package would ensure that our students can relieve themselves of some of the drama theyve been going through this year because of the inaction by this body and the governor in passing a budget. But Republicans ripped the plan, with Senator Chapin Rose, a Republican from Mahomet, Ill., about 200 miles south of Chicago, accusing the Senate majority of writing a check that it darn well knows cannot be cashed. The Senate passed the bill 39-15, with two members voting present - enough to override any potential Rauner veto. But the 68-45 margin during a Tuesday House vote fell three votes short of a veto-proof majority, meaning Rauner could kill the measure if he chose to. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
Clinton calls Trump too unsteady to be president,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton pivoted to a general election match-up against Republican candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he is dangerously unpredictable and not qualified to be president. Confident that she is finally close to defeating U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination, Clinton turned heavy fire on Trump, who has been running about even with her in national polls of voters looking ahead to the Nov. 8 presidential election. On the Republican side, Trump promoted top aide Paul Manafort to serve as campaign manager and chief strategist, the Trump campaign said. Corey Lewandowski, the Trump aide who has been campaign manager, retains that title and will continue to oversee day-to-day operations, the campaign said. In addition, Trump has hired veteran Republican lawyer A.B. Culvahouse to help vet potential vice presidential running mates, a source close to the campaign said. In a CNN interview, Clinton used the example of the apparent downing of an EgyptAir plane from Paris to Cairo to say that Trump would lack the skills to bring together U.S. allies to respond to global threats. I know how hard this job is and I know we need steadiness, as well as strength and smarts in it, and I have concluded that he is not qualified to be president of the United States, Clinton said. Trump, the Republicans presumptive presidential nominee, has been intensifying his criticism of Clinton by lobbing personal attacks at her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.  Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, said she would resolutely refuse to respond to Trumps goading. He can say whatever he wants, she said. But she said the EgyptAir crash reinforces the need for American leadership and that Trumps proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States has sent the wrong signal to countries that Washington will need to work with in the fight against Islamic militants. He says a lot of things that are provocative, that actually make the important task of building this coalition, bringing everybody to the table and defeating terrorism more difficult, she said. It sends a message of disrespect and it sends a message that makes the situation inside those countries more difficult. Clinton suggested the Democratic race was over because of her nearly insurmountable lead in delegates to the nominating convention, despite Sanders insistence on staying in the race. I will be the nominee for my party, she said. That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I wont be. She said Sanders will have to eventually help her unify the Democratic Party after the prolonged nomination fight. I am absolutely committed to doing my part, more than my part. But Senator Sanders has to do his part, she said. The Sanders campaign rebuffed Clintons nudge to get out of the race, pointing to his recent victories. In the past three weeks voters in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton. We expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said. Trump stepped up efforts to rally Republican loyalists behind his campaign after winning a divisive primary fight that left the party ruptured. On Capitol Hill, Manafort and other Trump aides met with conservatives in the House of Representatives who are members of the Freedom Caucus group and canvassed them for policy ideas. Manafort was reaching out for ideas on policy, and several Freedom Caucus members made suggestions, said Republican Representative Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee. It went very well, it was encouraging. I think the Trump team recognizes the relevance of the Freedom Caucus, and the influence they have. I think actually, despite some early skepticism by some members, I think the (Freedom Caucus) board received Manafort and his representation of Trump very well, DesJarlais said. Manafort also met with U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a Tea Party Republican who was a big backer of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for president. Lee has expressed some concerns about Trumps candidacy.  A spokesman for Lee said U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a key Trump adviser, was also at the meeting. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
California Senate passes gun control package,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The California Senate on Thursday passed a sweeping package of gun control bills that would require background checks for ammunition purchasers, ban possession of high-capacity magazines and establish a firearms violence research center. The bills, whose passage through the Assembly are far from assured, are at the heart of a political duel between Senate leader Kevin de Leon and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, who are proposing competing plans in advance of key election campaigns. Gun violence has reached epidemic proportions across our nation, de Leon, who represents Los Angeles, said as he introduced the bills on the Senate floor on Thursday. We cannot stand by while our communities suffer from this horrific violence. The package of eight bills would ban the possession of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds, make stealing a gun a felony, limit the lending of guns among family members, and close a loophole in the states assault weapons ban. It is uncertain whether the bills will pass the Assembly, where Republicans and conservative Democrats have blocked some of the same measures in the past, or be signed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who has vetoed some gun control measures. The Senate bills were fast-tracked through the legislature this week, even as state officials are counting signatures and preparing to place on the November ballot a referendum by Newsom that would accomplish many of the same goals. The competing measures are a sore point between the two powerful politicians that could spill into the November election campaign as well as the race to replace Brown in 2018. De Leon, who said Thursday that Newsom based his ballot initiative on de Leons own proposals, has asked the lieutenant governor to agree to withdraw his ballot measure should the Senate bills pass. But Newsom, who is running for governor, has refused. His campaign strategist, Dan Newman, said Thursday that the initiative was more comprehensive than the legislative package and should go before voters in the fall. Newsom is expected to make the gun control initiative a centerpiece of his campaign to replace Brown in 2018, along with a proposed referendum to legalize recreational use of marijuana. De Leon has not endorsed Newsom. He is close to possible Newsom rivals in the governors race, including former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Puerto Rico debt crisis bill keeps oversight board,"NEW YORK/SAN JUAN (Reuters) - The U.S. House Natural Resources Committee early on Thursday released long-delayed revised legislation to address Puerto Ricos fiscal crisis, which is threatening to become a full-blown humanitarian disaster. The bill, also known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), has two major aims: setting out a framework for restructuring the islands $70 billion in debt and putting the islands financial operations under the control of a federal oversight board. Severe economic decline, an accumulation of operating deficits, lack of financial transparency and management inefficiencies, combined with excessive borrowing, created a fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico, the legislation states. Puerto Ricos next debt payment of $1.9 billion, which its governor has said it cannot pay, is due on July 1. A vote in the House is expected the first week of June. * A Financial Oversight and Management Board, consisting of seven members appointed by the president of the United States from recommendations provided by the leaders of the U.S. House and Senate. One member is appointed at the sole discretion of the president. Appointments are due by Sept. 30, 2016. * The board has the authority to enforce balanced budgets and government reform if the Puerto Rican government fails to do so, including the sale of government assets, the consolidation of agencies and reduction of workforce.  * The boards aims are to generate management plans that achieve fiscal responsibility, maintain access to capital markets and ensure funding for public services and pensions; and to help facilitate consensual debt restructuring talks between Puerto Rico and its bondholders. * The board will have subpoena power to seek testimony and information. Board members will not be paid a salary. * A fiscal plan should be no less than five years. It can be developed either by the governor, the Oversight Board or both in collaboration. * Neither the governor of Puerto Rico nor the islands  legislature can exercise control over the board or pass laws that would inhibit its functioning. * The oversight board will dissolve once Puerto Rico has attained adequate and reasonable access to credit markets and achieves four consecutive fiscal years of budgetary compliance without spending more than it earned. * The bill adopts certain provisions of U.S. bankruptcy law, including giving Puerto Rico access to a court-sanctioned debt restructuring law, under which it could, in certain circumstances, impose debt cuts without creditors consent, so-called cram-downs.   * The bill also empowers the oversight board to hold consensual debt restructuring talks, in hopes of reaching  collective action compromises that do not require cram-down. For a restructuring to be approved under the bills collective action clause, two-thirdsof the outstanding principal amount of the bonds in each pool of debt must vote in favor of it.  * PROMESAdoes not directly put Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, under the bankruptcy laws enjoyed by U.S. states.This addresses concerns that actions taken in the commonwealth could bleed over and affect long-standing municipal bankruptcy laws. * Any prior voluntary debt restructuring agreements will be left intact. This essentially leaves in place the current voluntary restructuring agreement between creditors and PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority)  * Certifying a restructuring of debt requires approval by five out of seven members of the oversight board.  * The U.S. government will not pledge its full faith and credit for repaying Puerto Ricos debt. This provision addresses concerns the bill would amount to a financial bailout by Washington. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
U.S. judge upholds Virginia's voter ID law,"RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Thursday upheld a 2013 Virginia law requiring prospective voters to show an approved photo identification before they cast their ballots. The states Democratic Party had challenged the law, signed by former Republican Governor Robert McDonnell, saying it was politically motivated and intended to deter young and minority voters from turning out on Election Day. The courts mission is to judge not the wisdom of the Virginia voter ID law, but rather its constitutionality, wrote U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson in his decision. While he noted that the measure created an inconvenience for potential voters who did not have drivers licenses or other government-issued ID, he said that was not enough to strike it down. While the merits of this voter identification law, and indeed all aspects of Virginias voting regime, can be reasonably debated, it remains true that Virginia has created a scheme of laws to accommodate all people in their right to vote, Hudson wrote.  Lawyers representing the state Democratic Party said in a filing that the Republican-dominated state legislature passed the photo ID law to stall, if not reverse, the growing success of the Democratic Party in Virginia. The state argued that ID was necessary to ensure that only registered voters cast ballots and to prevent voter fraud. In 2008, President Barack Obama became the first Democrat to carry Virginia in more than 40 years, in part because of turnout among black, Latino and young voters. Obama carried the state again in 2012. In the most recent statewide elections, Democrats also swept all top offices: governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. Moreover, the states two U.S. senators are both Democrats. Hudson acknowledged that Virginia, a former slave state, has an unfortunate history of racial and statutory artifice to hinder black voting. The ruling comes a month after another federal judge upheld a similar requirement in neighboring North Carolina. A federal court this week ordered Kansas toregister thousands of eligible voters who have been blocked from registering. That ruling resulted from an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed on behalf of Kansas residents who tried to register to vote through the Kansas Department of Motor Vehicles and had been forced to provide additional documentation of citizenship.

Senate approves $1.1 billion to fight Zika virus,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An election-year fight over addressing the spreading Zika virus intensified in the U.S. Congress as the Senate on Thursday approved $1.1 billion in emergency money one day after the House of Representatives voted $622.1 million financed through cuts to existing programs. The two chambers would have to reach agreement on a spending level before they can send it to President Barack Obama, who in February requested $1.9 billion. The White House has called the House measure woefully inadequate and has threatened to veto it. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington State urged Congress to act quickly, saying, This is a public health emergency and Congress should treat it like one.  The Senate will enter negotiations with the House with a strong hand: a bipartisan 68-30 vote in favor of the emergency funds to battle Zika, a virus that has been spreading rapidly through the Americas, with more than 100 confirmed cases in the U.S. state of Florida. However, the conservative group Heritage Action is lobbying against any Zika funding bill that is not paid for with an equal amount of spending cuts. The Senates funding was attached to an unrelated transportation and housing appropriations bill that also passed the chamber on Thursday. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.     Conservative Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah tried unsuccessfully to kill the Senate funding, saying the Obama administration already had enough money to deal with Zika. What we should not do, however, is allow the Zika virus to be yet another excuse to run up the national debt, Lee said. But Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican, countered that U.S. debt problems were rooted in the rapid growth in the cost of huge programs such as Social Security and Medicare and not so-called discretionary spending like on Zika.

Trump identifies 11 potential Supreme Court nominees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled the names of 11 judges - eight men and three women, all white and all conservative - he would consider, if elected, to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Six of them are judges who were appointed to federal appeals courts around the country by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other five serve on various state supreme courts. Scalias replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, which now is evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. Scalia, who died in February, was one of the courts most conservative justices. Were going to choose from, most likely from this list, Trump said in an interview with Fox News. But Trump said he could deviate from the list and added, At a minimum we will keep people within this general realm.  All of Trumps 11 judges are listed as affiliated with the Federalist Society on the influential conservative legal groups website. The organization is known as a breeding ground for conservative legal thinkers. It is unusual for a presidential candidate to release names of potential Supreme Court or Cabinet nominees before winning an election. But Trump is working to assure conservatives in his own party that, if elected president on Nov. 8, he would not appoint a liberal or moderate to the court. Trump allies had encouraged him to announce the names of potential court nominees to allay fears among conservatives wary of a Trump presidency. Trumps list includes: Steven Colloton of Iowa, a judge on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Raymond Gruender of Missouri, also a judge on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. It also includes: Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, a judge on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals; William Pryor of Alabama, a judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin, a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. The state supreme court jurists include: Allison Eid of Colorado; Joan Larsen of Michigan; Thomas Lee of Utah; David Stras of Minnesota; and Don Willett of Texas. Democratic President Barack Obama in March named centrist appellate court judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. But the Republican-led Senate has refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote, insisting that Obamas successor should get to select Scalias replacement.  Trump said in a statement that the 11 judges were representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value and said he would use the list as a guide for nominating a justice. Willett in the past year has posted several comments on Twitter mocking Trump, even referring to him as Darth Trump, a twist on the Star Wars villain Darth Vader. Willett last June posted about imagining Trump selecting a Supreme Court nominee. The mind reels. *weepscant finish tweet*, Willett wrote, suggesting he was crying at the idea. Asked to comment on Willetts Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, Mr. Trumps sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles. Lee is the brother of Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate. I dont know everyone on the list, but those I do know would all be great Supreme Court Justices. Of course, I do believe one name on that list stands head and shoulders above the rest, said Mike Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would consider any nomination. Sykes is the former wife of conservative Wisconsin radio host Charles Sykes, who posted on Twitter that she would make a great justice but added, I simply dont believe Trump. Several of the judges have ruled against abortion and reproductive rights. Sykes, Colloton and Pryor have ruled against the Obama administration regarding religious objections to the contraception coverage requirement of the Obamacare healthcare law.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at his daily briefing that he would be surprised if any Democrat would describe any of Trumps picks as a consensus nominee. But the individual President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans have described as a consensus nominee, Earnest said of Garland, adding that it would be wise for the Senate to act on Obamas nominee. Liberal advocacy group People for the American Way said  Trumps list included conservative dream justices. Most of the 11 judges did not respond to requests for comment.  Joan Larsen is working along with the rest of Michigans Supreme Court to provide common-sense, rule-of-law justice. That is her focus and will remain her focus, her campaign spokesman Stu Sandler said. Larsen was appointed to the post and is running for election to a full term.  ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
"Grammar fail, or do Texas Republicans believe most Texans are gay?","AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A Texas-based LGBT advocacy helped spark a grammar debate this week over whether an errant comma in the stridently anti-homosexual Republican Party of Texas platform can be read as saying the majority of Texans are gay. The plank that was approved by delegates at the partys convention this month reads: Homosexuality is a chosen behavior that is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that has been ordained by God in the Bible, recognized by our nations founders, and shared by the majority of Texans. Lone Star Q, which describes itself as the states No. 1 source for LGBT news, asked on Twitter on Wednesday to have a grammar debate over the wording. In response, grammarians pointed out that placement of the final comma in the plank could lead to understanding it to mean  that homosexuality is a chosen behavior shared by the majority of Texans. They also noted that nations should have an apostrophe and that by using has been, the plank gives the impression that homosexuality has been ordained by God.  Party officials did not respond to requests to comment. The party, which dominates Texas politics, has been hostile toward homosexuality for years. Its platform has said homosexuality must not be presented as an acceptable lifestyle and gays should not be allowed to marry. Over the years, the partys platforms have favored a number of hard-right positions, such as cutting off funding for about a dozen U.S. government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, abolishing the Federal Reserve, a return to the gold standard for the U.S. dollar and U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations.

Senate Banking committee approves two SEC nominees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Thursday approved nominees for the two vacant spots on the five-member Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the highest ranking Democrat on the committee. The nominations of Democrat Lisa Fairfax and Republican Hester Peirce now go to the full Senate. The Republican-led Congress has been slow to fill empty seats at agencies and boards, and many of the nominations made by outgoing President Barack Obama, a Democrat, have stalled. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, said the committee has yet to hold hearings for nominees to the Federal Reserve Board or the board of the Export-Import Bank.  It is disgraceful that the Senate still hasnt confirmed any of the 20 nominations that the Banking Committee has received since the start of last year, said Brown in a statement. These nominees are essential to promoting financial stability, protecting national security, and ensuring that American businesses of all sizes can compete on a level playing field with foreign competitors. The two SEC nominees were part of a block of five nominations that were approved by a single voice vote in a room near the Senate floor.  The committee also approved Jay Lerner as inspector general of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, Amias Gerety as assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department and Rhett Jeppson as director of the U.S. Mint.  Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, dissented in the hastily scheduled vote in protest over the Export-Import Bank board nominees. Despite the fact that Congress finally passed my bill to reauthorize the agency last December, the Ex-Im Bank has still been hamstrung from supporting American jobs and businesses because there isnt a majority on the board, she said in a statement. I dont have strong concerns with the nominees we voted on today.  The committee attempted to approve the nominees last month, but opposition from Democrats over corporate political disclosure threw the vote into disarray. The Democrats had pressed the SEC nominees to support a requirement that corporations disclose political donations. Obama put the two names forward in October.  Peirce once worked on the Senate Banking Committee staff and then became a senior research fellow and director of the financial markets working group at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.  Fairfax is a law professor at George Washington University, and has written a primer on shareholder activism. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
ACLU threatens Cleveland over delays in convention protest permits,"(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday accused the city of Cleveland of taking too long to issue permits to protesters planning demonstrations at the Republican National Convention in July and threatened to sue if the city delays further. Delays by the city are effectively blocking groups from exercising their fundamental right to political expression,  Christine Link, executive director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. Cleveland is using security planning as a mask to suppress political speech. Thousands of demonstrators are expected to converge outside the convention from July 18 to 21 when presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is likely to receive the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 general election. Raucous protests for and against the candidate have erupted at Trump events during the primary campaign. Large groups require a parade permit in Cleveland for demonstrations that would obstruct traffic or occur during special events. City spokesman Dan Williams said permits would be issued in time for the convention but he declined to say what date it considered appropriate. He said he was unaware of any permits issued so far. The normal permitting process could not be expected for the convention because this is not normal, Williams said. The city of Philadelphia, which will host the Democratic convention a week later, has already begun issuing permits, and Cleveland has told protesters they should wait until two weeks before the convention, the ACLU said. Undue delays may infringe on protesters rights to free speech, the ACLU said, suggesting a deadline of June 1. If Cleveland delays too long, the ACLU would file a lawsuit in federal court and ask for an expedited hearing, Link said in a telephone interview. Protesters need adequate time to make travel arrangements and rent needed materials such as portable toilets and sound stage equipment, Link said. The ACLU wrote on behalf of Citizens for Trump, which applied for a permit one month ago, and the liberal activist group Organize Ohio, which has been waiting two months for a permit. Citizens for Trump anticipates 104 cars and trucks, 100 motorcycles, four horses and at least 5,000 people to participate in its event, while Organize Ohio expects 3,000 to 5,000 marchers, the ACLU said. Another attorney represents an individual, John Penley, who has said the city has yet to even respond to his request for a permit application, the ACLU said. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1

"Top Democratic senator probes SWIFT, NY Fed about Bangladesh heist","(Reuters) - The Senate Homeland Security Committees top Democrat sought information Thursday from global financial network SWIFT and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on steps being taken to bolster cyber security in the wake of the theft of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware requested that both answer questions and brief his staff by June 17 on how they were handling issues following the February heist, during which hackers wired money out of an account at the New York Fed held by Bank Bangladesh, as well as how they were safeguarding against other potential cyber threats. These cyber attacks raise important questions about the security of the SWIFT system and the ability of its members to prevent future attacks, Carper wrote in his letters. The inquiry comes as policymakers, regulators and financial institutions around the world increase scrutiny into the heist at Bank Bangladesh and a separate attempt to use fraudulent SWIFT messages to steal from a commercial bank in Vietnam. The Association of Banks in Singapore told Reuters it had invited SWIFT for a meeting in June to discuss the latest cyber attacks. The Bank of England last month ordered British banks to provide documentation on SWIFT security measures.  In his letters, Carper said there appeared to be no evidence the Federal Reserve systems were penetrated or compromised in the Bangladesh attack. The New York Federal Reserve has denied responsibility for the intrusion, which some security researchers have said was due to a flaw in the SWIFT bank messaging network. The identity of the Bangladesh hackers remains unknown. Brussels-based SWIFT is a cooperative owned by some 3,000 global financial institutions. A representative for SWIFT could not immediately be reached for comment. The New York Fed plans to respond, a representative said. Carper asked SWIFT how it shares information about cyber security threats against member banks, whether there were consequences for members who did not follow security standards and if it plans to revise its cyber security policies in response to the Bangladesh attacks, among other questions. He requested similar information from the Federal Reserve, including steps it has taken to coordinate with SWIFT, Bangladesh Bank, the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Treasury since the heist. Major U.S. banks are scrutinizing security of the SWIFT messaging network following the cyber attacks, according to media reports. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
Clinton calls on world to break down barriers holding back girls,"COPENHAGEN (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - U.S. presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton called for renewed efforts to break down the barriers holding back women and girls around the world on Thursday. In a video address to Women Deliver, a major womens health and rights conference, she said gender equality must be made a priority in the drive to meet new U.N. development goals. Two decades ago at the U.N. fourth world conference on women in Beijing we came together and said with one voice that womens rights are human rights. And the gains weve made since then prove that progress is possible, she said. But as you all know too well, our work is far from finished. This is an important moment as we chart a course to meet the new Sustainable Development Goals. We have to break down the barriers holding back women and girls around the world. More than 5,500 delegates from over 160 countries  - including world leaders, ministers, health experts, economists, business leaders, activists, royalty and celebrities - have attended the four-day conference in Copenhagen. Discussions focused on how to put girls and women at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed by world leaders last year to fight inequality and extreme poverty. Gender equality, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, must be a core priority, Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in the race to the White House, said in the unscheduled video address. To get there we need greater political will and resources, and we need to continue to invest in more and better data to measure progress. The Women Deliver summit is critical to this work, Clinton added. You carry the spirit of Beijing forward bringing in new voices and lifting up the next generation of leaders. Mogens Lykketoft, president of the U.N. General Assembly, said he hoped a woman would become the next head of the world body when Ban Ki-moon steps down later this year. It would be symbolically and of real value very important that at the end of 2016 we will have the first ever elected female U.N. secretary general, and the first ever female president of the most powerful of nations  the United States. What a way to demonstrate that our shared vision can become a reality, he said. Women candidates in the running include former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova of Bulgaria.      ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
UAW chief says union to endorse either Clinton or Sanders 'soon',"DETROIT (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said on Thursday the union will endorse either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders for U.S. president soon, and called for unity among Democrats behind the eventual nominee. Williams, head of the richest U.S. union, vowed that the labor group will be all in to support the eventual Democratic nominee. The UAW has more than 1 million current and retired members. In a news conference at UAW headquarters, Williams did not say whether the UAW would endorse a candidate before the June 7 Democratic primary in California, but said he and top union leaders could decide quickly over the phone when the time comes to announce a decision. In early polling of UAW members, 28 percent preferred Donald Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee. Williams said the poll was conducted at a time when Trump talked about bringing jobs back to the United States and before the union distributed comments Trump made last August in a Detroit News interview when he said U.S. automakers should shift production from Michigan to states where wages could be lowered. Williams would not reveal how Clinton or Sanders fared in the early polling among UAW members when Trump received about 28 percent of the support. Williams said he did not know the current level of support among UAW members for Trump, but he indicated that he is confident most of the onetime Trump supporters would side with a Democratic candidate. Williams said the Republican Party is for free trade and not fair trade and that the result of a Republican presidency would be lower wages for U.S. workers. I dont want a president that has a good line, said the UAW chief. I want to know what the detail is. Williams said, Its not a game show. Separately, he said he may seek a meeting with Tesla Motors Incs Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk when he calls on other corporate leaders. Williams said he met twice with Musk five years ago, before he became UAW president in mid-2014. Teslas factory in Fremont, California, which is nonunion, has increased production and the number of employees greatly since then. Williams said the UAW continues to work to organize the Tesla plant but he would not give any details on how intense that effort is. Its still a priority, he said. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
Senators introduce bill to block expansion of FBI hacking authority,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A small group of bipartisan senators introduced a bill Thursday that would block a pending judicial rule change allowing U.S. judges to issue search warrants for remote access to computers in any jurisdiction, even overseas, arguing the change would expand the FBIs hacking authority. The one-page legislation from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Republican Senator Rand Paul would undo the change, adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in a private vote last month and without congressional involvement, to procedural rules governing the court system. Republican Senator Steve Daines and Democrats Tammy Baldwin and Jon Tester are co-sponsoring the Stopping Mass Hacking Act. Magistrate judges currently can only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, typically limited to a few counties. This is a dramatic expansion of the governments hacking and surveillance authority, Wyden said in a statement. Such a substantive change with an enormous impact on Americans constitutional rights should be debated by Congress, not maneuvered through an obscure bureaucratic process. Companion legislation is expected in the House soon,  Wydens office said. The U.S. Justice Department has pushed for the rule change since 2013 and has portrayed it as a procedural tweak needed to modernize the criminal code to pursue sophisticated 21st century criminals. Congress has until Dec. 1 to vote to reject, amend or postpone the changes to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure. If lawmakers fail to act, the change will automatically take effect, a scenario seen as likely given the short timeline.  But civil liberties groups and Alphabets Google  have argued the change should be properly authorized by Congress  and could violate the U.S. Constitutions protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Many organizations have vowed to lobby Congress intensely in the coming months to block it. The change would permit judges to issue warrants in cases where a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnot. Tensions over the FBIs secretive hacking tools, also known as network investigative techniques, have played out in a number of recent cases involving the bureaus covert seizure of a dark web child pornography website in February 2015 to track thousands of the sites visitors. Two defendants in the investigation secured rulings last month declaring the warrants used in their cases were invalid under current limitations of Rule 41. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
"House lifts block on Google-hosted apps, Yahoo Mail remains blacklisted","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives information technology team this week reinstated access on its internet network to software applications hosted on a Google cloud service after the company addressed potential security fears, according to an email seen by Reuters. Yahoo Mail remains inaccessible, however, and has been blacklisted since the House Information Security Office said in an April 30 memo it had detected an increase of ransomware attacks on the network.  The two restrictions were not related, but came within days of each other and made some communication among lawmakers and their staff more difficult, several congressional aides said. Devices connected to the Houses internet via Wi-Fi or ethernet cables were barred from accessing appspot.com, the domain where Alphabet Incs Google hosts custom-built apps, on May 3 due to concerns about a potential security vulnerability identified publicly by the FBI in June 2015.	 Based on Googles corrective actions of removing suspicious applications from appspot.com, InfoSec has unblocked access to appspot.com on the House Network, an email sent by the Houses technology service desk on Monday said. It is unclear if that apparent appspot.com flaw caused any damage or presented any actual threat. The House Information Service Office did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, a Yahoo spokesperson said it had been working with the Houses technology staff to address their questions. Unfortunately, we have been disappointed that they have not moved as quickly on recommended changes that would better protect its employees the spokesperson said. Two individuals fell victim to ransomware by clicking on infected Word document email attachments, sources familiar with the hacking said. The infected files were able to be recovered without paying any ransom, sources told Reuters last week.",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
"Guantanamo, rights issues in defense bill divide Congress","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee announced his opposition on Wednesday to the 2017 defense authorization bill, underscoring the partisan divide over the $602 billion defense policy measure. Representative Adam Smith said changes in the bill this week by Republicans, who control the House, on issues including womens registration for the draft, transfers from the Guantanamo detention center and protection for gay and transgender employees of military contractors, had led him to oppose it. These have tipped the balance of the bill considerably, Smith said in a statement. President Barack Obama had already threatened to veto the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, over a long list of issues, starting with its use of $18 billion of special war funds for day-to-day military programs to avoid automatic budget cuts. This week, the powerful House Rules Committee used a procedural move to remove, without a House vote, an amendment approved by the armed services committee that would have required women to register for the military draft. The Rules panel also decided not to allow debate on an amendment that would have stripped a religious protection measure from the bill that rights advocates fear would undo the presidents 2014 executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Smith said he also objected to Republicans adding further restrictions on transfers from the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and reduction in funds for nuclear nonproliferation and other provisions. Republicans control 246 seats in the 435-member House, which passed the bill by a vote of 277-147 late on Wednesday, largely along party lines, with most Republicans backing the bill and most Democrats opposed. However, the Senate will pass its own version of the bill later this year, which will be reconciled with the House bill to create a final version of the legislation. Once passed by the Senate and House, that NDAA would be sent to the White House for Obama to sign into law, or veto. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
House approves $622 million to combat Zika virus,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday to provide $622.1 million to control the spread of the Zika virus, far below President Barack Obamas request and lower than Senate legislation. The bill passed the Republican-controlled House 241 to 184, largely along party lines, and sets up a confrontation with both the Republican-majority Senate and the Democratic Obama administration.  The White House has threatened to veto the House bill, saying it was woefully inadequate. The Obama administration has requested $1.9 billion. On Tuesday, the Senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on Thursday of $1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects. Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts. House Republicans argue their bill, when coupled with $589 million the Obama administration already shifted to Zika from unused funds to battle Ebola, would provide enough money through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. It was unclear how long it might take the Senate and House to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. Last year, Brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly, and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the Americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern U.S. states including Florida. The Obama administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine. ",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",1
Facebook's Zuckerberg meets U.S. conservatives over bias controversy,"(Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg heard from more than a dozen U.S. conservative leaders on Wednesday and said he will work to build trust with users who believe the social network displays politically biased news content. After a closed-door meeting at the companys Silicon Valley headquarters, Zuckerberg defended his companys practices but acknowledged that many conservatives believe Facebook is politically liberal.  It doesnt make sense for our mission or our business to suppress political content, Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook after the meeting.  I know many conservatives dont trust that our platform surfaces content without a political bias, he added. I wanted to hear their concerns personally and have an open conversation about how we can build trust.  The editorial practices at the worlds largest social network came under scrutiny after a former Facebook contractor anonymously accused editors there of deliberately suppressing conservative news. The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor. Facebook has denied the allegations and said it would conduct a full investigation. A Facebook spokeswoman said the meeting produced a constructive discussion and some attendees called it productive. I think Facebook is very sincere in wanting to resolve outstanding issues with conservatives, Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, said after the meeting. Attendees were frank about their concerns, but the tone was cordial, Bozell said. Facebook invited that frank talk. People didnt hold back too much, he said.     On her Facebook page, conservative CNN commentator S.E. Cupp said the meeting had produced strong commitments to address issues, as well as to work together on common goals.   Other attendees included former White House press secretary Dana Perino, media personality Glenn Beck and former Republican Senator Jim DeMint. Zuckerberg said that while Silicon Valley has a reputation for being liberal, Facebooks 1.6 billion users span every background and ideology. The reality is, conservatives and Republicans have always been an important part of Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has more Facebook fans than any other presidential candidate, he said. Fox News drives more interactions on its Facebook page than any other news outlet in the world, Zuckerberg added. Its not even close.  Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdochs 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O). Facebook employees who donate to presidential candidates lean Democratic. Seventy-nine percent of employee contributions to 2016 contenders went to Democrats, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance data, and 21 percent to Republicans. Zuckerberg has contributed to candidates in both parties. Sixty-percent of his donations during the 2014 midterm elections went to Republicans and 40 percent to Democrats. He has not supported a presidential candidate this cycle. Although a U.S. Senate committee is investigating whether there is liberal bias in selection of trending topics, there is little chance the government will try to regulate Facebooks practices, said Republican Senator John Thune, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. I dont have any reason to believe that would be necessary, Thune told reporters on Tuesday. Thune sent a letter to Facebook last week to demand that it explain its editorial decision-making and how stories are chosen for the trending topics feature. He said his primary concern was that Facebook was potentially being deceptive about how its news feed curation algorithms work.  Facebook last week released its guidelines for choosing trending topics, but the operations of the news feed algorithm remain closely guarded. Legal experts said the government has few tools to dictate how a private company makes news decisions. As a legal matter, Facebook is not required to be even-handed, said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Congress cant introduce something that tries to prohibit Facebook from making these kinds of choices. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
Democrats chide Sanders after Nevada mutiny,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Infighting dogged the Democrats on Wednesday as Bernie Sanders campaign accused party leaders of bias against him and many Democrats urged Sanders to keep his supporters in check. The tensions after a chaotic weekend convention in Nevada emerged as Republicans begin to rally around their own outsider presidential candidate, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, in the general election. Trump, who has all but secured his partys nomination, has turned his focus to November, outlining to Reuters on Tuesday  proposals including scrapping financial regulation and the Paris climate accords. On Wednesday, he  released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. More Democrats urged Sanders on Wednesday to take a stronger stand against his supporters uprising in Nevada over the delegate selection process. They said he did not go far enough in condemning the unrest, which included a thrown chair, yelling and threats to convention leaders. That was the time to have sent a full-throated message to his followers: that we dont do this kind of thing, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said on CNN. Democrat Barbara Boxer, the other U.S. senator from California, was at the Nevada convention and expressed her concern to Sanders in a phone call on Tuesday night.  I feared for my safety and had a lot of security around me, she said. Ive never had anything like this happen. Sanders campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, in a series of television interviews, accused Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, of bias against Sanders from the beginning and throwing shade on his campaign. Theres a tremendous amount of frustration out there and people want to have a fair process, Weaver said on CNN. Senior U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Wasserman Schultz on Tuesdsay both also called on Sanders to do more to rein in his supporters. Sanders had said he condemned violence and harassment against individuals but framed Nevadas incident as a warning to Democratic leaders to treat his supporters with fairness. The U.S. senator from Vermont is determined to fight on against front-runner Clinton in what has become a longer-than-expected and sometimes acrimonious battle. In contests on Tuesday, Clinton narrowly edged out Sanders in Kentucky, a state where she had not been expected to win. Sanders won Oregon, a state that played to his strengths. Democrats are faced with a delicate balancing act as long as Sanders remains in the race, needing to pivot toward Trump without taking Clintons nomination for granted and alienating passionate backers of Sanders. Sparring between the Sanders camp and the Democratic Party leaders over the Nevada events threatened party unity before the Democrats national convention in July in Philadelphia. Unaddressed, the toxic relationship between DNC @ @SenSanders campaign, so evident last night, could cast dark cloud over Philly convention, David Axelrod, a former top strategist for President Barack Obama, said on Twitter. Despite having an almost unassailable lead in the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination, and with the  primary battle heading toward the final contests next month, Clinton will need Sanders supporters on her side in the general election. According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, what played out in Nevada is just a glimpse into the uphill battle Clinton faces in courting them. If Clinton wins the nomination, for every six Democrats who support Sanders, one will switch their allegiance to Trump in the general election and two say they would not support either candidate. Only three of every six say they would support Clinton as the partys nominee.  Sanders campaign has long accused party leaders of favoring Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, for the presidential nomination in the face of his unexpectedly strong primary challenge. On Saturday, his supporters in Nevada became angry at the delegate selection process, booing, yelling and hurling insults, and at least one chair, toward the convention leaders. Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, said she and her family, including a 5-year-old grandson, have received death threats and numerous callers have disrupted her workplace. On Wednesday, Lange said she wanted Sanders to acknowledge the threats, and apologize. His statement was pretty weak, she said on CNN. Until you say youre sorry, until you say what happened in Nevada should not have happened and it was wrong and it was fueled by your senior campaign staff people, then thats an apology and then I think theres some responsibility is taken.

Hackers target presidential campaigns: U.S. spy chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential campaigns face threats from hackers bent on espionage and other activity more nefarious than mere political mischief, the office of U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said on Wednesday, but did not provide details on specific intrusions. Were aware that campaigns and related organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations - from philosophical differences to espionage - and capabilities - from defacements to intrusions, Clappers spokesman, Brian Hale, said in a statement, deferring to the FBI for details on specific incidents. Earlier, Clapper said the U.S. intelligence community had already had some indications of hacking attempts against presidential campaigns. As the campaign intensifies well probably have more attacks, Clapper said at a morning event at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. The hacking efforts against the campaigns are considered so serious that some congressional committees have been briefed on the activity, a government source said. Given the intense scrutiny paid to the 2016 campaign, and the broad implications for U.S. foreign policy, its no surprise that actors are launching cyber attacks against presidential campaigns, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement. The U.S. Secret Service, which is charged with protecting the presidential candidates, said in a statement that it works to prevent and detect cyber security threats and makes the candidates aware of vulnerabilities. Cyber attacks against political candidates occur in countries around the world. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obamas campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes. U.S. intelligence officials have said many previous assaults were linked to Chinese hackers.  Matthew Prince, co-founder and chief executive of CloudFlare, which has provided internet security services to Donald Trump and other presidential candidates, said his company has seen a surprisingly civil cyber landscape in the United States compared with elections in other countries where it has worked, such as Turkey or Mexico.	 We have not seen anything (in the United States) that would suggest a level of sophistication that you would see if a nation-state actor threw its full weight behind it, Prince said. Clapper said the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working to educate both campaigns about cyber threats, likely referring to the campaigns of Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. A U.S. security official said foreign hackers would likely seek information about a candidates foreign policy intentions and team and about the campaigns internal operations. The Republican and Democratic candidates for president will begin receiving intelligence briefings after their official nominations at party conventions this summer.  Clapper said the two candidates would receive exactly the same briefings. He said the sessions would not be used to try to persuade Trump to soften his stance about a proposed ban on Muslim immigration, which some national security professionals have said is counterproductive to fighting Islamic extremism. Weve been doing this for many years, its not designed to shape anybodys world view, Clapper said. Because the candidates are briefed in person, U.S. intelligence officials said they are not concerned about hackers eavesdropping on the sessions. But they are worried that Trump or Clinton might share information with aides, advisers or supporters using email systems that are less secure than those the government uses for classified information.  One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cited Clintons previous use of a private email server when she was secretary of state and noted Trumps reputation for speaking, and tweeting, off the top of his head.

Wall Street bearish on Trump's call to scrap financial reform law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banking lobbyists said on Wednesday they disagree with presidential candidate Donald Trumps call for a wholesale repeal of President Barack Obamas financial reform law, even though they share his view that it is overly burdensome. U.S. banks do want changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law but after spending millions of dollars to bring themselves into compliance with it, they are wary of Trumps call for it to be essentially scrapped. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, vowed on Tuesday to dismantle most of the law. Dodd Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function, he told Reuters in an interview. Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a Washington trade group, said he appreciated Trumps interest in changes to the financial regulatory system. It certainly needs some perfecting, he said. To have an outright repeal of Dodd-Frank I dont think would serve the banking industry or consumers, Hunt said, adding that it would create a messy regulatory environment.  For instance, he said repealing Dodd-Frank would end the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created by the law, and it would be unclear which agency would take over its oversight of consumer products such as mortgages.        The wariness within the industry about gutting Dodd-Frank came as critics of Wall Street slammed Trumps proposal as a gift to big banks. Congress passed Dodd-Frank in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In addition to creating the new consumer agency, the law restricted banks ability to make risky investments and gave regulators new power over Wall Street executives pay. In addition to seeking legislative changes to Dodd-Frank, the U.S. financial industry has spent much of the last six years wielding its clout in a quieter way by trying to push regulatory agencies to implement the law in ways they consider manageable. Banks still want tweaks to the rules, such as simpler capital requirements - which limit banks reliance on debt for funding - and carve-outs from the toughest rules for small- and mid-sized institutions. There could be risks for the banking industry should Trump or a Democratic successor to Obama push for a reopening of Dodd-Frank following the Nov. 8 election. Anger at Wall Street has been a potent theme in the election so far and resonates strongly with both Democratic and Republican voters.  One reason banks fear pushing for a complete overhaul of the Dodd-Frank law is the possibility that it could be replaced by even tighter regulations, said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Guggenheim Partners, in a note to clients on Wednesday. For instance, some bank critics on both sides of the political spectrum have called for replacing Dodd-Franks litany of regulations with much tougher restrictions on banks debt. The odds favor Trumps solution being even more onerous for large financial firms than the status quo, Seiberg said.     A source who has advised banks on regulatory issues told Reuters that Trumps scathing critique of Dodd-Frank far overstated the problems with the law. Most thinking people in the industry would dispute these characterizations, the source said. Are some pieces of Dodd Frank problematic? Yes. But there is, on balance, more good than bad.    Former U.S. Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat for whom the law is named, said Trumps comments could backfire because of voter antipathy toward Wall Street. He says hell be enemy of Wall Street, and hes giving Wall street what it most wants, Frank told Reuters. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
Trump: 'most likely' would choose a Supreme Court nominee from list,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said that if elected in November he would most likely choose a U.S. Supreme Court justice from the list of 11 people he released on Wednesday. We are going to choose from, most likely from this list. But at a minimum we will keep people within this general realm, Trump said in an excerpt of an interview to be broadcast Wednesday night on Fox News. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
Potential Trump high court nominee mocked him on Twitter,"(Reuters) - A Texas judge identified by Donald Trump on Wednesday as one of 11 people he would consider nominating to the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly mocked the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on social media.  Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett last month likened Trump to Star Wars villain Darth Vader in a Twitter post.  ""'We'll rebuild the Death Star. It'll be amazing, believe me. And the rebels will pay for it.' Darth Trump,"" Willett tweeted last month with a photo of the Death Star, the giant spherical spaceship built to carry a planet-destroying weapon in the first ""Star Wars"" movie.  Willett also linked Trump to liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Cant wait till Trump rips off his face Mission Impossible-style & reveals a laughing Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Willett posted on Twitter last August.  Last June he mocked Trumps judgment on picking a nominee to the high court.  Donald Trump haiku Who would the Donald Name to #SCOTUS? The mind reels. *weepscant finish tweet* tweeted Willett (@JusticeWillett) on the same day Trump launched his candidacy. SCOTUS refers to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Asked to comment on Willetts Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, Mr. Trumps sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles.  Alabama U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a key Trump backer, was asked on Fox News Channel about the judges Twitter posts, replying, I doubt he cares. Sessions said it was more important to ask whether Willett follows the Constitution, is a good scholar, has integrity and meets the high standards expected of a Supreme Court justice.  Willetts enthusiastic tweeting would be a pivot from the current social media presence of Supreme Court justices. None of the eight sitting justices has a verified Twitter account.  Willett did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.  ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
Trump threat to renegotiate U.N. climate deal causes dismay abroad,"OSLO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps vow to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected U.S. president caused dismay abroad on Wednesday, with supporters of the deal saying it was in his interests to embrace a plan that seeks to end dependence on fossil fuels. U.S. insistence on renegotiation could unravel a 195-nation compromise to curb greenhouse gas emissions reached in Paris in December after fraught talks between nations as different as China, the United States, small island states and OPEC members. The Paris Agreement is as much in the United States interests as any other country, said Tony de Brum, ambassador for climate change of the Marshall Islands who, as his countrys foreign minister, helped broker the U.N. deal. Seeking to unravel it would not only threaten the U.S. economy, damage its environment, and weaken its security, but it would do a great disservice to all of humanity, he said. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told Reuters on Tuesday he was not a big fan of the climate accord.  He said China and other countries would not stick to the one-sided deal, which seeks to transform the world economy from fossil fuels in coming decades to slow global warming. I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else, he said. Trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business. Government officials meeting in Bonn, Germany, from May 16-26 to find ways to implement the deal, raised concerns about Trumps comments but doubted he would take serious action. Thats because the deal imposes no real constraints on the United States - it lets all nations define their own actions for fighting climate change. President Barack Obama has promised to cut emissions by 2025, but his successors will face no penalties if they do not comply, meaning little incentive to challenge the U.N. deal. Many officials also say it is in U.S. interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions, partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels also means less air pollution, a big cause of disease. Even many nations traditionally sceptical that man-made greenhouse emissions stoke climate change, like OPEC countries, have gone along with the Paris Agreement. George David Banks, a senior climate change adviser to President George W. Bush and a Trump supporter, said Trump could try to force countries like China to pledge deeper emissions cuts by renegotiating the agreement. Thats wishful thinking, according to John Coequyt, director of green group the Sierra Clubs international climate campaigns. You cant get more than 190 countries to renegotiate a deal they are implementing, he said. The Paris Agreement will formally enter into force when 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. China and the United States, representing 38 percent, say they will join this year. If the deal enters into force before the next U.S. president takes office next year, it will in theory be harder to pull out. Article 28 says any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of entry into force - the length of a U.S. presidential term. Trumps easiest option is to neglect the deal if elected, legal experts say. Trump could ignore the targets set by Obama and promise instead to help developing nations cope with global warming. The Paris Agreements flexible approach, allowing all to set their own goals, is radically different from the U.N.s 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which set mandatory targets for developed nations to cut emissions until 2012. The United States did not take part in Kyoto - President George W. Bush denounced it as an economic straitjacket that, he said, unfairly omitted targets for developing nations led by China and India. Former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who helped broker the Paris deal, said this month that the U.S. election was critical to its future. If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption, he said. But U.S. chief climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said last week that other nations were likely to push ahead with the Paris Agreement whoever wins the White House.  ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
"House members defend NATO, in rebuke to Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a resolution reaffirming American support for NATO on Wednesday, in a rebuke of criticism of the alliance by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  The resolution introduced by Republican Adam Kinzinger and Democrat John Delaney says that the North American Treaty Organization is central to the national security interest of the United States. Campaigning for president, Trump has said the 67-year-old alliance is obsolete and costs the United States too much, and that European nations should look after their own defense. The world is safer with an engaged America, and I firmly believe our participation in NATO greatly matters to Americas national security, Kinzinger said in a statement. Including the two lead sponsors, the resolution was backed by two Republicans and 18 Democrats. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
Congress forecasters see major savings from sentencing reforms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A criminal justice bill awaiting a vote by the U.S. Senate would reduce federal prison costs by $722 million over the next 10 years by releasing thousands of federal prisoners early, congressional forecasters said on Wednesday. Federal benefits received by the newly released prisoners would increase direct spending by $251 million and reduce revenues by $8 million over the same period, according to the estimate by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. The new savings estimate buoyed supporters of the bipartisan measure to lower mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, which is central to President Barack Obamas efforts to overhaul the countrys federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding.  We have an obligation to change the way we think about incarceration, and todays CBO report shows that we have a fiscal obligation as well, said the bills co-authors, U.S. senators Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, in a statement. The bill was revised last month to exclude prisoners convicted of violent crimes in an effort to garner more support among conservatives.  Still, its prospects for moving to a full Senate vote remain unclear. Some key Republican senators are reluctant to support the bill until it includes changes to mens rea laws that govern criminal intent.  Parallel sentencing reforms await a floor vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. A White House study last month found that current sentencing and incarceration policies strain state budgets, take people out of the work force and pull families apart more than they reduce crime or boost the U.S. economy.

U.S. Senate set to approve $1.1 billion in Zika virus funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday cleared the way for approval of $1.1 billion in immediate funds to battle the Zika virus that is linked to birth defects, well above what is in legislation pending in the House of Representatives. By a vote of 68-29, senators limited debate on the measure, paving the way for likely Senate approval this week. Two other funding approaches failed to get enough support to advance in the Senate. Meanwhile, the White House threatened to veto a $622.1 million Zika bill poised to pass the House of Representatives later this week, saying it was woefully inadequate. Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill also requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts. Republican Senator Roy Blunt from Missouri told reporters that the Senate measure trimmed this package back (from Obamas request) to what really addresses the emergency at the time. Democratic Senator Patty Murray from Washington, who crafted the legislation with Blunt, added, We are going to need to keep the pressure on House Republicans to set aside their partisan bill and actually get the administration the emergency resources they need. It was unclear how long it might take the Senate and House to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. Last year, Brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the Americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern U.S. states including Florida. House Republicans argue their $622.1 million bill, when coupled with $589 million the Obama administration already shifted to Zika from unused funds to battle Ebola, would provide enough money through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. The administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine. (This version of the story was corrected to say $622.1 million from $622.1 billion in the 3rd and 11th paragraphs.) ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
Many Senate Democrats frustrated with slow U.S. Syrian refugee admissions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than half the Democrats in the Senate, including many of President Barack Obamas strongest supporters, signed a letter to him on Wednesday urging him to move more quickly to admit Syrian refugees into the United States. Despite Obamas pledge to admit 10,000 of the people fleeing Syrias civil war in the year ending this September, only 1,736 have been allowed into the country so far. In contrast, more than 6,000 have been admitted from Myanmar and more than 5,000 have been admitted from Iraq. We urge your Administration to devote the necessary resources to expeditiously and safely resettle refugees from Syria, the 27 senators wrote in the letter, which was seen by Reuters. We are deeply concerned about the slow pace of admissions for Syrian refugees in the first seven months of the fiscal year, the letter said. The lead signers on the letter included Senator Richard Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate, and Senator Amy Klobuchar. The letter was signed by 25 other members of the Democratic caucus, including presidential candidate Bernie Sanders It requested an update on specific measures the administration plans to take to fulfill its commitment to resettle the remaining 8,264 Syrians within five months. Obama said in late April that he expected the United States to meet his goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees before Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. But Obamas promise sparked a firestorm of criticism in the United States, mostly from Republicans who say that violent militants could enter the country by posing as refugees. More than 30 governors, most of them Republicans, have tried to block refugees from coming to their states. The United States has offered refuge to far fewer of the millions fleeing war in Syria and Iraq than many of its closest allies. Germany has taken in hundreds of thousands. Canada admitted 26,859 Syrian refugees between Nov. 4, 2015, and May 1, 2016. Other nations, including ours, can and should do much more, the senators said in the letter.

U.S. extends overtime pay to 4.2 million salaried workers,"(Reuters) - The Obama administration on Tuesday unveiled the final version of a long-awaited and controversial rule to extend overtime pay to 4.2 million U.S. workers, which marks one of the administrations most significant moves to address stagnant wages.  The rule, which has drawn intense criticism from business groups and Republicans, doubles the maximum annual income a salaried worker can earn and still be automatically eligible for overtime pay from $23,660 to $47,476 and requires that threshold to be updated every three years. It takes effect Dec. 1. Officials said many workers will earn more money, an estimated total of $12 billion over the next decade, while others will work fewer hours for the same pay. More than 4 million workers are either going to be paid more or get time back to raise their family, go to school  or retrain to get a better job, Vice President Joe Biden said during a phone call with reporters on Tuesday. The rule will likely touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy but is expected to have the greatest impact on nonprofit groups, retail companies, hotels and restaurants, which have many management workers whose salaries are below the new threshold. Business groups, which lobbied heavily against the changes, say companies will be forced to cut wages and hours and may slow hiring. The Obama administration and supporters of the new rule say the $23,660 threshold allowed companies to hold down labor costs by requiring workers with relatively low incomes to work well over 40 hours per week without additional pay. The rule will likely face legal challenges, including claims that the U.S. Labor Department flouted legal requirements for creating new regulations. Republicans in Congress have said they will move to block the rule, but they would need to overcome a veto from President Barack Obama.  The new threshold was lower than the $50,440 standard proposed by the Obama administration last year, but the last-minute change to lower it, which was widely expected, did little to appease critics.  Any federal standard above the $35,100 overtime threshold in New York, which has a high cost of living, will inhibit economic growth in more rural states in the South and Midwest, Tammy McCutchen, a Washington D.C. lawyer who works with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Tuesday before the final rule was announced. The threshold also disappointed proponents of the new rule, including Ross Eisenbrey of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, who first pitched an overhaul to the White House in 2013. It means a million fewer employees will be helped, he said before the rule was released. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1
"Democrats Clinton, Sanders split nominating contests in Oregon, Kentucky","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each picked up primary wins on Tuesday in yet another demonstration of how divided the party is in the drawn-out national race to win the nomination for Novembers general election. Clinton narrowly defeated Sanders in Kentucky, a state where she was not expected to win. Sanders bested her in Oregon, a state that played to his strengths. In Kentucky, the two candidates will likely split the 55 delegates up for grabs. In Oregon, Sanders will take only a handful more of the 61 delegates that were awarded.     Clintons sizeable lead in delegates means it is likely she will eventually be her partys nominee, but she remains more than 100 delegates short of sealing the deal. The Democratic primary now hits a two-week lull, with the final set major contests, including California, scheduled for June 7. Clinton, who spent the past two days campaigning in Kentucky, would like to lock up the nomination and turn her attention to the Nov. 8 general election and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Trump has begun to organize his general election campaign. On Tuesday, he signed a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee. The agreement allows him to raise $449,400 from a single donor by splitting the funds between his campaign, the RNC and state Republican parties.  Trump, who eschewed donations in the political system through the primary, has thus far insisted on mostly self-funding his campaign. The shift to a more traditional fundraising approach could draw the ire of some supporters. Trump, in an interview with Megyn Kelly that aired on Fox News Tuesday night, said he did have regrets about his actions during the Republican primary process. I could have used different language in a couple of instances, but overall Im happy with the outcome, Trump said.  Sanders supporters became angry when Nevada state party officials chose to end their convention and block efforts to award the U.S. senator from Vermont more delegates than he initially won in the February caucus. Clinton won the caucus. The Nevada incident was a warning about the potential for fireworks at Julys Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Clintons campaign continued to express confidence that she would be able to unify the party. Hillary Clinton is grateful to the thousands of Nevadans who came out to participate in the caucuses and convention process, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. She believes every voice should be heard and no one should be intimidated, harassed or threatened in this process. When the primary process is complete, our party must come together and ensure a Democrat is elected to serve as our next president, Mook said. Sanders on Tuesday joined his supporters in criticizing the Nevada Democratic Party after Saturdays events. One Sanders supporter threw a chair, unhappy about being blocked in a rules vote that was part of the effort to help the senator win more delegates to the national convention. Others drew chalk graffiti on a party building, while the states party chairwoman has been receiving death threats. Sanders framed Nevadas incident as a warning. If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned, Sanders said in a statement on the Nevada incident.   Sanders - who said he condemns violence and personal harassment of individuals - leveled some of the same complaints his supporters did, arguing that state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange did not allow a headcount on a disputed rules change. He also argued that 64 delegates to the state convention were not given a hearing before being ruled ineligible. The state party disputed the Sanders campaigns interpretation of the events. It said some delegates did not show up at the convention and others were disqualified because they were not registered as Democrats in time. The Sanders campaign is continuing to be dishonest about what happened Saturday and is failing to adequately denounce the threats of violence of his supporters, the Nevada Democratic Party said in a statement. Sanders supporters began circulating a picture of Lange on the internet that included her cellphone number and encouraged others to contact her to express their unhappiness.  Lange said on MSNBC she had been receiving death threats, including many containing vulgar language. Public messages sent to her Twitter account included a barrage of derogatory statements. MSNBC played some of the voicemails, including one saying people like you should be hung in a public execution. What you heard is a few of the thousands of emails and texts and Facebook messages and Twitter messages that Ive gotten, Lange said on MSNBC. Threats to my family, to my grandson, to my husband.  Sanders continued presence in the race is prompting concerns among Clinton allies that he will damage her ability to take on Trump and hurt her in the fall.  But Sanders supporters shrug off that worry, arguing that Trump is such a flawed candidate that Clinton will easily dispatch with him if she faces him in the Nov. 8 election. Clintons camp seems to agree.  Ultimately, we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose  to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trumps hands, her campaign manager Mook said.

Clinton begins Appalachia tour in Trump-friendly coal country,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton begins a two-day tour on Monday through rural, traditionally coal-reliant parts of the eastern Appalachian region where Republican rival Donald Trumps pro-coal, anti-trade message has resonated with economically distressed voters.  Clinton, in a move to reclaim her early pledge to focus on helping the struggling region resuscitate its economies, will meet the head of a local steel workers union, retired mine workers and others in Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio affected by declining coal and steel prices. Her pledge of more than $30 billion to help coal regions was overshadowed in March when Clinton, at an Ohio town hall, said the country would put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Clintons statement was seized upon by coal industry groups and Republican lawmakers such as U.S. Senators Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, both from Kentucky, as evidence she planned to continue carrying out President Barack Obamas regulatory war on coal. Clinton immediately sent an apology letter to Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, an early supporter, pledging to focus my team and administration on bringing jobs to Appalachia and help its residents adjust to a wave of coal company bankruptcies and changes in the U.S. energy market. Her decision to embark on an Appalachian tour is in part timed ahead of Democratic nominating contests in West Virginia on May 10 and in Kentucky on May 17 as she seeks to secure the nomination before the partys July convention. Clinton won Ohios contest in mid-March, besting rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont. However, her aides say her decision to focus on the region also reflects her commitment to show voters she will work for them if elected, even if they do not support her now.  Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned on Sunday in West Virginia, encountering protests from Trump supporters and being asked about Clintons town hall remark and subsequent apology, according to local media reports. Manchin accompanied the former president, who is also expected to campaign in Kentucky on Tuesday. West Virginia last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for his second four-year term. He is the only Democrat who has won Kentucky since 1980. During her first presidential run, Clinton defeated Obama in the 2008 primaries in those states but lost the nomination to him. Her tour is an early move to siphon support from Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, who has called for continued coal production and dismissed environmental concerns as a policy priority. Clintons first stop, at a restaurant in Ashland, Kentucky, will be a discussion with the leader of a local steel workers union and several of some 600 workers who were laid off when AK Steel Holding Corp announced in October that it would idle one of its furnaces amid a supply glut and lower steel prices. Clinton last month criticized Chinas announcement that it was encouraging increased steel output amid a global surplus that is driving down prices and said, if elected, she would crack down on Chinese trade practices. She will continue to Williamson, West Virginia, a once-thriving town near the states border with Kentucky in Mingo County, the heart of the coal-producing region. Its main streets had been dotted with empty store fronts as coal mining employment has been cut in half over the past four years. The town is now trying to reshape its economy. Clinton will meet retired mine workers there and also tour the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, which serves as the nerve center for a local program that aims to drive economic revitalization through a health-focused, local-foods movement using land once designated for mining to drive large-scale agricultural development. Aides say Clintons interest in the regions economic troubles was piqued after she left the U.S. State Department in 2013. She circulated data to aides then about studies related to decreased life expectancies for less-educated white adults in Appalachia, where the decline in coal-related employment has been accompanied by a growth in opioid addiction, diabetes and other health issues. Clinton has throughout her campaign criticized attempts made by coal companies to shirk the responsibility to pay healthcare benefits for retirees during bankruptcy proceedings, saying the country owes them gratitude for fueling decades of economic success.

Silicon Valley mocks Trump over his tech bubble warning,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that a dangerous financial bubble has formed in the technology industry - and Silicon Valley responded with a collective eye roll.  In a Reuters interview, the New York billionaire said technology start-ups that had never earned a profit were able to sell shares at very high prices, likening the situation to the overheated stock market in 2007. Im talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars, so here we go again, Trump said. Many tech watchers have repeatedly warned of a tech bubble as the number of private companies valued at $1 billion or more - known as unicorns - have soared to 163, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights. So Trumps declaration, in the eyes of Silicon Valleys entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, was nothing new. Investors and others took to Twitter to poke fun at Trumps campaign slogan Make America Great Again! by repeating the phrase, Make Bubbles Great Again.     FINALLY someone calls it out, Marc Andreessen, a general partner at the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, tweeted, mocking Trump. In the interview, Trump said the high valuations that tech start-ups are able to fetch today remind him of 2007, when an overheated housing market helped drive U.S. stocks to unsustainable valuations before the bubble burst. You have a stock market that is very strange, the presumptive Republican nominee said. You look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company, and theyre selling for so much money. And I would have said can that ever happen again? I think that could happen again. Some startup founders rejected Trumps generalization that all companies are burning cash and overvalued; certainly many of them are, and in the last several months a correction has started to rectify years of exuberant investments.  Still, other companies continue to raise money successfully and turn profits. So far he has been saying dumb things but they seem to be getting dumber and dumber, Vivek Wadhwa, an entrepreneur and Stanford University fellow, told Reuters. I was going to tweet (the comments) while calling Peter Thiel and saying, Here is your buddy. Thiel, an influential investor well-known for his contrarian ideas, is one of the few Silicon Valley leaders to openly support Trump. Thiel was not immediately available for comment. There is nothing in his (Trumps) track record to show that he has been out here and met with any technology leaders and knows this industry and knows about innovation, said Aaron Ginn, co-founder of the Lincoln Initiative, a community that promotes libertarian and technology-friendly values.  Which is ironic, Ginn said, given how much technology - especially Twitter - has helped Trumps campaign. He says things and does things that are made for entertainment, Ginn said.

"Exclusive: Trump would talk to North Korea's Kim, wants to renegotiate climate accord","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday he is willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyangs nuclear program, proposing a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation. In a wide-ranging interview with Reuters, Trump also called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord, said he disapproved of Russian President Vladimir Putins actions in eastern Ukraine, and said he would seek to dismantle most of the U.S. Dodd-Frank financial regulations if he is elected president. The presumptive Republican nominee declined to share details of his plans to deal with North Korea, but said he was open to talking to its leader.  I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him, he said.  Asked whether he would try to talk some sense into the North Korean leader, Trump replied, Absolutely.  North Koreas mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trumps remarks.     Trump, 69, also said he would press China, Pyongyangs only major diplomatic and economic supporter, to help find a solution. I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China, he said in the interview in his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan. China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call.     A Chinese official said dialogue was needed to resolve issues on the Korean peninsula. China supports direct talks and communication between the United States and North Korea. We believe this is beneficial, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters. Trumps preparedness to talk directly with Kim contrasts with President Barack Obamas policy of relying on senior U.S. officials to talk to senior North Korean officials. Obama has not engaged personally with Kim, but he has pushed for new diplomatic overtures to Iran and Cuba that produced a nuclear deal with Tehran and improved ties with Havana. Sitting at his desk with an expansive view of Central Park, Trump spoke at length about his economic and foreign policy ideas in the half-hour interview. Facing him on his desk is a framed photograph of his father, the late Fred Trump. A wall displays framed photos of Trump with various celebrities, as well as numerous magazine covers on which he has appeared. On Russia, Trump tempered past praise of Putin, saying the nice comments the Russian leader has made about him in the past would only go so far. The fact that he said good things about me doesnt mean that its going to help him in a negotiation. It wont help him at all, he said. An adviser to Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential candidate, criticized Trumps foreign policy comments, noting they came soon after Trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Let me get this straight: Donald Trump insults the leader of our closest ally, then turns around and says hed love to talk to Kim Jong Un? Clintons senior foreign policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a statement. Trump seems to have a bizarre fascination with foreign strongmen like Putin and Kim. But his approach to foreign policy makes no sense for the rest of us, he said. In the Reuters interview, Trump said he thought Camerons criticism of him was inappropriate but Im sure Ill have a good relationship with him. Trump said he is not a big fan of the Paris climate accord, which prescribes reductions in carbon emissions by more than 170 countries. He said he would want to renegotiate the deal because it treats the United States unfairly and gives favorable treatment to countries like China.  I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else, he said. A renegotiation of the pact would be a major setback for what was hailed as the first truly global climate accord, committing both rich and poor nations to reining in the rise in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet. Trump has been criticized for offering far fewer specific policy proposals than Clinton, his likely rival for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The New York billionaire said he planned to release a detailed policy platform in two weeks that would propose dismantling nearly all of Dodd-Frank, a package of financial reforms put in place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Dodd-Frank is a very negative force, which has developed a very bad name, he said. Trump took a dim view of Clintons stated desire to put her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in charge of building up the U.S. economy.  The wife wants to make him in charge of the economy, he said. Clinton described Trumps idea of dismantling Dodd-Frank as reckless. Latest reckless idea from Trump: gut rules on Wall Street, and leave middle-class families out to dry, she said on Twitter. Trump said he perceived a dangerous financial bubble in the tech start-up industry, with some companies selling shares at high valuations without ever turning a profit. Im talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars, he said. Silicon Valley investors responded on Twitter by poking fun at Trumps campaign slogan Make America Great Again! by repeating the phrase, Make Bubbles Great Again. On the U.S. Federal Reserve, Trump said that while he eventually wants a Republican to head it, he is not an enemy of current chair Janet Yellen, who was appointed by Obama. Im not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low-interest rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head, which can happen at some point, he said, adding that inflation doesnt seem like its happening any time soon.     The real estate mogul said he would maintain the current level of benefits for Social Security recipients, a position championed by former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. Trump said he would not raise the retirement age or impose a sliding scale of benefits depending on income levels. Some Republican lawmakers have pushed for structural reforms to Social Security to extend its solvency. The depleted Social Security Trust Fund, Trump said, would be replenished by the increased tax revenue that would flow into the government from the higher job growth spurred by his economic policies.

Exclusive: Skeptical Trump says would renegotiate global climate deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential contender Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would renegotiate Americas role in the U.N. global climate accord, spelling potential doom for an agreement many view as a last chance to turn the tide on global warming. A pull-out by the worlds second biggest carbon-emitting country would hobble the deal reached in Paris last December by nearly 200 nations, who for the first time in more than two decades found a common vision for curbing greenhouse gas emissions. I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else, the New York real estate mogul said in an interview with Reuters.  But those agreements are one-sided agreements and they are bad for the United States. Trump said he did not believe China, the worlds top emitter of the carbon dioxide gas that many scientists believe is contributing to global climate change, would adhere to its pledge under the Paris deal. Not a big fan because other countries dont adhere to it, and China doesnt adhere to it, and Chinas spewing into the atmosphere, he said. The accord to transform the worlds fossil-fuel driven economy was a potent signal to investors.  It seeks to limit a rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius through combined national pledges to cut emissions, and provide funding for developing nations to mitigate the damaging effects of a sea level rise and climate change. The Obama administration pledged a 26 to 28 percent domestic reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005, while China promised it would halt increases in carbon emissions by 2030. Both countries have promised to ratify the deal this year. Many U.S. Republicans have found fault with the deal for overreacting to what they see as an uncertain threat. Former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who helped broker the deal, said this month that the U.S. election was critical to its future. If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption, he said. Trump has said that he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by China to hurt the competitiveness of U.S. business. One of his energy policy advisers is a climate change skeptic, U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic contender for the White House, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030. Trumps comment drew fire from environmental advocates. This is another example of Trumps dangerous lack of judgment and the very real impacts it could have for all of us, said Gene Karpinski, president of the U.S.-based environmental group League of Conservation Voters.  Trumps denunciation of the Paris climate accord is not only short sighted, but would be terribly costly for America and our ability to lead the world. We cannot go backwards on this important step towards a clean energy economy that benefits all our families, billionaire environmental financier Tom Steyer said in a statement. The Paris agreement has an article built into it meant to protect countries in the accord in the event that a new government comes in and wants to dismantle it. The clause says any nation wanting to withdraw will first have to wait four years. U.S. chief climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said last week that regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election, other countries were likely to be bound by the pact. ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
"Trump on North Korea, Wall Street regulation, tech stocks","NEW YORK - Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump told Reuters in a wide-ranging interview on Tuesday that he would be willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyangs nuclear program. He also called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord and said he would dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations if he is elected president. Here are excerpts of the interview. On speaking to Kim Jong Un: I would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him. At the same time, I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China. People dont realize that. They are extracting vast billions of dollars out of our country. Billions. And we have tremendous power over China. China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call. On breaking up big banks:  The big banks arent big banks compared to other big banks. In other words if you look at the big banks in Germany or if you look at the big banks in China, I have the biggest bank in the world right downstairs four or five floors below us. ... If we make our big banks too much not big, they wont be able to compete with the banks from China and the banks from Germany and other big banks. On repealing Dodd-Frank:  Im going to be making a statement about this in approximately two weeks having to do with Dodd-Frank. Much of it is very bad. Much of it gives so much power to the regulators that the bankers are unable to function. Dodd Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function. ... It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop. And will there be bad loans made? Yes, but there are bad loans made now with Dodd-Frank, OK, I mean all you have to do is take a look. The rules and regulations of Dodd Frank have made it so impossible to carry out business and to, especially with respect to lending to businesses who are going to employ a lot of people. So Im going to make a statement about it. But Dodd-Frank  I mean there are some things in Dodd-Frank that can stay but overall Dodd-Frank has been very bad. On tech stocks: You have a stock market that is very strange. Could be a little bit similar to, would you say its nine years ago now? I guess its sort of nine years ago. But you know, you look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company and theyre selling for so much money. And I would have said can that ever happen again? I think that could happen again. Im talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars. So here we go again. On auditing the Fed:  I think number one, the Federal Reserve should be audited. You know, theyre not auditing it. And so far not too many people have been able to tell me why. Im not one that says we should get rid of the Federal Reserve because I think the Federal Reserve has an important function, but it should certainly be audited and ... we should at least watch what theyre doing from the dollar standpoint. On timing for audit-the-Fed legislation:  Its not my highest priority. I have other priorities like rebuild our military. ... Its not my number one priority. But certainly its one of the things that well be doing. On replacing Fed Chair Janet Yellen:  Im not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low interest rate person, unless inflation rears its ugly head, which could happen at some point. It doesnt seem like its happening any time soon. I dont think I want to at this point - I mean, number one, shes got time left. I would rather have a Republican in the position, but I am not the enemy of Janet Yellen. ... Look, if interest rates were raised and if the dollar went up more, wed be doing no business. Were being killed by other countries devaluing their currencies. On the Paris accords: Not a big fan. No. Not a big fan because other countries dont adhere to it and China doesnt adhere to it, and Chinas spewing into the atmosphere. Take a look at China with certain agreements where they have to do it within 30 years, and we have to do it almost immediately. You understand what I mean by that? The agreements are not fair agreements, number one. And I would say that I will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum, I will be renegotiating those agreements. At a minimum. Ok? And at a maximum, I may do something else. But those agreements are one-sided agreements, and theyre bad for the United States. On devaluation of the yuan: China was in big trouble a year ago, now all of a sudden they cut their currency. Theyre taking more business out of the United States. ... China, whenever they have a problem, they devalue their currency. And they take more money out of the United States. Jobs, money, product. Trade: We cannot allow China and other countries to rip the soul out of our country. And they will understand that. South China Sea: Theyre building a massive fortress in the South China Sea. Theyre not supposed to be doing that.  On Russian presence in Ukraine: I dont like it. I dont like it at all. On Russian President Vladimir Putin: Putin made very nice statements about me. Very strong, very nice statements. I think thats not a bad thing, thats a good thing.  I think Ill have a good relationship with Russia, and I may not. And the fact that hes said good things about me doesnt mean that, you know, its going to help him in a negotiation. It wont help him at all. And Ill know pretty soon in whether or not Ill have a good relationship with Russia. But wouldnt it be wonderful if we actually did have a good relationship with foreign countries as opposed to the way theyre treating us now? Everyone knows. You know on Nov. 1, theyre going to announce new - the numbers are going to come out for Obamacare. They are going to be catastrophic. Its beyond terrible healthcare. And Obamacare in 17 collapses. Dont forget, Obama pushed everything to 17 because hell be out on the golf course. Hell be playing a nice round of golf someplace. Obamacare is part of the bubble problem. Now, were going to terminate Obamacare, and were going to replace it with something much better and much less expensive. Well, the lines are very important. The lines meaning the state borders. These people are protected from competition. And you go to these states and they have - its almost like a monopoly in many of the states. You have to get rid of the lines. And they almost did it with Obamacare. It almost worked out.  I think that Medicaid should be sent to the states. Ok? Let them work it. Its very important that we protect Social Security and our Medicare without cuts. And Im the only Republican that says that.   I think he was inappropriate. I think he was totally inappropriate. Hes got plenty of problems, and I think he was inappropriate. So thats fine... Im sure Ill have a good relationship with him.  ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
Trump changes tune on UK's Cameron: now sees 'a good relationship',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump appeared to change tack on Tuesday about his future ties with British Prime Minister David Cameron, saying he expects them to have a good relationship if he becomes the U.S. president, after predicting the opposite in an interview aired just the day before in response to criticism from the UK leader. Hes got plenty of problems, and I think he was inappropriate. So thats fine. ... Im sure Ill have a good relationship with him, Trump told Reuters in an interview. On Monday, in an interview broadcast on Britains ITV television station, Trump said, It looks like were not going to have a very good relationship, who knows? when asked how ties would fare if he won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Cameron criticized Trump in the British parliament over his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, calling him divisive, stupid and wrong. The prime minister suggested that the New York billionaire, who is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would unite Britain against him if he visited. Asked which foreign leader he would like to meet first, Trump told Reuters: I have no preference in terms of timing. Ill meet them, well have a better relationship with foreign countries than we have right now. We dont have a good relationship. Every one of them rips us off but we still dont have a good relationship.  ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
Trump preparing plan to dismantle Obama's Wall Street reform law,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday that sweeping financial reforms put in place under President Barack Obama were harming the economy and he would dismantle nearly all of them. Trump told Reuters in an interview that he would release a plan in about two weeks for overhauling the 2010 financial regulatory law known as Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function, the presumptive Republican nominee said. It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop. Pressed on the extent of the changes he wanted to make, Trump said, it will be close to dismantling of Dodd-Frank. Reacting on Twitter to Trumps comment, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called it a reckless idea that would leave middle-class families out to dry. Dodd-Frank, passed in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, forced U.S. banks to reduce their reliance on debt for funding and to craft living wills, or blueprints for winding them down in a crisis. The law created a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to oversee consumer financial products such as mortgages and gave regulators new powers over large non-bank financial companies. Republicans in Congress have pushed to ease the requirements on small- and medium-sized banks and to make it more difficult for regulators to introduce new rules. They have also argued for getting rid of the consumer financial protection agency. Banks and other financial firms have spent six years and millions of dollars adjusting their operations to comply with the law. Bank lobbyists have generally pushed for changes to make complying easier, rather than a wholesale rewrite. Every law can be improved, and Dodd-Frank is no exception. Sometimes there are drafting errors. Sometimes a good idea in theory turns out to be unworkable after a closer look in the light of day, said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association. Alison Hawkins, a spokesman for the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington-based financial industry trade group, said the group wanted to know more about Trumps plan, and added some fixes to Dodd-Frank will benefit consumers and the economy. On Capitol Hill, Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, plans to release his own financial regulation plan in the coming weeks, according to his spokeswoman, Sarah Rozier. Mr. Trump is right, Dodd-Frank isnt working, Rozier said. She added that Hensarling, who has endorsed Trump, has not discussed his plan with any of the presidential candidates. But Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a group that favors tighter regulation of Wall Street, said Trumps plan would be a slap in the face to the American people who have suffered so much from the 2008 crash. Trump declined to offer specifics on his plan, but said it would address whether institutions should separate commercial banking activities from investment banking. He said even under the new plan, the banking system would not be perfect.  Will there be bad loans made? Yes. But there are bad loans made now with Dodd-Frank, Trump said. Trump was reluctant to discuss specifics on his ideas for the economy before his upcoming speech, but he praised Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, saying he approved of her decision to keep interest rates low. Trump has said in the past he would replace Yellen once her term as Fed chair ended. Im not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job, he told Reuters. I would rather have a Republican in the position but I am not the enemy of Janet Yellen. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2016 ",1

Senate backs Fanning as Army secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate unanimously backed President Barack Obamas nomination of Eric Fanning as secretary of the Army on Tuesday, making him the first openly gay leader of a U.S. military service branch. Fanning was previously undersecretary of the Air Force and chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Fanning was confirmed by unanimous voice vote, eight months following his nomination, after Senator Pat Roberts said Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told him that it was now too late for the administration to transfer prisoners from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Roberts home state, Kansas. Work did not confirm Roberts account of that conversation, saying that no option was off the table. I explained to Senator Roberts that we are trying to achieve the goal of closure with the support of Congress and we recognize that there is limited time left to achieve that support, both in terms of lifting Congressional restrictions and winning approval of funds to execute closure, Work said in a statement.  Roberts had held up Fannings nomination for months to  underscore his opposition to any possible transfer of detainees. His opposition had frustrated fellow Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of Fannings nomination. On Tuesday, McCain and Roberts appeared in the Senate together as Roberts announced that he had released his hold on Fanning and spoken to Fanning. McCain noted that this years National Defense Authorization Act ensures that the Obama administration does not have the authority to release or transfer Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. mainland. Roberts said Work told him during a meeting last week that he would be unable to fulfill an order to move Guantanamo detainees to the United States before Obama leaves office in January 2017. The clock has run out for the president, Roberts said. ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1

Let me get this straight: Donald Trump insults the leader of our closest ally, then turns around and says hed love to talk to Kim Jong Un? senior foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement.

Judges rule Trump University can appeal to New York's highest court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York appeals court issued a ruling on Tuesday that apparently made it highly unlikely that a state fraud case against Trump University, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps venture, will be heard before the Nov. 8 general election. The mid-level appeals court ruled that Trumps lawyers can argue to the states highest court that the fraud claims against Trump University brought by the state attorney general should be dismissed.  Trump suffered a legal setback in the case in March when the appeals court allowed multimillion-dollar fraud claims against the now-defunct venture to proceed.  The claims are part of a state lawsuit filed in 2013 that accuses Trump University of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn the billionaire businessmans real estate investment strategies. The trial judge in the case had been waiting to hear whether the mid-level appeals court, the Appellate Division, First Department, in Manhattan, would give Trump permission to go to the states highest court, the Court of Appeals. Its no surprise that Donald Trump is using every legal option to avoid standing trial for operating a sham for-profit university, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement responding to the ruling.  As our lawsuit makes clear, Mr. Trumps phony university defrauded thousands of students through an illicit scheme that cost them millions of dollars, Schneiderman continued. I am confident that the Court of Appeals will agree with the lower courts unanimous decision to reject virtually all of Mr. Trumps claims. Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said, We are pleased with the courts decision and look forward to going to the Court of Appeals. Garten has said the claims are without merit and baseless and that almost all those who participated in the programs filled out written surveys giving the seminars high ratings. Class actions are pending in California on similar claims by Trump University students. One of those cases is scheduled for trial on Nov. 28. The fraud claims against Trump University were an issue early in the Republican primary campaign.  With Trump allowed to appeal the pretrial rulings to the states highest court, it is very unlikely the New York case will be resolved before Novembers election. It takes an average of 12 months from the time an appeal is allowed for the Court of Appeals to hear oral arguments in a case, according to court spokesman Gary Spencer. A decision on whether or not the fraud claims can proceed would normally take another month and, if not dismissed, the case would then go back to the trial court.  In the March decision, Schneiderman was allowed to proceed on fraud claims that require proof of intent to defraud and those that do not. The court also ruled that the statute of limitations for the claims stretches back to 2007 instead of 2010. The program stopped taking students in 2010. ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
Donald Trump files disclosure of $10 billion in net worth,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump has filed a new personal financial disclosure form that details a net worth of more than $10 billion, the Republican presidential candidates campaign said on Tuesday. The partys presumptive nominee has refused so far to release his income tax statements, which are normally released by presidential candidates. That decision has drawn criticism from likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  The personal disclosure form is identical to one Trump filed shortly after announcing his candidacy last year. Critics have said the billionaire real estate developer is inflating his net worth in the forms and that his tax documents would provide a more accurate depiction of how much money he has. I have built an incredible company and have accumulated one of the greatest portfolios of real estate assets, many of which are considered to be among the finest and most iconic properties in the world, Trump said in a statement about his disclosure.

House drops military draft requirement for women,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives stripped a requirement that women register for the military draft from a sweeping annual defense policy bill on Tuesday, but supporters of the provision said they would keep pushing for its passage. Democrats accused the committees Republican leaders of using an underhanded ploy to undercut the House Armed Services Committee, which had approved the amendment, and avoid what could be a difficult vote for some party members. They dont want to subject their members to a vote on equality for women, Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, told reporters. Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the amendment was removed because it violated House budget rules due to the cost of  registering women. He said it was replaced with an amendment calling for a broad review of the Selective Service. The House Rules Committee set up removal of the amendment from the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, during a meeting late on Monday. It was taken out of the bill via a procedural vote on Tuesday afternoon. But the effort is not dead. The Senate Armed Services Committee included a similar amendment in its version of the NDAA, and it has bipartisan support in the Senate. The Senates Republican Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said he believed women should register, although he did not expect the country to reinstate the draft. Given where we are today with women in the military performing virtually all kinds of functions, I personally think it would be appropriate for them to register just like men do, McConnell told a news conference. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced last year that all combat positions would be open to women, which immediately prompted calls that women also should be required to register. That worried some social conservatives uncomfortable with the blurring of mens and womens traditional roles in society. The U.S. military has been an all-volunteer force since the 1970s, but young men have been required to sign up for the Selective Service in case the draft is reactivated.     To become law as part of the NDAA, a version of the defense bill with the amendment would have to be approved by the full House and Senate, and signed by President Barack Obama.

"Obama speaks to Philippines' president-elect, stresses human rights","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama called incoming Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday to congratulate him on his election win, stressing that their countries alliance was based on a commitment to human rights and the rule of law, the White House said. U.S. officials have signaled that Washington is ready to work with Duterte despite allegations of human rights abuses in the city he led as mayor for over two decades. Obamas deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told a Washington seminar earlier on Tuesday that the U.S. administration was aware there was some controversy surrounding Duterte and statements that drew attention in the past, but he did not elaborate. Obama offered his congratulations to Duterte as the presumptive president-elect. He won the largest share of the votes in a May 9 presidential election, according to an unofficial count by a poll watchdog, although the official result has yet to be confirmed. Obama highlighted the enduring values that underpin our thriving alliance ... and the longstanding ties between our two peoples, including our shared commitments to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and inclusive economic growth, the White House said. Washington hoped to build on progress made with the last administration in the Philippines, Rhodes said. This is a new government and well want to hear from them directly what their priorities are, he said when asked about the election, adding that Washington wanted to see continued efforts to respect the rule of law and combat corruption. Duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings under his administration in Davao city, and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president. He has denied ordering any of the killings, but has not condemned them. Washington has steered clear of the controversy, however, which analysts say reflects the reality of U.S. national security interests given Chinas increasingly assertive stance in Asia and maritime disputes in the South China Sea. Dutertes vows to restore law and order resonated with voters, but his incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many people. Rhodes noted U.S. support for Manila efforts to resolve its territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea through international arbitration, and a recent deal allowing a greater U.S. military presence in the Philippines.  We believe that now as much as ever its important that the U.S. and Philippines are seen working together, he said. The U.S. stance on Duterte could echo its approach toward Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At one point, Modi was unable to obtain a U.S. visa because of concerns about sectarian riots in the state of Gujarat when he was chief minister, but was later invited to the White House when he became prime minister.

White House defends deportations after Democratic complaints,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday defended its deportation policy after complaints from Democratic presidential candidates and congressional leaders that a sweep targeting Central American illegal immigrants is inhumane. Reuters reported on Thursday that U.S. immigration officials plan a month-long series of raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally. White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged that the deportation operations were consistent with President Barack Obamas policy to focus on deporting criminals and recent immigrants who crossed the U.S. border illegally after Jan. 1, 2014. No one is removed if they have an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief, Earnest told reporters at a briefing. If this serves to discourage people from considering to make this journey, that would be a good thing, Earnest said. In 2014, a wave of children fleeing violence in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala surged across the U.S. border, inflaming the debate over how to deal with the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries by Central American women traveling with their children. In January, immigration officers rounded up 121 people, mostly women and children, in three states. That sparked criticism from Democrats running to replace Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential elections. On Thursday, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton reiterated her concerns about the new plans. Im against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities, Clinton said. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders said he opposed the painful and inhumane business of locking up and deporting families trying to escape violence in other countries. In Congress, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called on Obama to reconsider the plans and focus on addressing the instability in Central America. Democratic representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a critic of the Obama administrations deportation policies, complained the administration was leaking word of the deportations to scare people away from coming to the United States. The last time they did this, people called my office about raids that were not existent because it creates panic, it creates fear, its terrible, its a terrible way to bring about policy on this issue, Gutierrez told reporters. Stop talking about them as illegal immigrants. They are asylum seekers, he said. ",politicsNews,"May 13, 2016 ",1
Senate passes bill allowing 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabias government for damages, setting up a potential showdown with the White House, which has threatened a veto. The Saudis, who deny responsibility for the 2001 attacks, strongly object to the bill. They had said they might sell up to $750 billion in U.S. securities and other American assets in retaliation if it became law. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, passed the Senate by unanimous voice vote. It must next be taken up by the U.S. House of Representatives, where the Judiciary Committee intends to hold a hearing on the measure in the near future, a committee aide said. If it became law, JASTA would remove the sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. It would allow survivors of the attacks, and relatives of those killed in the attacks, to seek damages from other countries. In this case, it would allow lawsuits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir has said his countrys objection to the bill is based on principles of international relations. What (Congress is) doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle, he said in a statement on Tuesday. James Kreindler, a prominent trial lawyer who represents 9/11 families and won large payouts for the victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan American Airways Flight 103 over Scotland, said he expected the bill to pass the House and become law. It would be crazy for (President Barack) Obama to veto bipartisan legislation (which would) open (U.S.) courts to victims of the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history, Kreindler said. Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat and a JASTA co-sponsor, said the bill is overdue. Today the Senate has spoken loudly and unanimously that the families of victims of terrorist attacks should be able to hold the perpetrators, even if its a country, a nation, accountable, Schumer told a news conference. Republican Senator John Cornyn, also a sponsor of the bill, said JASTA does not target the Saudis, although he alluded to a still-classified section of a report on the Sept. 11 attacks that Saudi critics say might implicate Riyadh. We have yet to see the 28 pages that have not been yet released about the 9/11 report, and that may well be instructive, Cornyn said at the news conference. Other lawmakers who have seen the 28 pages have said releasing them would quiet such rumors. Cornyn said it was up to the court to decide whether the Saudis were liable. I dont believe that this will be destructive of the relationship that we have with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, he said. The White House said Obama still plans to veto JASTA. This legislation would change long-standing, international law regarding sovereign immunity, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a daily press briefing. And the president of the United States continues to harbor serious concerns that this legislation would make the United States vulnerable in other court systems around the world. Asked if Senate Democrats would back a veto, Schumer said he would vote against Obama. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who had opposed the bill, said the version passed on Tuesday eased his worries that it might leave U.S. allies more vulnerable to lawsuits, for example if groups based within their borders but not supported by their governments were behind a terrorist attack. We dont want to alienate allies, but we do want to create redress if a nation-state was involved in helping a terrorist organization attack American interests, and I think they should be held liable, Graham said in a brief interview.

Cutting Pentagon's acquisition chief post may raise costs: Carter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A proposal by a U.S. Senate committee to cancel the Defense Department position of acquisition chief could lead to an increase in costs, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Tuesday. The Senate Armed Services Committees version of the National Defense Authorization Act aims to cancel the position of under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics because it slows innovation.  The committee is proposing to divide the responsibilities between a new office in the Pentagon that deals with research and another which would address business management. If the acquisition chief position, currently held by Frank Kendall, was cut, it would separate research and engineering from manufacturing and could derail progress made on lowering growth in contract costs over the last three decades, Carter said at the Sea-Air-Space conference. Separating these functions makes no sense, as procurement and sustainment costs are controlled by decisions made during development, Carter said. The proposal still has to take a number of steps before it becomes law. The Senate version of the defense bill must be reconciled with the Houses version before being voted on in both chambers. If passed, that version would be sent to the White House for President Barack Obamas signature, or veto.     On Monday, the White House said it would veto the Houses version of the bill because it would shift $18 billion of wartime Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs.

Appeals court delays release of NJ's 'Bridgegate' co-conspirators list,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday postponed a deadline for prosecutors in New Jersey to reveal a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the so-called Bridgegate criminal case involving allies of Governor Chris Christie. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a last-minute emergency request from one of the people on the list, less than two hours before U.S. prosecutors were set to file the names in federal court in New Jersey. The document could make clear how many Christie associates were aware of an alleged scheme to close down lanes at the George Washington Bridge in what prosecutors claim was an act of political retribution against a local mayor. Christie, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for his partys presidential nomination this year, has denied knowledge of the plot. U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton had ordered the list made public at the request of several media companies. But one of the alleged co-conspirators anonymously filed an emergency appeal, arguing his reputation will be irreparably besmirched. In a brief order, the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia scheduled a hearing for June 6. The court is also considering whether that hearing should be closed to the public, presumably to preserve the individuals anonymity.     The unindicted co-conspirators are those who prosecutors believe joined in the plot but have not been criminally charged. Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for the media companies, said in an email, Were looking forward to making our case before the full 3rd Circuit panel that the public has a First Amendment right to see the list of unindicted co-conspirators. Thus far, three people have been charged. William Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Kelly, Christies former deputy chief of staff, are scheduled to face trial in September. David Wildstein, also a former official at the Port Authority, the agency that oversees major transportation facilities in the New York City area, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating. Prosecutors say they orchestrated the September 2013 lane closure in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as payback against the Democratic mayor for refusing to endorse Christies re-election bid. The ensuing traffic wreaked havoc in town, causing massive delays and impeding emergency responders. The case has proven embarrassing for Christie, who is heading presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps transition team. The trial will unfold in the heat of the presidential campaign ahead of Election Day, Nov. 8.",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
New Jersey governor's race opens as Christie's approval slumps,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The race to succeed Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie got under way this week when a former Goldman Sachs executive entered the ring as the first Democratic contender to succeed Christie, whose popularity has slumped. Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and U.S. ambassador to Germany who has never held elected office, is seeking the Democratic nomination for the gubernatorial  election in November 2017.  Christie, who is not eligible to run for a third term, won the governorship in 2009, when he beat one-term Democrat Jon Corzine, also formerly of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Murphy, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany until 2013, said he would focus on issues such as equal pay for women and a higher minimum wage - legislative initiatives that Christie has either already vetoed and is expected to veto.  Its time for a governor who has your back. I will, promised Murphy, 58, in a campaign ad released on Monday. He is a married father of four who lives in Middletown and retired in 2006 after 23 years at the Wall Street investment bank. Political observers say other possible candidates include Democrats such as state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and Republicans such as Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick, state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr and Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno. Christie has seen his approval ratings fall to fresh lows in recent weeks. He has been tarnished by the Bridgegate scandal and criticized as a no-show leader preoccupied first with his own presidential campaign and when that failed, with role as a top adviser to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. His approval ratings are terrible. They have been low and keep going down. He will leave unpopular, said Julian Zelizer, a professor of political history at Princeton University. A poll of New Jersey voters last month showed 31 percent approve and 63 percent disapprove of Christies performance as governor, said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics. Voters will likely seek a candidate very different from Christie, Zelizer said, particularly on transparency and righting the states finances.  They are looking for someone who is antithetical to him. Someone they can trust, someone who is devoted to the state, and someone who seems clean and immune from scandal, Zelizer said. They want a governor who will bring in new kinds of industry and new pockets of growth. ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
White House voices concerns on Senate Sept. 11 lawsuit bill ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday that it had serious concerns about a bill the U.S. Senate passed that would allow survivors and relatives of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks to sue to seek damages from the government of Saudi Arabia.

"Australian opposition leader backs Clinton, slams Trump","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australias center-left opposition Labor Party leader Bill Shorten on Tuesday endorsed U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton over her chief Republican rival, Donald Trump, who he said would be very difficult to work with. Shorten, who is campaigning against Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ahead of national elections on July 2, pledged to continue Australias close relationship with the United States regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election. But he made no secret of which candidate he preferred. In terms of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, I have to say that if I was in America, I would be voting for Hillary Clinton, Shorten told reporters. Whoever America elects well deal with but theres no doubt in my mind that Trump would be very difficult, I think, to deal with. Trumps often controversial comments on everything from Muslims and women to the future of NATO and relations with Russia have drawn criticism from Berlin, Paris and other European capitals. British Prime Minister David Cameron this week stood by his description of Trumps plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States as divisive, stupid and wrong after Trump said that he was unlikely to have a good relationship with Cameron.

California Democrats dueling over gun control plans,"SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - Two of the most powerful politicians in California are advancing the same basic gun control agenda  yet they are at loggerheads in a political duel that could preview an ugly race to replace the states popular Democratic governor, Jerry Brown. The spat among ambitious Democrats took a serious turn this week, as Senate leader Kevin de Leon aggressively moved to push a package of gun control bills through the legislature that, if passed, would largely render irrelevant a firearms referendum by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom aimed at the November ballot. They both want tougher gun laws in California and they both want credit for it, said Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist who now heads the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. Both efforts would prohibit possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require greater scrutiny of ammunition purchasers and seek to better keep guns out of the hands of violent felons. The legislative package, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday and will go before the full body on Thursday, also seeks to eliminate a loophole in an existing law prohibiting weapons with detachable ammunition magazines. Newsom, who is running to replace Brown in the 2018 gubernatorial election, is expected to make the gun control measure a centerpiece of his campaign, along with a proposed ballot initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.   But de Leon has not endorsed him. Last year, shortly after Newsom announced his gun control referendum, de Leon reduced the number of legislative staff working in the lieutenant governors office. De Leon, who represents Los Angeles, is close to possible Newsom rivals in the governors race, including former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.  He has asked Newsom to agree to withdraw his ballot measure if the Senate package passes, but Newsom has refused. The initiative process is a blunt instrument and should always be the last resort - not the first, de Leon said in an email on Monday. It would be preferable to achieve policymaking on such a complex issue as gun control through the legislative process. De Leon is also concerned that the ballot campaign would be expensive, drawing political contributions from pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association and potentially causing Democrats in moderate and conservative districts to lose elections, a source close to him said. But Newsom said in a letter to de Leon shared with Reuters that his initiative was more comprehensive than the Senate package, tackling topics that had stalled repeatedly in the legislature. Dan Newman, Newsoms campaign strategist, said concerns about gun violence, not politics, motivated the lieutenant governor. He will get plenty of exposure this fall via his support for the marijuana initiative and Hillary for President, Newman said. Being relentlessly attacked by the NRA isnt something he needs for his personal ambition. Backing a ballot initiative on a controversial topic like gun control will likely raise Newsoms profile with voters, Schnur said. But it could also backfire and alienate de Leon. It doesnt do his campaign for governor a lot of good to be going up against the most powerful Democrat in the legislature, Schnur said. Gun rights supporters say both men are being opportunistic. Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom is no stranger to trying to hijack high-profile issues in order to get his name out there, said Craig Deluz, a lobbyist for the Calgun Foundation. And Senate Pro Tem de Leon doesnt want the Lieutenant Governor to steal his thunder. ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
Donald Trump to meet with Henry Kissinger: Washington Post ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the Washington Post reported on Monday, citing three people close to Trump. The meeting in New York comes after weeks of telephone conversations between Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Kissinger, who was a top adviser to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, the Post said. Last week, Trump met with former Secretary of State James Baker, who told a congressional hearing on the same day as the meeting that Trumps foreign policy proposals would make the world a less stable place. Trump has been criticized for suggesting the United States should rethink the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that Japan and South Korea should consider getting nuclear weapons to defend themselves.

Boston men jailed for Trump-inspired hate crime attack,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Two Boston brothers accused of urinating on and beating a homeless Mexican man and telling police Donald Trump was right: All these illegals need to be deported, were sentenced to prison on Monday, prosecutors said. Scott Leader, 38, and Steve Leader, 30, had previously pleaded guilty to indictments charging them with causing bodily injury while committing a civil rights violation, as well as assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, among other charges. Scott Leader was sentenced to three years in prison and Steve Leader was sentenced to 1-1/2 years, the Suffolk County District Attorneys Office said in a statement. The pair will also be on probation for three years after their prison sentences end. The Leaders were arrested on Aug. 19 on suspicion of beating Rodriguez, then 58, as he slept in a subway station. The men told police they targeted their victim because they believed he was an illegal immigrant.  The victim, Guillermo Rodriguez, said in a statement that he was in fact a permanent resident. I came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. I actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago, although if I had been undocumented I still would not have deserved to be beaten this way, Rodriguez said in a prepared statement read by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Rimar before the sentencing. The pair punched and kicked Rodriguez, and one of the men repeatedly struck him with a metal pole, before the two walked off laughing, prosecutors said. According to a police report, they told officers, Donald Trump was right: All these illegals need to be deported. Prosecutors said Scott Leader told arresting officers that he believed the attack was justified because the victim was homeless and Hispanic. The pair also allegedly threatened police officers while in custody. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. presidential race, has been vocal on immigration, proposing to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and promising, if elected, to deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States. Trump, a real estate developer and reality television personality, initially described the attack as an outcome of passionate views on immigration but later called it terrible. Lawyers for the two men could not be reached for immediate comment on Monday night. ",politicsNews,"May 17, 2016 ",1
Former Trump girlfriend rebuts NY Times story on history with women,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A woman at the center of a New York Times piece detailing Republican Donald Trumps history with women took issue with the story on Monday, saying she never had a negative experience with the billionaire and does not believe he ever mistreated women. Rowanne Brewer Lane, a former model who dated Trump for several months starting in the late 1990s, said her words were mischaracterized in the Times article, which used dozens of interviews to show what it said was a pattern of unsettling personal behavior by the presidential candidate with women. The Times story said Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, asked Lane to change into a bikini shortly after meeting her at a pool party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. According to the article, he then introduced her to the crowd outside, saying, That is a stunning Trump girl, isnt it? On Monday, Lane told the same story in a series of television interviews but said she had been flattered by his comment. They spun it to where it appeared negative, Lane said on Fox News. I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump. Lane said that during the time she and Trump were dating, he never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way. She also said she supports Trumps presidential run. The New York Times responded to Lanes accusations by saying she was quoted fairly, accurately and at length. The story provides context for the reader including that the swimsuit scene was the start of a whirlwind romance between Ms. Brewer Lane and Mr. Trump, Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in a statement. Trump has deflected criticism about his attitude toward women throughout his campaign. On Monday, he called the New York Times so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie! Trump posted on Twitter.     Times reporters Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey defended their story in several television interviews on Monday, saying it showed how Trump behaved privately with women and revealed common themes including unwelcome advances, aggression and commentary on their appearance. People can evaluate the story ... on its own merits, Barbaro said on CBS This Morning. ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 ",1
House 2017 defense bill would face Obama veto: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas White House set up one last fight with the Republican-controlled Congress over defense spending on Monday, threatening to veto a 2017 defense authorization bill over its use of special war funds for day-to-day military programs. The House of Representatives draft of the $602 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which sets spending policy for the Department of Defense, would shift $18 billion of wartime Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, funds to avoid automatic budget cuts to military programs. The Obama administration objects to the use of that money, saying it threatens U.S. security and unfairly spares the Pentagon from cuts faced by important civilian programs such as medical research and education. By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies, the White House said in a statement. House Republicans say the spending plan is essential to ensure that the military has the resources it needs, as it wages wars in Afghanistan and against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The Obama administration also objected to a long list of policy provisions in the bill, including measures making it more difficult to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and cuts in funding for programs to train and equip local fighters in Iraq and Syria. Obama vetoed one version of the 2016 NDAA over its use of OCO funding and the Guantanamo restrictions. He later signed a modified version that addressed his budget concerns but left the Guantanamo measures in place. It will be months before the legislation passes Congress and arrives on Obamas desk. The House draft has passed the House Armed Services Committee, and Republican leaders would like a vote by the full House as soon as Wednesday. However, lawmakers have offered 375 amendments on a huge range of issues. The Rules Committee was meeting late on Monday to decide which of those amendments might come up for a vote. The Senate is also drafting its version of the NDAA, which must be reconciled with the Houses before being subject to vote in both chambers. If passed, that version would be sent to the White House for Obamas signature, or veto. ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 ",1
Cuba and United States draw up roadmap for talks to deepen detente,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States aim to reach new agreements on cooperation in law enforcement, health and agriculture over the coming months, a senior Cuban official said on Monday, as part of the former Cold War foes drive to normalize ties. The Communist-ruled island and its northern neighbor reestablished diplomatic relations a year ago after decades of hostility and have since signed deals on the environment, postal services and direct flights. A bilateral commission met on Monday in Havana to establish a roadmap for talks over the rest of this year, which would include more high-ranking official visits, said Josefina Vidal, head of the Cuban delegation. In March, Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president in 88 years to visit Cuba. The agenda is quite ambitious, Vidal told a news conference, adding that talks about intellectual property rights were also in the cards. The two sides had discussed holding dialogues on human rights and claims, the U.S. embassy in Cuba said in a statement. They already outlined their respective claims late last year, with the U.S. seeking upwards of $10 billion in compensation for nationalized properties and Cuba demanding at least $121 billion in reparations for the U.S. trade embargo and other acts it described as aggression. The United States looks forward to holding these meetings in the near future, the embassy said. Tomorrow (we) will discuss specific steps related to bilateral security during the law enforcement dialogue. Vidal, who is the Cuban Foreign Ministrys chief of U.S. affairs, said the island was hopeful that whomever became next the U.S. president would continue to deepen the detente. The United States will hold a general election on Nov.8. When you look at the polls, the majority of the American population and the Cuban American community are in favor of the normalization of relations, she said. So I expect their opinion will be taken into account. ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 ",1
Divided lawmakers battle over Puerto Rico debt bill  ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A congressional committee on Mondayput off plans to debate legislationon how to address Puerto Ricos economic crisis, the latest sign of ongoing struggle by lawmakers to find a solution for the American territorys crippling $70 billion debt. For months the Natural Resources Committee of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has been weighing whether and how to rescue Puerto Rico from a crippling debt without spending any U.S. taxpayer money. A committee spokesman said the panel will unveil a new draft proposal soon and then consider that plan in a work session next week. House Speaker Paul Ryan has rejected any bailout of creditors and instead has been mulling the creation of an oversight board that would reschedule the U.S. territorys debt payments. The committee repeatedly has had to hold off on such a work session because of a lack of agreement. Some of the panels 26 Republicans oppose any debt restructuring, while some of its 18 Democratswant limitations on the oversight board, and object to some side issues included in the bill, such as one having to do with the Caribbean islands minimum wage law. On May 1, Puerto Rico, which is suffering from a 45 percent poverty rate, defaulted on some of its debt when it missed paying the Government Development Bank around $400 million. It faces another debt payment, of nearly $2 billion, on July 1. The Republican-led U.S. Senate has been awaiting action by the House before debating a Puerto Rico debt bill.

Obama administration releases rules on wellness programs,"(Reuters) - A federal agency on Monday released final rules on how employers can offer workers financial incentives of up to 30 percent of the cost of their cheapest health insurance plans to participate in wellness programs without violating federal laws protecting the confidentiality of medical information. The move from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission aims to clear up confusion over the way two federal laws protecting employees medical privacy apply to the popular programs, which are designed to control medical spending by reducing obesity, smoking and other risk factors.  The rules, which were first proposed in November, mark a compromise with U.S. businesses that opposed the EEOCs previous stance that providing incentives for voluntary wellness programs rendered them involuntary, and thus illegal. The 2010 Affordable Care Act allowed U.S. employers to increase the rewards they offer to employees who participate in wellness programs. But in a series of 2013 lawsuits against companies, including Honeywell International Inc, the EEOC said requests for medical information related to incentive-based wellness programs violated the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.  Under the new rules, incentives for wellness programs are open only to employees, not their families, and are capped at 30 percent of the cheapest individual health insurance premium offered through the employer. The new rules are more restrictive than those passed under the ACA, which allowed incentives of up to 30 percent of the actual cost of an employees insurance plan and 50 percent for programs approved by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services. Only smoking-cessation programs received that approval. Senator Lamar Alexander (R.-Tennessee), chair of the Senates Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he would push legislation, along with House Republicans, to reverse the rules. The National Business Group on Health, a non-profit organization advocating for large healthcare employers, said that although it would have hoped for some additional flexibility... the rules do what the EEOC was asked to do. Some health and workers rights groups say the rules, which take effect next year, penalize employees who decline to join wellness programs and hand over private medical information. Maxwell Mehlman, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said lower-income employees could be unduly pressured to join wellness programs. Its hard to say that thats a voluntary program for a lot of people, he said. ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 ",1
U.S. House to weigh $622.1 million in new Zika funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will try to pass legislation this week providing $622.1 million in funds to fight the spreading Zika virus, far less than the Obama administration has been seeking. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers introduced the measure on Monday, according to a statement. The bill would offset the new spending by taking $352.1 million from an Ebola fund and another $270 million from a Department of Health and Human Services administrative account. The bill will make dollars available to fight the disease now, prioritizing critical activities that must begin immediately, such as vaccine development and mosquito control, Rogers said. The mosquito-borne Zika virus has been linked to severe birth defects and other neurological disorders and is beginning to show up in warm climates in U.S. southern states such as Florida. The Obama administration in February called for $1.9 billion in emergency funds that would not result in any government spending cuts elsewhere. The White House and health officials have expressed concerns in the past with taking money from Ebola programs to pay for Zika virus efforts. But in April, after the Republican-led Congress did not act, it found a temporary fix to fund the fight against Zika by redirecting $589 million, mostly from Ebola funds.   White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday that congressional inaction on supplemental funding meant that health officials are forced to resort to the equivalent of digging through the sofa cushions to try to come up with the necessary money. The House bill is also at odds with legislation being debated in the Senate. Competing proposals there would either give Obama the full $1.9 billion or at least $1.1 billion. The Senate is expected to cast initial votes on the alternatives on Tuesday. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of being beyond reckless by being slow to send money to combat a raging virus. If the House and Senate approve competing versions they would have to reconcile their differences and pass one uniform bill before sending it to Obama for signing into law. Of the $622.1 million proposed by House Republicans, $230 million would go to the National Institutes of Health to help support the development of vaccines to stop the spread of Zika.  Other funds would be contributed to global health programs, through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, and for the development of rapid diagnostic tests.

Appeals court revives challenge to California county's gun law,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday revived a lawsuit by prospective gun shop owners who were banned by Alameda County, California, from opening within 500 feet of a residential district, ruling that local officials had failed to justify their law in the face of a constitutional right to bear arms. A three-member panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not strike down the local ordinance, but voted 2-1 to overturn a federal judge who threw the gun store owners lawsuit out of court. Gun rights groups quickly hailed the decision as an important protection of the Second Amendment. Were very happy to see the Court take a very principled and reasoned approach to protecting the fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms, Brandon Combs, executive director of the Calguns Foundation, said in a written statement.  The Ninth Circuit panel ordered that judge to take up the case again and said that if Alameda County wanted to enforce the gun-control ordinance, officials there would have to prove that there was a basis for the restrictions. Alameda Countys ordinance may very well be permissible. Thus far, however, the county has failed to justify the burden it has placed on the right of law-abiding citizens to purchase guns, Judge Diarmuid OScannlain wrote in a 34-page opinion for the majority.  The Second Amendment (of the U.S. Constitution) requires something more rigorous than the unsubstantiated assertions offered to the district court, OScannlain wrote. Representatives for the Alameda County Board of Supervisors could not immediately be reached for comment. In tossing the lawsuit out of court, the lower-court judge found that Alameda Countys gun restrictions were permissible to achieve such important governmental objectives as protecting public safety, preserving the character of residential areas and guarding against secondary effects of gun stores. But the Ninth Circuit majority said that Alameda County had not provided any evidence that such objectives would be achieved. The plaintiffs also asserted that no parcels in Alameda County would fit within the regulations, which meant that gun sales were effectively banned there. In dissenting from the majority, Judge Barry Silverman said that the ordinance did not infringe upon anyones right to bear arms and that what were dealing with here is a mundane zoning dispute dressed up as a Second Amendment challenge.

Betting on a Trump win or a North Korea H-bomb: a predictions site gains traction,"NEW YORK/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Erik Duhaime is a passive stock market investor, but he isnt afraid to short Donald Trump or go long on Hillary Clinton. The 28-year-old from Cambridge, Massachusetts, trades on PredictIt, an online political stock market that allows users to wager small amounts of money on yes or no predictions about whether an event will occur. That includes who will win the U.S. presidential election in November. This is probably one of the ways I restrain myself from being active in the stock market, said Duhaime, a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, who checks the site a few times a week for fun. PredictIt, which was launched in 2014, now has more than 30,000 traders registered, up from 19,000 at the end of 2015, and has received shout-outs from pundits and presidential campaign advisors alike. Users must be U.S. residents and registered voters. PredictIt says it is not like an online gambling site because it mainly exists to supply its data to universities for academic research, one of the main reasons the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission allows it to operate legally, according to a letter issued by the regulator in 2014. It is jointly run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and a Washington-based political consulting firm Aristotle International Inc.  Unlike mainstream financial markets, bets are not big: The CFTC caps each participants position at $850 per market, and the average deposit when people sign up is just $100. The regulator hasnt been as friendly to such betting sites in the past. In 2012, the CFTC filed a civil complaint against the now defunct Intrade for violating a ban on off-exchange options trading. The Ireland-based market also allowed people to wager money on yes or no questions, but it wasnt tied to an academic institution and didnt have a cap on the maximum amount that could be traded.  Predictions markets like PredictIt and a similar venue run by the University of Iowa have emerged as an alternative to polling for election forecasters. PredictIt is bigger than the Iowa Electronic Markets, which has only about 2,000 active traders with access to its political markets. Polling is very expensive, said David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research who runs a predictions-market aggregator called PredictWise, which draws heavily from PredictIt. Its a slow process. Its not very flexible. Knowledge of polls does also feed into betting decisions on PredictIt. Predictions markets translate this and other information into probability, said Rajiv Sethi, professor of economics at Barnard College. The basic intuition is that its a wisdom of crowds effect.     For example, Trumps chances of securing the Republican nomination for the presidential election swung dramatically on the site over the past three months as the primary season progressed. A Trump share shot from 30 cents in early February when he lost to rival Ted Cruz in the Iowa primary to 80 cents a month later when Trump dominated on Super Tuesday. They then lost half their value by early April as Cruz appeared to regain momentum with a big win in Wisconsin. With Cruz and another rival, John Kasich, now out of the race, Trump had risen to 94 cents by Monday. For graphic showing Trump's ascendancy on PredictIt during primary season, see tmsnrt.rs/1WmRq For Novembers election, though, Trump is trailing on PredictIt with 40 cents against Clintons 59 cents.  While PredictIts precision has yet to be closely examined by academics, other predictions markets such as the Iowa Electronic Markets, have proven to be just as accurate as polls, experts who have studied them said. PredictIt markets go beyond topics related to U.S. elections. Users also put the probability of a North Korea hydrogen bomb test this year at only 29 cents, and a British exit from the European Union by 2017 at just 30 cents. The idea for PredictIt was first thought up in the mid-1990s by Lew Evans, professor of economics at the University of Victoria. It took until 2008, for the market, called iPredict in New Zealand, to get up and running.  Early on, it focused primarily on New Zealand politics, and research showed iPredict out-performed the majority of polls in predicting the results in two of New Zealands last three general elections. However, new anti-money laundering laws in New Zealand put an end to iPredict last year after the cost of verifying users identities to comply with the rules threatened to blow through iPredicts shoe-string budget.  PredictIt attracts everyone from campaign volunteers to political junkies. In mid-April, about 30 PredictIt traders gathered at a bar in New York to watch the states primary results roll in. I think its a good source of collective wisdom, said Brian Hegarty, who was at the event. Hegarty, who worked for Kasichs campaign, reads political news, but also relied on picking up information through his campaign experience. That didnt always translate to a bet in favor of Kasich. He said he put money on Republican candidate Marco Rubio to win the Minnesota caucus because he had overheard someone who was working for the Florida senator express confidence about Rubios chances. It turned out to be one of the few states Rubio won before dropping out in mid-March. Duhaime, the MIT student,said he usually bets against candidates he believes are likely to flame out.  For me, Trump was one of those people, he said. I shorted Trump way back in July, and it hasnt been fun watching.  After Trumps win in Indiana in early May, Duhaime was down nearly $1,000, about a third of the money he put into PredictIt.  I still think it was a one in a hundred thing, Duhaime, who doesnt identify as a Democrat but is a fan of President Barack Obama, said of the Trump phenomenon.

Obama says transgender rule is important aid to schools: BuzzFeed,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Monday that his administrations guidance on transgender issues is needed to help schools grapple with the sensitive topic and ensure that all children are treated fairly. Obama, in an interview with BuzzFeed news website broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube, said schools had been asking the Department of Education how they should handle questions they were facing with transgender youths. We think it was important for schools who want to go ahead and, in a very practical way, try to deal with the school year - What are they going to be doing next year? How should we approach this? - that we give them our best judgment about how to approach it, Obama said. The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. The Education and Justice Departments told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity. Obama, who has two teenaged daughters, elaborated on the decision. Were talking about kids. And anybody whos been in school, been in high school, whos been a parent, I think, should realize that kids who are sometimes in the minority, kids who have a different sexual orientation or are transgender are subject to a lot of bullying, potentially, Obama said. They are vulnerable. And I think that its part of our obligation as a society to make sure that everybody is treated fairly and our kids are all loved and that theyre protected and that their dignity is affirmed, he said.

'The Wire' actor Pierce arrested after scuffle over Democratic politics,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - Actor Wendell Pierce, who starred in HBOs The Wire, was arrested in Atlanta over the weekend and charged with battery after an altercation sparked by differences in opinion about the U.S. presidential race, police said on Monday. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after Pierce, a Hillary Clinton backer, got into a political debate with a couple at the Loews Atlanta Hotel, according to an Atlanta Police Department arrest report. Media reports said the couple supported Clinton rival Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination. The police report said Pierce followed the couple through the hotel and tried to force his way into their room, and also that he pulled the womans hoodie off and hit her in the head. Pierce denied the allegations, police said, and no one needed medical attention. Pierces representatives could not be reached for comment. On Monday, Rutgers University-Newark said Pierce had withdrawn as the speaker for the schools commencement this week, citing the incident. Pierce declined to give the address in order to assure that commencement 2016 will be a celebration of the accomplishments of our students, free from distractions, the school said in a statement, adding that journalist Soledad OBrien would replace him as speaker. In addition to his role as Baltimore police detective Bunk Moreland on HBOs critically acclaimed The Wire, Pierce, 52, is also known for roles on television shows including Treme and The Odd Couple as well as the film Selma.  He was arrested early on Saturday and released after posting a $1,000 bond, according to police and jail records. Media reports said Pierce, whose residence was listed as Pasadena, California, was staying at the Atlanta hotel while shooting a film.  ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 ",1

Philadelphia congressman orchestrated series of frauds: prosecutor,"(Reuters) - Representative Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania and several associates orchestrated a series of fraudulent schemes to enrich the congressman and preserve his political career, federal prosecutors said at the start of his corruption trial on Monday. The congressman stole from federal agencies, from taxpayers, from nonprofit educational groups he created, Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Gray told a Philadelphia jury. He even stole from his own political campaigns. But defense lawyers said the governments case relied almost entirely on the word of two convicted felons who received favorable plea deals. Congressman Fattah had nothing to do with any of it, said Mark Lee, a lawyer for Fattah. The 59-year-old Fattah, an 11-term congressman who represents parts of Philadelphia, lost the Democratic primary in April under the cloud of a wide-ranging indictment charging him with racketeering, bribery and fraud. Some of the alleged schemes stemmed from Fattahs unsuccessful 2007 mayoral campaign, when prosecutors say he accepted a secret and illegal $1 million loan from Al Lord, former chief executive officer of student loan servicer SLM Corp, known as Sallie Mae. Following the race, Fattah convinced Karen Nicholas, who ran his nonprofit educational organization, to transfer charitable and federal grant money to pay Lord back, Gray said. Separately, Fattah owed consultant Thomas Lindenfeld more than $100,000. With no funds to repay him, Fattah encouraged Lindenfeld to apply for federal money for a nonprofit that didnt exist, prosecutors said. In a third scheme, Fattah funneled campaign money through another consultant, Gregory Naylor, to pay off his sons student debt, prosecutors said. The son, Chaka Fattah Jr., was convicted in an unrelated fraud case and sentenced earlier this year to five years in prison. Both Lindenfeld and Naylor have pleaded guilty in exchange for testifying against Fattah. Prosecutors also said Fattah accepted bribes from a close friend, retired businessman Herb Vederman, who was seeking a U.S. ambassadorship. Fattah personally appealed to President Barack Obama to appoint Vederman to an international post. Congressman Fattah used Herb Vederman as a human ATM machine whenever he needed a little money, Gray said. But lawyers for Fattah and Vederman said prosecutors had cherry-picked evidence to suggest a bribery scheme when the two men simply acted out of friendship. Nicholas, Vederman and two other Fattah associates, consultant Robert Brand and campaign treasurer Bonnie Bowser, are co-defendants in the trial, which is expected to last eight weeks.

Trump says unlikely to have good relationship with UK's Cameron,"LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trump said he was unlikely to have a good relationship with David Cameron because the British prime minister cast the U.S. presidential candidate as divisive, stupid and wrong for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Cameron criticised Trump in the British parliament over his call for the ban on Muslims and suggested that the New York billionaire, who is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would unite Britain against him if he visited. It looks like were not going to have a very good relationship, who knows? Trump told Britains ITV television station in an interview aired on Monday when asked how ties would fare if he won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Well number one, Im not stupid, okay. I can tell you that right now. Just the opposite. Number Two, in terms of divisive: I dont think Im a divisive person. Im a unifier, unlike our president right now, Trump said, referring to Barack Obama. Camerons spokesman said the prime minister stood by his original comments. The United States is Britains closest ally. U.S. companies are the biggest foreign direct investors in Britain and the so- called special relationship with Washington has been the cornerstone of British diplomacy since World War Two. Trumps often controversial comments on everything from Muslims and women to the future of NATO and relations with Russia have drawn criticism from Berlin, Paris and other European capitals. But neither Germanys Angela Merkel nor Frances Francois Hollande have gone as far as Cameron in chiding Trump who, if he wins in November, would be in charge of the worlds most powerful nation and largest economy from January 20 next year. Cameron will work with whoever is elected U.S. president and is committed to maintaining the special relationship, the prime ministers spokesman said. The PM has made his views on Donald Trumps comments very clear. He disagrees with them, the spokesman said. He continues to believe that preventing Muslims from entering the U.S. is divisive, stupid and wrong. He stands by his comments. The spokesman refused to answer questions on who Cameron would like to see win in November but said there was no telephone call or meeting planned with Trump, adding: If one is proposed we will consider it. On a more conciliatory note, Cameron has said Trump deserves respect for making it through the gruelling Republican primary process. The Times newspaper also reported last month Cameron had ordered diplomats to attempt to repair relations with Trump. I hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like hes not willing to address the problem either, Trump told ITV. Trump also criticised Londons newly elected Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan for making very rude statements. Trump had initially welcomed Khans election and said he would make an exception in the event of a ban on Muslims for him entering the United States, drawing a sharp reply from Khan. Donald Trumps ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe - it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of the extremists, Khan said. Responding to this criticism in the ITV interview, Trump said: He doesnt know me, never met me, doesnt know what I am all about. I think they are very rude statements. Frankly, tell him I will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements. It is ignorant for him to say that. ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 ",1
Democrats use Trump as bogeyman to get people to vote,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic Party activists in some U.S. states are using Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who has stirred controversy with his comments about illegal immigrants and women, as the centerpiece of their get out the vote campaign for the November elections. In California, canvassers from the Orange County Democrats carry pictures of Trump when they knock on doors ahead of the June 7 California primary. They ask if people will vote in the primary, and warn that if they dont help pick the strongest possible Democrat, this guy will win, said Henry Vandermeir, the local party chairman in Orange County, a traditionally Republican island in the state.  Democrats in New Hampshire have unveiled Trump/Sununu lawn signs, looking to tie Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on issues such as climate change (Trump is a skeptic) and healthcare. One sign reads: Trump/Sununu. Because Health Care Is For Losers, a swipe at Trumps vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. Every state party is trying to maximize what they can get out of this difference (between candidates) and to tie Trump to the Republicans in the state, said Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party.  The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. To be sure, Republicans appear likely to use Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination who is also a polarizing figure, in a similar fashion.  There is no better volunteer recruitment tool, fundraising pitch, or unifier for the Republican Party than the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency that will surely take us further backwards, the Republican National Committee said in a statement. Democrats are also looking to tie Trump to Republican Senate candidates on the Nov. 8 ballot as they seek to regain control of the chamber they lost in the 2014 congressional elections. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last week released so-called Trump cards online, equating several Republican senators policy positions with those of the New York developer.     For Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey and New Hampshires Kelly Ayotte, for example, the DSCC highlighted how they and Trump oppose a federal minimum wage hike.  The DSCC also launched a website in March, partyoftrump.com, which labeled some senators Retrumplicans and asked for donations to help fight senators who support Trump. Recent polls suggest that a Trump/Clinton matchup could be a tight race. The two candidates were in a dead heat in the three key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania in a Quinnipiac University poll earlier in May. And a Reuters poll this month showed that much of the backing for Clinton and Trump comes from people whose primary motivation is to stop the other side from winning, rather than any love for either of the two candidates or their policies.     The strategy of highlighting opposing candidates is not without risks, according to Bruce Newman, the author of The Marketing Revolution in Politics: What Recent U.S. Presidential Campaigns Can Teach Us About Effective Marketing. If Trump - who shocked pundits by beating 16 other Republican hopefuls for the nomination - proves more attractive to the general electorate than Hillary Clinton, then tying him to other Republicans could hurt Democrats We dont know how popular this guy is going to get, Newman said. This is just the beginning. (This version of the story has been refiled to add dropped to in final paragraph) ",politicsNews,"May 16, 2016 ",1

Trump aide dismisses audio tape as Democrats raise character issue,"WASHINGTON, 2016 - A top aide to Donald Trump said on Sunday he did not believe the Republican presidential front-runner posed as his own spokesman to brag about his personal life, a controversy that came as Democrats sharpen their attacks on the billionaires character.  The Washington Post released an audio recording on Friday of a man who identified himself as Trump publicist John Miller and talked about the real estate tycoons romantic encounters in a 1991 conversation with a People magazine reporter. After listening to the tape while appearing on CNNs State of the Union show, senior Trump adviser Paul Manafort said he did not believe it was the Republican candidates voice despite his past admissions of sometimes using a pseudonym.  I could barely understand it, Manafort said. I couldnt tell who it is. Donald Trump says its not him, I believe its not him. Trump told NBCs Today show on Friday that the voice was not his, although he has admitted in years past to using at least one pseudonym to speak to reporters.  The original People article, which ran in 1991, winkingly described Miller as a mysterious PR man who sounds just like Donald. Within a few days of that article, Sue Carswell, the People reporter who originally made the recording, reported that Trump had admitted that he posed as Miller as a joke and had apologized for it. Trump earlier this month effectively locked up the Republican nomination to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election and has been working to try to unify his party after many of its leaders opposed his candidacy. Leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons allies have described Trump as deceptive and honed in on his treatment of women. Clinton has begun attacking Trump more aggressively since he effectively secured the nomination, deriding his character and recently suggesting he is hiding something by not releasing his tax returns. Trump has reacted angrily to criticism he sometimes reduces women to their appearances, and in turn has criticized Clinton for how she and her husband, Bill Clinton, treated women who accused the former president of sexual indiscretions. Bill Clinton has admitted to having extra-marital affairs with two women: Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and Gennifer Flowers, a singer and actor from Arkansas.   On Sunday, Trump used his Twitter account to deride a New York Times article in which several women said he had unnerved them over the years with comments about their looks and unwelcome advances. The article also said he had a good track record of promoting women to senior positions, which was rare in the real estate industry. Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women, went one message posted on Trumps account on Sunday. Democratic President Barack Obama used a commencement speech at a university on Sunday to criticize Trumps positions, including a proposal to temporarily ban non-American Muslims from entering the United States. Isolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country, that is not just a betrayal of our values, that is not who Americans are, he told the students at Rutgers University in New Jersey.  Although it was widely reported in the early 1990s that Trump sometimes posed as a fake spokesman in order to shape media coverage, the recording of what is said to be such an occurrence only emerged a few days ago. It quickly rippled through American media. The comedy television program Saturday Night Live showed a skit with an actor posing as Trump calling reporters pretending to be his own spokesman, named John Pepperoni. Trumps willingness to pose as a fake spokesman first emerged in 1990, when he testified during a lawsuit that he had used the pseudonym John Baron, sometimes rendered in news reports as John Barron, when speaking to journalists by telephone. Lots of people use pen names, Newsday quoted Trump as saying after his testimony. Ernest Hemingway used one.  ",politicsNews,"May 15, 2016 ",1
"Trump, Biden attend same Pennsylvania college graduation","(Reuters) - Presidential politics crept into the graduation ceremony at the University of Pennsylvania on Sunday, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Joe Biden in attendance to cheer on family members. The two men sat relatively near each other at the event in Philadelphia, where the Trump family gathered to watch the real estate tycoons daughter, Tiffany, graduate from the Ivy League school. Biden came to support granddaughter Naomi. Tiffany Trump, 22, is the daughter of Trump and his ex-wife Marla Maples. Naomi Biden is named after the vice presidents one-year-old daughter, who died in a 1972 car accident along with the girls mother, Bidens first wife. Donald Trump, who earlier this month effectively secured the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, also attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from its Wharton business school. Biden, who is not running in the 2016 election, has been a bitter critic of Trumps policies and campaign tactics, calling the Republican front-runners remark that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals across the border a sick message.

During a visit to London last month President Barack Obama told Britons that if they elected to leave the EU in a June 23 referendum they would be at the back of the queue for a U.S. trade deal.

Facebook's Zuckerberg to meet conservatives on political bias flap,"(Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg will meet this week with prominent conservatives in the media, a spokesman said on Sunday, to address allegations of political bias at the popular social networking site. Some 12 conservative thought leaders will join the meeting with Zuckerberg on Wednesday, a Facebook spokesman said. Among the invitees are media personality Glenn Beck, Fox News Channels The Five co-host Dana Perino and Zac Moffatt, co-founder of Targeted Victory, a technology company that aims to bring transparency to media buying. Facebook came under fire last week when an unnamed former employee told technology news website Gizmodo that workers often omitted conservative political stories from the companys trending list of topics. Zuckerberg said Facebook has found no evidence that this report is true, but would continue to investigate. A U.S. Senate committee has also opened an inquiry into Facebooks practices. Beck, a former Fox News host, took to Facebook early Sunday to say he is going to the meeting in Menlo Park, California, and  it would be interesting to look him (Zuckerberg) in the eye as he explains. While they are a private business and I support their right to run it any way they desire without government interference, Beck said, it would be wonderful if a tool like face book [sic] INDEPENDENTLY CHOSE to hold up Freedom of speech and freedom of association as a corporate principle. On Friday, Facebook outlined its Trending Topics guidelines in its media relations section and stated that reviewers are neither allowed nor advised to discriminate against sources.  Facebook, now valued at around $350 billion, has become a bigger source of news for its more than 1 billion daily active users. Sixty-three percent of users, or 41 percent of all U.S. adults, say they get news from the site, according to a study last year by the Pew Research Center and the Knight Foundation.

Trump has a history of questionable behavior with women: NY Times,"(Reuters) - Interviews with dozens of women who have worked for Donald Trump or interacted with him socially reveal a pattern of often unsettling personal behavior by the Republican presidential candidate, The New York Times reported on Saturday.  The Times, which said it based the article on more than 50 interviews, quoted women who recounted episodes in which he treated women as sexual objects and made comments about their bodies. But some women said Trump had encouraged them in their careers and promoted them within his businesses, often in positions in which women tended to be excluded. When asked about the unflattering incidents described in the article, Trump either denied that they took place or disputed the details, the newspaper said. A lot of things get made up over the years, Trump told the Times. I have always treated women with great respect. A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Barbara Res, who oversaw construction of Trumps Manhattan business headquarters, said he would sometimes interrupt meetings with comments about womens figures.  During a job interview for a Los Angeles project, for example, Trump made a random aside about Southern California women. They take care of their asses, Res recalled Trump saying. Years later, when Res says she had gained weight, she said Trump told her: You like your candy. Even so, Res, who worked for Trump for 12 years before quitting and then came back as a consultant for six more, said she was grateful to Trump for her professional opportunities, though she said he frequently called her Honey Bunch, the Times reported.   Trump also earned a reputation for being seen with beautiful women dating back to his days at a New York military-style boarding school where he was named ladies man in the yearbook, the Times reported.   Barbara Fife, a deputy New York mayor in the 1990s, recalls Trump telling her at her City Hall office that he was in a hurry because he had a great date tonight with a model for Victorias Secret, she told the Times. I saw it as immature, quite honestly, Fife was quoted as saying. As a candidate, Trump has made frequent references to his record in business as evidence of how American women would benefit if he is elected. He has often said that no one cherishes or respects women more than him.  Some of those interviewed praised Trump for giving women positions of power. I think there are mischaracterizations about him, Jill Martin, assistant counsel at the Trump Organization, told the Times. For me, hes made it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time necessary for my family. The story comes less than two weeks after the last of Trumps Republican rivals dropped out, all but assuring him the partys presidential nomination this summer.  Throughout his improbable campaign, Trump has managed to deflect criticism about his attitude to women, fueled by verbal insults he lobbed at Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina.

Obama toasts Nordic nations after Russia-focused summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama toasted Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland at a star-studded state dinner on Friday, lauding the nations for their global influence on civil rights, humanitarian issues and curbing climate change. The red carpet glamor followed a White House summit where Obama and the leaders of the five nations presented a united front against Moscows recent military aggression in Ukraine and the Baltic region. But the meeting was more about soft diplomacy than launching ambitious foreign policy endeavors, given that Obamas second and final term ends in January. Americans will vote in presidential elections on Nov. 8. I thought this was a very useful and important conversation, although there was probably too much agreement to make for as exciting a multilateral meeting as I sometimes participate in, Obama said. More than 300 guests including rapper Common, comedian Will Farrell and actress Tracee Ellis Ross mingled with diplomats, tech and Fortune 500 CEOs, White House officials, and political donors in a glass-ceiling tent built around a tree on the South Lawn. Hand-rolled beeswax candles and strings of lights reflected off ten-foot pillars of ice, an homage to the northern lights. Pop star Demi Lovato, known for her support of liberal causes, was set to perform after a Nordic-inspired meal of ahi tuna, tomato tartare and red wine-braised beef short ribs. Its a great opportunity to drink wine and make progress on the most serious issues of our time, Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters on her way into the dinner. The summit was aimed in part at sending a message to a nation not on the guest list: Russia, which annexed Ukraines Crimea region in 2014 and has stepped up its military posture. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is planning its biggest build-up in eastern Europe since the Cold War to try to deter further Russian aggression, and Denmark and Norway said on Friday they would contribute to the enhanced allied forward presence with NATO. We will be maintaining ongoing dialogue and seek cooperation with Russia, but we also want to make sure that we are prepared and strong, and we want to encourage Russia to keep its military activities in full compliance with international obligations, Obama said after the summit. Obama has long expressed admiration for the pragmatic and liberal-leaning politics of the Nordic nations. There have been times where Ive said, why dont we just put all these small countries in charge for a while? And they could clean things up, Obama said.

U.S. tells schools to give transgender students bathroom rights,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority.  Conservatives pushed back against the administrations non-binding guidance to schools, the latest battleground in the issue of rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the guidance must be challenged. If President Obama thinks he can bully Texas schools into allowing men to have open access to girls in bathrooms, he better prepare for yet another legal fight,  Paxton, a Tea Party champion, said in a statement. Other Republican-led states joined calls to disregard the White Houses directive and accused the administration of overstepping its role. In North Carolina, Governor Pat McCrory labeled the move a massive executive branch overreach and called on federal courts and the U.S. Congress to intercede, while Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said it was offensive, intrusive and totally lacking in common sense. The U.S. Education and Justice Departments, in a letter, told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity. The guidance contained an implicit threat that school districts defying the Obama administrations interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or be deprived of federal aid. The White House defended its actions, saying the guidance should not be viewed as a threat but instead as a set of specific, tangible, real-world advice and suggestions that many schools had sought and will welcome. Thats what were looking for: solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every single student in school, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing, adding that the idea was to prevent discrimination against a range of groups extending beyond the transgender community.    The directive came as the Justice Department and North Carolina are battling in federal court over a North Carolina state law approved in March that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their gender assigned at birth, while other states weigh similar measures. North Carolinas law was the first to ban people from restrooms in public buildings and schools not matching the sex on their birth certificate. Mississippi has enacted legislation similarly viewed as discriminatory by civil and gay rights groups, and Tennessee and Missouri considered similar measures. The letter to the schools from Washington said that, to get federal funding under existing rules, a school has to agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. That includes not treating a transgender student differently from other students of the same gender identity, officials said. The American Civil Liberties Union said the guidance would help make students free to bring their whole selves to school. In a sign of what defiant states may face, the Justice Department this week asked a U.S. District Court in North Carolina to declare the state in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. Americans are divided over which public restrooms should be used by transgender people, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify. A group representing U.S. school boards called the guidance unsettled law. A dispute about the intent of the federal law must ultimately be resolved by the courts and the Congress, the National School Boards Association said in a statement.  Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was less critical than many of his party in several television interviews, saying the issue should be left up to individual states.  Everybody has to be protected ... but its a tiny, tiny portion of the population, Trump told Fox News. ",politicsNews,"May 13, 2016 ",1
"Trump taps climate change skeptic as energy adviser, pushes back on taxes","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Friday picked a prominent climate change skeptic to help him craft his energy policy and pushed back against renewed calls that he release his income tax returns - saying his tax rate is none of your business. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is seeking to build out his policy proposals as he pivots from campaigning for his partys nomination to a likely general election matchup with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Among those he has asked for help is U.S. Republican Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the countrys most ardent oil and gas drilling advocates and climate change skeptics. North Dakota has been at the forefront of the U.S. shale oil and gas boom.  Trumps team asked Cramer, who has endorsed Trump, to write a white paper, or detailed report, on his energy policy ideas, according to Cramer and sources familiar with the matter. Cramer said in an interview that his white paper would emphasize the dangers of foreign ownership of U.S. energy assets, as well as what he characterized as burdensome taxes and over-regulation. Trump will have an opportunity to float some of the ideas at an energy summit in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, Cramer said.     The senator was also among a group of Trump advisers who recently met with lawmakers from Western energy states, who hope Trump will open more federal land for drilling, a lawmaker who took part in the meeting said. A spokeswoman for Trumps campaign did not comment. Environmental groups, and Clintons campaign, quickly attacked Trump for tapping Cramer. Kevin Cramer has consistently backed reckless and dangerous schemes to put the profits of fossil fuel executives before the health of the public, so he and Trump are a match made in polluter heaven, Sierra Club Legislative Director Melinda Pierce said in an emailed statement. The Clinton campaign also criticized the move.     Donald Trumps choice of outspoken climate (change) denier Kevin Cramer to advise him on energy policy is just the latest piece of evidence that letting him get near the White House would put our childrens health and futures at risk, said campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson. Trump has been light on the details of his energy policy, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were president. He has also claimed global warming is a concept created by and for the Chinese to hurt U.S. business. Clinton, meanwhile, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies out of business. Trump also took heat on Friday for not releasing his tax returns, something that American presidential candidates have done for decades. Clinton and her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have both released their returns. Trump has said the Internal Revenue Service was auditing his returns and he wanted to wait until the review was over before making them public. It should be, and I hope its before the election, Trump told ABCs Good Morning America. Pressed on what tax rate he pays, Trump refused to say. Its none of your business, he said. The candidate has said there is nothing voters can learn from his tax filings.  Tax filings show sources of income, both from within the United States and other countries, as well as charitable giving, investments, deductions and other financial information. The IRS declined to comment on whether Trump or any other presidential candidates were being audited. However, the Trump campaign earlier this year released a letter from his attorneys saying his personal tax returns have been under continuous examination from the IRS. This week, Clinton began calling on her probable Republican rival to release his returns. Last August, the former U.S. secretary of state posted the past eight years of tax returns for her and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, on her website. Sanders released his 2014 return in April.  Presidential candidates have a long history in the modern era of releasing their tax returns. In 1976, Gerald Ford did not release his returns, but he did release some information about his taxes, said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that provides tax news and analysis. That was the last time that a major party nominee hasnt done it, he said.  (Refiling to change dateline, previous WASHINGTON.)     ",politicsNews,"May 13, 2016 ",1
First $200 admission for a Trump rally; more to come?,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The email Donald Trumps campaign sent inviting fans to a rally next week looked familiar: Meet me in New Jersey! it urged. But something was different. You will need to buy a ticket to get into the rally, it added. The cost: $200. During the months-long battle for the Republican presidential nomination, rallies staged by Trump, the partys likely candidate in the Nov. 8 election, were free and open to anyone with the stamina to withstand half a days wait outside and a heady hour packed into a sports stadium or warehouse. Supporters could buy snacks or hats or T-shirts while they waited, but they never had to pay for admission. The May 19 rally advertised in the email is a fundraiser for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival now working for Trump who, according to news reports, needs to retire debt from his own failed campaign. The emailed invitation to supporters said it will be a fundraiser. It was not clear whether Trump will charge for rallies that are not specifically designated as fundraisers.  The New York billionaire has claimed he was self-funding his campaign and did not need donations. He has financed his offensive in the nominating phase of the race for the White House with loans to himself as well as around $12 million in unsolicited donations from fans. Now that Trump is pivoting toward the general election, where conventional estimates put the cost of winning at around $1 billion, things are changing.  The move to charge admission for some appearances was just one harbinger of a new relationship between Trump and his fans, many of whom cited their perception of his financial independence as a major factor behind their support. It will test the loyalty of those who have swelled his rallies to capacity, either transforming huge crowds into cash cows or creating more breathing room in the places where he appears.      When asked whether the format of the Christie fundraiser rally would be repeated in the future, Trumps spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not comment. This is a fundraiser for Governor Christie, she said. Supporters have said Trumps about-face on fundraising does not bother them. Susan Kihne, a Mandan, North Dakota resident who snagged a ticket to see Trump speak at a petroleum conference later this month decided the $30 it cost her was worth it. Hes self-funded up until now, so I dont mind supporting him, she said. ",politicsNews,"May 13, 2016 ",1
Puerto Rico debt bill due in 'coming days': House Speaker Ryan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Friday an updated bill dealing with Puerto Ricos debt will be introduced in the coming days.

U.S. guidance on school restroom choice opposed by some states,"(Reuters) - Transgender students cheered the Obama administrations directive on Friday requiring U.S. public schools to allow them to use toilets and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity while some school districts said they would not comply. This is the strongest guidance to date from the federal government to schools instructing them on how they must treat transgender students fairly and without discrimination, said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in California.  This will be something that courts will have to give great weight to. The letter, signed by officials from the U.S. Education and Justice Departments, intensified the debate over balancing equal rights with privacy concerns.  The Obama administration told U.S. public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. Transgender student Gavin Grimm, who won a U.S. appeals court ruling in April in his fight over bathroom access at his Virginia high school, said he was happy with the support from the Obama administration. This guidance would have made a big difference in my life, he wrote on Twitter.   Educators are facing scrutiny and legal action over access to toilets and locker rooms based on gender identity versus a students sex at birth. The federal governments position is that U.S. laws against sex discrimination in educational programs include gender identity. Fridays directive was the broadest attempt to enforce that stance on a national basis.  But North Carolinas Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest said in a statement that the state would not stand by and let our locker rooms and high school showers be used for social experimentation at the expense of the privacy and protection of our young boys and girls.  Forest advised schools to reject the policy and said a state law enacted in March restricting bathroom choice for transgender people trumped the administrations non-binding directive. North Carolina is locked in a high-profile legal battle with the federal government over its bathroom bill. On Monday, Republican leaders of the states legislature said they had sued the U.S. Justice Department over the states law restricting public bathroom access for transgender people. That lawsuit came hours after North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory sued the Justice Department, accusing it of overreaching after federal lawyers said the states law requiring public bathroom use based on birth gender was a civil rights violation.    In Florida, Marion County Public Schools showed no sign of backing down from a resolution passed in April requiring students to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. I dont believe our board will reverse the decision unless it is instructed by the courts, the school systems spokesman Kevin Christian said in a telephone interview. Mississippis Department of Education said it would comply with the federal guidance. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order in March allowing a person of any gender to choose whether to use a mens or womens toilet or locker room in all municipal properties including public parks, pools, and playgrounds. The order requires city agencies to post the policy in conspicuous locations within three months and to train all employees within two years. New York Citys action came a week after South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard vetoed a bill that would have made the state the first to limit transgender students to bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their birth gender. In November, Houston voters overwhelmingly rejected a measure known as the bathroom ordinance that would have established non-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. Nationwide, 22 percent of transgender and gender non-conforming people report being denied access to appropriate bathrooms at work, and 26 percent report being denied access to bathrooms in an educational setting, according to a survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

Exclusive: U.S. to renew most Myanmar sanctions with changes to aid business,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to renew the bulk of its sanctions against Myanmar when they expire next week, but will make some  changes aimed at boosting investment and trade, according to several senior U.S. officials and congressional aides. An announcement on extending much of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, could come as soon as Tuesday ahead of a visit to the Southeast Asian nation by Secretary of State John Kerry on May 22, officials said. The U.S. Treasury Department has significantly eased sanctions against Myanmar by issuing general licenses that give companies and investors exemptions to sanctions targeting more than 100 individuals and businesses, including some of Myanmars biggest business players. U.S. officials began lifting trade and financial sanctions against the country after military leaders launched reforms that led to a civilian government being formed in 2011, beginning its transformation from a half-century as an international pariah. In December, Treasury temporarily relaxed trade restrictions on the country also known as Burma by allowing all shipments to go through its ports and airports for six months. This time, Washington will likely offer more general licenses to specific companies, and take some people off Treasurys list of Specially Designated Individuals targeted for sanctions, congressional aides and U.S. officials said. Kerrys visit to Myanmar is his first since the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, the countrys Nobel laureate, swept to power following a landslide election win in November. A constitution drafted by the countrys former military rulers bars her from becoming president. President Barack Obamas opening to Myanmar followed by its peaceful transition to an elected government is seen as one of his foreign policy achievements. He has visited there twice. But the administration also wants to maintain leverage on the country to guard against backsliding on reforms and to press for improvement on human rights. By renewing the legal framework for sanctions even as it eases some measures, Obama will offer the private sector more breathing room while maintaining pressure on its military, which still holds significant political power. The sanctions had been due to expire on May 20. Washington has deep concerns about human rights conditions in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, especially violence against ethnic and religious minorities including Rohingya Muslims. Members of the U.S. Congress, from both parties, are watching closely and could move to clamp down on Myanmar themselves if they think Obama is moving too quickly. Last month, Senators Cory Gardner and Ben Cardin, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Foreign Relations Asia subcommittee, wrote to Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew expressing concern about rights, and asking the administration to work with Congress to ensure those concerns were addressed.  Like you, we want to ensure that the U.S. is Burmas strongest supporter on its road to democracy, the senators said in the letter, seen by Reuters. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aung San Suu Kyi supported the extension of U.S. sanctions with some changes. Discussions with her have focused on how to properly target trade restrictions so they do not hurt Myanmars overall economy, but keep pressure on military-owned institutions, they said. We are looking to take steps to demonstrate our support for the new democratically elected government of Burma ...and that were taking the necessary steps to ensure that they succeed, that they can carry on economic developments and reforms, a senior administration official told Reuters. At the same time we want to do that in a smart, measured way that gives us a range of options and flexibility to respond appropriately going forward, the official added. The United States is eager to expand relations with Myanmar to help counteract Chinas rise in Asia and take advantage of the opening of one of the worlds last frontier markets, growing but less developed emerging economies. Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions adviser at the U.S. Treasury, said despite an easing of some banking sanctions by the United States since 2012, transactions with Myanmar were still difficult. I suspect the changes that get announced all drive at the same end goal: which is to promote and make easier the trade and business relationships between the two countries and encourage continued reform while minding concerns, said Kucik. The details will really indicate where the principal areas of remaining concern are but broadly speaking they are going to be aligned with what weve seen so far, he said.

RNC's Priebus takes dim view of anti-Trump third party talk,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the Republican National Committee sought on Friday to tamp down talk among some Republicans about the possibility of running a third-party candidate who would give party supporters a choice beyond Donald Trump. In an interview, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said a third-party candidate would have no hope of actually winning the Nov. 8 presidential election but would instead ensure victory for the Democratic nominee. They may as well jump off the top floor of a building because thats what wed be doing by having a third party, Priebus said. Priebus has been a vocal advocate for party loyalists to get over their concerns about Trump and support him since he is on track to become the presidential nominee and stands as the only real option for Republicans to win the White House. He brought Trump together with House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan for a meeting in Washington on Thursday to try to ease Ryans concerns about backing the billionaire.  Ryan stopped short of endorsing Trump but said the session was productive. Priebus said the two men have opened a dialogue. My guess is they may even be talking today and through the weekend (on the phone), he said. Priebus said a Democratic victory would allow Democrats to reshape the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. If Republican donors sit on the sidelines, Democrats could also take over control of the U.S. Senate, he said. If you dont participate in the presidential election you might as well kiss away the Senate as well, Priebus said in a message directed at Republican donors unenthusiastic about Trump. The Senate goes as the presidential race goes. Theyre inextricably intertwined. Some Republicans continue to hold out hope that a leading figure in the party could be persuaded to run for president as a third-party candidate to give party voters uncomfortable with Trump a candidate to rally around. Some speculation has centered around 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who has been a frequent critic of Trump. Just this week Romney said Trump should release his tax records, a public disclosure move that Romney made in 2012 but which Trump has been resisting. Some Republicans have been urging Romney to launch an independent bid for the presidency. He discussed the issue last week with William Kristol, editor of the conservative-leaning Weekly Standard magazine, a source close to Romney said. ",politicsNews,"May 13, 2016 ",1
"Trump taps climate change skeptic, fracking advocate as key energy advisor","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has asked one of Americas most ardent drilling advocates and climate change skeptics to help him draft his energy policy. U.S. Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota - a major oil drilling state - is writing a white paper on energy policy for the New York billionaire, Cramer and sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cramer was also among a group of Trump advisers who recently met with lawmakers from western energy states, who hope Trump will open more federal land for drilling, a lawmaker who took part in the meeting said. Cramer said in an interview his paper would emphasize the dangers of foreign ownership of U.S. energy assets, burdensome taxes, and over-regulation.Trump will have an opportunity to float some of the ideas at an energy summit in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, Cramer said. A spokeswoman for Trumps campaign did not comment. While the ultimate size and makeup of Trumps energy advisory team is unclear, Cramers inclusion suggests the presumptive Republican presidential nominees oil policy could emphasize more drilling, less regulation and taxes, and curbs on efforts to combat climate change. Cramer has said he believes the Earth is cooling, not warming, and he has opposed efforts by the Obama administration to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has been light on details of his energy policy so far, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were in the White House. He has also claimed global warming is a concept created by and for the Chinese to hurt U.S. business. Trump only recently started building up teams of advisors on the economy, foreign policy and other issues to flesh out his platform for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Cramer, North Dakotas only congressman and an early Congressional Trump supporter, encountered Trump when they were guests on a radio show last month and Trump spoke about relaxing regulation and expanding drilling. Trumps political team later asked Cramer to write the energy policy paper, the lawmaker said. The real opportunity for prosperity in this country has been to produce more because you have access to more markets, Cramer said, referring to the recent lifting of a decades-old ban on oil exports. The last thing we need is more rules. On foreign ownership of U.S. oil assets, Cramer said: One-third of refining capacity is owned by OPEC countries. How does this fit into his (Trumps) America first policy?  OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela both have large stakes in U.S. refining capacity. Cramer said he expected energy policy to be a vulnerability for Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, in an election year where energy companies are going broke. Clinton has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies out of business.

Trump's about-face on fund-raising seems unlikely to dent his popularity,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Supporters of billionaire Donald Trump appear unfazed by his decision to accept money from outside donors, despite his earlier vow to self-fund his presidential campaign and his  criticism of rivals as puppets of wealthy special interests. The vow has been a cornerstone of Trumps election strategy to present himself as an outsider who is not in the pocket of rich donors, even though he has accepted more than $12 million in contributions so far. The strategy paid off last week when the New York businessman emerged as the Republican partys presumptive presidential nominee, after sweeping a series of state nominating contests. Since then, Trump has said he would no longer self-finance and would work with the party to raise more than $1 billion to help him fight his eventual Democratic Party challenger. Critics accused him of flip flopping, but some supporters dont agree. Three dozen of the 40 pro-Trump voters Reuters interviewed said they were not concerned about his reversal. Only four indicated the switch made them uneasy, though all of them said they would still support him. Most of those interviewed applauded the way the celebrity businessman billed himself as a blue-collar billionaire who didnt need other peoples money, but said they understood Trump would need far more resources to compete in the general election. They would have no problem donating to the billionaire, albeit in the same kind of small increments that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has used to build his nearly $200 million fundraising juggernaut.  Even though Im on welfare, I would donate to Trump, said Pamela Thompson, a 46-year-old mother of three school-age kids from Tulsa, Oklahoma. And my kids would run a lemonade stand to help elect him. The supporters interviewed said Trumps pledge to self-finance his campaign was less important to them than his promises to crack down on undocumented workers and ease the pain of mostly white, blue collar towns that have seen manufacturing jobs lost to developing countries. Sharon Jones, a 53-year old Wal-Mart cashier from Coleman County, Alabama, says her anger over undocumented immigrants shopping at her store on welfare benefits is animating her support for Trump, who has promised to deport undocumented workers and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. They are doing better than I am on my $9.45 an hour, Jones said. The majority of supporters interviewed said they thought Trumps decision to fundraise was strategically wise given that Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has raised more than $250 million so far.  In the 2012 election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney and his Democratic opponent, President Barack Obama, each raised $1 billion. You gotta fight fire with fire. Bring it on, said Cheryl Ressler Halvorson, a cattle rancher from Williston, North Dakota  whose support for Trump stems mainly from her ire over having to pay $1,100 a month for health insurance with a $13,000 deductible due to the government mandate known as Obamacare. Halvorson is not an outlier. Most Trump supporters have stayed loyal despite the candidate frequently reversing or updating policy positions on key economic and social issues. Trump is not the first U.S. presidential candidate to change his mind about financing his election campaign. In the 2008 election, Obama also did an about-face. He said he would forego public financing of his general election campaign against Republican John McCain. This was a reversal of his earlier stance and it allowed him to pursue a record fund-raising effort. Supporters were unfazed by the shift and Obama went on to win the election.

U.S. probes Trump's former butler for urging Obama assassination,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service is investigating presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps former butler over a Facebook post calling for President Barack Obamas assassination. The former butler, Anthony Senecal, 74, said in a Facebook post Obama should be hanged for treason. He made the statement in 2015, and the magazine Mother Jones wrote on Thursday about the post and other similar remarks by Senecal. Senecal worked for decades as a butler at Trumps Palm Beach mansion, Mar-a-Lago. After reports of Senecals comments began to circulate, the Secret Service said in a statement, The U.S. Secret Service is aware of this matter and will conduct the appropriate investigation. The story broke as Trump, whose proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States and build a wall along the Mexican border have drawn heavy criticism, concluded a charm offensive on Capitol Hill. He attended a series of meetings there on Thursday with Republican lawmakers to try to win the party establishments support for his candidacy. Senecal has not served as a butler to the billionaire candidate since 2009, but he was identified in a March 15 profile in the New York Times as a current employee of Mar-a-Lago, serving as the estates historian. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said in a statement, Senecal has not worked at Mar-a-Lago for years, but nevertheless we totally and completely disavow the horrible statements made by him regarding the president. She declined to comment on the Times report about Senecals recent role. Senecal did not respond to a call seeking comment and could not be reached by email.  It is time for our Military to drag that fraud out of the white mosque and hang his ass for treason and other high crimes against AMERICA !!!!!!! Senecal wrote on Sept. 13, 2015, in reference to Obama. Mother Jones reached Senecal on Thursday. The magazine reported that Senecal said of his Facebook comments, including a private comment on Wednesday in which he said Obama should be shot: I wrote that. I believe that.

Trump on best behavior as he woos Republicans but differences remain,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump went on a charm offensive on Thursday to try to win the party establishments support for his insurgent candidacy, but top Republican Paul Ryan stopped short of endorsing him. Trump was on his best behavior on a day of meetings with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He listened patiently as they raised concerns about his tone and the need to try to appeal to Hispanic voters. He avoided strident language, like the frequent criticism he has lobbed from the campaign trail that many lawmakers are awestruck by the corridors of power and forget why they were sent to Washington. The whole discussion was very solid, reasonable and a warm and winning discussion, said Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. I think youre going to find hes going to be better and better all the time.  The U.S. budget deficit and debt were among the issues Trump and Ryan discussed, sources familiar with the meeting said. Trumps day in Washington was aimed at laying to rest some of the concerns that persist among Republicans about his incendiary tone and some policy proposals at odds with party doctrine. The New York billionaire, who needs the party behind him to bolster his chances at winning the Nov. 8 election, has vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, deport 11 million illegal immigrants, temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and impose trade protectionist policies. Trump held an hour-long session with Ryan, who as speaker of the House of Representatives is the top U.S. elected Republican and can hold sway with many establishment Republicans leery of Trump. This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification, Ryan and Trump said in a joint statement. Trump told Fox News in an interview that he had a very, very good meeting with Ryan. I think Paul felt the same way and everybody else did also, Trump said. Trump said he and Ryan largely agree on issues of border security, trade and beefing up the U.S. military.  Party leaders are normally eager to rally around a presidential nominee to combine forces for the battle leading up to the general election. But Ryan has withheld his endorsement of Trump out of concern over the businessmans conservative credentials. In remarks to reporters after the meeting, the congressman said he was encouraged by the session but that more work will be needed. Theres no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences. We talked about those differences today, Ryan said at his weekly news conference. I do believe we are planting the seeds in getting ourselves unified. Ryan, who may harbor aspirations of running for president in 2020 or later, noted that he represents a wing of the conservatives and that it is positive that Trump is bringing new voters into the party. Despite his problems in winning over senior Republicans, Trump received a boost on Wednesday when a Reuters/Ipsos national poll showed him pulling even with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The online survey found 41 percent of likely voters supporting Clinton and 40 percent backing Trump.             Later on Thursday, Trump went into a meeting with Senate     Republican leaders, where he posed for photos with them and heard concerns about his campaign rhetoric but appeared to make some progress in tempering concerns about him. Everyone here wants you to win, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told him at the Senate session, a source said. Senator Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia urged Trump to be careful in his tone. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a former U.S. trade representative, urged caution on his rhetoric against trade deals. The issue of tone did come up, said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who said he gave some advice to Trump on the importance of the Hispanic vote and the whole idea of distinguishing between illegal immigration and legal immigration. In a meeting at a Washington law firm, Trump sat down with James Baker, who served as secretary of state for Republican President George H.W. Bush. Earlier in the day, Baker had testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Under questioning from Senator Marco Rubio, a former Republican presidential candidate, Baker said the world would be far less stable without a strong NATO, a slap at Trumps idea of reconfiguring the Western alliance and getting European nations to foot more of the bill. Secretary Baker had a meeting with Donald Trump that was requested by his campaign, a Baker spokesman said. Even Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina softened a bit. Graham dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year and had said the choice between Trump and rival Ted Cruz was like trying to decide between being shot or poisoned. Graham said he had a cordial, pleasant conversation on the phone with Trump on Wednesday. I know Mr. Trump is reaching out to many people, throughout the party and the country, to solicit their advice and opinions.  I believe this is a wise move on his part, said Graham.

Exclusive: U.S. plans new wave of immigrant deportation raids,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials are planning a month-long series of raids in May and June to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children found to have entered the country illegally, according to sources and an internal document seen by Reuters. The operation would likely be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year after a similar drive over two days in January that focused on Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina. Those raids, which resulted in the detention of 121 people, mostly women and children, sparked an outcry from immigration advocates and criticism from some Democrats, including the partys presidential election frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has now told field offices nationwide to launch a 30-day surge of arrests focused on mothers and children who have already been told to leave the United States, the document seen by Reuters said. The operation would also cover minors who have entered the country without a guardian and since turned 18 years of age, the document said. Two sources confirmed the details of the plan.   The exact dates of the latest series of raids were not known and the details of the operation could change.  The operation in January marked a departure for ICE, part of the Department of Homeland Security, from one-off deportations to high-profile raids meant to deter migrants from coming to the United States.  An ICE spokeswoman said the agency does not confirm or deny the existence of specific ongoing or future law enforcement actions. The spokeswoman said immigrants who arrived illegally after Jan. 1, 2014 are priorities for removal. Federal resources were strained in 2014 under a wave of illegal migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, especially women and children fleeing violence in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The planned new raids are in response to a renewed surge of illegal entries by Central American women traveling with their children.  From October 2015 through March 2016, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended more than 32,000 family units, defined as mothers and children traveling together, for crossing illegally into the United States. Over the same period in 2014-2015, there were about 14,000 such apprehensions; in 2013-2014, about 19,800. (Graphic on immigration patterns of Central American migrants: tmsnrt.rs/1qglGZG) Many of those apprehended for unlawful entry are put into deportation proceedings in court but do not show up for their scheduled appearance before a judge or ignore court orders to leave the country. The surge in illegal border crossings has put Obama in a tough spot in a presidential election year in which he wants to see a fellow Democrat elected as his successor.   Obama has said criminal immigrants and those who have recently entered the country are priorities for deportation. He is regularly hammered by Republicans over the presence of more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.  But Hispanic-Americans tend to vote for Democrats, who are more sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented. Clinton raised concerns about the January raids at the time, saying they had sown fear and division in immigrant communities. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to build a wall along the Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a U.S. Senate panel in March that the January raids had helped to deter Central Americans from migrating illegally. Border Patrol reported fewer illegal entries between January and March 2016 compared to October and December 2015, but there were more apprehended than over the same time period in early 2015. A separate document seen by Reuters said Johnson was concerned about the most recent uptick in border crossings.  Immigration advocates say they have asked Johnson to abandon plans for future raids. Raids are not the answer, said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, a legal aide and advocacy group for migrants. This is a humanitarian challenge, she said.

Cuba and U.S. officials to meet next week to deepen detente,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States will meet next week for a third round of talks on improving relations, Havana said on Thursday, adding that the two former Cold War foes were not yet negotiating their multibillion-dollar claims against one another. A bilateral commission will meet next Monday in the Cuban capital to evaluate the progress made in putting their decades-old conflict behind them, and to identify new areas of cooperation, said Gustavo Machin, the deputy director for U.S. affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry. We will set the agenda for the rest for the year, Machin told a news conference. We are not yet negotiating the topic of claims even if there is a recognition on both sides that these exist. Cuba and the U.S. reestablished diplomatic relations a year ago and have signed agreements on issues of common concern such as the environment, postal services and direct flights. Many differences remain however. Machin reiterated Cubas demands for the return of the Guantanamo naval base and lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. Cuba complains that some of the policy changes the U.S. has carried out, such as relaxing currency restrictions against the island, have had little real impact given the persistent fear among U.S. institutions of risking government sanctions. The White House said in March it would allow U.S. banks to process dollar transactions for Cuba as long as neither buyer nor seller were U.S. entities. Until now, no bank transactions have been carried out in U.S. currency, Machin said. There is still a great fear. Cuba has said it will only lift a 10 percent tax on cash dollars once it is clear U.S. banks are processing dollar transactions for the Communist-ruled island. The issue of reparations is another sticky point. Late last year, Cuba and the U.S. outlined their respective claims, with the former demanding at least $121 billion in reparations for the U.S. trade embargo and other acts it describes as aggressions against the Caribbean country. The Americans meanwhile are seeking upwards of $10 billion in compensation for nationalized properties. The third bilateral commission will be led by Josefina Vidal, the Cuban Foreign Ministrys chief of U.S. affairs, and Kristie Kenney, counselor for the U.S. State Department.

Obama sets state dinner table for six at unusual Nordic summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is set to toast the five leaders of Nordic nations at a lavish state dinner at the White House on Friday, an unusual summit aimed in part at sending a message to a nation not on the guest list: Russia. Obama will laud the humanitarian and environmental accomplishments of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland, but also wants to talk about how to deal with their increasingly aggressive neighbor Russia ahead of a NATO summit in July. We share the concern of countries in the region, particularly those who have a border with Russia, about the increasing presence of Russian military assets in the area, said Charles Kupchan, Obamas senior director for European affairs. We will be discussing ways to enhance the security of the region, writ large, and also what we can do through dialogue and diplomacy to urge Russia to be more transparent and to be more restrained and careful in its military exercises, Kupchan told reporters. Obama last met Nordic leaders in Stockholm in 2013 on his way to a G20 summit in St. Petersburg after canceling a planned bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin because of tensions over Syria and surveillance issues. Since then, Russia annexed Ukraines Crimea region, prompting Nordic nations to step up their military cooperation and the United States to boost military spending to help NATO do more to try to deter Russia. During a recent visit to Europe, Obama sought to reassure allies about the U.S. commitment to the continent, but pushed nations to increase their defense spending and stay united amid the strain of dealing with an influx of migrants fleeing Middle East conflicts. The leaders will discuss a long-term approach for dealing with refugees, Kupchan said, as well as new contributions to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. He declined comment on specific commitments from the meeting. Typically, the White House rolls out the red carpet for one leader at a time. Friday will be a bit trickier, juggling five guests of honor and their entourages. The state dinner itself will be in a large tent with a transparent ceiling evoking the northern lights and shadowy spaces in the arctic night, the White House told reporters. Guests will sit at long, rustic wooden tables bedecked with columns of ice, fiddlehead ferns, and fragrant hand-rolled beeswax candles, and dine on braised Nebraska beef short ribs and salt-cured Atlantic ahi tuna served in a large ice cube.  The summit is expected to be heavy on feel-good messages about the outsized role Nordic nations play in international diplomacy, said Julie Smith, a former Obama administration official now with the Center for a New American Security. In many ways, the actual visit is the deliverable, Smith said, noting it was unlikely major new initiatives would emerge. Were at the end of the presidents tenure so there are limits on what new things he can drive forward, Smith said. In Washington, preparations for the leaders arrival have been overshadowed by a visit by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to meet with congressional leaders as the race intensifies to replace Obama in the White House in the Nov. 8 election. Trump has said NATO is obsolete and European nations should look after their own defense, which has sparked concern among Nordic nations, said Heather Conley, a former State Department official in the George W. Bush administration. They hear with great clarity the statements of Donald Trump and they dont know exactly how this is going to work in November, said Conley, now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Norways Prime Minister Erna Solberg plans to stress the importance of American participation in NATO for Nordic nations, she said in an interview this week with the Norwegian daily Aftenposten. With an unpredictable Russian presence in the northern areas, its important that the Americans have a focus on the Arctic regions, Solberg said. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1
U.S. foreign policy veteran warns Trump would make world less stable,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps foreign policy proposals would make the world a less stable place, former Secretary of State James Baker told a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday as the Republican presidential candidate met elsewhere with party congressional leaders. Under questioning from Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a former Trump rival in the presidential race, Baker said the world would be far less stable with a weaker NATO or if more countries had nuclear weapons as Trump has proposed. Weve a got a lot of problems today, but wed have a hell of a lot more if that were the case, Baker told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, adding that U.S. commitments around the world promote U.S. security. Trump met with Baker on Thursday at Trumps request, said a Baker spokesman, who declined further comment.   The hearing, on Americas Role in the World, was called by the committees Republican chairman, Senator Bob Corker. Corker praised a foreign policy speech Trump gave in Washington last month. Some U.S. allies worried after Trumps remarks that his invocation of an America first agenda is a threat to retreat from the world. Without naming Trump, Rubio referred to the businessman-turned-candidates suggestions that the United States should rethink the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and that Japan and South Korea should consider getting nuclear weapons to defend themselves. Some have suggested why dont you just let Japan and South Korea get their own nuclear weapons and let them defend themselves? Rubio asked. The more countries that acquire nuclear weapons, the more instability there is going to be in the world, in my opinion, Baker said. Tom Donilon, Democratic President Barack Obamas former national security adviser, called Rubios question an important thought experiment, as he backed Bakers comments about the importance of NATO. Its not just a thought experiment, its actually been proposed, Rubio said. As the hearing took place, Trump was on Capitol Hill meeting with Republican congressional leaders on how to heal divisions within the party, including those between establishment figures like Baker and the insurgent candidate. Baker, a Republican who was secretary of state under President George Bush and Treasury secretary under President Ronald Reagan, testified alongside Donilon. Former Presidents Bush and George W. Bush do not plan to endorse Trump, or any candidate, in this years White House race. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1
Senate sets votes on competing Zika funding plans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three competing plans for battling a potential Zika virus outbreak in the United States were presented on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Thursday, as lawmakers tried to break an impasse pitting President Barack Obama against congressional Republicans. The first test votes on the measures, which would provide at least $1.1 billion in new funds to deal with the spreading virus, were expected on Tuesday. In February, Obama urged Congress to quickly approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with prevention and treatment of Zika virus, which the World Health Organization warns is spreading rapidly in the Americas. The disease, transmitted by mosquitoes, has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities. It also is suspected of causing a rare neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome, that can result in paralysis. White House spokesman Josh Earnest welcomed any sort of forward momentum in Congress while continuing to push for the full $1.9 billion. It could not be clearer that Congress needs to take action to help our states and our local officials fight the Zika virus. That is critical for health and safety of the American people, Earnest said. Floridas senators, Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, called for the full $1.9 billion, saying $1.1 billion was inadequate. They noted that the Florida Department of Health has reported a total of 112 Zika virus cases, the most of any U.S. state, as the mosquito season goes into high gear with hotter temperatures.   One proposal now before the Senate would provide Obama with his full $1.9 billion request for emergency funds. A second one would scale back Obamas request to $1.1 billion. These two options would not require spending cuts elsewhere to cover the Zika costs, Senate aides said. A third one would take money from Obamacare to pay for $1.1 billion in Zika response funds. Even if the Senate approves one of these proposals, its fate is uncertain in the House of Representatives, where Republicans are deeply divided over new Zika funding, according to aides. Two senior Republican aides said the partys House leadership has been unable to formulate a plan on Zika legislation and is preoccupied with internal party strife over Donald Trump becoming the presumptive presidential nominee, as well as a deadlock over Puerto Rico debt legislation and a budget blueprint that has been stuck in the House. While plans to unveil a new Puerto Rico bill on Wednesday were canceled, a third senior House Republican aide noted there is progress on that legislation and that discussions on a budget are moving forward as well.    Senate backers of each amendment will try to attach their competing proposals to an unrelated spending bill the Senate started debating on Thursday.         ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1
Senator Rand Paul to back bill blocking FBI hacking expansion,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kentucky Senator Rand Paul plans to become the first Republican co-sponsor of legislation to block a pending judicial rule change that would let U.S. judges issue search warrants for remote access to computers located in any jurisdiction, his office told Reuters on Thursday. The bill is expected to be introduced next week. Backing from Paul, a former Republican candidate for president with libertarian leanings, lends bipartisan support to an effort to undo a little-noticed modification to a text governing procedural rules for the U.S. court system that civil liberties groups warn would drastically expand the FBIs hacking authority. So far, that cause has largely been championed solely by Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and digital privacy advocate. He has vowed to work to stop the rule change on grounds it would allow the government to use one warrant to access and search thousands or millions of computers at once, potentially implicating those suspected of no wrongdoing.  Magistrate judges can normally only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties. But last month the Supreme Court, in a private vote, approved the amendments to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure, which would permit judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnot. Congress has until December 1 to pass legislation that would reject, amend or postpone the changes to Rule 41. If lawmakers do nothing, which is customary in these circumstances, the changes automatically will take effect. The U.S. Justice Department, which is pushing for the rule change, has described it as a procedural tweak needed to modernize the criminal code, and has said it would not permit searches that are not already legal. Alphabet Incs Google has warned the change poses a monumental threat to the Constitutions protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Last year Paul and Wyden worked together to force a temporary expiration of the USA Patriot Act, which led to passage of surveillance reforms that pared backed the National Security Agencys controversial bulk collection of U.S. call records. Other lawmakers are also examining Rule 41.  Republican Senator Mike Lee is looking at ways to address concerns, a spokesman said, and a small group of lawmakers in the House are weighing introduction of companion legislation, sources said.

"Republicans win Obamacare legal challenge, add to insurer concerns","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday handed a victory to congressional Republicans who challenged President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, ruling that his administration overstepped its constitutional powers relating to government spending. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, based in Washington, ruled that the administration cannot spend billions of dollars in federal funds to provide subsidies under the law known as Obamacare to private insurers without the approval of Congress. At issue in the case, brought by the Republican-led House of Representatives, are reimbursements to insurance companies to compensate them for reductions that the law requires them to make to customers out-of-pocket medical payments. The ruling will not have an immediate effect on the law because the judge put the decision on hold pending an expected appeal by the administration. But it adds to uncertainty over the future of Obamas signature domestic policy achievement ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections, including whether enough health insurers will continue to participate in the program. Insurers have sustained losses from their Obamacare business, saying they have not attracted enough healthy customers to offset the costs of sicker members. Two of the largest players, UnitedHealth Group and Humana Inc, had already said they would not offer plans in many markets next year. If youre going to lose more money, why participate? asked Steve Halper, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. Shares in hospital operators such as Community Health Systems Inc fell sharply, while insurer stocks including Aetna Inc, which plans to remain in at least 15 Obamacare markets next year, also declined. In court papers, the administration had warned that a court victory for the House Republicans would lead to a spike in insurance premiums for Americans and force the government to pay more in tax credits to insurance policy-holders. As part of an appeal, the administration is likely to press its argument that the House lacks legal standing to sue.  This suit represents the first time in our nations history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. Its unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing, Earnest added. Theyve been losing this fight for six years, and theyll lose it again. Conservatives have mounted a series of legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act since it was passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition. Collyer was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush. The law has helped bring insurance coverage to millions of Americans who previously had none, subsidizing the cost of insurance through tax credits. In addition, the federal government helped defray consumers out-of-pocket costs. The House Republicans argued that the administrations action violated the U.S. Constitution because it is the legislative branch, not the executive branch, that authorizes government spending. BIG win for the Constitution, House Speaker Paul Ryan wrote on Twitter. Jonathan Turley, the lawyer who spearheaded the lawsuit, in a blog post called the ruling a resounding victory not just for Congress but for our constitutional system as a whole. The appeals court in Washington may be more receptive to the administrations arguments, in part because seven of its 11 active judges are Democratic-appointees, including four picked by Obama. The case focuses on a cost-sharing provision of Obamacare that requires insurers to reduce deductibles and co-pays. Insurers are supposed to be reimbursed for these costs by the federal government. Cost-sharing is determined by the income of the policyholder and is a mechanism for reducing healthcare costs for lower-income households.  The Obama administration has interpreted the provision as a type of federal spending that does not need to be explicitly authorized by Congress. The House Republicans who filed the challenge disagreed. Collyer ruled that the cost-sharing provisions cannot be funded through the same permanent appropriation that covers tax credits made available under the law. The judge rejected the administrations contention that the appropriation should be viewed as permanent because the alternative interpretation would lead to absurd economic, fiscal and healthcare policy results. The U.S. Supreme Court in June 2015, in a ruling authored by Bush-appointed Chief Justice John Roberts, rejected a conservative challenge that could have gutted Obamacare, upholding nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the law. Roberts also wrote a major 2012 ruling preserving Obamacare. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1
Illinois lawmakers approve $700 million to pay social services in part,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A bill to send $700 million to cash-starved social services providers breezed through the Illinois Legislature on Thursday, as the state once again turned to stopgap funding measures in lieu of a budget. The measure passed the House 111-0 and the Senate 56-0. There was no immediate comment from Governor Bruce Rauners office on whether he will sign it into law. A memo from his budget office expressed concerns that language in the bill could actually prevent funding for some programs. Democratic State Representative Greg Harris said the money would be taken from state funds outside of Illinois general revenue fund to cover 46 percent of what the state has failed to pay service providers due to the ongoing impasse over the fiscal 2016 budget. This is a $700 million piece of legislation that would help the neediest at the time they need help the most, he said. Despite the stalemate between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature, about 90 percent of Illinois government is being funded through continuing appropriations, the enactment of a K-12 school bill, and court-ordered spending. But some parts of the government were left out in the cold. Earlier this month, dozens of unpaid social service providers sued Illinois, seeking more than $100 million. Andrea Durbin, chairman of the Pay Now Illinois coalition that filed the lawsuit, said that if enacted, the bill would not end the litigation. It could provide a downpayment of the money we are owed, but its not a comprehensive solution for the Pay Now Illinois plaintiffs, she said. In April, the legislature passed and Rauner signed a $600 million stopgap funding bill for state universities, community colleges, and student tuition grants that covered only 34 percent of the $1.7 billion that had been earmarked for higher education spending in the fiscal year that began on July 1. Illinois is the only U.S. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget. Rauner earlier on Thursday acknowledged that some lawmakers are working on a budget framework. That framework involves higher taxes, spending cuts, and borrowing, according to local media reports.  Im cheering for bipartisan General Assembly members to come up with some solutions, the governor told reporters. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1
Michael Douglas urges Obama to think of his legacy at Hiroshima,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Hollywood actor Michael Douglas, a U.N. messenger for peace, wants President Barack Obama to issue a strong message against nuclear weapons when he visits Hiroshima in Japan later this month. Douglas told reporters at the United Nations in Geneva, where nuclear negotiations have been stuck for 20 years, that the nuclear danger was greater than during the Cold War,  largely due to a huge escalation in U.S.-Russia tensions and increasing recklessness in their close-quarter contacts. Theres this kind of crazy tension between U.S. and Russia. We have our issues but I dont quite see that all of this posturing is helping anybody, he said. The number of weapons that are on trigger alert is frightening. So the time for somebody to possibly make a mistake and correct it is very very short. Douglas said he found religion in the anti-nuclear cause after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979, within days of the opening of his film The China Syndrome, which dealt with an emergency at a nuclear plant.   Standing beside Joseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, a global security organization, Douglas recalled Obamas 2009 speech in Prague, where the president promised concrete steps to wards a nuclear-free world. I think we could say hes been a disappointment because theres not been follow through, and I do hope now for his legacy as he begins to leave office, that hes going to have something strong to say at Hiroshima. Cirincione said Obama had made good early progress on nuclear non-proliferation, but had made only modest cuts in arsenals and was leaving $1 trillion in new nuclear contracts in the pipeline for his successor. Every single weapon in the nuclear arsenal is now due for replacement or an upgrade. Its a looming disaster, he said. Douglas, 71, said he was also a friend of Donald Trump, but he was not confident the United States would make any advances in nuclear disarmament if Trump won the presidency.  I guess one of his strengths, or weaknesses depending how you look at it, is his unpredictability, he said. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1

Puerto Rico either gets legislative fix or humanitarian aid: Congressman,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos debt crisis, if left unaddressed by the U.S. Congress where legislation has stalled in the House Natural Resources Committee, will result in the need to pay for a humanitarian aid package, Congressman Raul Grijalva said on Thursday. Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the HNRC from Arizona, said in a teleconference with reporters that it is an either/or situation as Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in debt it cannot pay off and a growing humanitarian crisis because it cannot afford maintaining basic social services. Either we begin this process, stabilize, create some carve out opportunities for essential services and/or wait for the crisis to get worse and then have to respond with humanitarian relief, Grijalva said, adding that a new draft of the bill had not been made available as of Thursday morning. Grijalva visited Puerto Rico this week and met with the islands leadership and toured its main medical facilities. He said austerity alone is not going to stay the situation of degraded conditions for health, nutrition and education. People talk about a bailout. Thus far there is no money being talked about extended by the United States government, Grijalva said, adding: We are talking about a piece of legislation that provides for a method of restructuring and for some accountability attached to that restructuring. The Republican chairman of the HNRC, Rob Bishop of Utah, said he wants a bipartisan bill to emerge from committee but canceled an expected release of the legislation on Wednesday while lawmakers hashed out language revolving around the status of the island of Vieques, pensions and minimum wage rates. Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the islands main fiscal agent. It faces a near $2 billion July 1 debt payment. The legislations basic structure still includes the creation of an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealths credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan. On the issue of Vieques, Democrats are concerned the language regarding the transfer of federal land on the island, which is mainly a nature preserve, could leave it vulnerable to commercial development in the name of recreation. Our position has been from the beginning that Vieques did not belong in this package of legislation, said Grijalva. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1
"Baltimore primary results decertified, irregularities cited","(Reuters) - Results of Baltimores primary election were ordered decertified on Thursday by the Maryland elections board, which cited irregularities in the April 26 vote that may have influenced a tight mayoral race. The state panel will begin a precinct-by-precinct review of voting in the overwhelming Democratic city. The Baltimore elections board will pull its certification this evening, state board administrator Linda Lamone said. The state review could cast doubt on the narrow victory by state Senator Catherine Pugh in the mayoral primary, where she defeated former Mayor Sheila Dixon. Pugh had backed law enforcement reform as Baltimore recovers from April 2015 rioting sparked by a black mans death from an injury in police custody. Three City Council races were determined by a few hundred votes. Lamone said officials had found 80 provisional ballots that had not been checked to see whether they were cast in the right precinct or the voters were registered. Unusually high numbers of voters also checked in at polling places but never cast ballots, she said. That issue was not cleared up when the city board certified the election this week. There were enough discrepancies in that reconciliation (on the number of voters) that made me determine we need to review everything more, Lamone said. A group of activists has questioned the fairness of the election. Victory in the Democratic primary means an almost certain win in the November general election. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1

Congress subcommittee grills U.S. banks regulator about data breaches,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of Congress on Thursday grilled the main U.S. banking regulator about a recent raft of data breaches, highlighting two incidents where workers downloaded more than 10,000 sensitive and private records onto portable storage devices before leaving the agencys employ. After the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp uncovered those two breaches, it conducted a review and found five other instances when employees improperly stored and took personal information for tens of thousands of individuals, according to Representative Barry Loudermilk, a Republican who chairs a House of Representatives subcommittee on oversight and technology. Altogether, more than 160,000 people were affected, Loudermilk said at a hearing covering the breaches. To date, FDIC has failed to notify any of those individuals that their private information may have been compromised, he added.  The highest-ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Representative Don Beyer, said the concerns were shared by members of both parties and added the FDIC was too slow in notifying Congress about the breaks in data security. It should have informed lawmakers within seven days of the incidents, he said. The FDICs chief information officer and chief privacy officer, Lawrence Gross, told the hearing the agency is working to eliminate employees use of portable media and has installed technology blocking most employees from downloading data from its systems to DVDs, CDs and flash drives. It is also looking into digital rights management software limiting the time period someone can access information and putting up other barriers to redistributing information. Gross, who started his role in November, said he is conducting a top to bottom review of the agencys information technology policies and planned to hire an independent third party to conduct an assessment.  The FDIC has said the downloads were inadvertent.  But members of Congress remained skeptical that the breaches were not intentional.  In at least one case...a former employee who downloaded such data was evasive about her actions and not cooperative when initially confronted, said Representative Bill Johnson. Some FDIC employees also suggest that it was highly improbable that this former employees actions were accidental. In addition this former employee is now working for a U.S. subsidiary of a non-U.S. financial services company which raises additional concerns. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1

Fundraisers make pitch for Trump at hedge fund conference,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Top fundraisers for Donald Trump made pitches on Wednesday to prominent hedge fund investors to line up behind the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to raise $1 billion for the general election campaign. The New York billionaire businessman was a topic of discussion as some 2,000 hedge fund managers, investors, lawyers and journalists gathered in Las Vegas for the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as SALT, the industrys most prominent annual meeting. Steven Mnuchin, Trumps newly appointed national finance chairman and a private investor himself, met with some of the attending hedge fund managers and others, including oil investor T. Boone Pickens, Georgette Mosbacher and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. In an onstage interview, Kenneth Griffin, the billionaire founder of powerful hedge fund firm Citadel who previously supported U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, did not address the presidential campaign. A spokesman for Griffin did not respond to a request for comment. Also speaking at the event was former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who in an onstage interview, declined to endorse any presidential candidate. Earlier this year, Bloomberg flirted with an independent presidential candidacy, but decided against it for fear it would help Trumps chances of getting elected. Some investors told Reuters they were disappointed Bloomberg did not enter the race. Trump is the last man standing in the Republican race after U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich dropped out last week. Trump, who has never held elective office, is trying to unite Republicans behind his candidacy after a primary election campaign in which his fiery rhetoric on trade, immigration and Muslims rankled party elites. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Trump had pulled even with Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 presidential election. David Rubenstein, co-founder of private equity powerhouse Carlyle Group, kicked off the three-day conference by asking the audience which candidate they thought would move into the White House in January after Novembers election. The vast majority did not express an opinion on either Trump or Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Away from panel discussions on how the industry can salvage a poor start to the year - the average hedge fund is off 0.8 percent this year, according to eVestment - powerful Trump backers were working smaller venues around the Hotel Bellagio. Anthony Scaramucci, who hosts the conference and runs hedge fund investment firm Skybridge Capital, said he was reaching out to his contacts to convince them Trump would run his candidacy like an entrepreneur, something he said America needed.  You have an opportunity now to bring an entrepreneur and a team of advisers that are entrepreneurial, out-of-the-box thinkers into Washington, Scaramucci told Reuters. Thats the sell to potential donors. Scaramucci has long been a powerful Republican fundraiser who originally backed Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in this years race and later Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor.  He said there would be the Trump Entrepreneurial Avenue versus the Clinton cul-de sac, a suggestion that economic growth would be stronger under the likely Republican nominee. Scaramucci added that potential donors would soon get over any fears of publicly helping Trump. Candidate Trump has said some things that some business people think: Jeez, if Im associated with some of those things, it could be perceived negatively for my business. I think that will wash away in the next two months, Scaramucci said. Among big-name Trump backers at the conference were Pickens, an oil investor and hedge fund manager who previously supported Bushs candidacy. Yes, Im for Donald Trump, he said on stage, adding Trump was smart enough to get himself help where he needed it politically and that it would be refreshing to have a businessman instead of a politician in the White House. Donald almost always overestimates how successful he is, Pickens said, but nonetheless he has been out there and he does know something about what he is talking about.

Different this time? Trump candidacy could weigh on Fed thinking,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps rise to de-facto Republican nominee for president poses an unusually high level of uncertainty for investors and businesses, potentially weighing on the economy and the Federal Reserves plan to raise interest rates this year. Uncertainty is always present in elections and the Fed has hiked rates during past campaign seasons. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1rD6A1u) But the possibility of the firebrand New York real estate mogul occupying the White House presents a step up in risk because of the unconventional policies he has proposed and a lack of detail on how they will be achieved, economists say. Promising to make America great again, Trump has raised fears of a trade war by saying he would slap steep tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports. He has also vowed to deport all 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States, and suggested, though later retracted, a partial default on U.S. debt. Fed officials say they avoid discussion of domestic politics at rate-setting meetings. Transcripts from previous election-year policy discussions show that political uncertainty is a factor in their thinking, though there is no clear pattern of a loosening or tightening bias in the run-up to elections. In recent comments, some Fed officials have acknowledged that campaign rhetoric could spill over into the economy. If consumers, because of political rhetoric, are slowing their spending or just pausing a little bit, or capex is slowing down...that Ive got to take into account, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told Reuters last Thursday.  Asked his view of Trumps policy proposals, he said, If I have one, youll never know what that is. I will never allow that to seep into my work.  Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that it was fair to say the election could be a factor in this years economy. The Fed kept rates on hold at 0.25-0.5 percent last month and signaled it was in no rush to raise them again soon, citing slowing economic activity despite an improved labor market. Fed policymakers in March forecast two rate hikes this year after raising them last December for the first time in nearly a decade. A Reuters poll of economists released on Thursday showed they have pushed back their expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates again to September from June. Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other Fed policymakers have often cited uncertainty over the economic, financial and policy outlook as a factor in their interest-rate decisions. The VIX measure of stock-market volatility is one approach to measuring uncertainty; querying influential business owners is another. The exact mix of measures the Fed uses is not known. Stanford University professor Nick Blooms economic policy uncertainty index, which he presented to Yellen and economists at recently as April last year, is another approach that the Fed considers. The index analyzes newspaper coverage of policy-related economic uncertainty and divergence between economic forecasters predictions on the U.S. outlook among other factors.   When uncertainty is high, firms put on pause hiring and investment decisions, Bloom said in an interview. If Trump looks like a serious contender and is still making Mexican Wall and Trade Rape comments we will have the mother of all policy uncertainty spikes running up to the election.  Trump has said he would build a wall on the Mexico-U.S. border and accused China of raping the U.S. with unfair trade policies.  A rise in the index, Bloom said, would foreshadow declines in production, investment, and employment.  Policymakers pay close attention to financial market volatility as well as economic data. The Fed delayed an expected hike last September after Chinas sharp economic slowdown caused stock market drops and a tightening in financial conditions. A strong Trump candidacy could similarly upset markets, economists say. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Trump running nearly even with Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely U.S. voters, a dramatic turnaround since he became his partys presumptive nominee. Traders see a 36.5 percent chance of a Republican taking the presidency, according to futures prices on the Iowa Electronic Market.  If Trump gains in the polls and the market reacts poorly, that (market turmoil) would be a good argument for the Fed to stay on hold, said Cornerstone Macro economist Roberto Perli, a former Fed board staffer. China and Mexico are the second and third largest trading partners of the United States, respectively. The trade stuff is anti-growth and harmful to the U.S. outlook, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of conservative think tank the American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. Hes an utterly unpredictable political element at this point, added Holtz-Eakin, who was also chief economic policy adviser to Senator John McCains 2008 presidential campaign.  Trump, who says his policies will boost U.S. jobs and business interests, has said he likes low rates, but has also said he would replace Yellen when her term expires in 2018 if he wins the presidency.   So far theres little indication Blooms uncertainty index is about to spike. It fell to a reading of 98.39 in April, just above where it was in November ahead of the Feds well-telegraphed rate hike. Other readings of uncertainty, like the VIX, look similarly benign. Voters go to the polls on Nov. 8. Historically, Blooms index jumps just ahead of tight presidential ballots, as well as during times of other policy uncertainty, such as the U.S. debt ceiling debate in 2011. A surge of 90 points in the index could presage a one percent decline in production and declines in employment and investment of about a half a percent each, based on Blooms models.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic showing past Fed rate moves in election years    tmsnrt.rs/1rD6A1u) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1

Factbox: How will Britain's EU referendum work on the night?,"(Reuters) - Britain holds a referendum on membership of the European Union on June 23. Following are details of how the referendum will work on the night. Sources: Electoral Commission, Reuters reporting. Voters will be given one piece of paper with the question: Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union? They will be asked to put a cross beside either: Remain a member of the European Union Leave the European Union All those who are entitled to vote in a UK parliamentary general election can vote in the referendum, including British, Irish and qualifying Commonwealth citizens over the age of 18 who are resident in the UK.

U.S. Senate negotiators zero in on Zika virus funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate negotiators on Wednesday tried to reach a deal to provide more than $1 billion to battle the Zika virus that is feared will creep north into the United States with the onset of warmer weather, which breeds mosquitoes that could carry the disease. Senior Senate Democratic aides said details were still being worked out, but votes could come by next week on whether to approve the new money. In February, President Barack Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funds, but Republicans balked, with some arguing that $1.1 billion is more in line with what is needed. Many Republicans also want any Zika funds to be offset with spending cuts elsewhere. These are among the details that still have to be worked out, according to aides. Republican Senator Roy Blunt from Missouri and Democratic Senator Patty Murray from Washington, the two senior senators on an appropriations panel that oversees healthcare spending, have been trying to hammer out a deal. An aide to Murray said in a statement: Senator Murray is having conversations with Chairman Blunt and others about the path forward on emergency funding to respond to Zika. The aide said Murray still supports Obamas $1.9 billion request. Amid congressional inaction, the Obama administration shifted $589 million to help federal agencies prepare for Zika. Most of that money came from a fund to fight the Ebola virus and will have to be replenished, according to officials. Senator Marco Rubio, however, is one Republican pushing for both immediate, emergency funding and longer-term money to be made available starting on Oct. 1 to battle the disease that can cause severe brain deformities in babies born of infected mothers and other illnesses. This is going to be an ongoing issue beyond this year, Rubio said, adding, We need to jump on it now. There are fears that Rubios home state of Florida could be the first place in the continental United States to get hit hard by Zika because of its tropical climate. For the first time, Ive seen high-level conversations about a way forward here in the Senate and thats a positive development, Rubio said in a brief hallway interview with Reuters. Republicans in the House of Representatives are still deeply divided over new funding for Zika, according to two senior aides.",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1

U.S. Republicans want to slash Obama's security council," (This version of the May 11 story, corrects figure in second paragraph to 100.) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Republican filed legislation on Wednesday seeking to rein in the White Houses National Security Council, saying it has grown too large and seeks to play too big a role in foreign policy. Representative Mac Thornberry said his measure would increase oversight of the NSC, capping it at 100 people or allowing it to be larger but subjecting the National Security adviser to confirmation by the Senate. Thornberry estimated the NSC currently has 400 staff. All of President (Barack) Obamas former Defense Secretaries have complained about micromanagement by the NSC, Thornberry, chairman of the powerful House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. I have personally heard from troops on the frontlines who have received intimidating calls from junior White House staffers. Now we hear reports of NSC staffers running misinformation campaigns targeted at Congress and the press, Thornberry said. He was referring to a recent New York Times profile in which a deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, discussed ways the administration had communicated about last years Iran nuclear deal to the Washington press corps. Administration officials have dismissed proposals like Thornberrys as political ploys. Ned Price, a spokesman for the NSC, commented that the White House has already taken steps to trim staff and streamline procedures. Thornberry introduced his legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass annual defense bill. To become law, a version of the NDAA including Thornberrys amendment would have to pass both the House and Senate and be signed into law by Obama. ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1
Germany's Steinmeier warns of EU disruptions in event of 'Brexit',"BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union would not simply carry on as before should Britain vote to leave the bloc, Germanys foreign minister said on Thursday, pointing to Northern Ireland as one potential trouble spot. Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he hoped Britain would vote to stay in the 28-member bloc in a referendum on June 23. Should the British decide otherwise, then the European Union wont just carry on as 28 minus one, Steinmeier told a conference on Europe in his ministry. As an example of one area where old troubles could flare up, he pointed to Northern Ireland and its border with EU member Ireland, which is open and where the situation is largely calm. At the moment that the United Kingdom leaves (the EU), we have a border again between Ireland and Northern Ireland. That has at least the potential to allow completely calmed conflicts to flare up again, Steinmeier said. A 1998 peace deal, brokered after more than 3,600 had died, has largely ended the conflict that pitted mostly Catholics, who wanted a united Ireland, against Unionists, mostly Protestants, who wanted it to remain part of the United Kingdom.

U.S. high court could spur Congress on Puerto Rico debt crisis,"WASHINGTON/SAN JUAN (Reuters) - As the U.S. Congress drags its feet on a bill to address Puerto Ricos $70 billion debt crisis, it could get kicked into high gear by an unlikely source: the Supreme Court.  The highest U.S.court is due to rule by the end of June on the validity of a Puerto Rico law that would allow the U.S. territory to restructure the chunk of its debt issued by public agencies,more than$20 billion, in a bankruptcy-like process. The court fight is playing out as the Republican-led Congress grapples with legislation that lawmakers hope will prevent the need for a bailout of the territory of 3.5 million U.S. citizens. The legislation is expected to put Puerto Ricos finances under federal oversight through a control board and let the Caribbean island cut debt through a bankruptcy-like restructuring process. It would preempt the Recovery Act, the local restructuring law that was thrown out in U.S. courts before Puerto Rico asked the Supreme Court to reinstate it. Puerto Rico is not covered by federal bankruptcy laws that U.S. cities and public agencies can use,so some U.S. lawmakers view legislation as the only way to keep the debt crisis from worsening. But drafting the bill has been laborious. Some bondholders, including U.S. hedge funds, and Republicans are seeking to ensure that creditors get paid as much as possible of what they are owed. Congressional Democrats, the Obama administration and Puerto Rico itself are trying to prevent austerity that could threaten services on the island. An early draft of the bill by the House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee never made it to a vote, and the panel on Wednesday delayed unveiling the latest draft, citing the need for a number of refinements. Some Republicans oppose inclusion of a cram-down provision that would let Puerto Rico impose debt cuts on creditors who do not agree to them. A Supreme Court decision on Puerto Ricos law could comeas soon as Monday. The rulingcould change the political dynamics for Republicans by resurrecting a lawthat is viewed as even less palatable to them than the congressional bill,according to congressional sources and experts who follow the debate. Many of the creditors lobbying conservatives in Congress to oppose the legislation, known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), would prefer to keep debt-restructuring talks out of a bankruptcy court, or at least avoid cram-down. That is because in the normal course of business they are entitled to full repayment, but in a bankruptcy proceeding they could be legally made to accept discounts.  If the Supreme Court reinstates the Recovery Act, the congressional legislationmight not seem so bad to creditorsin comparison,said Melissa Jacoby, a University of North Carolina School of Law bankruptcy expert and professor. It might alter the lobbying landscape, Jacoby said. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its debt, most recently the bulk of a $422 million payment owed by its primary government bank. The Recovery Act, if revived, would let the island restructure debt at public utilities like power authority PREPA and water authority PRASA, though the islands legislature could try to expand it to cover other debts, Jacoby said. The Supreme Courts March 22 oral arguments indicated the justices could uphold the law. Such a ruling could prompt creditors and Republican lawmakers to embrace the need to pass the PROMESA bill. The legislation is expected to carry more bondholder protections than the Recovery Act, requiring an attempt at consensual restructuring talks as a condition for any debt cuts. Those very same players who are now blocking our (congressional) legislation will, all of a sudden, encourage the (Republican) majority to pass some legislation if the Supreme Court revives the Recovery Act, said a Democratic House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. The islands moment of truth could strike by June 30. That is the date by which the Supreme Court is expected to rule and a day before Puerto Rico faces a $1.9 billion debt payment that its governor has said it cannot afford. Congress isaiming to pass legislation to address Puerto Ricos crisisbeforethat payment.  Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat, told Reuters the high courts ruling could have some effect on PROMESAs drafting process depending on what the Supreme Court says about Puerto Rican authority to do whatever it needs to do. A source close to major creditors said a ruling reinstating the Recovery Act could encourage Congress to pass legislation for a different reason: creditors would keep litigating different aspects of that law, perpetuating Puerto Ricos economic uncertainty. Parish Braden, a spokesman for House National Resources Committee Republicans, said Congress ultimately must act regardless of what the Supreme Court does. The ball is already in Congress court, Braden said. ",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",1
Gingrich doesn't rule out Trump VP role,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican veteran Newt Gingrich did not rule out on Wednesday the possibility that he could be persuaded to serve as presumptive nominee Donald Trumps vice presidential running mate, but said Trump has plenty of other talent to consider. I would certainly talk about it, Gingrich told Fox News Channels Sean Hannity. I wouldnt turn it down automatically. Gingrich has been a persistent subject of speculation as a possible Trump running mate. He is a former speaker of the House of Representatives and, as such, meets one of Trumps main requirements for the job - that his No. 2 be someone who could help steer legislation through Congress. Gingrich ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and lost to the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney. He has been serving as an informal adviser to Trump, who has said he has narrowed his list of potential picks to five or six. Gingrich said in the Fox interview that former Texas Governor Rick Perry and Ohio Governor John Kasich would both be strong selections for the position. Kasich, who ended his own presidential run last week, has emphatically ruled out serving with Trump, while Perry has said he would be willing to be considered and has endorsed Trump. Speculation has also centered around some of Trumps former rivals like U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who said this week he was not interested, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who is a strong backer of Trump. Im not the only person around, Gingrich said. He suggested that there could be better choices for the position, noting that it would be an advantage for Trump to have a running mate who could help win over voters in a particular region of the country.  A former congressman from Georgia, Gingrich has lived in the Washington, D.C., suburbs for years. Still, he said, he would be willing to consider it. I am in the not no column, Gingrich said.

"House blocks Google-hosted apps, Yahoo Mail over security fears","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives information technology team has blocked lawmakers from accessing software applications hosted on a Google cloud service to prevent possible hacking campaigns, two congressional sources said on Wednesday.  The move came after Yahoo Mail was also blacklisted by House authorities due to fears of ransomware infiltration. The two restrictions, which have hampered some internal communications in the lower chamber, have both been implemented within the past two weeks and are still in place. The episodes are not believed to be related, the sources said.    Devices connected to the Houses internet via wifi or ethernet cables have been barred from accessing appspot.com, the domain where Google hosts custom-built apps, after the FBI notified Congress of a potential security vulnerability, the sources said. We began blocking appspot.com on May 3 in response to indicators that appspot.com was potentially still hosting a remote access trojan named BLT that has been there since June 2015, one of the sources, a House staffer with direct knowledge of the situation, told Reuters. A Google (GOOGL.O) spokesman said the company was investigating reports of the restriction and would work with the House to resolve any issues. The FBI has so far not responded to a request for a comment. The FBI sent an advisory to private industry in June 2015 about a number of remote access tools capable of stealing personally identifiable information, including a trojan file named BLT found on the Google appspot.com domain.          Ted Henderson, a former House employee, said two Google-hosted apps he created specifically for use by congressional staffers to discuss politics and share alerts on votes are now effectively banned on their work network. The disabling of appspot.com occurred after the House Information Security Office sent an advisory email to lawmakers and staffers on April 30 warning of increased phishing attacks on the House network from third party, web-based mail applications including Yahoo Mail and Gmail. The attacks are focused on putting ransomware on users computers, the email, seen by Reuters, states. It added that the primary focus of the attackers appeared to be Yahoo Mail, which was being blocked on the network until further notice. Two individuals fell victim to ransomware by clicking on infected Word document email attachments, sources familiar with the hacking said. The infected files were able to be recovered without paying any ransom, the sources said. Ransomware attacks, which involve accessing a computer or networks files and encrypting them until a ransom is paid by the victim, have grown more severe and common in recent years.  Yahoo YHOO.O is working closely with the House to resolve the matter, a company spokesperson said. ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1
Cyber attacks on Islamic State use tools others also have: U.S. defense chief,"SANTA CLARA (Reuters) - Cyber attack techniques used by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State could also be used by other countries, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said on Wednesday. Speaking in California, Carter told reporters that the U.S.-led coalition used electronic techniques to disrupt and degrade the jihadist forces ability to organize and said an unspecified number of other countries could do the same in other conflicts. These are not capabilities that only we have, Carter said at a news conference at the Santa Clara headquarters of Intel Corps security wing. That is why good, strong cyber defenses are essential for us. The remarks add more detail to a campaign that has only recently been acknowledged. The conference was also attended by the U.S. Secretaries of Homeland Security and Commerce. The cabinet secretaries had gathered for a day-long presidential security advisory board meeting that was the first to be held in Silicon Valley since the groups inception more than 35 years ago. The officials used their remarks at the event to call for greater cooperation between the government and private sector, especially to confront rising cyber security threats. Carter said he was expanding the Pentagons technology innovation unit by adding an office in Boston and hiring a recruiter to attract tech company leaders to temporary military jobs. The so-called Defense Innovation Unit Experimental was formed to help get ideas and products from Silicon Valley into the Defense Department quickly. National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers told the group that the governments largest intelligence workforce had moved from almost exclusively defending Pentagon networks to protecting the civilian government five years ago and was increasingly assisting the Department of Homeland Security in efforts to help safeguard private companies. The part that frustrates me is, why are we coming in after the fact, as with the destructive hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp, instead of acting earlier on information gathered about attacks in the works, Rogers said.  Tensions between U.S. technology companies and the government continue to flare over President Barack Obamas call for encryption that can be pierced at the governments request.  The three cabinet secretaries stood behind the call for flexible encryption during the press conference. The National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee did not address the subject during its public sessions at Intel on Wednesday. Tech and security company officials and prominent venture capitalists said at the meeting they hoped the government would continue to hasten the adoption of private-sector innovation in such areas as robotics and machine learning and the officials said that they would. White House cyber security policy coordinator Michael Daniel said cooperation was critical to avoid the massive economic, social and intelligence benefit of the Internet for the West becoming a liability.

Trump draws even with Clinton in national White House poll ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump pulled even with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday, in a dramatic early sign that the Nov. 8 presidential election might be more hotly contested than first thought. While much can change in the six months until the election, the results of the online survey are a red flag for the Clinton campaign that the billionaires unorthodox bid for the White House cannot be brushed aside. Trumps numbers surged after he effectively won the Republican nomination last week by knocking out his two remaining rivals, according to the poll. The national survey found 41 percent of likely voters supporting Clinton and 40 percent backing Trump, with 19 percent undecided. The survey of 1,289 people was conducted over five days and has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. Very happy to see these numbers, Trump said in a written comment to Reuters. Good direction. A spokesman for Clintons campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the poll. A Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted in the five days to May 4 had the former secretary of state at 48 percent and the New York magnate at 35 percent.     Republican strategist Dave Carney said the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed the vulnerability of Clinton, who is still battling U.S. Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination.  She has been in the public eye for decades, served in high office, and now shes in a dead heat with Trump, in a race that everyone thought she would win easily, said Carney, who has been critical of Trump. Everyone thought it would be a romp. Trump has his own problems, though. He is struggling to bring some senior Republicans behind his campaign after primary election battles in which his fiery rhetoric rankled party elites.     Several Republican leaders  including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan  are withholding their support.  After a tough primary, thats going to take some effort, Ryan said about unifying the party. We are committed to putting that effort in.  The former reality TV star will face pressure to tone down his rhetoric and clarify his policy positions when he visits Republican lawmakers, including Ryan, on Thursday. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney criticized Trump on Wednesday for not releasing his tax returns, saying the only explanation was that the documents contained a bombshell. Trump has said that he will make public his tax returns on the completion of an audit.              Clinton and Trump both poll well with voters of their respective parties, but independent voters continue to express uncertainty about who they will support, with 38 percent in the Reuters/Ipsos poll saying they are unsure or would vote for someone else. With the partys primary season winding down, the two likely nominees have turned their attention to attacking each other, both on policy and personality. Clinton took aim at Trumps tax reform plan at a rally in New Jersey on Wednesday.  With a typical American family earning $54,000 per year, Clinton said, It would take that family 24 years of work to earn what Donald Trumps tax plan will hand out to people like him in just one year. That is no way to create good job with rising incomes for the vast majority of Americans, is it? Trump has taunted Clinton in recent days for failing to close the deal against Sanders.     University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said Trump - who has promised to force Mexico to pay for a border wall to halt illegal immigration and called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country - could also face a wall of opposition among minority voters. This is an election that will be determined as much by the demographic composition of the American electorate as anything else - and that didnt change in a week, he said.      Clintons loss in the Democratic primary election in West Virginia on Tuesday also signaled possible trouble for her in industrial states in November, underscoring how she still needs to court working-class voters in the Rust Belt. Roughly six in 10 voters in West Virginia, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in country, said they were very worried about the direction of the U.S. economy in the next few years, according to a preliminary ABC News exit poll.  The same proportion cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue in the election.         ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1
House passes bill to aid children born into opioid dependency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives on Wednesday unanimously passed legislation to improve safety planning for children who are born dependent on opioid drugs. A similar bill is pending in the Senate. It is one of more than a dozen new measures that are aimed at addressing a U.S. epidemic of addiction to pain pills and cheap heroin.   The legislation came in response to a Reuters investigation last year, titled Helpless and Hooked, which revealed that at least 110 babies had died since 2010 after being born dependent or exposed to opioids and sent home with parents ill-prepared to care for them. Its hard to imagine that stories like these could be any more tragic, Rep. Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican who is the prime sponsor of the bill, said on the House floor. Unfortunately, they are. Because they should have and in many cases could have been prevented. Only nine of the 50 U.S. states followed a federal law requiring them to track and help those newborns, Reuters reported. The news agency found that more than 130,000 newborns were diagnosed with drug withdrawal over the last decade, but most of them werent reported to state child-protection authorities. In April, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asked all states to report by June 30 whether and how they are following the existing law, known as the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. States receive federal funding after giving assurance they are complying. Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the leading Democratic co-sponsor, emphasized that the new legislation would require help for not only the newborn but also for the mother and family. That provision is aimed at overcoming resistance to reporting cases of newborn addiction among doctors and other health-care workers, who sometimes fear that mothers may be punished if the cases come to official attention.    This important step with this bill is to ensure that the whole family is healthy and successful and supported, Clark said. The measure, formally known the Improving Safe Care for the Prevention of Infant Abuse and Neglect Act,passed 421-0. Childrens advocates are seeking more federal funding to go with the commitment.We would view this as a good first step, but they need to make it real and put some money in it, saidJohn Sciamanna, vice president of public policy for the Child Welfare League of America. Among the other opioid-related bills adopted by the House on Wednesday was one designed to help states emulate a pilot program for drug-affected newborns in Huntington, West Virginia. Rep. Evan Jenkins, a Republican who helped create the Huntington facility, known as Lilys Place, before he became a congressman, said his bill would help improve access to care for poor babies and women on Medicare.

Trump open to Social Security changes if elected: adviser,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump would consider changes to Social Security and Medicare if he is elected U.S. president, a top adviser to the New York businessman said on Wednesday, signaling a shift from Trumps earlier stance that he would not touch so-called entitlement programs. Policy adviser Sam Clovis said at a Washington conference that Trump would be open to a bipartisan look at entitlement spending once he implemented his other policies, such as his tax plan. I think after the administrations been in place, then we will start to take a look at all of the programs, including entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, Clovis said at an event hosted by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. The foundation is known for its attacks on deficit spending, and it supports revamping Social Security and Medicare. Well take a hard look at those to start seeing what we can do in a bipartisan way, Clovis said, adding Trump was not  proposing any entitlement changes now. Trump, who became the likely Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 general election last week when his two remaining rivals dropped out, had said he wanted to leave those programs alone.  On the campaign trail in Wisconsin last month, he attacked Republicans who he said would cut Social Security benefits. Its my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is, Trump said during a Republican debate in March. I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. Clovis said Trumps economic policies would spur growth, and he estimated a $4.5 trillion to $7 trillion surplus over 10 years. The conservative Tax Foundation has estimated Trumps tax plan, which calls for simplifying the tax code and slashing corporate rates, would cut U.S. tax revenues by about $10 trillion. Trump may retool that tax proposal to bring down the price tag, said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist with the Heritage Foundation. He said he and Larry Kudlow, who hosts a program on CNBC, have proposed changes to the tax plan. What we were working with the campaign a little bit on is how can we get that cost down, cut it by half or more, without disrupting the main growth elements of the plan, Moore told Reuters. Hope Hicks, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said the tax plan was not being re-written. Moore said Trump had not yet signed off on any proposed tweaks. ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1
Planned Parenthood sues Ohio over plan to restrict funds,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against Ohio officials on Wednesday over a plan by the state to restrict the U.S. healthcare agencys access to state and federal funds, saying it was being singled out for providing abortion services. The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of Planned Parenthood branches of greater Ohio and of the southwest region, said attempts to defund the healthcare agency and several affiliated programs were an extreme punishment exacted solely because abortion services are part of its range of care, court filings showed. Agency officials also said such actions violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution for singling out Planned Parenthood and treating it differently from other healthcare providers. Ohio Right to Life director Katie Franklin called the lawsuit frivolous. The Ohio bill was signed by Governor John Kasich in February and bars the state from contracts with organizations that perform or promote abortions. It is set to take effect on May 23. Kasichs press secretary, Joe Andrews, said in an email he would not discuss pending litigation, but added the governor, a former Republican presidential candidate, was pleased to sign legislation that continued our progress in moving funding to other eligible providers. The lawsuit is the 15th filed by Planned Parenthood over access to care at its centers since mid-2015, when anti-abortion activists began releasing videos purporting to show group officials negotiating prices for aborted fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood denied wrongdoing and said the videos were distorted and politically motivated. Officials in 12 states have since blocked efforts to cut funding from the clinics, and the federal director of Medicaid, a government healthcare program for the poor, warned states in April against cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood simply because its services include abortions. Planned Parenthood officials said they were asking the court to hand down an order before the law takes effect. If allowed to continue, the action would constitute an undue, constitutionally intolerable burden on the abortion rights of Ohio women, the filing said. Also on Wednesday, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed into law a bill that directs the states spending of federal funds for family planning services to health centers and hospitals that provide a full range of healthcare.  The governors office said in a statement the bill would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood clinics out of federal grants for family planning programs.  ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1
"Trump, Sanders fans share hunger for campaign T-shirts, coffee mugs","BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Supporters of U.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders may inhabit opposite ends of the political spectrum, but they have one thing in common: an unprecedented hunger for campaign swag. Fans of the Republican billionaire Trump and of Democrat Sanders have bought nearly $20 million worth of campaign hats, T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other merchandise so far, according to campaign officials, a level that political brand experts reckon is a record for a presidential election. The sales reveal deep passion for the White House contenders among some voters, and could also signify an expansion of merchandise as a fundraising tool in future races, said Laura Ries, president of branding consultancy Ries & Ries. Im sure well see more of this. Merchandise is a great way of getting your message out there, of engaging people, and of raising money, she said. Among offerings from Trump, now the only candidate left in the Republican race, are T-shirts featuring slogans like Team Trump and New York Values, trucker hats emblazed with Make America Great Again and a presidential dog raglan sweater designed to be worn by dogs. The campaign shop for Sanders, who describes himself as a Democratic socialist and who has promised to go after Wall Street and redress social inequalities, features Feel the Bern mugs, T-shirts with slogans like Join the political revolution NOW, and a Babies for Bernie baby bib. Hillary Clinton, who is expected to fend off the challenge from Sanders to become the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has run a much smaller campaign merchandise business. Hillary is a huge front-runner in the polls, but in terms of passion, shes lagging, Ries said. Not as many people want to wear a Clinton T-shirt. T-SHIRTS AND COFFEE MUGS The Sanders campaign has raised about $12.8 million in gross revenue from campaign merchandise sales, accounting for some 7 percent of total individual contributions so far, according to Kenneth Pennington, the campaigns digital director. He said the campaign had sold more than 800,000 individual items since launching last year, including 207,000 t-shirts and 44,000 coffee mugs. That gear cost the campaign $8.5 million to manufacture, representing about 5 percent of the campaigns total expenditures to date, according to federal disclosures, meaning the campaigns net revenue on merchandise is about $4.3 million. The primary manufacturer of the goods was Tigereye Promotions of Ohio. Campaign reports do not require candidates to break out revenue from merchandise sales. Trumps merchandise business is smaller than Sanders, but still historically huge. The real estate developer has mainly used his own funds to finance his White House bid so far, but his campaign has raised more than $6 million in gross revenue by selling Trump trademark gifts and apparel, representing a majority of the campaigns individual contributions, according to spokeswoman Hope Hicks.  The sale of official campaign products has been extremely successful, she said. That gear cost the campaign more than $4.7 million to produce. Among the most used manufacturers were Cali-Fame of California and Ace Specialties of Louisiana, according to federal campaign finance disclosures. The owner of Ace Specialties, Christl Mahfouz, is on the board of Trumps sons foundation, the Eric Trump Foundation, which raises money for terminally ill children. Clintons campaign, meanwhile, has spent just $1.4 million on swag manufacturing so far, according to campaign records. A campaign official was not immediately available to comment on how much the campaign had raised through the sale of that merchandise. For Hillary, I suspect we will see more swag, as she tries to pick up Bernie supporters in the general election, said Karen Post, a brand consultant and author of Brand Turnaround. What young person do you know who doesnt love T shirts? The Trump and Sanders swag spending this year is unmatched by recent elections.  Democratic President Barack Obama, seen as one of the best-branded presidential candidates in recent U.S. history, spent just $1.3 million on T-shirts, posters and bumper stickers during his first election bid in 2008, when he galvanized supporters behind his core messages of hope and change slogan and his rising sun campaign logo.  Obama spent less than $70,000 on merchandise during his 2012 re-election bid against Republican Mitt Romney, whose campaign dished out $3.4 million on campaign promotional items, according to campaign finance reports.

Louisiana legislature passes 72-hour waiting period for abortions,"(Reuters) - The Louisiana legislature on Wednesday passed a bill requiring women to wait three days before receiving an abortion, tripling the states existing waiting time in one of the most stringent regulations of its kind nationally. Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, has said he plans to sign the bill championed by anti-abortion groups. It passed with wide support from the Republican-controlled legislature. The bill requires a woman to wait at least 72 hours after a state-mandated ultrasound for the procedure. The current waiting time is 24 hours, the same as in most states with waiting periods. Only five other states require 72-hour waiting periods: Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. The measures are among a wave of laws being adopted by states as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Courts landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion.  Advocates of extending the Louisiana waiting period say women need more time to consider alternatives and the consequences of ending a pregnancy. Many of them come to regret their decision later in life, Deanna Wallace, legislative director for Louisiana Right to Life, said in a telephone interview. The measure is empowering them with additional time to consider all of the options. Opponents of the legislation see it as the latest attempt to block womens access to abortions. Politicians in Louisiana have made it their mission to restrict access to safe and legal health care  with women in the state left to pay the price, Amanda Allen, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement, urging the governor to veto the measure.  Louisiana also requires women to make two separate visits to a clinic to obtain an abortion, seen as an additional burden on women forced to take extra time off work and away from families, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive health policy.     Missouri, South Dakota and Utah have similar policies, while North Carolina and Oklahoma allow women to receive the initial counseling by phone. The Louisiana legislation includes an exception for women living 150 miles or farther from an abortion clinic. They will remain under the current 24-hour waiting requirement.

Romney: It's 'disqualifying' for Trump not to release tax returns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Wednesday criticized Donald Trump for declining to release his tax returns, saying the only explanation was that the documents contained a bombshell about the real estate mogul. It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters, Romney said in a Facebook post about Trump, who became the likely Republican nominee when his rivals dropped out last week. There is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trumps refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them, Romney said. Given Mr. Trumps equanimity with other flaws in his history, we can only assume its a bombshell of unusual size. Trump has said that he will make public his tax returns on the completion of an audit.

Ryan strikes conciliatory tone ahead of Trump meeting,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday he was trying to be as constructive as possible as he looked forward to a Thursday meeting with presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump aimed at unifying the fractured party. But Ryan, the most high-profile Republican who has not endorsed Trump, warned that bringing party factions together would take some time after a grueling primary season. This suggested there might not be instant results from his get-together on Thursday with Trump and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Trumps takeover of the Republican Party has shaken the partys establishment and prompted soul-searching over whether to reluctantly get behind him or cede any role in the Nov. 8 presidential election, when Hillary Clinton is expected to be his Democratic opponent. Trump faces pressure to tone down his rhetoric and clarify his policy positions as a step toward unifying the divided party. Some Republicans were alarmed at his recent talk of raising taxes on the wealthy. But Ryan also faces some pressure to smooth things over after saying last week that he was not yet ready to support Trump, an extraordinary statement that was seen as keeping some distance from the presumptive nominee and leaving open his prospects for running for president in 2020. What we are trying to do is to be as constructive as possible, to have a real unification, Ryan told reporters on Wednesday after a meeting with his fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives. After a tough primary, thats going to take some effort. We are committed to putting that effort in, said Ryan, who said he does not really know Trump. I want to be a part of that unifying process so that we are at full strength this fall, so that we can win this election. We cannot afford to lose this election to Hillary Clinton, Ryan said. Ryan, 46, a conservative congressman since 1999 who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 2012, and Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire real estate developer, are very different Republicans who do not see eye to eye on many things, from immigration to trade. But Ryan said on Wednesday these differences are not at issue, because this is a big-tent party. There is plenty of room for different policy disputes in this party. One lawmaker at Wednesdays House Republican gathering raised a request for Trump to meet with all Republicans in the House, a source who was in the room said, asking not to be named. Such a meeting is expected to happen sometime before the July 18-21 Republican convention in Cleveland, the source said. On Tuesday night, Ryan spoke by phone for about 16 minutes with a Trump emissary, former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, according to Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams. Some Republicans have been rankled by Trumps policy proposals, including his declaration that NATO is obsolete and his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. But some House lawmakers who back Trump expressed their displeasure with Ryan for withholding his support at a small group meeting with the speaker later on Wednesday, an aide to one of the lawmakers said. Trump has the potential to appeal to a greater number of Republican voters but must make changes to make party leaders more comfortable with him, Republican officials and lawmakers say.  I think he has to show what kind of president that he would be, Senator Susan Collins said. But I believe he can do that, so I am not one who has foreclosed the possibility of eventually supporting him. But I need to see more from him. After Ryan said last week he was not yet ready to support Trump, the candidate fired back that he was not ready to support Ryans agenda. But on Wednesday, Trump had warm words for Ryan and said he thought they were doing fine. Well see what happens at the meeting, Trump told Fox News. If we make a deal, thatll be great. If we dont, well trudge forward like Ive been doing. ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1
"Exclusive: Trump surges in support, almost even with Clinton in national U.S. poll"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps support has surged and he is now running nearly even with Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely U.S. voters, a dramatic turnaround since he became the Republican partys presumptive presidential nominee, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.  The results could signal a close fight between the two likely White House rivals as Americans make up their minds ahead of the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. As recently as last week, Clinton led Trump by around 13 points in the poll.  In the most recent survey, 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, and 40 percent backed Trump, with 19 percent not decided on either yet, according to the online poll of 1,289 people conducted from Friday to Tuesday. The poll had a credibility interval of about 3 percentage points.  The results reflect a big increase in support for Trump since he knocked out U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich last week to become the last Republican in the White House race.  There was no immediate comment from the Clinton or Trump campaigns.  Clinton, who has all but clinched the Democratic nomination over rival Bernie Sanders, has mostly led Trump in the head-to-head poll this year. Trump briefly matched her support a few times in 2016, most recently in mid-March, after U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a favorite of the Republican establishment, dropped out.

We were disappointed that the bill we saw yesterday wasnt something we could support, and so another few days of back and forth I think will produce something that we can take to the floor, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters.

U.S. House panel cancels plan to introduce Puerto Rico bill,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republicans on a U.S. House of Representatives panel said they were making progress on a Puerto Rico debt relief bill that will take the same basic approach as an earlier failed version, despite cancelling plans to unveil new legislation on Wednesday. The House Natural Resources Committee said more time was needed to refine the bills language. House Democratic leadership now expects legislation from the committee before the end of the week. Competing forces have fought over the bill and raised concerns that creditor rights and long-established municipal bond market hierarchy would be set aside in a broader plan to fix Puerto Ricos festering debt problems that have resulted in a breakdown in the islands social services. The new bill itself already protects existing lawful creditor priorities and liens. The integrity of creditor hierarchy will be preserved, said Parish Braden, spokesman for the Natural Resources Committee said on Wednesday. HNRC Chairman Rob Bishop told Reuters on Monday the bill is still expected to include the installation of an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealths credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan. The introduction (of the bill) is not being delayed due to the underlying foundation of the board, Braden said, adding: There arent hang ups. There are a number of refinements to the bill being made to ensure internal consistency among the titles (of the bill).  One source familiar with the delay said it was due to a need to refine language related to the minimum wage and land-use issues over the island of Vieques. U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday her party could not support the latest legislative effort but still hopes for an agreement within a few days. We were disappointed that the bill we saw yesterday wasnt something we could support, and so another few days of back and forth I think will produce something that we can take to the floor, Pelosi told reporters. Im hoping maybe by Friday, so that we can have something for next week, she added. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its debt and faces an overall bill of $70 billion it cannot pay. A staggering 45 percent poverty rate and increased migration among its 3.5 million citizens to the U.S. mainland drains economic activity. The ranking Democrat on the HNRC issued a statement that said the families on the island needed relief from cuts to public services but remained hopeful a deal is close at hand. We are making progress, but we are not there yet. The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, but a bill that doesnt solve the problem, or doesnt pass, wont help anyone, Ral Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona said. Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the islands main fiscal agent. The May 1 default and the nearly $2 billion July 1 debt payments have spurred congressional activity. (Senator Chuck) Schumer from the Senate is pushing to get something done. But the problem here is that Democrats are going to push for protections for unions and for pensioners and we feel like they should be at the bottom of the heap because thats the way the law states, Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana, a Tea Party favorite and member of the HNRC, told Reuters on Wednesday. I think theres just big divisions on how this goes. But I think the way it was previously set up, its not going to fly, Fleming said. ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1
North Carolina transgender battle could expand civil rights law," (This version of the May 10 story has been corrects to update new name of group to GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders from Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, in the sixth paragraph) By Daniel Trotta and Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - The legal battle over transgender rights between the state of North Carolina and the U.S. government has moved the country closer to settling one of the last frontiers in civil rights law.  At issue is whether transgender people deserve the same federal protections that have been extended to groups such as blacks and religious minorities. Backers of the North Carolina law, which requires people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity, say it will protect women and girls from predators. Transgender advocates say that claim is unfounded and ignores a modern understanding of people who identify with a gender other than the one assigned at birth.  The next step is likely to be a federal judges decision on whether to impose an injunction, or temporary ruling, to void the North Carolina law pending a trial. Regardless of how a judge might rule on an injunction, the case stands to add to a growing body of legal decisions that have tended to side in favor of transgender rights but not enough to dissuade states like North Carolina.  A handful of U.S. states and cities have attempted to enact measures affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, but North Carolina is the first state to focus on transgender peoples use of public bathrooms.    This is absolutely a critical moment in terms of the focus and the answers that will come through these cases about the established scope of protections for transgender people, said Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders. The North Carolina law is the subject of four lawsuits in federal court, two on each side. The U.S. Justice Department and an advocacy group, the American Civil Liberties Union, have each sought to strike it down, saying the law violates the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which jolted a divided nation into applying full rights to African-Americans a century after the abolition of slavery. North Carolinas governor and legislature both sued on Monday to protect their law, saying the Justice Department was trying to strike down a common sense privacy policy meant to protect the states public employees. State officials also said if the Obama administration wants protections for transgender people, it should appeal to Congress to amend existing laws. At least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which covers and employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The issue before the courts is whether sex also applies to gender identity. The Obama administration has taken a firm stance that transgender people are protected, a point that Attorney General Loretta Lynch emphasized on Monday. The entire Obama administration wants you to know that we see you; we stand with you; and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward, Lynch told transgender people in remarks at a news conference.  Lynch also threatened to withhold federal funding to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina while the legal case proceeds. North Carolina stands to lose $4.8 billion in funds, mainly educational grants, if it does not back down from the law, according to an analysis by lawyers at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School. Unless North Carolina backs down, any ruling by a trial judge would likely be challenged and end up in a Virginia-based federal appeals court that only weeks ago issued an important ruling in favor of transgender rights. That court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, said a transgender teen from Virginia could sue his high school for being barred from using the boys bathroom. The court noted that federal education officials have interpreted Title IX to apply to transgender people but did not directly rule on the issue.  So far, only one appeals court has explicitly ruled that the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination against transgender people, in a 2005 case brought by a police officer. At least five other appeals courts have suggested that they agreed, some in cases involving other federal discrimination laws. The U.S. Supreme Court could help settle the matter, but experts said it was unlikely to take up any precedent-setting case any time soon. ",politicsNews,"May 10, 2016 ",1

Bid to stop heavy water purchase from Iran blocked in U.S. Senate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats defeated a Republican effort to undercut the Iran nuclear agreement on Wednesday by blocking an amendment to a spending bill that would have stopped the Obama administration from buying heavy water from Tehran. The amendment to an energy spending bill offered by Republican Senator Tom Cotton received 57 yes votes and 42 no votes. It had needed 60 yes votes to advance in the 100-member Senate. Cotton withdrew his amendment after the vote and the Senate is expected to vote later on a version of the spending bill without it. The measure would have barred the use of U.S. government funds to purchase heavy water, which is non-radioactive and used in nuclear reactors and for making nuclear weapons. Under last years nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and five other world powers, Tehran is responsible for reducing its stock of the substance, which it can sell, dilute or dispose of, under certain conditions.  President Barack Obamas administration had warned Congress that it strongly opposed any move to prevent the planned purchase of $8.6 million-worth of heavy water from Iran. Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans had also banded together in late April to block the Cotton amendment, and hence the spending bill. The dust-up had put a crimp in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells plans to pass bipartisan appropriations bills to keep the federal government functioning beyond Sept. 30, the end of the governments fiscal year.

Clinton loses to Sanders in coal state of West Virginia,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton on Tuesday in West Virginias primary, winning over voters deeply skeptical about the economy and signaling the difficulty Clinton may have in industrial states in the general election. The loss slows Clintons march to the nomination, but she is still heavily favored to become the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 election. In a November match-up with Donald Trump, Clinton will need to win over working-class voters in the U.S. Rust Belt, which includes key states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. Trump, 69, won contests in West Virginia and Nebraska handily on Tuesday. The presumptive Republican nominee is set to meet with party leaders in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, including U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. After Ryan said last week that he was not yet ready to endorse Trump, Trump said on Sunday that he would have to decide whether he still wanted Ryan to preside over the partys July convention. Trump said in a Fox interview on Tuesday night that he would like Ryan to chair the convention as planned. Hes a very good man, he wants whats good for the party, the New York billionaire said. Trump has zeroed in on Clintons protracted battle with Sanders, a 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont. He has taunted Clinton in recent days by saying she cant close the deal by beating Sanders, her only rival for the Democratic Partys nomination since Feb. 1. Clinton, 68, has said she will ignore Trumps personal insults, including his repeated use of his new nickname for her, Crooked Hillary, and instead will criticize his policy pronouncements. Deep concerns about the economy underscored West Virginias Democratic primary. Roughly six in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the U.S. economy in the next few years. The same proportion cited the economy and jobs was their most important voting issue, according to a preliminary ABC News exit poll. A remark Clinton made at an Ohio town hall in March that the country would put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business at an Ohio town hall in a comment may have hurt her with voters in coal-mining states such as West Virginia. During Clintons visit to West Virginia and Ohio last week she repeatedly apologized to displaced coal and steel workers for her comment, which she said had been taken out of context, and discussed her plan to help retrain coal workers for clean energy jobs. To secure the Democratic nomination, a candidate needs 2,383 delegates. Going into West Virginia, Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, had 2,228 delegates, including 523 so-called superdelegates, elite party members who are free to support any candidate. Sanders had 1,454 delegates, including 39 superdelegates. Another 29 delegates will be apportioned based on West Virginias results. Clinton and Sanders will compete in another primary contest on May 17. Both candidates are also looking ahead to the June 7 contests, the last in the long nominating season, in which nearly 700 delegates are at stake, including 475 in California, where Sanders is now focusing his efforts. Sanders has vowed to take his campaign all the way to the Democrats July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia, and wants a say in shaping the partys platform.  Sanders has repeatedly told supporters at packed rallies that most opinion polls indicate he would beat Trump in a general election match-up by a larger margin than polls show Clinton defeating Trump. Trump, shifting into general election mode, has already begun to consider running mates. He told Fox on Tuesday night that he has narrowed his list to five people. He did not rule out picking New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former rival who ended his presidential bid in February. Christie, who endorsed Trump and then campaigned for him, on Monday was named to head Trumps White House transition team.

"Trump to offer views on law and order, judges in speeches: NYT","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump will present his views on law and order and the judiciary in separate policy speeches in coming weeks, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. Trumps speech on judges is planned in part to respond to unease among some conservatives that the billionaire real estate developer can be trusted with Supreme Court appointments, the Times said. Senate Republicans have blocked President Barack Obamas nomination of centrist appellate judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. With the ideological balance of the court at stake, the Republicans have said they want Obamas successor to fill the courts vacancy, hoping their party wins the White House. Representatives for Trumps campaign could not be immediately reached to confirm the speeches. Trump last week said he would consider wonderful, conservative, good, solid, brilliant judges in the form of Scalia to nominate to the Supreme Court, and plans to offer a list of potential nominees by July.  Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News on Wednesday he was considering tapping former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to lead a commission to study his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering in the United States. Well figure it out and we will get it going, but we have to be extremely careful, Trump said. His campaign acknowledged this month that Trump is planning several policy speeches following his address last month explaining his foreign policy views. Trump offered few details in that April 27 speech in Washington but repeatedly vowed to put America first. Trump effectively clinched the Republican Partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election last week. His planned remarks on law and order may offer more details on his views on issues including freedom of speech and police use of force. His large and raucous rallies often have drawn protesters and on occasion have been marred by violence. Trump has called protesters thugs and expressed regret that he and police officers could not respond to them more aggressively. Trump has called for increased law enforcement surveillance of mosques in the United States and has said he would use an executive order to impose the death penalty for anyone who killed a police officer. Nineteen states do not allow the death penalty under state law. He has endorsed the use of waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning, and a lot more on terrorism suspects. Critics call waterboarding torture. Obama, a Democrat, banned its use days after taking office in 2009. ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2016 ",1
"Cruz returns to Washington, warns of 'volcanic anger'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz returned to his job in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday with a warning to Washington that the turbulent primary race was a wake-up call. All across this country people are hungry for change. This election cycle should be a wake-up call to Washington, D.C., the senator from Texas said outside his office. The frustration and volcanic anger with Washington was echoed throughout this election. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders have upended expectations in their respective presidential campaigns, tapping into voter anger at establishment politicians in Washington. Cruz, a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, also tried to position himself as an outsider.  However, he dropped out of the Republican race a week ago after a crushing loss in Indiana and a brutal campaign in which Trump attacked Cruzs wife and father and constantly derided the senator as Lyin Ted. Cruz ruled out a third-party candidacy, and said the democratic process had run its course. Earlier on Tuesday, Cruz welcomed the idea of tossing his hat back into the ring in a lighthearted exchange with a staunch supporter, conservative radio host Glenn Beck.  Beck, who campaigned heavily for Cruz in the senators quest for the Republican nomination, asked the 45-year-old Texan whether he would consider getting back into the race if he won Nebraskas primary on Tuesday. I am not holding my breath, Cruz said to laughter on Becks show on TheBlaze Radio Network. My assumption is that that will not happen. ... The reason we suspended the race last week is with Indianas loss I didnt see a viable path to victory.  If that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly. Trumps victory in Indiana last Tuesday pushed Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich out of the Republican race and put the brakes on the Stop Trump movements sparked by his unorthodox candidacy.  Trump campaign adviser Sam Clovis dismissed the possibility of Cruz re-entering the race as highly unlikely. I think if Ted has a future in Republican politics in this country, I think hell want to preserve that, Clovis told CNN. Cruz may be hoping to put his conservative imprint on the partys July 18-21 national convention in Cleveland. On Monday, he said he would not release delegates he had won in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, according to news reports.  Trump needs 1,237 delegates, a majority of the delegates at the convention, to clinch the nomination on the first ballot, and it is not guaranteed he will win them in the remaining nominating contests. Asked if he would endorse Trump, Cruz said every voter needs to make their own choice and they do not need to make it now. The Republican convention isnt for another two-and-a-half months; the election isnt for another six months, the senator said. I think we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do.

Trump says he has narrowed potential running mate picks to five or six: AP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he had narrowed his potential vice presidential choices to five or six experienced politicians, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, told AP in an interview that he had not ruled out New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former rival now supporting Trumps bid for the White House. I have a list of people that I would like, Trump was quoted as saying, adding he wanted his running mate to have political experience to help him with legislation, getting things through Washington if he wins the Nov. 8 presidential election. The New York billionaire businessman also said choosing someone who previously held elected office would make it easier to do background checks, in part because that person would have already been checked out by voters, the news media and to some extent, the government, according to the AP. For the most part, theyve been vetted over the last 20 years, it quoted him as saying.  Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is heading up the vetting effort, a campaign aide said on Tuesday. The vetting group includes former rival Ben Carson and Trump himself, the AP quoted the billionaire businessman as saying. ",politicsNews,"May 10, 2016 ",1
"Obama to visit Hiroshima, will not apologize for World War Two bombing","WASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Barack Obama will become the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima in Japan later this month, but he will not apologize for the United States dropping of an atomic bomb on the city at the end of World War Two, the White House said on Tuesday. Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize early in his presidency in 2009 in part for making nuclear nonproliferation a centerpiece of his agenda, Obama on May 27 will tour the site of the worlds first nuclear bombing with Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  With the end of his last term in office approaching in January, Obama will highlight his continued commitment to pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons, the White House said in a statement. He will not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb at the end of World War II. Instead, he will offer a forward-looking vision focused on our shared future, Ben Rhodes, Obamas deputy national security adviser, wrote in a separate blog. The visit comes as part of a May 21-28 swing through Asia, which will include a Group of Seven summit in Japan and his first trip to Vietnam. The Asia trip seeks to reinforce his geopolitical pivot toward the region, though friends and allies there have sometimes questioned Washingtons commitment. The Hiroshima tour will symbolize a new level of reconciliation between former wartime enemies who are now close allies. It will also underscore Obamas efforts to improve U.S.-Japan ties, marked by an Asia-Pacific trade pact as well as cooperation against Chinas pursuit of maritime claims and the nuclear threat from North Korea. On the final day of the summit in Japan, Obama and Abe will visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park near the spot where a U.S. warplane dropped an atomic bomb 71 years ago. The decision to go to Hiroshima was hotly debated within the White House. There were concerns a U.S. presidential visit would be heavily criticized in the United States if it were seen as an apology. The bomb dropped on Aug. 6, 1945 killed thousands of people instantly and about 140,000 by the end of that year. Another was dropped on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, and Japan surrendered six days later. The majority of Americans view the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as justified to end the war and save U.S lives. Most Japanese see it as unjustified. Obamas press secretary Josh Earnest said it was an entirely legitimate line of inquiry for historians when asked why the White House had decided not to use his Hiroshima visit to issue an apology. He told reporters that while Obama understands the United States bears a special responsibility as the only country to use nuclear weapons in wartime, the president will emphasize Washingtons responsibility to lead the world in an effort to eliminate them. Abe, speaking to reporters in Tokyo, said he hoped to turn this into an opportunity for the U.S. and Japan to together pay tribute to the memories of the victims of the nuclear bombing.  President Obama visiting Hiroshima and expressing toward the world the reality of the impact of nuclear radiation will contribute greatly to establishing a world without nuclear arms, Abe added. Obamas visit will be a symbolic capstone for the nuclear disarmament agenda he laid out in a landmark speech in Prague in 2009. His aides tout last years Iran nuclear deal as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy. But Obama has made only modest progress toward securing the worlds loose nuclear materials, and there is no guarantee his White House successor will keep the issue a high priority. Lisbeth Gronlund, co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists Global Security Program, said Obama must do more  than give another beautiful speech and should announce concrete action on nuclear disarmament when he visits Hiroshima. After U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Hiroshima last month, survivors of the bombing and other residents said that if Obama visits, they hope for progress in ridding the world of nuclear weapons, rather than an apology.

London's mayor an exception to proposed ban on Muslims: Trump,"WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, suggested he would make an exception for Londons newly elected Muslim mayor, the New York Times reported. However, Sadiq Khan who was sworn in as mayor of the British capital on Saturday, dismissed Trumps response, saying the real estate billionaire and presumptive Republican nominee had an ignorant view of Islam. There will always be exceptions, the Times on Monday quoted Trump as saying when asked how his controversial proposal would apply to Khan, the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver and a seamstress. Trump said he was happy to see Khan elected, the Times reported, adding: You lead by example, always lead by example. If he does a good job ... that would be a terrific thing. Trump put forth the idea of the ban after deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Paris and California last year. Muslim and human rights groups, Trumps Democratic rivals and many of his Republican presidential opponents condemned the proposal as divisive, counter-productive and contrary to American values. Khan said Trumps view risked alienating mainstream Muslims and played into the hands of extremists, making both Britain and the United States less secure. This isnt just about me - its about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world, he said in a statement on Tuesday. Donald Trump and those around him think that Western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam - London has proved him wrong. Khan, 45, a candidate from the opposition Labour Party, defeated his Conservative rival by a record margin last week to secure the biggest individual mandate in British political history after an acrimonious campaign. After his victory, he accused his opponents of using fear and innuendo about his alleged links to extremists to turn ethnic and religious groups against each other, which he described as something straight out of the Donald Trump playbook. In an interview with Time magazine, Khan said he wanted to go to the United States to see the interesting programmes the mayors of New York and Chicago were implementing, but that he would have to visit before January in case Trump won the Nov. 8 election.

Former Illinois congressman requests to plead guilty in tax case,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Mel Reynolds, a former U.S. congressman from Illinois who has had numerous legal troubles, wants to plead guilty to federal income tax charges, he told a judge in a handwritten letter made public on Tuesday. I request to come to court at the earliest time possible to enter my plea of guilty, he wrote on notebook paper to U.S. District Judge John Darrah. The letter was written last week and entered in the courts on-line filings on Tuesday.  Reynolds, 64, is being held at a detention center in Kankakee, Illinois. He said he has no choice but to plead guilty because he has been unable to prepare for his case because he has been in solitary confinement due to death threats.  Reynolds is representing himself after firing his lawyer in April. His next court date is a status hearing scheduled for May 19, and his trial is scheduled to begin June 20.  Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, declined to comment on the court filing. Reynolds was arrested by U.S. marshals last month at an Atlanta airport for violating the conditions of his pretrial release after he arrived from South Africa. Reynolds pleaded not guilty in July to misdemeanor charges of failing to file income tax returns for 2009 through 2012. He was indicted in June and faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine for each of the four counts against him. A Rhodes scholar and one-time promising star of the Democratic Party, Reynolds was first elected to Congress in 1992. In August of 1994, he was indicted for having a relationship with a 16-year-old campaign worker but was re-elected in 1994 in his Chicago district without opposition. The case ended with a conviction on sexual assault and child pornography charges in 1995 and Reynolds resigned. Before his scheduled release from prison in 1997, Reynolds was convicted of bank fraud and misusing campaign funds for personal use and sentenced to serve additional time. He was released in 2001. Reynolds tried politics again but in 2013 lost a bid for the U.S. House of Representatives seat of Jesse Jackson Jr., who had resigned before pleading guilty to fraud charges.

White House prods Senate on Garland amid Republican blockade,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House pressed forward on Tuesday with its uphill battle to win Senate confirmation of President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee, providing senators Merrick Garlands voluminous responses to questions about his background. The 141 pages of answers to standard questions posed to U.S. Supreme Court nominees, plus another 2,066 pages of appendices, filled six boxes that were wheeled into the U.S. Capitol building for reporters to see. Now that we have this, lets have some confirmation hearings. We have never in my lifetime had a time when theres been a nominee for Supreme Court justice (that) they havent been offered a hearing, said Senator Patrick Leahy, the 76-year-old top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senate Republicans have blocked consideration of Garland, the centrist federal appeals court judge nominated by the Democratic president in March, saying Obamas successor should fill the courts vacancy left by the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia. White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the questionnaire provided to the Senate an exhaustive picture of Judge Garlands distinguished career and impeccable credentials.  The questionnaire has become a tradition for Supreme Court nominees as part of the confirmation process. The process is anything but traditional this time around because of the Republican blockade, but at least three Judiciary Committee Republicans said they would read through Garlands material. One of them, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, said if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins the presidency on Nov. 8, the Senate should confirm Garland during a post-election legislative session before she takes office in January. While Flake said a conservative jurist should replace Scalia, Garland could be a better alternative than a potentially more liberal nominee from Clinton. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Most of us (Senate Republicans) believe Trump would appoint somebody more conservative than Hillary would, Flake said, adding, Id like to be more sure of that. Some Republicans are not sold on Trumps conservative credentials. Garlands material provided insights into what the 63-year-old judge views as his career highlights. Garland cited a 2008 ruling he authored backing a Chinese Uighur detained at the Guantanamo Bay prison, and a 2015 ruling in which his appeals court upheld a long-standing ban on U.S. government contractors making campaign contributions in federal elections. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, asked whether the White House should withdraw Garlands nomination if Clinton wins, allowing her to make her own pick, responded: I think hed be a great addition to the court. Hes a consensus nominee. And I am a Garland man. ",politicsNews,"May 10, 2016 ",1
New Jersey judge orders naming of Bridgegate scandal co-conspirators,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in New Jersey on Tuesday ordered the release of a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the criminal case against two former allies of Republican Governor Chris Christie in a 2013 scandal involving lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark ruled in favor of several media organizations that sought the list, saying the public interest in seeing names linked to Bridgegate outweighed the privacy interests of those named. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman had opposed the release, citing the potential harm to reputations and privacy, and saying the co-conspirator designation will become relevant, if at all only at trial. A spokesman for Fishman declined to comment. Last May, Fishmans office unveiled criminal charges against Bridget Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The defendants were accused of wire fraud and civil rights deprivation for arranging the September 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey, allegedly to punish the Democratic mayor there for not endorsing Christies successful reelection bid. The closures snarled traffic for several days, causing big delays for drivers and hurting local businesses. Kelly and Baroni have pleaded not guilty. David Wildstein, another former Port Authority official, pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges. Christie has not been charged, and has denied involvement in wrongdoing. In her decision, Wigenton said the scandal has received such extensive media coverage that very little remained private. She also called it likely that anyone on the list would be a public employee, or an elected or appointed official. Although privacy for third-parties is indeed important, this court is satisfied that the privacy interests of uncharged third parties are insufficiently compelling to outweigh the publics right of access, she wrote. Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for the media companies, on Tuesday asked the judge for the immediate release of the list. Christie made an unsuccessful run for the White House this year. He was chosen on Monday to lead the White House transition team for Donald Trump, the only candidate left in the race to be the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

"Sanders plan raises incomes but also U.S. deficits, analysts say","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders tax and benefit plans would raise income for most Americans but his proposal for single-payer healthcare would help generate record federal deficits, two Washington think tanks said on Monday.  An analysis by the Tax Policy Center said that although most people would pay higher taxes under Sanders plan, the average household income would increase by nearly $4,300 in 2017 after his proposed benefits were factored in.  Those benefits include an expansion of the Social Security government pension plan, paid family leave and free tuition at public colleges, ideas that have generated support for Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, as he seeks to become the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Only the wealthiest 5 percent of households would end up paying more in new taxes than they got back in benefits, according to the center, a joint effort run by two Washington-based think tanks, the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. But Sanders plans would also increase federal deficits to unprecedented levels, the center said, relying largely on a new estimate of the cost of his healthcare proposals published on Monday in a separate analysis by the Urban Institute.  Sanders has proposed a single-payer healthcare system, a more significant overhaul than the tweaks that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton wants to make to the Affordable Care Act, a signature policy achievement of Democratic President Barack Obama. The Urban Institute estimated Sanders healthcare plan would require an increase in federal spending of $32 trillion over the next decade but that new revenue sources proposed by Sanders only covered just under half of that amount.  The overall result would be an increase in annual federal budget deficits by $18 trillion over the next decade, the Tax Policy Center said.  Warren Gunnels, Sanders policy director, called the new cost estimate wildly overestimated in a statement on Monday. He said the analyses were wrong to assume that state and local governments would stop their own spending on healthcare, thereby shifting $4.1 trillion in costs to the federal government.  Gunnels said the reports also underestimated what the Sanders campaign forecast would be trillions of dollars in savings in administration, paperwork and drug prices seen in other Western countries with single-payer systems. The Sanders campaign has estimated that his proposed healthcare system would save more than $6 trillion over the next 10 years, compared with the current system. ",politicsNews,"May 9, 2016 ",1
Commentary: Party leaders often disliked their nominee. It’s the public vitriol that’s new.,"GOP leaders have unleashed a stunning level of vitriol against their partys most successful presidential candidate.  House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), emphatically declared last week that he was not ready to endorse Donald Trump, his partys presumptive presidential nominee. This move was unprecedented in modern American history. Trumps response was that Ryan may need to be replaced as head of the Republican National Convention.  Ryans rebuke reminds Americans that Trump is deeply unpopular, particularly among a significant number of powerful Republicans. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney belittled the GOPs new leader as a moral cretin unfit to be the standard bearer. Former President George W. Bush and his father, President George H.W. Bush, both say they are not attending the GOP convention in Cleveland.  Such attacks, however, are nothing new.  Political elders have lambasted their partys leading presidential contenders throughout U.S. history. The big difference now is that this battle is playing out in public. In the past, attacks were largely in party backrooms, behind closed doors.  To be sure, some serious breaks have been acted out in public. With dire results. President Theodore Roosevelt, for example, realized in 1912 that his progressive agenda was being abandoned by his chosen successor, William Howard Taft. TR challenged Taft in the Republican primaries. We stand at Armageddon, Roosevelt thundered at the convention, and we battle for the Lord!  When Taft prevailed, Roosevelt bolted the party. He ran as a third-party candidate in 1912 on a Progressive Party ticket. Ultimately, the Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson, won.  In most other cases, however, the internecine bloodletting took place in private, preserving the appearance of party unity and making it easier to heal any rifts.  The 1944 Republican nominee Thomas Dewey ignored former President Herbert Hoover at an important state funeral that October and drew the national leaders ire. Dewey has no inner reservoir of knowledge on which to draw for his thinking. Hoover sneered to a friend. A man couldnt wear a mustache like that without having it affect his mind.  Hoover, though, sought to keep his beliefs private  Former presidents have kept mum even when they see a nominee as a threat to their legacy. In 1964, for example, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower didnt have much regard for Senator Barry Goldwater. The conservative firebrand had repudiated Eisenhowers presidency as a dime-store New Deal. Nonetheless, Eisenhower gave only halting support to the partys anti-Goldwater forces. Despite Eisenhowers contempt, the Arizonan became the Republican nominee, only to lose in a landslide to President Lyndon B. Johnson.  Four years earlier, the Democratic power brokers were not as reticent. They viewed Senator John F. Kennedy, their partys leading candidate in 1960, as too conservative and inexperienced. They disliked the campaign role of Joseph Kennedy, JFKs father, and his controversial past. In addition, party leaders worried that JFK could not win national office because he was a Catholic.  During the primaries, Truman, the titular head of the party, told a TV news conference that a nominee should have the greatest possible maturity and experience -- a clear dig at JFKs relative youth. The former president beseeched his party to hold a brokered convention and find a way to avoid nominating Kennedy. Eventually, however, Truman endorsed Kennedy in the general election, reasoning that GOP nominee Richard M. Nixon was worse  Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956, also refused to back Kennedy during the primary. Even Kennedys promise to name Stevenson as secretary of state could not persuade him.  Still, most of the party elders scathing criticism against JFK was confined to backroom conversations. Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who also wanted the nomination, privately mocked Kennedy as a scrawny little fellow with rickets. Johnson urged Eisenhower to oppose Kennedy during the primary contest, calling him a [Senate] nobody and a dangerous man.  But Johnsons efforts to stop Kennedy were not aired before the country in real time. In fact, 1960 demonstrated how the Democratic elders were able to prevent serious rifts from destroying their partys chances. After securing the nomination, JFK offered  and LBJ accepted  the second slot on the ticket.  The resentment of party elders toward party nominees was often rooted in a sense that the candidate was repudiating a mentors record. In the 1960 GOP presidential race, for example, Eisenhower resented Vice President Nixons implication that he would offer more robust leadership. Close to Election Day, Ike was asked to name an instance when Nixons advice influenced a presidential decision. If you give me a week, Eisenhower replied, I might think of one.  In the reverse situation, Vice President Al Gore sought to distance himself from President Bill Clinton during the 2000 presidential campaign. Gore declared in his announcement that he would provide moral leadership and defend the American family  not-so-subtle knocks against Clintons sexual relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The bitterness between the two men festered and Gore never asked Clinton to campaign with him. After Gore lost to George W. Bush, Clinton upbraided his former vice president for running a lame, visionless campaign.  The current spectacle  in which former Senator Bob Dole will likely be the only past Republican presidential nominee to come to the convention and endorse the partys standard bearer  is partly a function of Trumps scorched-earth multi-media campaign. His attacks have been leveled personally, in real-time, via Twitter and cable news. Wounds are deeper, and could be harder to heal.  Trumps presidential primary campaign is the apotheosis of the anti-Washington mood that has gripped presidential politics since Jimmy Carters 1976 White House run. One reason Trump vanquished his foes was because he ran against the GOPs leadership as out-of-touch and inept.  This played out even as party elders have less power to shape national tickets  and outsiders more ability to tear down anything that smacks of Washington politics-as-usual.  Republican-on-Republican hits on Trump and his main rival, Ted Cruz, have contributed to the fraying of the GOP. The anti-Trump former presidents, as well as current and former party chairmen and congressional leaders, have much at stake. They are fighting for, as they see it, their legacies, their partys future, their professional identities  and their own power.  In recent decades, party elders have been clinging to an increasingly tenuous position. Think former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who lost a primary election, as Sarah Palin recently noted. Or former House Speaker John Boehner, who was unable to control his partys Tea Party wing. Boehner is still so incensed that he called Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) Lucifer in the flesh. As we are seeing now with Ryan, Trumps ferocious public attacks could yet come back to haunt him. Unlike so many past presidential primaries, this rift might prove irreparable.

Campaign chief to oversee Trump U.S. vice presidential search,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, will oversee the presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominees search for a running mate, a campaign aide said on Tuesday. Lewandowski last week took over the vice presidential selection process and is drawing up a list of potential candidates and speaking with Republican Party figures, two top Republicans told the Washington Post, which first reported the move. The two Republicans said they expected lawyers or a law firm to help vet Trumps short list of candidates, the Post reported. The Trump campaign aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Lewandowski is leading the effort but would not elaborate. Trump has said he is considering some of his former rivals for the Republican nomination. But some already have ruled themselves out or declared they will not support the billionaire businessman. One of those was U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who on Monday sought to quash speculation he might emerge as the running mate, saying he still has deep reservations about Trump. Trump has bristled at Republicans who publicly have taken themselves out of the running. The day after Rubios announcement, Trump wrote in a Twitter post, It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position. Trump has said he plans to select a Republican with political experience as his choice for vice president. Lewandowski has been part of Trumps inner circle since the beginning of his candidacy. Other Trump senior advisers, including Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, will concentrate on the campaigns national field operation and planning for the Republican National Convention in July, the Post said. Lewandowski has generated controversy during Trumps campaign for president. He was hit in March with a misdemeanor battery charge relating to an incident involving a female reporter, but prosecutors in Floridas Palm Beach County last month decided not to prosecute Lewandowski.

House to introduce Puerto Rico crisis bill on Wednesday: Rep. Bishop,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee said on Monday legislation to address Puerto Ricos growing debt and humanitarian crisis will be introduced for discussion on Wednesday, with a committee vote a week later. Earlier attempts at introducing a bill out of the committee failed to gain enough attention or understanding among lawmakers, prompting its chairman, Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican, to delay and rework the bill. The basic premise of installing an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealths credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan remains in place. What we are seeing in Puerto Rico is if you push it off, the situation gets worse, the debt gets worse, the humanitarian crisis gets worse. If you dont want a bailout and you put it off long enough, you probably will be forced into a position of being in a bailout and Im not going to vote for that, Bishop said. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its debt and faces an overall bill of $70 billion it cannot pay. A staggering 45 percent poverty rate and increased migration of citizens to the U.S. mainland drains economic activity. Bishop said the changes to the bill were relatively small and that the U.S. Treasury has been marvelous to work with in developing the plan. Obviously the relationship between the Obama administration and this Congress has not been warm and fuzzy. So this is unusual in the amount of help they have given us, Bishop said, adding: At the same time I want it finished. I want them to actually sign off and in some of the small areas, I think they have been dragging their feet. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew visited a Puerto Rican school and hospital on Monday where teachers, nurses and doctors described and showed dire conditions due to the lack of funding. Lew later told reporters he had not seen the latest language in the draft bill, but that the Treasury has provided technical advice. He said it was up to the committee to decide when to release the legislation. I hope Congress does not, as it sometimes does, try to find that last possible moment and miss it, Lew said. Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the islands main fiscal agent. However, some of the GDBs major creditors are forgoing lawsuits for at least a month after reaching a tentative restructuring deal with the bank. If we dont get a bill passed, then lawsuits are going to be coming fast and furiously, Bishop said. The May 1 default and the nearly $2 billion July 1 debt payments have spurred congressional activity. The goal being that everyone eventually gets paid. And who is first in the line is maybe not as important as the fact that at the end of the day everyone has the chance to be treated fairly and will get their investment back, Bishop said. Lew, in his remarks, added that the bill will have to take into account many stakeholders, not just bondholders. The interests of retirees on the island have to be balanced, not treated necessarily equally, but balanced, Lew said, adding that television advertisements calling the legislation a bailout crossed the line and are deceptive. Puerto Ricos government has said it has not asked for a taxpayer-led bailout, nor has one been offered. While the legislation will include bankruptcy language, it is not a stealthy way around a prohibition for Puerto Rico to use the U.S. bankruptcy code to restructure its debt, Bishop said. We are putting this language in the code that deals specifically with the territories. So everything we do has got to have that firewall between that which will have an impact on the states versus what is there in the territory. ",politicsNews,"May 9, 2016 ",1
Trump retreats on comments on raising taxes on the wealthy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump backtracked on Monday on his remarks about raising taxes on wealthy Americans, saying the rich might simply get a smaller tax cut than he originally proposed. Trump walked away from his Sunday comment that taxes on the wealthy would go up once his broad tax policy proposals, which include tax cuts for rich Americans, were negotiated with Congress. That appeared to be a break with traditional Republican support for lower taxes in all income brackets. On Monday, Trump said he did not mean to imply he was willing to raise taxes for people in higher-income brackets from their current level, but was referring to potential adjustments to his own tax policy proposal. I may have to increase it on the wealthy - Im not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class, Trump said on CNN. Now, if I increase it on the wealthy, that means theyre still going to be paying less than they are paying now. Im talking about increasing it from my (original) tax proposal. The proposal, released in September, included broad tax breaks for businesses and households, with the highest income tax rate cut to 25 percent from the current 39.6 percent. Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, said on Monday that lowering taxes on the middle class and businesses was his priority. Im not talking about a tax increase. Im talking about a tremendous tax decrease, OK? Trump said on the Fox Business Network. He said proposals always changed in negotiations with Congress but that he was committed to cutting taxes. The contradictory statements came as Trump began pivoting to a general election race against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election last week after his last two rivals dropped out of the race. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Bush administration official who also advised Republican John McCain during his failed 2008 presidential run, said Trump was trying to make his economic plans add up. Hes gone from wildly unrealistic to impenetrable on the subject of taxes, Holtz-Eakin said, adding that Trumps comments about the outcome of possible negotiations with Congress makes me confused as to what he really wants. Trump did win support from influential anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who said on CNBC on Monday that some people with a lot of tax credits might see some increase, but that rates would drop overall under Trumps plan. Hes made it very clear he wants lower taxes, Norquist said. Trumps tax cut would be a tax cut for every American. Norquists group, Americans for Tax Reform, asks all Republican candidates to sign a no-new-taxes pledge, but Trump has not signed one yet. Norquist said he was confident the candidate would sign, given his public comments. The Clinton campaign was happy to take Trump at his word that he planned to cut wealthy Americans taxes. It cited an analysis of Trumps proposal by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimating it would give the wealthiest Americans an average annual boost of more than $1.3 million a year. This is a tax plan by the billionaire for the billionaires, Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan said. And after some confusing comments over the weekend, he actually doubled down today on the fact that his tax plan would have massive cuts for the wealthy. Who knows what hell say tomorrow? Trump also sought on Monday to clarify comments he made last week about the U.S. debt. He said he never espoused restructuring or defaulting on government debt but would buy it back at a discount if interest rates go up. He should stop talking about the debt because he hasnt said anything that makes any sense yet, Holtz-Eakin said. Trumps candidacy has opened a rift in the Republican Party, with many leaders appalled by his rhetoric on immigrants, Muslims and women and concerned that some policy positions such as his opposition to free trade run counter to Republican orthodoxy. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who said last week he was not yet ready to endorse Trump, said on Monday he would step down as co-chairman of the July 18-21 Republican National Convention if Trump wants him to. Trump on Sunday did not rule out pushing Ryan out from the speakers traditional role as convention chairman. Ryan and Trump will meet on Thursday to try to iron out their differences. Later on Thursday, the candidate will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other members of the Senate Republican leadership, a Senate Republican aide said on Monday. Trump said on Monday that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former presidential rival who endorsed his candidacy shortly after dropping out of the race, would lead his White House transition team. Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another vanquished presidential rival, sought on Monday to quash speculation he might emerge as the vice presidential running mate for Trump, saying he still had deep reservations about the former reality television star.

U.S. government and North Carolina escalate legal fight over transgender law,"WASHINGTON/WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A fight between the Obama administration and North Carolina over a state law limiting public bathroom access for transgender people escalated on Monday as both sides sued each other, trading accusations of civil rights violations and government overreach. The U.S. Justice Departments complaint asked a federal district court in North Carolina to declare that the state is violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. Hours earlier, North Carolinas Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and the states secretary of public safety sued the agency in a different federal court in North Carolina, accusing it of baseless and blatant overreach. The so-called bathroom law, passed in March and known as HB 2, prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their biological sex. It has thrust North Carolina into the center of a national debate over equality and privacy, and has now led the state into what could be a long and costly legal battle with the U.S. government. Americans are divided over how public restrooms should be used by transgender people, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify.       By passing the law, North Carolina became the first state in the country to ban people from using multiple occupancy restrooms or changing rooms in public buildings and schools that do not match the sex on their birth certificate. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Monday the department retains the option of curtailing federal funding to North Carolina unless it backs down. None of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity and insists that a person pretend to be something or someone that they are not, Lynch said at a news conference, comparing the measure to Jim Crow-era racial discrimination laws and bans on same-sex marriage. Lynch said the department is monitoring other U.S. jurisdictions that have passed or considered laws similar to North Carolinas but declined to say whether the agency was planning any action against them.      White House spokesman Josh Earnest called the North Carolina law mean-spirited but McCrory said in his complaint that it is common sense privacy policy. North Carolina Republicans say the law stops men from posing as transgender to gain access to womens restrooms.     North Carolina stands to lose $4.8 billion in funds, mainly educational grants, if it does not back down, according to an analysis by lawyers at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School. The Justice Departments complaint named the state of North Carolina, McCrory, the states Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina system as defendants. The 17-campus University of North Carolina system says it takes federal non-discrimination laws very seriously but must also adhere to state laws like HB 2.     In these circumstances, the University is truly caught in the middle, UNC President Margaret Spellings said. McCrory told reporters that North Carolina had been forced to pass the law after the Charlotte city council passed an ordinance that allowed transgender people access to bathrooms based on gender identity in public and private buildings.   Were taking the Obama admin to court. Theyre bypassing Congress, attempting to rewrite law & policies for the whole country, not just NC, McCrory wrote on Twitter.   The Republican leaders of North Carolinas state legislature also sued the U.S. government over the law on Monday, hours after McCrorys lawsuit. The law is also being challenged in federal district court by critics including the American Civil Liberties Union.    ",politicsNews,"May 9, 2016 ",1
California Assembly passes gender-neutral restroom bill,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A bill requiring all single-occupancy public restrooms to be open to anyone regardless of gender or gender identity passed the California Assembly on Monday, and will proceed to the state Senate. The most populous U.S. state already bars discrimination against transgender people, including in public restrooms. The measure by state Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat from San Francisco, goes farther, saying that single-use restrooms should not be reserved for one sex. Restrooms are a necessity of life, making equal access to them a civil rights issue, Ting said in a press statement. The measure passed on a 55-19 vote. A date has not been set for the Senate to consider the bill. Supporters have said that in addition to protecting transgender or gender fluid people, the bill would also cut down waiting time at single-occupancy public restrooms by allowing anyone to use facilities previously reserved for men or women. The bill came during a nationwide furor over a law passed by the state of North Carolina requiring people to use restrooms consistent with their biological sex. On Monday, a fight between the Obama administration and North Carolina over that law escalated as both sides sued each other, trading accusations of civil rights violations and government overreach.  The U.S. Justice Departments complaint asked a federal district court in North Carolina to declare that the state is violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. North Carolinas Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and the states secretary of public safety sued the U.S. agency in a different federal court in North Carolina, accusing it of baseless and blatant overreach.

Supreme Court nominee to submit questionnaire to lawmakers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamas nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, will submit a filled-out questionnaire and other information to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to spur a vote on his nomination, the White House said. The questionnaire and associated materials present an exhaustive picture of Judge Garlands distinguished career and impeccable credentials as a nominee to the Supreme Court, White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said in an emailed statement on Monday. Republican Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has refused to hold hearings on Garlands nomination. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to act on Obamas pick, saying whoever wins the Nov. 8 presidential election should choose a nominee to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. The White House declined to release Garlands questionnaire on Monday. It repeated its call for the Senate to hold a hearing on his nomination once lawmakers had reviewed the new information. Every nominee since 1875 who wasnt withdrawn from consideration has received a hearing and/or a vote, Hoffine said. With more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history and a long record of public service, we expect the Senate will give Chief Judge Garland the same fair consideration as prior nominees.

Republican Rubio distances himself from Trump VP talk,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Marco Rubio on Monday sought to quash speculation that he might emerge as the vice presidential running mate for Republican candidate Donald Trump, saying he still has deep reservations about the billionaire. He will be best served by a running mate and by surrogates who fully embrace his campaign. As such, I have never sought, will not seek and do not want to be considered for vice president, Rubio said in a statement. Rubio, a former Republican presidential candidate himself, and Trump clashed repeatedly in the weeks leading up to the bitterly contested primary vote in Rubios home state of Florida in March. Trump had dismissed Rubio as little Marco and won the state handily, dealing a death blow to Rubios campaign. Rubio had blasted Trump as a con artist who is not a conservative. While Republican voters have chosen Donald Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee, my previously stated reservations about his campaign and concerns with many of his policies remain unchanged, Rubio said. GOP, short for Grand Old Party, is an acronym for the Republican Party. A former Trump campaign rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, is leading Trumps search for a vice presidential running mate. Trump has said he is considering a variety of his former rivals for the nomination, but some have ruled themselves out or declared they will not support him. Rubio said he plans to focus his attention in the run-up to the Nov. 8 helping Republicans hang on to control of the Senate and electing principled conservatives across the country.

White House: Puerto Rico debt crisis could hamper Zika response,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday it was concerned the debt crisis confronting Puerto Rico could hamper its ability to deal with the potential public health crisis caused by the spread of the Zika virus, which has sickened nearly people 700 on the island. Given the fact that there are reported cases of the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, this seems like a pretty bad time for investments in Puerto Ricos public health system to be cut, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a news briefing.

Trump picks NJ Governor Christie to head transition team,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday he has chosen New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a rival turned ally, to lead his White House transition team as he prepares for the general election campaign. Governor Christie is an extremely knowledgeable and loyal person with the tools and resources to put together an unparalleled Transition Team, one that will be prepared to take over the White House when we win in November, Trump said in a statement.  Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 presidential election, said Christie will oversee an extensive team. Christie endorsed Trump after dropping out of the 2016 Republican primary race in February and has been campaigning with the New York billionaire. Trumps campaign said the candidate was moving into a general election mode and implementing an infrastructure capable of securing a victory including making key hires, building a finance operation to benefit the Republican Party and unifying the party by working with several Republican leaders now voicing their support for Mr. Trump and his candidacy.

Democrats gird for fight with Trump in U.S. Rust Belt states,"CLEVELAND/NEW YORK - Bracing for a general election fight with Donald Trump, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and her allies are putting resources into industrial states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania to try to block Trump from making inroads with working-class voters there. Labor leaders, progressive groups and Democratic operatives told Reuters in interviews that they took seriously Trumps appeal with white working-class voters and were studying how to respond to his promises to create jobs and negotiate better trade deals. The desire to stop the presumptive Republican presidential nominee from wresting away the support of unionized workers has even led a group organized to back Bernie Sanders, Labor for Bernie, to consider its next steps if Sanders does not win the Democratic nomination. It may well be our task to work hard to reach out to our (labor union) members who support Trump and begin an important dialogue, said Rand Wilson, a staunch Sanders supporter and Labor for Bernie spokesman. The Rust Belt, which includes Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and West Virginia, has suffered heavy job losses in sectors such as autos, coal and steel that have faced fierce competition from abroad. The region, home to many unionized workers, has been a stronghold for Democrats. The exceptions are socially conservative West Virginia, which has gone Republican in the past four presidential elections, and Indiana, which has gone Democratic only twice since 1940. Ohio has switched back and forth. Trump has aggressively courted working-class voters ahead of the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. He has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and promised to rip up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. He has also said he will consider raising the minimum wage and backing higher taxes on the wealthy.  On Monday, Trump sought to backtrack from those comments on taxes. Now if I increase it on the wealthy, that means theyre still going to be paying less than they are paying now, he told CNN. Im talking about increasing it from my (original) tax proposal. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters the campaign was targeting industrial states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, which have voted Democratic in presidential elections since 1992. Working America, an advocacy group affiliated with the AFL-CIO labor federation, is expanding operations in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and plans to open an office in Wisconsin. Its first mission is talking to voters about jobs and the economy and trying to gauge where they are leaning in the presidential race. Later in the campaign, the group will work more aggressively to win over voters. In Ohio, the Democratic Party has doubled its field operation over the past month, thanks to an infusion of cash raised by the Clinton campaign for the national and state parties. Clinton, who has a strong lead over Sanders but has yet to secure the Democratic nomination, has already hired state directors in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Working America field director Soren Norris knocked on doors on the west side of Cleveland last week as part of an effort to gauge voter sentiment. At the first house, Tamara Phillips, 44, told Norris she was not enthusiastic about either Clinton or Trump but that she would vote for the New York businessman if forced to choose. Phillips, who works in publishing, said taxes on her commission income rose during former President Bill Clintons administration. But she said she had reservations about Trumps gruff demeanor. With an eye toward voters across the Rust Belt, Clinton visited Appalachia last week with stops in West Virginia and Ohio. She apologized for previous statements related to shutting down the coal industry and told protesters she was committed to solving their economic problems even if they did not support her. Union activists said their strategy for undercutting Trumps support would be pointing out discrepancies in his positions. His comment that he is open to raising the minimum wage comes after he said in a November debate that wages are too high and that an increase would hurt the economy. Although Trump rails against trade deals and businesses that move operations to Mexico, critics say that items such as ties and suits in his clothing line were made in China. The best way to go after Trump is to make him run against himself, said political strategist Brad Bannon, who advises labor unions. Tom Buffenbarger, a Clinton surrogate to labor and the past president of the machinists union, said Democrats would have a lot of fun highlighting Trumps inconsistencies, although he acknowledged the Republican candidate presented a threat in some Rust Belt states. Are we concerned about the industrial states in the upcoming election? Buffenbarger said. Yeah, Donald Trumps done a good job complaining about the trade deal while he continues to ship work from the U.S. to China. ",politicsNews,"May 9, 2016 ",1
Michelle Obama helps Prince Harry launch second Invictus Games,"ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Britains Prince Harry and U.S. first lady Michelle Obama mixed with headline acts from music and film to launch the second edition of the Invictus Games for wounded military personnel on Sunday. British singers James Blunt and Laura Wright performed at the two-hour ceremony before Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman led the crowd at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Champion Stadium in reciting the Invictus Games pledge. Former U.S. President George W Bush, the honorary chairman of this years Games, also spoke on stage to the near 500 athletes from 14 different countries who will compete over four days from Monday in 11 Paralympic sports.

Lets cheer for the woman who fought through post-traumatic stress. That spirit was echoed by Obama, who thanked U.S. veterans for their service. Im here and honor all of you: our extraordinary service members, our veterans, and of course our military families. You all are amazing. Truly amazing, she said. ",politicsNews,"May 9, 2016 ",1
Chagrined anti-Trump Republicans seek to recruit third-party candidate," (This version of the May 5, 2016 story has been corrected to make clear Ralph Nader ran as a Green Party candidate) By Ginger Gibson and Jonathan Allen WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps emergence as the last man standing in the Republican presidential race has prompted his critics inside the party to intensify their search for a candidate they could back as a serious third-party alternative. Political operatives are courting donors, calling potential candidates and developing legal contingency plans for overcoming onerous ballot qualification laws. This is as much as anything a battle for the future of American party politics, said Republican strategist Joel Searby, who is working with conservative writer Bill Kristol, among others, on an effort to identify a third-party candidate to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election. A separate group, Conservatives Against Trump, which includes blogger Erick Erickson, has been holding calls and meetings to discuss third-party candidates as well as other options to stop the New York billionaire from winning the White House. The hurdles to a third-party candidacy are immense. No independent candidate has ever won a presidential election, although some have played spoilers. But the efforts by the Republican groups underscore the unusual divisiveness of Trumps candidacy within Republican ranks ahead of a likely general election fight with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Trumps opposition to free trade is at odds with the views of many Republicans, especially in the partys business wing. Many of Trumps critics also find his rhetoric offensive, including his call to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country and his comment describing Mexican immigrants to the United States as rapists and drug dealers. Some Republicans say they worry that any third-party candidate would only siphon votes away from Trump and help Clinton win the election. Ralph Naders Green Party presidential run has been blamed by some Democrats for the razor-thin defeat of Democratic nominee Al Gore in the 2000 election. Ross Perots independent candidacy in 1992 was seen by some Republicans as contributing to President George H.W. Bushs loss to Democrat Bill Clinton.   One outcome, though rare, may be that no candidate crosses the necessary threshold of 270 votes in the U.S. Electoral College. In that case, the vote for the next president would pass to the U.S. House of Representatives, currently controlled by Republicans.   Deborah DeMoss Fonseca, who recruited donors for former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush and is working with Conservatives Against Trump, said her group was trying to find a candidate who would be high-profile enough to compete with Trump and Clinton. But finding a candidate of that caliber who would be willing to run is no easy feat. Searbys group has reached out to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and James Mattis, a retired U.S. Marine Corps general, among others, but both declined after discussions. Republican U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has emerged as a favorite of the Republicans seeking a third-party candidate. Kristol has had warm words for him. Sasse, a freshman lawmaker and former Bush administration official, is a strong critic of Trump and has called for an alternative candidate to him. But he says that person should be someone other than him. On Wednesday, the morning after Trump emerged as the presumptive presidential nominee, phones at the office of Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson were ringing off the hook with calls from small-government Republicans who feel they cannot get behind Trump. But as a Libertarian, Johnson holds views on some issues, such as the legalization of marijuana, that are antithetical to the views of some Republicans.  In March, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, said he had considered jumping into the race as a third-party candidate but opted against it, saying he feared it would only serve to help get Trump elected. One of the biggest hurdles to a third-party run is simply getting on the ballot in enough states to mount a viable campaign. Texas requires more than 79,000 signatures from voters who did not participate in either primary. Its deadline is Monday. Among other states, North Carolinas deadline is the end of May, and Illinois and Florida in mid-July. A third-party candidate is a pipe dream, said Republican strategist Tony Fratto, who worked in Bushs administration and strongly opposes Trump. Whats going to happen is Hillary Clinton is going to win big. It wont be close. ",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Top reason Americans will vote for Trump: 'To stop Clinton' - poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. presidential election may turn out to be one of the worlds biggest un-popularity contests.  Nearly half of American voters who support either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump for the White House said they will mainly be trying to block the other side from winning, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday.  The results reflect a deepening ideological divide in the United States, where people are becoming increasingly fearful of the opposing party, a feeling worsened by the likely matchup between the New York real estate tycoon and the former first lady, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginias Center for Politics.  This phenomenon is called negative partisanship, Sabato said.If we were trying to maximize the effect, we couldnt have found better nominees than Trump and Clinton.  Trump has won passionate supporters and vitriolic detractors for his blunt talk and hardline proposals, including his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, his vow to force Mexico to pay for a border wall, and his promise to renegotiate international trade deals.  Former Secretary of State Clintons appeal to voters seeking continuity with President Barack Obamas policies, has won her a decisive lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, but finds strong opponents among those disillusioned by what they see as lack of progress during Obamas tenure.  The poll asked likely voters about the primary motivation driving their support of either Trump or Clinton heading into the general election on Nov. 8.  About 47 percent of Trump supporters said they backed him primarily because they dont want Clinton to win. Another 43 percent said their primary motivation was a liking for Trumps political positions, while 6 percent said they liked him personally.  Similar responses prevailed among Clinton supporters.  About 46 percent said they would vote for her mostly because they dont want to see a Trump presidency, while 40 percent said they agreed with her political positions, and 11 percent said they liked her personally.  The April 29-May 5 poll included 469 likely Trump voters and 599 likely Clinton voters. It has a credibility interval of 5 percentage points. (For results, click tmsnrt.rs/1TLCbqX)  To be sure, voters opinions could change over the next several months. Candidates will be feted at party conventions, will square off in a series of national debates, and will be targeted by millions of dollars worth of advertisements.  But the negative atmosphere is likely to reign, says Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University professor who has studied the rise of negative partisanship in America.  Both campaigns probably will decide their best strategy is to work even harder to vilify each other, he said.  Its going to get very, very negative, he added.  That would play into a longer-term trend.  A 2014 study by Pew Research Center found that Democrats and Republicans have shown increasingly negative views toward each other over the past few decades. In 2014 more than a quarter of Democrats, and more than a third of Republicans, viewed the opposition as a threat to the nations well-being.  Barbara Monson, 59, a Republican from Murray, Utah, is among them. No matter who the Republican (nominee) is, I would have voted for him, poll respondent Monson said of her support for Trump. Its never going to be Clinton. Never.  Jo-Anne Michaud, 69, an independent voter from Abingdon, Maryland, told Reuters she would try to keep an open mind. Although she has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, she feels repelled by Trump.  I used to like the guy when I watched his show, Michaud said. But I just hate the way he talks now. I dont think hes a nice person deep down inside.  ",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1
"'This is not a reality show,' Obama tells Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama warned on Friday that occupying the Oval Office is not a reality show, in a swipe at outspoken Republican candidate Donald Trump who is vying to replace him in the White House.  Fighting with Obama is a battle Trump would likely relish as he tries to rally support within his own party. During hard-fought Republican primary campaigns, the billionaire delighted in responding to attacks from rivals and found that his support grew when he lashed out at his opponents. Asked about Trump at a media briefing in the White House, Obama called on the press and public to weigh past statements by the Republican but did not point to any specific issues or remarks.  This is not entertainment, Obama said, a reference to Trumps television background. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States, he said. Some top Republican leaders - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan among them - are still expressing wariness about Trump, who became the partys presumptive nominee this week when two Republican rivals dropped out of the White House race. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination, posted on Facebook that he will not vote for Trump - one of the sharpest slights yet against the New York real estate mogul by a senior Republican.  Donald Trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot support his candidacy, Bush wrote, adding that he would not vote for likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton either. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, who made an unsuccessful bid for president, joined a growing list of Republicans who are refusing to support Trump and he announced on Friday he will also skip the Republican convention in July. Mitt Romney, who won the Republican nomination in 2012, is also refusing to support Trump. But Trump on Friday won the endorsement of another former Republican presidential nominee, Bob Dole, who lost to Bill Clinton in 1996. For Trump, finding unifying enemies like Obama and Hillary Clinton could help rally Republicans back to his side ahead of the Nov. 8 general election.     Obama is likely to be the feature of much of Trumps criticism in the general election. Republicans have sought to paint Clinton as an extension of the Obama administration who would continue all of his policies. Since effectively securing the nomination on Tuesday, Trump has begun testing themes to attack Clinton, Obamas former secretary of state.  On Friday, Trump took aim at Clinton for her use of a private email server while in office. Clinton has said she did not send or receive information marked as classified. The FBI is investigating whether laws were broken. The email scandal should take her down but I dont think its going to because I think shes being protected by the Democrats, Trump said on Fox & Friends, a television news program that attracts a large conservative viewership. Trump tried to cast Clinton as weak on the economy, which is sure to be one of the main policy issues as the election approaches. If you look at what shes going to do, shes going to be so bad on jobs that wages are going to go down for workers, he said. Early general election polls show Clinton with a lead both nationally and in key states.      Clinton has a higher probability than Trump of becoming the next president, but the gap between them narrowed this week, according to the online political stock market PredictIt.     A key factor for Trump in the general election will be whether he can rally the party behind him. Trump has seen some top Republicans who previously fought his candidacy now back him, including Texas Governor Rick Perry. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, whose daughter Liz Cheney is running for Congress in Wyoming, said he will support Trump, a source close to him said on Friday. Paul Manafort, a top Trump adviser, told MSNBC that Republicans will rally behind the businessman because he has strengthened the party by attracting new supporters. We want to unify the party, but the important thing to remember is Donald Trump just won a historic victory among 17 other candidates, Manafort said. He is a very strong nominee. His vision that he laid out is not something in question. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has already begun his efforts to rally the party behind Trump, saying at an event hosted by Politico that behind the scenes the candidate is more gracious and personable than I think you see at rallies. I think theres work on tone to do, Priebus said, adding that he has made that point to Trump. I think he gets it. I think youre going to see it. I think youre going to see the change in tone. In addition to changing tone, Trump also faces an uphill climb to bring the party together. Ryan, the top elected Republican in the United States, said on Thursday he was not ready to support Trump, a sign of lingering establishment concern about the candidates position on immigration and trade. Trump took issue with Ryan.  Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party, Trump wrote on Twitter. Wrong, I didnt inherit it, I won it with millions of voters.     Ryan has invited Trump to meet with House of Representatives Republican leaders next week, Ryans office said on Friday. Trumps attorney was quoted in media reports on Friday as saying the candidate will testify after the November election in a class-action lawsuit that accuses him and his now-defunct Trump University of defrauding people who paid up to $35,000 for real estate seminars. A federal judge ordered the trial in San Diego to start on Nov. 28, which means he will not have to testify while he campaigns. The university case was one of the subjects Trumps rivals used to attack him during presidential debates. ",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1
Top U.S. official visits Vietnam to assess human rights progress,"HANOI (Reuters) - A top U.S. envoy began a two-day trip to Vietnam on Monday to gauge its progress in human rights, two weeks ahead of a visit by President Barack Obama in what will be the first by a U.S. leader in a decade. Tom Malinowski, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, is expected to press Vietnam to release unconditionally political prisoners and reform its laws to comply with its international commitments. Relations between the United States and Vietnam have moved to a new level in the past two years as Washington seeks to make a new ally in Asia, but the communist nations zero-tolerance approach to its detractors remains a sticking point. Vietnam has jailed dissidents, bloggers and religious figures in recent years, holding them for long periods without access to family or legal counsel and often subject to torture or other mistreatment, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. The United States has been intensifying efforts in building stronger ties -  in health, education, environment, energy and recently military - to boost its influence, and offset that of China. The United States and Vietnam, along with 10 others, this year signed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), one of the worlds biggest multinational trade deals. Though the TPP has no requirements for members to reach certain standards in human rights, analysts say Vietnams record of arrests, intimidation and oppression of those who speak out against the ruling Communist Party could add to anticipated resistance to the pact among U.S. legislators. The TPP must be ratified by each member countrys parliament. Malinowski said during his visit to Vietnam last year that he had seen signs of progress on human rights but the country needed to make a stronger commitment.

Trump changes tune on tax hikes for wealthy Americans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Sunday he was open to raising taxes on the rich, backing off his prior proposal to reduce taxes on all Americans and breaking with one of his partys core policies dating back to the 1990s. I am willing to pay more, and you know what, the wealthy are willing to pay more, Trump told ABCs This Week. After effectively sealing the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election last week, Trump has used speeches and interviews to offer more details on his policy positions. The billionaire real estate tycoon has said he would like to see an increase in the minimum wage, although he told NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday he would prefer to see states take the lead on that front instead of the federal government. I dont know how people make it on $7.25 an hour, Trump said of the current federal minimum wage. I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But Id rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Trumps call for higher taxes on the wealthy is a break with Republican presidential nominees who have staunchly opposed tax hikes for almost three decades. Tax hikes have been anathema to many in the party since former President George H.W. Bush infuriated fellow Republicans by abandoning a pledge not to raise taxes and agreeing to an increase in a 1990 budget deal. Democrats, including presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, have pressed for increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans for years. Trump released a tax proposal last September that included broad tax breaks for businesses and households. He proposed reducing the highest income tax rate to 25 percent from the current 39.6 percent rate. Pressed on the contradiction between his latest comments on taxes and the September tax plan, Trump said he viewed his original proposal as a concept and that he expected it would be changed following negotiations with Congress. By the time it gets negotiated, its going to be a different plan, Trump told ABC. He emphasized in separate interviews with ABC and NBC that his priorities were lowering taxes on the middle class and businesses. The middle class has to be protected, Trump told NBC. The rich are probably going to end up paying more, he said. The Clinton campaign said Trump was trying to pander to voters beyond those who supported him in the Republican nominating contests and that he had no intention of raising the taxes of wealthy people. Dont believe Donald Trumps weak attempts at a general election makeover for even a second, Christina Reynolds, a Clinton campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement. Trumps economic plans take direct aim at working Americans - his proposal to cut trillions in taxes for the top one percent would almost certainly come at the expense of working- and middle-class families. When asked on NBC whether he would release his own tax returns before the election, Trump said once again that it depended on the completion of an audit. Sure. If the auditors finish. Ill do it as fast as the auditors finish, he said.   Republicans remain deeply divided over Trumps candidacy, although he has pledged to try to unite the party ahead of its convention in July. Prominent party leaders such as Paul Ryan, the top elected U.S. Republican, have distanced themselves from Trump over his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Ryan, who has been a leading voice for the Republican Party on budget issues for years and is the House of Representatives speaker, has proposed a series of budgets that would cut taxes across the board. Trump has also called for new tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports to the United States, a position at odds with views on trade held by Ryan and many other pro-business Republicans. Ryan, who will preside over the July 18-21 convention in Cleveland where the party will formally nominate its presidential candidate, said last week he hoped to eventually support Trump. But he added: Im just not there right now. Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona also is undecided about Trump. Flake said he wanted to see Trump revise some of his positions, including the proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. Hes got to soften his position there, Flake said. Underscoring the partys divisions, Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate and a Trump supporter, criticized Ryan for failing to endorse Trump. The conservative populist firebrand said she would work to defeat Ryan in his Aug. 9 primary race against a conservative businessman.  Clinton said she hoped to take advantage of Republican reticence over Trump to draw the support of party defectors.  I am asking people to come join this campaign, the former secretary of state told CBS. And Ive had a lot of outreach from Republicans in the last days who say that they are interested in talking about that. ",politicsNews,"May 8, 2016 ",1
Palin vows to help defeat Ryan over his refusal to support Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin vowed on Sunday to help unseat Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, because of the his refusal to endorse presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Palin, the former Alaska governor and Trump supporter, endorsed conservative businessman Paul Nehlen, who is challenging Ryan, the House speaker, for his congressional seat in the Wisconsin Republican nominating contest on Aug. 9. I will do whatever I can for Paul Nehlen, Palin said in an interview with CNN. This man is a hardworking guy, so in touch with the people. Though Ryan is heavily favored to win the primary race against Nehlen, Palin predicted an upset in a race she said would shock Washingtons political class. Palins comments underscore the deep divisions within the party over Trump, who effectively locked up his partys nomination for president last week when his two remaining rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out of the race. Palin said she believed Ryan would get Cantored, comparing him to former Eric Cantor, the former No. 2 Republican in the House who was defeated in a 2014 primary by conservative Dave Brat, now a Virginia congressman. Ryan said last week he was not ready to support Trump yet, saying that the New York real estate mogul needed to do more to unify the Republican party. Paul Ryan and his ilk, their problem is that they become so disconnected from the people they are elected to represent, as evidenced by Paul Ryans refusal to support the GOP front runner, that we just said, Hes our man, Palin said. A poll in March by Marquette University Law School showed Ryan with more than an 80 percent approval rating among Wisconsin Republicans. Seen as an intellectual leader of the partys conservative values, many inside the party believe he may mount his own White House run in the next presidential cycle. Nehlen, like Trump, wants to secure the southern border with Mexico and withdraw from global trade deals. He told Reuters in April that Cantors defeat in 2014 reinforced in my mind that he could defeat Ryan. Asked if she would be willing to be vetted as a potential vice presidential candidate, Palin said she recognizes many voters might not want her on the ticket and that she wouldnt want to be a burden to Trumps candidacy. Palin, who is popular with the Tea Party wing of the Republican party, was tapped in 2008 to be the running mate for  former Republican presidential nominee John McCain.

"Treading cautiously, House's Ryan to meet Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan and Donald Trump, the top Republicans in the United States, plan to meet next week to try to unite their party, with both men focused on the Nov. 8 presidential election, but the Wisconsin congressman also perhaps looking further ahead. Speaker of the House of Representatives Ryan has invited Trump, this years likely Republican presidential nominee, to meet on Thursday with Ryan and other congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, Ryans office said in a statement on Friday. A key part of the conversation is sure to be Trumps combative, in-your-face campaign persona and Republican leaders requests for him to tone it down, but political analysts said Ryan will have other considerations in mind, as well. One issue is likely to be his own future, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginias Center for Politics. Ryan, 46, lost his 2012 campaign for vice president as Mitt Romneys running mate. Ryan probably has serious doubts that Trump, like Romney, can win this year, Sabato said. If so, Ryan will want to find a balance between accepting Trump, 69, as the nominee and keeping some distance from him, just in case the real estate moguls campaign ends in disaster. Suppose Trump loses overwhelmingly. Would you want to have been siding with the captain of the Titanic, or maybe seen as someone who was begging the captain to watch out for icebergs? Sabato said, adding that a Trump defeat could push the party in a different direction in 2020, maybe toward Ryan as the nominee. As chairman of the Republican Party convention in Cleveland in July, Ryans political tightrope will be especially perilous. One of his objectives will be to provide political cover for his 246 House Republicans so they can choose to embrace or run away from Trump, depending on their home districts politics, with the goal of preserving control of the House, analysts said. Ryan dropped a bombshell on Thursday when he said he was not ready to endorse Trump until he shows he can unify the party, still reeling from a bitter primary campaign that left many establishment Republicans stunned at Trumps victory. One moderate Pennsylvania congressman, Representative Charlie Dent, said he thought most of his fellow House Republicans would be comfortable with what Ryan said, because they were conflicted themselves over whether to support Trump. Some Republican lawmakers worry that Trump is not conservative enough; others are more bothered by Trumps divisive, incendiary remarks and lack of substance, said Dent, who put himself in the latter category. However, a conservative Republican congressman, Raul Labrador of Idaho, told CNN that Ryan needs to reconsider what hes doing concerning Trump. A lot of people that are voting for Donald Trump are totally disaffected with what were doing in Washington D.C., and he (Ryan) almost kind of slapped them in the face when he said what he did, said Labrador, who endorsed Ted Cruz but says he will vote for Trump now that Cruz is out of the race.  As speaker, Ryan has struggled with his deeply divided colleagues over budget issues, funding the battle against the Zika virus, rescuing Puerto Rico from a debt crisis, and helping Flint, Michigan, deal with their contaminated water system. Ryan is trying to jawbone Trump into adjusting his positions to line up better with the party establishment, said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar and political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The unprecedented move by a congressional leader to distance himself from his partys expected nominee, Ornstein said, showed Ryan trying to mold a less confrontational and divisive approach to minorities and a less isolationist and combative approach to our allies. In a swipe at Trump on Friday, President Barack Obama warned that occupying the Oval Office is not a reality show. ",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1
"Obama says U.S. race relations have improved, but work to be done","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said in a commencement speech on Saturday that U.S. race relations have improved over the last three decades, but that significant work still needs to be done. I tell you this not to lull you into complacency, but to spur you into action because theres still so much work to do, Obama told about 2,300 Howard University graduates in Washington, acknowledging that racism and inequality still persist. We cannot sleepwalk through life, he said. The United States has faced a number of racial controversies in recent years, including the 2014 shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, that sparked sometimes violent protests. The United States has a racial gap in economic opportunities, Obama said, noting that the overall U.S. employment rate is around 5 percent, but it is near 9 percent for African-Americans. Obama, the son of a white mother and African father, told the graduates to embrace their racial identity. Be confident in your blackness, Obama said, adding there is no one way to be black ... Theres no straightjacket, theres no constraints, theres no litmus test for authenticity. He added that my election did not create a post-racial society, but was one example of how attitudes have changed. Obama also urged the crowd not to try to prod colleges and universities into disinviting controversial speakers - something that has taken place regularly at campuses throughout the United States. Howard University is one of about 100 historically black colleges and universities in the United States. Obama argued that the United States and the world has progressed dramatically since 1983 when he graduated from college. America is by almost every measure better than it was in 1983, Obama said, noting that U.S. poverty rate is down, the number of people with college degrees is up and the number of women in the workforce have risen. Obama said todays college graduates are better positioned than any other to address the countrys tough outstanding problems. You need a strategy, Obama said, adding passion and anger are not enough to effect political change and encouraging them to embrace compromise. Not just hashtags but votes. He noted the low voter turnout among young people in the 2014 congressional elections. He told the graduates they needed to vote every time ... not just when youre inspired. But Obama noted an area that has not improved in recent decades - the U.S. prison population - currently at 2.2 million, it is up more than fourfold from 500,000 in 1983. African-American men are six times more likely than white men to be incarcerated, Obama said, and urged the graduates to lobby the U.S. Congress to pass a pending criminal justice reform measure. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, praised Obamas remarks on Twitter, writing even conservatives would applaud it. ",politicsNews,"May 7, 2016 ",1
Alabama's top judge faces ethics charges over gay-marriage order,"(Reuters) - Alabamas Supreme Court Chief Justice was suspended on Friday  for ordering state probate judges not to grant marriage licenses to gay couples, despite contrary rulings by a federal court and the U.S. Supreme Court. Chief Justice Roy Moore, an outspoken opponent of same-sex unions, faces possible removal from the bench after the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission charged him with violating the states judicial ethics laws, according to news website AL.com.  The legality of gay marriage had been at the center of a national debate until the Supreme Court ruled in June that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry, handing a historic triumph to the American gay rights movement.   Despite the decision and a federal court ruling that made gay marriage legal in Alabama, Moore in January issued an administrative order to state probate judges that they should not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to court documents.  Chief Justice Moore flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority, the complaint said. Moore knowingly ordered (probate judges) to commit violations ... knowingly subjecting them to potential prosecution and removal from office. Moore said in a statement that the commission had no authority over administrative orders or the courts ability to prohibit probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses.   We intend to fight this agenda vigorously and expect to prevail, he said.   Moore wrote in his order that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was at odds with a decision in March 2015 by the Alabama Supreme Court that instructed probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The conflicting opinions had resulted in confusion and uncertainty, Moore said, with many probate judges issuing marriage licenses to gay couples while others refused to do so. [uL1N14R283] The Human Rights Campaign, the biggest U.S. gay rights organization, hailed the suspension. Roy Moore is an embarrassment to the state of Alabama, Eva Walton Kendrick, the groups Alabama state manager, said in a statement. Moore, a Republican, has been a hero of conservative causes before. In 2003, he was removed from office after a federal judge ruled he was placing himself above the law by refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument. He won the chief justice job back in 2012, vowing not to do anything to create further friction with the federal courts. ",politicsNews,"May 7, 2016 ",1
Arizona joins rest of U.S. in adding health insurance program for children,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Arizonas governor signed into law on Friday a bitterly contested proposal that will restore a federal health insurance program for children from low-income families, making it the last of its 49 counterparts to join the program. Arizona opted out of the federal Childrens Health Insurance Program in 2010 over cost concerns as it grappled with a budget crunch.  The program aims to help working families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid health care coverage for the poor, but who cannot afford private health insurance. To qualify for KidsCare, as its known in Arizona, a family of four must earn between $33,000 and $49,000 annually. It is estimated to serve about 30,000 children in Arizona. Arizonas Republican governor, Doug Ducey, signed the legislation over fierce objections from the top two lawmakers in his own party a matter of hours after it cleared the Republican-led legislature. The debate over the program was among the most rancorous of the legislative session and focused on both costs and the fact that the measure was tacked on to a virtually unrelated school voucher bill, prompting concerns that the law would face a legal challenge. Backers said the program is desperately needed to close a gap in affordable health insurance options and to ensure that children are able to grow up healthy.  Even though the state is no longer required under the program to contribute funds in exchange for federal dollars, as was the case in 2010, opponents argued that Arizona citizens are still indirectly financing the program by paying for the program through federal taxes. Arizonas House of Representatives approved the measure on Thursday following heated debate.  The law could take effect as early as August. ",politicsNews,"May 7, 2016 ",1
"Obama: new tax rule will fight corruption, help economy","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday a long-delayed rule requiring the financial industry to identify the real owners of companies will help fight corruption and tax evasion and boost the economy. His administration on Friday issued the Customer Due Diligence rule in the works since 2012 and proposed legislation meant to stop prevent criminals from using shell companies to evade taxes, launder money, and finance terror.  These actions are going to make a difference, Obama told reporters. He said they would help the administration to do a better job of tracking financial flows and making sure companies are paying the taxes they owe rather than using shell corporations and offshore accounts to avoid doing the things that ordinary Americans are doing every day. Obama also called on Congress to pass legislation that requires all companies formed in the United States to report information to the financial crimes enforcement network at the Treasury Department.   Thats going to help law enforcement better investigate and prevent financial crimes, Obama told reporters. Obama also urged Congress to raise the federal minimum wage, pass new trade agreements, and simplify the tax code.  Only Congress can fully close the loopholes that wealthy individuals or corporations can take advantage of, Obama said. He singled out Senator Rand Paul, a Republican and libertarian, who in years past has single-handedly blocked tax treaties or treaty updates between the United States and Spain, Japan, Britain, and other countries. Paul has been a little quirky on this issue, Obama said, and urged him to stop blocking the implementation of tax treaties.  Pauls office did not immediately comment. ",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1
Clinton more likely to win U.S. presidency than Trump: PredictIt,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has a higher probability than her likely Republican rival Donald Trump of becoming the next U.S. president, but the gap between the pair narrowed this week, according to the online political stock market PredictIt.  Clintons probability on Friday was 61 percent, down from 65 percent seven days ago, according to the site, which allows users to wager small amounts of money on yes or no predictions of future events. The probability that Trump will win the Nov. 8 election was 40 percent, up from 34 percent. Trumps sweeping victory in this weeks Indiana primary prompted his remaining Republicans rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich to drop out of the race, cementing the businessmans status as the partys presumptive nominee.  He is now testing out themes to use against Clinton to persuade disgruntled Republicans to get behind his campaign. On Friday, he criticized her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state. PredictIt is jointly run by Washington political consultancy Aristotle and Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. All of its users are registered U.S. voters.         As with polls, predictions markets like PredictIt do not always accurately forecast outcome. Ninety days ago, its users gave Trump a 20 percent probability of winning the presidency, illustrating how the celebrity businessmans momentum was underestimated.  Clinton is in a fight with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination and holds a clear lead in delegates.

Trump to testify in Trump University lawsuit after Nov. 8 vote: reports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump will testify after the Nov. 8 presidential election in a class-action lawsuit that accuses him and his now-defunct Trump University of defrauding people who paid up to $35,000 for real estate seminars, media reports said on Friday, citing his attorney. Court documents showed a federal judge ordered the trial to start in San Diego on Nov. 28. This raised the possibility that Trump could take the stand as president-elect but also ensured that he will not have to testify in the case while he campaigns. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee plans to attend much of the trial and would take the witness stand, Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli was quoted as saying by the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times. Petrocelli did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit claim the school lured student-victims into its doors, only to defraud them once their checks were cashed. Another Trump lawyer, Alan Garten, last year called the allegations totally lacking in any merit and said that Trump would prevail in the end whether it be by motion or at trial. Trump also faces another lawsuit in Manhattan over Trump University brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, which Garten has said is politically motivated. Schneiderman is a Democrat.   That fraud lawsuit, filed in 2013, seeks $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs. ",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1
Trump dips toe into delicate U.S. debt discussion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Would Donald Trump really consider not paying portions of the U.S. debt? The prospect riled economists on Friday as stories in the New York Times and the conservative website The Blaze cast fresh scrutiny on comments Trump made a day earlier. Responding to a question about the national debt, the likely Republican presidential nominee said in an interview on CNBC on Thursday he would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal.  When asked if that meant he had taken a page from his own playbook as a businessman and try to get U.S. creditors to accept less than the full value of the bonds they hold, he said No, but added: I could see long-term renegotiations where we borrow long-term at very low rates. The reaction to his words on Friday offered the first-time political candidate a taste of how delicate the prospect of discussing economic and fiscal policy can be. It also highlighted a danger for Trump as his campaign moves from a crowded, personality-fueled contest for the Republican nomination to a general election competition where the media and members of the public expect more policy details from the candidates. Such remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent, the New York Times wrote in a story saying Trumps plan implied he would negotiate a partial repayment of U.S. debt. Its beyond ludicrous and irresponsible unless youre, say, an emerging market country, wrote the U.S. debt analyst David Ader, the head of rates strategy at CRT Capital, in a note to clients early Friday morning.  A senior campaign adviser said Trump had not meant to suggest he would demur on any U.S. debt payments. Mr. Trump was clear in saying that he was not going to renegotiate U.S. debt, despite being asked multiple times, and that he would not default on U.S. debt, despite being asked multiple times, said the adviser, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. All he said is that he believes that long term low interest Treasuries would be a better deal for the U.S. taxpayer. Still, four Trump companies have been through bankruptcies in which his creditors were forced to accept far less than the more than $4 billion he owed them, and in the CNBC interview he spoke of loving to play with debt. The United States is nowhere near debt distress, said Charles Seville, an analyst at Fitch Ratings Inc. who focuses on government debt. Seville said if the U.S. government were to choose not to repay creditors, it would undermine faith in the United Statess ability to borrow at low rates which is the underpinning of its high credit rating, adding, theres no quick way of reducing the debt burden. Its something that would be a product of fiscal consolidation or faster growth.  Moreover, given that U.S. Treasuries are viewed as the safest-of-safe securities globally, underpinning the dollars status as the worlds preferred reserve currency, any damage to that reputation would likely unleash far-flung ructions in financial markets worldwide. The U.S. government regularly issues Treasury bills, notes and bonds maturing in a range of between four weeks and 30 years. Currently, interest rates on U.S. government debt are near historically low levels, meaning the government is able to borrow cheaply. The Treasury Department has been gradually moving more of its obligations into longer-term debt to take advantage of the low rates. ",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1
Oklahoma lawmakers pass bill to reduce feral hog population,"OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahomas legislature has passed a bill aimed at reducing the states bulging population of feral hogs, blamed for spreading disease and wiping out crops, that would let people kill them without a hunting license. A study by an agricultural research organization found that the animals are running wild in all of Oklahomas 77 counties and could number as high as 1.6 million, which would be one of the highest feral hog populations of any state. The measure, passed on Thursday by the Republican-led legislature, would permit hunters to kill hogs without a hunting permit on their property or on someone elses property with the landowners permission. It also would allow use of night-vision equipment to hunt them. Republican Governor Mary Fallins office has not said whether she will sign it into law. This legislation gives Oklahomans more options to combat the rapidly growing feral hog population, said Republican state Representative Sean Robert, a bill co-sponsor. The most effective method of eradicating the wild hogs currently is aerial shooting from helicopters, state officials said. Feral hogs wreak havoc on Oklahomas farms, ranches and ecosystems, and cost farmers, ranchers and landowners, said Tom Buchanan, president of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, an agricultural industry group that supports the legislation. Bill opponents said it couldprompt some people to bring even more feral hogs into Oklahoma to be shot by hunters. The U.S. Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said damage caused by feral swine across the United States could top $2 billion. If you are a farmer, they can clean out your crops overnight, Dale Nolte, the inspection services program manager, said in an interview. We have farmers tell us they have given up on planting high-dollar crops because of the feral hog problem. Texas, Oklahoma and California have the highest numbers of feral swine in the country, Nolte said. The inspection service has operations to remove them in 38 states, Nolte added. The problem is that feral hogs are so prolific that we have to trap 70 percent of the pig population every year just to maintain the population level we have right now, said Kevin Grant, Oklahoma Wildlife Services state director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Out in the wild, feral hogs are an ecological nightmare. There is very little that is beneficial to native wildlife that come from feral swine, Grant said. ",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1

"Kerry jabs at Trump, warns against isolationism in Boston speech","BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry criticized presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday, warning that isolationist policies would take a toll on the countrys well-being. You are the most diverse class in Northeastern history. In other words, you are Donald Trumps worst nightmare, he jokingly told the 2016 graduates of Northeastern University in Boston. While he did not mention the billionaire businessmans name again, Kerry alluded to one of Trumps signature proposals - his call to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. We will never come out on top if we accept advice from soundbite salesmen and carnival barkers who pretend the most powerful country on Earth can remain great by looking inward and hiding behind walls at a time when technology has made that impossible to do and unwise to even attempt, said the former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, who was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004. Kerry has generally declined to comment on the race leading up to the Nov. 8 presidential election, though he has noted that foreign leaders have raised concerns about statements made by candidates, particularly Trump. A spokesman told reporters on Friday that Kerrys remarks in Boston were intended to be lighthearted. He is not living in a bubble. He is obviously concerned about some of the tone and the effect that is having on foreign leaders, department spokesman John Kirby told a press briefing. If youre asking me because he enjoyed a light-hearted moment with students today has he changed his calculus to more aggressively jumping into active debates ... the answer is no.

Obama urges scrutiny of Trump's record: 'This is not entertainment',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged the U.S. media and American public on Friday to examine the long record of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and not get distracted by the spectacle and the circus aspect of the 2016 election campaign. The Democratic president delivered an indirect swipe at the flamboyant, combative Republican primary campaign run by Trump, a former reality television star, and how media have covered it. Its important for us to take seriously the statements hes made in the past, Obama said in remarks to reporters. I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job. This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States. He said Trump has a long record in public life and that should be closely examined, as should the statements and policy positions of all the candidates. If they take a position on international issues that could threaten war or has the potential of upending our critical relationships with other countries, or would potential break the financial system - that needs to be reported on, Obama said. Trump received criticism and angered allies with his comments on rethinking NATO and suggesting Japan and South Korea should consider getting nuclear weapons to defend themselves. He is perceived abroad as pursuing isolationist policies at odds with the current U.S. role in the world. Obama said he would be looking to see the American people are adequately informed about where candidates to replace him in the White House stand on issues, what they believe and whether their budget numbers add up. What Im concerned about is the degree to which reporting and information starts emphasizing the spectacle and the circus. Because thats not something we can afford, Obama said.

Japan ambassador takes veiled swipe at Trump's 'America First' stance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Japans ambassador to the United States weighed in on the U.S. presidential election debate on Friday by arguing against the America first stance of Republican candidate Donald Trump and stressing the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance. Without mentioning Trump by name, the envoy, Kenichiro Sasae, told a Washington forum Japan had come up unexpectedly in the election debate, showing that nothing could be taken for granted in terms of the long-standing alliance. In the presidential elections, there are arguments whether the United States is going for the isolationist stance, Sasae said. I dont want to see that kind of United States. I want to see the United States to be strong and come with a strong robust position, not really thinking of the United States only, he said. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, has portrayed Japan, a long-time treaty ally of the United States, as a free-rider on security. He has suggested Tokyo might need nuclear weapons to ease U.S. financial commitment to its defense, anathema to the only country ever attacked by atomic bombs. Japans Minister for Regional Revitalization, Shigeru Ishiba, said comments by one candidate, who he said he would not name, were causing a lot of concern in Japan. Ishiba told the forum that if Japan or South Korea chose to develop nuclear weapons regional stability would suffer, and added: I dont think it will add to the U.S. interest. No matter who becomes the president, understanding the essence of the alliance, accurately grasping the international environment we have been placed in would lead, I am sure, to proper policies being implemented, he added. Sasae said he understood there was a debate about how to make America strong, but added the question is whether you could be strong without a proper role around the world.  It is important not to undermine ... one, the value of the U.S.-Japan alliance; two, the geopolitical implications of emerging or resurgent powers in the world; three, the capability  and strength of the United States. Trump outlined a clear America First policy in a speech late last month, vowing that if he were elected president, U.S. allies in Europe and Asia would have to fend for themselves if they did not pay more for the U.S. defense umbrella. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday Japans U.S. alliance was the foundation of Asian peace and prosperity and Tokyo hoped to be able to work with whoever becomes U.S. president.

Republicans grapple with whether to back Trump for White House ,"(Reuters) - Republican lawmakers, operatives and donors grappled with whether to support Donald Trump, who effectively clinched his partys presidential nomination this week after his two remaining rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out of the White House race. As Trump sought to rally the fractured party behind him, many prominent Republicans got behind the reality TV star and real estate developer, while some weighed their options. Still others said they might vote in the Nov. 8 general election for Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.  Bill Achtmeyer, the Boston-based founder of consulting firm Parthenon Group, was among those considering a possible vote for Clinton, a former secretary of state and former first lady.  If she is able to move to the center and think as creatively and thoughtfully as her husband (Bill Clinton) did ... boy, I would have a very hard time, based on what I know today, not voting for Hillary versus what Trump is espousing, said Achtmeyer, who has donated $200,000 to Republicans over the last decade. Another Republican donor, David Beightol, a Washington lobbyist who raised money this year for the presidential bid of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, said he was leaning toward voting for Trump because he could not support Clinton. Im not there yet, but I dont have a lot of choice, Beightol said.  In most U.S. elections cycles, party insiders quickly coalesce around candidates once they have effectively sewn up the nomination. But Trumps bombastic rhetoric, unorthodox campaign and his lack of experience in government have left the party divided. The New York billionaire has vowed to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall along the Mexican border. He has also said he would temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country as a way to combat terrorism. Republican former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush do not plan to endorse anyone in the White House race this year, their spokesmen told Reuters. The partys presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, will not attend the Republican National Convention in July, an aide said. The former Massachusetts governor delivered a blistering attack on Trump in March. The partys 2008 nominee, U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, has said he would support the eventual nominee, who is now presumptively Donald Trump, said McCains Senate campaign spokeswoman, Lorna Romero.  But McCain told supporters in Arizona last month that having Trump at the top of the Republican ticket make his re-election harder, according a recording obtained by Politico. The state has a large Hispanic population. On Wednesday, fresh off the win in Indianas primary that drove both his rivals out of the race, Trump pledged to unify the party and said he was getting calls from people who had criticized him in the past but who now wanted to back him.Supporters of Trump, who has never held elective office,  said he could ease concerns about his lack of experience by choosing a well-known running mate. Representatives Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee and Chris Collins of New York both suggested former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  Rice did not respond to a request for comment. Trump told CNBC on Thursday there was a 40 percent chance his vice presidential pick would be a former Republican presidential rival. Backers said Trump could mend ties with allies of Cruz, who had been his strongest challenger and had trumpeted himself as a true conservative, by meeting with lawmakers in person after a heated campaign in which Trump dubbed the U.S. senator from Texas Lyin Ted. Cruzs supporters on Capitol Hill have ties to conservative activists and the Tea Party, groups that could help Trump raise money and turn out voters. DesJarlais said meeting Trump in person would improve their impressions of him. Representative Raul Labrador, a Cruz backer and conservative leader from Idaho, told a radio station that he saw Trump as favoring the political establishment even though he has run as an outsider. But he said Trump would likely appoint a conservative to the U.S. Supreme Court, a priority for many on the political right. With Clinton, there is no chance, Labrador said. In my opinion, theres just no choice between the two. ",politicsNews,"May 5, 2016 ",1
Trump says Britain would be better off outside EU,"WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday he thought Britain would be better off out of the European Union, the opposite stance to that taken by his likely rival Hillary Clinton and by many political leaders around the world. Britons will vote in a referendum on June 23 on whether to leave the 28-member EU, a momentous decision with trade, investment, defense and political ramifications that stretch far beyond Britains borders. I would say that theyre better off without it personally, but Im not making that as a recommendation - just my feeling, Trump said in an interview with Fox News television, adding that he wanted Britons to make their own decision. I think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe. A lot of that was pushed by the EU, he said, without providing any specifics. Initial reaction to Trumps comments, which went further than what he had previously said on the subject, was muted in Britain where the focus was on the incoming results of local and regional elections. Given Trumps controversial statements and his negative image in the eyes of many Europeans, including Britons, it is not clear whether his endorsement would be good, bad or indifferent for Britains Leave campaign. A spokesman for the campaign declined to comment. U.S. President Barack Obama made a passionate intervention in the EU debate during a visit to London last month, saying EU membership magnified Britains role in the world and made it more prosperous. Obama warned Britons their country would find itself in the back of the queue for a trade deal with the United States if they voted to leave the EU. The Remain camp, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, has repeatedly said that none of Britains significant allies wants it to leave the bloc. On Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe became the latest foreign leader to say it would be better for Britain and its allies if it remained in the European club. After Obamas intervention, the Remain campaign published an advertisement with side-by-side photos of Obama smiling and Trump with a distorted facial expression and a finger in the air.  The slogan read: Obama thinks the UK is stronger in Europe. Trump thinks the UK should leave Europe. Whose side are you on? The image suggested that the official Remain campaign viewed Trump as repellent to British voters. A spokesman for the campaign had no immediate comment on Friday. ",politicsNews,"May 5, 2016 ",1
Republican House Speaker Ryan not ready to support Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top elected Republican, Paul Ryan, said on Thursday he was not ready to endorse Donald Trump, a sign of the challenges the partys presumptive presidential nominee faces rallying the Republican establishment behind his White House bid. Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said conservatives wanted to know if Trump shares their values. I hope to support our nominee, I hope to support his candidacy fully, Ryan said on CNN. At this point, Im just not there right now. Trump, who has built a huge following with an anti-establishment message, shot back at Ryan in a statement. I am not ready to support Speaker Ryans agenda. Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people, he said. The Republican National Committee, under pressure to unify the party or face an electoral rout in the Nov. 8 election, said  Ryan and Trump were expected to meet soon. It added that only a united Republican Party will be able to beat Hillary Clinton. We respect Speaker Ryans opinion and believe that since the primary ended early we will have time to unify. We anticipate the two meeting soon to begin to help unite the party, said RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. Trumps last remaining rivals in the Republican race, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, dropped out this week, clearing the New York billionaires path to be picked as the presidential nominee. He will likely face Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, in the Nov. 8 general election. Many Republicans have grappled this week with whether to support Trump, who has deviated from the party line on trade and upset the party establishment with offensive comments about women and immigrants. Trump on Thursday announced a new campaign finance chairman in response to questions about his readiness for a general election race. Trump, speaking to thousands at a rally in Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday night, sharpened his criticism of Clinton, the kind of tactic that some Republican strategists believe will help unify the party. He blasted Clinton for saying recently she would impose clean-energy policies that would put coal miners out of business. He put on a hard hat presented to him by the states coal miners association and made a shoveling motion. And for those miners, get ready: Youre going to be working your asses off, he said. In a sign some Republicans are rallying around Trump, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, whose family has helped bankroll the anti-Trump group Our Principles, is set to endorse Trump on Friday when the candidate visits Omaha. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 nomination, told CNN he now supported Trump as well. Ryan criticized Trump in December for proposing to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States and knocked him in March for failing to denounce white supremacist groups during a television interview. The House speaker, who was the running mate of Republican 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a harsh Trump critic, said he hoped the party would be unified by this summer but that the pressure was on Trump to do that. He won fair and square, Ryan said of Trump, acknowledging his own policy differences with the New York billionaire businessman. He added: If we dont unify all wings of the party, were not going to win this election. Ryan repeatedly denied interest in running for president this year despite attempts to draft him by some in his party. He has been putting together a policy plan for House Republicans to campaign on, which he says will be released before the convention in July. Trump on Thursday began shifting focus from the bruising primary campaign to the general election. He has largely used his own money for his primary fight but plans to follow the more typical path of raising money from outside sources for the general election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. He named his campaign finance chief on Thursday - Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who is chief executive of private investment firm Dune Capital Management and with whom Trump worked in a business capacity in the past. Mnuchin has a long history of political donations, including to Clinton. Since 1998, Mnuchin has given about $71,000 to Democrats, compared with about $37,000 to Republicans. Republicans have questioned Trumps loyalty to the party because he also donated to Democratic candidates in the past. U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers, a Republican from North Carolina who has endorsed Trump, told Reuters the campaign would begin raising money for the party. They are going to start understanding and realizing that in order to grow this operation, they will need to grow funds, not only for him and for the campaign to beat Hillary Clinton, but  for the Republican Party itself, Ellmers said.  Historically, political parties have depended on their nominees to raise money in order to fund their other operations, including working to elect members of the House of Representatives and Senate. One key worry for Republicans has been that their candidates for Congress and other elective positions could suffer with the divisive figure of Trump at the top of the ticket.  Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Ryan gave lawmakers in his party cover to steer clear of Trump in their re-election campaigns. He is positioning the Republican conference and giving Republicans a message they can hold onto, Bonjean said. ",politicsNews,"May 3, 2016 ",1
Trump says he will name possible Supreme Court nominees by July: Fox,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday that before the partys convention in July, he would put out names of possible candidates he might nominate to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.

Im going to discuss people ... I think before the convention. I want to put 10, 12, 15 names of the type of people that wed like, he said. From that list, I would choose.

FBI likely to interview Clinton soon in emails probe: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation is likely to interview Hillary Clinton in the next few weeks about her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state and have already interviewed some of her aides, CNN reported on Thursday. The nine-month investigation into whether laws were broken as a result of the server kept in her New York home has overshadowed Clintons campaign to become the Democratic Partys candidate in Novembers presidential election.  With only a few states left to vote in primary elections, she retains a commanding lead over her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. More than 2,000 emails sent and received by Clinton while working as President Barack Obamas top diplomat include classified information, which the government bans from being handled outside secure, government-controlled channels. Clinton has said she did not send or receive any information that was marked as classified and has accused the State Department and other government agencies of over-classifying her emails after a judge ordered them released to the public. She has said she expects to be exonerated by the FBI, a point her campaign staff echoed on Thursday. We are confident the review will conclude that nothing inappropriate took place, the campaign told CNN. David Kendall, Clintons lawyer, and Melanie Newman, a spokesperson for the U.S. Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, both declined to comment.   CNN said those interviewed included Huma Abedin, a senior aide to Clinton and the vice chairwoman of Clintons presidential campaign. Lawyers for Abedin and other Clinton aides did not respond to questions. The timeline in the CNN report appeared to contradict answers Clinton gave in an interview on Tuesday, in which she told MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell that neither she nor her representatives had yet been contacted by the FBI. Asked about this, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon suggested the definition of words Mitchell used in her question were open to interpretation. What does representatives mean to you, sir? he said in an email, but declined to elaborate. Donald Trump, the Republican Partys presumptive presidential nominee, and other Republicans have used the FBI inquiry to attack Clintons integrity.  These FBI interviews are another reminder of the gross negligence Hillary Clinton displayed as Secretary of State, Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said in a statement.

In September, Perry was the first member of the initially crowded Republican field to drop out of the 2016 White House race, following a failed bid in the 2012 race. The longest-serving governor in Texas history had languished near the bottom of the 17-strong Republican presidential pack since entering the current race in June.

North Carolina lawmaker dismisses U.S. deadline to change bathroom law,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican leaders in North Carolina on Thursday refused to back down from a law regulating which restrooms can be used by transgender people after the federal government told the state the law violated the U.S. Civil Rights Act.  The states leading Republican lawmaker, House Speaker Tim Moore, told reporters in Raleigh that North Carolina would not be bullied into meeting the U.S. Justice Departments Monday deadline to change the law. North Carolina is the first U.S. state to pass a law requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate instead of the gender with which they identify.  Republican legislators in several other states have proposed similar laws, making transgender rights a hot-button social issue in an election year. The Justice Departments challenge is similarly unprecedented, though the agency has in the past intervened on behalf of transgender individuals who have alleged discrimination. The Republican National Committee urged state legislators in January to resist federal policies that allow transgender people to use restrooms of their choice at public schools. The Justice Department said in letters to North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and other state officials on Wednesday that the state had until Monday to decided if it would stop discriminating against transgender state employees. McCrory affirmed his support for the very common-sense rule before a group of business leaders on Wednesday night but said he did not know if the state would fight the Justice Department. His office did not respond to questions on Thursday. If McCrory does not stand down from enforcing the law, the Justice Departments civil rights division could push for a court order. If a federal judge sides with the agency, North Carolina would have to comply or face a reduction in federal funding.  On Thursday, Republican Senate leader Phil Bergers spokeswoman, Amy Auth, said state lawyers were reviewing the letter. Berger on Wednesday said the departments position represented a gross overreach.  North Carolinas Secretary of Public Safety and officials at the University of North Carolina also received similar letters on Wednesday. Margaret Spellings, president of the University of North Carolina system, said her office would respond to the departments letter by the deadline. We take this determination seriously and will be conferring with the Governors Office, legislative leaders, and counsel about next steps, she said. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson would not say whether the department would take legal action against the state.  The state law is being challenged in federal court by critics including the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. Weve never before seen a state do something as aggressive as require mandatory discrimination against its own transgender employees, said Peter Renn, an attorney with Lambda Legal, in a phone interview with Reuters.  Jillian Weiss, an attorney who has argued in federal court for transgender rights, said the Justice Departments action against North Carolina showed the federal government was willing to intervene when states passed laws reducing rights based on gender identity and sexual orientation.  Weiss predicts Mississippi, where a law allowing businesses to refuse service to gay people takes effect in July, will be the departments next target. ",politicsNews,"May 5, 2016 ",1
Senators urge regulators to ID vehicles with possible faulty Takata air bags,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Senators urged auto safety regulators to publicly name the makes and models of tens of millions of vehicles with potentially faulty Takata air bag inflators, according to a letter made public late on Thursday. There may still be 50 million airbags installed in vehicles whose owners not only have no idea, but also no way to find out, that they are driving a car containing potentially lethal airbags, wrote Senators Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. On Wednesday, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirmed the Japanese air bag manufacturer would declare between 35 million and 40 million additional inflators defective by 2019, which will prompt automakers to recall vehicles with the inflators. The 50 million inflators that could still be recalled include 27 million side air bags and 23 million frontal air bag inflators. As part of a November agreement with NHTSA, those vehicles must also be recalled by 2019 unless Takata can prove they are safe. Takata must issue five separate defect reports starting May 16 and ending in 2019. Takata said the first report will cover 14 million of the 35 million to 40 million inflators being recalled. The second report is not due until Dec. 31 and subsequent reports are due in 2017, 2018 and 2019. NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas said automakers will provide the information about the models and makes in the coming weeks. He did not directly respond to the senators demands on the inflators that have not yet been recalled.  Takata spokesman Jared Levy declined to comment. The senators want NHTSA to release regular updates regarding testing data on Takata airbags and their failure rates. To date, 14 automakers have recalled 28.8 million Takata inflators in about 24 million vehicles. Three additional automakers are part of the expansion. The latest recall means all Takata ammonium nitrate-based driver and passenger frontal air bag inflators without a chemical drying agent, known as a desiccant, will be recalled. But 23 million Takata frontal air bags with a desiccant have not been recalled. When exposed to moisture, ammonium nitrate, which is used to inflate the air bag, can cause the inflator to rupture with deadly force, spraying shrapnel into vehicle occupants. The defect is linked to at least 11 deaths and more than 100 injuries worldwide since 2008. Takata said it is not aware of any ruptures in the inflators in the vehicles that are part of recall announced Wednesday. ",politicsNews,"May 5, 2016 ",1
Illinois Senate votes for $454 million higher-education package,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - For the second time in two weeks, the Illinois Senate moved to loosen the financial death grip on the states higher education system, which has been starved of operating revenue by a record-setting, 11-month state budget stalemate. The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved and sent to the House of Representatives a $454 million spending package for eight public universities, community colleges and low-income students dependent on Monetary Award Program grants. The bipartisan move, which could stave off mass layoffs at several state universities, builds on a $600 million, higher-education appropriation that Republican Governor Bruce Rauner signed on April 25. Thursdays action also represents another encouraging break in the states acrimonious budget fight between the governor and Democrats, who control the state legislature, as they face a scheduled legislative adjournment at the end of May. We have since found more dollars which we can appropriate to our universities to make them more competitive, to make them more viable and to give them a bridge going forth into the 2017 budget, said state Senator Donne Trotter, a Chicago Democrat and a sponsor of Thursdays legislation. The latest appropriation was supported financially by companion legislation that passed the Senate on Thursday authorizing Rauners administration not to repay $454 million borrowed from state special-purpose funds during the 2015 fiscal year. Without legislative action, that amount would have had to be repaid June 30 from the states main operational fund. The approach drew isolated claims of budgetary sleight of hand during floor debate. This is ridiculous, swapping money from one pocket to another, saying you have it when you dont, said state Senator Kyle McCarter, a Republican from Lebanon, Illinois, a rural enclave nearly 300 miles southwest of Chicago. The Senate-passed legislation cannot be acted on by the House until Tuesday at the earliest when that legislative chamber is scheduled to reconvene. The respite for the states higher-education system comes after its community colleges received rating downgrades and  negative outlooks by Moodys Investors Service in recent weeks, and Chicago State University had faced the threat of possible closure.

Michigan lawmakers push forward $500 mln package for Detroit schools,"(Reuters) - The Michigan House of Representatives approved on Thursday a $500 million spending package for Detroits cash-strapped schools, which could run out of money to pay employees at the end of June. The legislation, which still needs approvals from the state Senate and Governor Rick Snyder, was passed early Thursday morning after hundreds of Detroit teachers called in sick over paycheck concerns. The move closed nearly all of the districts 97 schools on Monday and Tuesday.  Detroit school teachers returned to their classrooms on Wednesday following the sick-out after receiving assurances from officials that they will be paid for their work. The Detroit public school system, or DPS, has nearly 46,000 students. It has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency. This is the right plan to fix Detroits schools and give the city a good, working school system for the long term, said House Speaker Kevin Cotter in a statement. The DPS, the states largest public school system, will run out of money to pay employees after the fiscal year ends on June 30, the school systems state-appointed transition manager, former federal bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, has said. The spending package, which provides $500 million in aid to the school district, is less than the $715 million requested by Republican Governor Snyder and approved by the Republican-controlled Senate as part of a different plan. In a joint statement, the leaders of the city, state and national teachers unions called the legislation some of the most despicable anti-student, anti-public school, anti-teacher provisions weve seen in America. They called on Snyder to veto the bill passed by the Republican-controlled House if it reached his desk. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, said in a statement that previous state Senate bills aimed at funding the schools were a thoughtful attempt, but the House legislation will repeat past mistakes that included a lack of clear planning. Republican state Senator Goeff Hansen, lead negotiator on the Senate bills, said in a statement he had serious concerns with many aspects of the House legislation, but would work toward a bipartisan solution that he said must include compromise. Hansen spokesman Peter Wills said in an email that a schedule for reconciling the Senate and House bills has not been set. Rhodes called the passage of the legislation an important step in the right direction and said he supported talks between the House and Senate to resolve their differences.

"Trump's taco tweet baffles, riles social media users"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump celebrated Cinco de Mayo on Thursday by tweeting a photo of himself with a taco bowl and the caption: I love Hispanics, but the gesture was not to everyones taste.  ""Happy #CincoDeMayo!"" tweeted Trump (@realDonaldTrump). ""The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!""  Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Mexican defeat of the French during the Battle of Puebla in 1862.  The posting angered, baffled or amused some social media users, including Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, Trumps likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election.  ""'I love Hispanics!' Trump, 52 minutes ago,"" Clinton (@HillaryClinton) tweeted. ""'Theyre gonna be deported.' Trump, yesterday.""  Trump has struggled to gain the support of Latino voters since launching his presidential campaign last year with comments accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the U.S. border.  He has also vowed to deport all the illegal immigrants living in the United States and build a wall along the border with Mexico and have that country pay for it.

Not over yet: Reid cautions Democrats relishing Trump election battle,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For some Democrats, Donald Trump may seem to be a gift - set to steer Republicans into a trainwreck election in November - but senior Democrat Harry Reid said on Thursday he worried people might be too confident.  Am I concerned about it? Of course I am, the U.S. Senate Democratic leader said in a conference call with reporters.  I think this race could be a debacle for the Republicans, Reid added. But Im not taking anything for granted. Im not being over confident. Trump effectively clinched the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election this week after a primary battle that angered many - including in his own partys establishment - for his bombastic style and proposals such as building a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out Mexicans.  Some Democrats believe that divisive style makes him an easier opponent than some of the other 16 Republicans who started out in the race. Trumps Democratic opponent will likely be former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Reid, who is retiring from the Senate after this year, used his position as the Senates Democratic leader in 2012 to aggressively attack then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. During a teleconference to discuss Trump and Republican opposition to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, Reid made clear that he will perform in a similar role against Trump. By nominating Trump, I guess its the natural evolution of a party thats spent eight years defining itself entirely on what its against: anti-immigrant, anti-woman,...anti-Obama, anti-working people, said the senator from Nevada. Reid, who has called Trump a monster, said there should be a closer look at Trumps business dealings and called on the real estate developer to open up his tax records. Reid recalled some of his own campaigns in his political career that were lost or won by razor-thin margins, adding, I can speak from personal experience. You cannot be over-confident.

"Clinton calls Trump a 'loose cannon,' risky choice for president","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton took quick aim at presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday, saying the United States should not take a risk on an unreliable candidate. He is a loose cannon, and loose cannons tend to misfire, Clinton said in an interview with CNN, citing Trump stances including an allegation that climate change was a Chinese hoax.  Clinton, a former secretary of state, said Trump would have to offer policy specifics in ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election and criticized him for his positions on issues including nuclear weapons and abortion. He makes these grand statements and grand accusations, Clinton said of the real estate magnate and former reality TV star. At some point when youre running for president, you actually have to put a little meat on the bones. Youve got to tell people what it is youre going to do and how youre going to do it. Clinton lost the Democratic primary contest in Indiana on Tuesday but still looks set to win her partys nomination, leading her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, by more than 800 delegates. Trumps win in Indiana on Tuesday pushed his rivals out of the race and left him as the presumptive nominee. In a preview of the likely general election battle, Clinton laughed when asked if she was ready to take on Trump, saying: Oh, please. This is to me a classic case of a blustering, bullying guy who has knocked out of the way all the Republicans because they were just dumbfounded, she said. Clinton said she knew how to run a campaign against Trump and took a swipe at Trumps 16 Republican presidential rivals who started out in the 2016 campaign. They didnt know how to deal with him, Clinton said. They couldnt take him on the issues because they basically agreed with them. And they didnt know how to counterpunch. Asked how scorched-earth the campaign was likely to be, she replied: You know, hes the one making that decision. ... Hes the one whos run the campaign insulting people, demeaning women, degrading people with disabilities, talking about keeping Muslims out of the country, hes the one thats been running that kind of very negative, aggressive, bullying campaign.

Republican Trump's new finance chair previously donated to Democrats,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump named a national finance chairman for his presidential campaign on Thursday, picking an investor with little experience in campaigns but a long history of political donations, including to Trumps likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Steven Mnuchin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who now works in entertainment financing, is chairman and CEO of private investment firm Dune Capital Management LP. He is taking one of the first high-profile jobs in the campaign that Trump has filled. Trump, a real estate developer who this week became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for the November election, worked with Mnuchin in a business capacity before, the campaign said. Since 1998, Mnuchin has given about $71,000 to Democrats and their associated committees, compared to about $37,000 to Republicans.  Since Hillary Clintons campaign to be elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000, Mnuchin donated $7,400 to Clinton, according to the Federal Election Commission. He also gave $10,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2004. More recently, Mnuchin donated to Republicans, including $22,500 in 2012 to Mitt Romneys joint fundraising committee and another $4,800 to the former Republican nominees campaign. His history of donations to Democrats may well add to distaste for Trump among some establishment Republicans who have opposed the billionaires rise to likely presidential nominee on the grounds his proposals are not truly Republican. Trump said on Wednesday he will begin to raise money for his general election bid after self-funding a majority of his primary campaign. Fundraising will require a balance, especially since much of Trumps campaign message has rested on his refusal to raise money and his decision to self-fund his campaign during the party nominating contests. Historically, political parties have depended on the ability of their nominee to raise money in order to fund their other operations, including working to elect members of the House and Senate.  Trump said he will work closely with the Republican National Committee - which already has a fundraising operation - to help both his own campaign and those of other members of the party for the Nov. 8 election.     U.S. Representative Chris Collins of New York, who was the first lawmaker to endorse Trump, said the move to start raising money will help bring the party together. Youll see that pivot to the general election, which is uniting the party, and fundraising is a very big part of uniting the party, with the influence money has in elections these days, Collins told Reuters in an interview.

Scottish isle a world away from fireworks of native son Trump,"ISLE OF LEWIS, Scotland (Reuters) - Donald Trump has played up his family roots from Lewis, an island off the northwestern tip of Scotland, but his success in the U.S. Republican presidential battle has not drawn the kind of rapture the billionaire might like from his home crowd. Trumps mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, emigrated to the United States from the Lewis village of Tong in the early 1930s, and a visit from her property mogul son would certainly interest the friendly inhabitants of this weather-beaten isle.  But the kind of fiery oratory that has catapulted him to unexpected victories in the U.S. primaries might be taken with a pinch of salt, according to Tim Durbin, manager of the post office in the capital Stornoway. People here like proof and anything less than that is suspect, said Durbin, a 43-year-old American originally from Kentucky who has lived here for a decade. There would certainly be lots of talk about him after he left, but the talk would be subdued and the laughter would be gentle.  The islanders wariness is apparent when the New Yorkers name is mentioned; many smile politely and refuse to talk about him at all, making it difficult to gauge sentiment among the 20,000-strong population.  But even such silence is significant in a place of strong community ties, according to critically-acclaimed Lewis novelist Kevin MacNeil. If people from Lewis were genuinely supportive of Trump they would be more vocal in their views, he said. The lack of support for a grandson of the island speaks volumes. An exception is a Facebook page called Isle of Lewis supports Trump for President which has 84 likes. The businessman has become the presumptive Republican nominee with a headline-grabbing campaign in which he has traded insults with rivals. A suggestion Muslims should be banned from entering the United States drew criticism from Europe and led to the withdrawal of Scottish business and academic accolades. Trump argued last month, in a column in Aberdeens Press and Journal newspaper, that he had won over the skeptical people of Scotland through tenaciousness after he built his golf course despite environmental hurdles, local opposition and lawsuits. Scotland has already been won  and so will the United States, he wrote.  Trump called his Scottish business project a labor of love and his Trump International Golf Links website has a section dedicated to his Scots family genealogy.  It would be funny if Trump won. It might boost tourism, said Donald, a Lewis pensioner living near the MacLeod family seat. But only for a while, interjected his wife Anne, with the caution habitual of the island. The couple recalled that Trumps mother would visit from the United States in the summer, and Trumps millionaire father Fred would ship over a Cadillac to carry her around the marshy island during her stay. Youd end up in the ditch if you were trying to drive past them, I remember that, said Donald with a laugh. Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides island chain, is a picturesque place, dotted with lakes, hills and open tracts of moor and almost devoid of trees. A freezing gust can whip your breath away or a warm breeze can surprise you with its gentleness.  Trump stopped for a brief visit in 2008, jetting in on his private plane when he was trying to launch a golf business near Aberdeen in mainland Scotland and holding a news conference.  He has not returned since, although he has visited Scotland several times and runs two golf courses on the mainland, one in Ayrshire and another in Aberdeenshire.  He was then offered the possibility of an investment in Lews (sic) Castle, a run-down Victorian country house in Stornoway built by another millionaire, Sir James Matheson, when he bought the island in the mid-19th century. He just didnt think he was going to make any money out of it. He knows his roots are here but hes more interested in his golf investments elsewhere, said council official Nigel Scott.     People are not easily swayed in Lewis, where strong bonds between neighbors and family are necessary to withstand the harshness of rural life, said Calum Iain Macleod a Presbyterian minister from the parish where Mary Anne MacLeod was born. When the Atlantic is throwing a force 10 and you can barely stand and your windows are caked with salt, it is extreme and it is tough, he said. Being on this island where The Minch separates you from the center of gravity, you feel more vulnerable, he said, referring to a strait that separates the Outer Hebrides from the mainland. The influence of the Church itself, which is well-attended, also makes for a tranquil place. Sundays are still almost entirely commerce-free and pubs and hotels which serve alcohol are very few, in contrast to the rest of Britain. Trumps desire to recall his historic Scottish roots may have another purpose, suggests novelist MacNeil. Perhaps he simply wants a Scotland-shaped mirror to reflect back his own perceived glory.

"Automakers, states urge White House to reject plan to open spectrum","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 50 automakers, state transportation agencies and other groups urged the White House and other federal policymakers on Thursday not to open a portion of the wireless spectrum reserved for connected vehicles in the near future. The letter was signed by major auto trade groups representing nearly the entire auto industry, including Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Honda Motor Co. It came a week after a cable industry trade group and some tech companies, including Qualcomm Inc, and public interest groups urged the White House to take quick action to open the spectrum to more wireless devices. Automakers and companies seeking to use the 5.9 GHz unlicensed spectrum band for wireless devices have been sparring for several years. In January, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx sent a proposed regulation to the White House that would require all new cars to be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle technology that could eventually prevent up to 80 percent of crashes in which alcohol is not a factor. The proposal will not be final until approved by the White House and opened for public comment. The technology, which involves cars repeatedly sending wireless signals to each other, could help alert drivers if an oncoming vehicle may disregard a traffic light. It can detect threats from hundreds of yards away and indicate whether  vehicles can, for example, pass safely or make a left turn. One of the most  if not the most  significant advances in vehicle safety is now coming into existence. We urge you to stay the course and complete the action your administration has undertaken to improve the safety of drivers and passengers on Americas roadways, said the letter, signed by the auto and auto parts trade groups as well as the Michigan, California and Arizona state transportation departments and the National Safety Council and National Sheriffs Association. Automakers say vehicle-to-vehicle technology could also help speed self-driving cars to the roads. Last week in a separate letter to the Obama administration, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and other groups said the president needs to act quickly because as connected device use continues to skyrocket, the spectrum resources that power our devices are perilously insufficient. The groups urged speedy action. We must act now to find more unlicensed spectrum, they wrote. Michael Calabrese, director for wireless policy at New Americas Open Technology Institute, said the auto industry ignores the fact that their unused band has enough spectrum to deploy  and protect  both crash avoidance safety applications and next generation Wi-Fi. Dave Sullivan, an analyst at AutoPacific, said automakers have a lot at stake and have made significant investments in the technology. Its imperative that this spectrum not be encroached on, he said. In 1999, the Federal Communications Commission allocated 75 megahertz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for highway safety. But critics say the technology has not progressed much beyond the testing phase. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and Foxx agreed in January to conduct testing on whether the spectrum can be shared with wireless devices. The government officials said it is imperative to ensure the future automotive safety and efficiency of the traveling public that testing be completed before they make any decisions on sharing the spectrum.

Trump signals willingness to raise U.S. minimum wage," (This version of the story corrects the figure for the current minimum wage to $7.25 from $15 in paragraph two) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said on Wednesday he was open to doing something with the countrys minimum wage, but added that any increase would have to be weighed against a potential loss of competitiveness. Im open to doing something with it, Trump said in an interview with CNN, adding that he did not like the current $7.25 an hour level. I mean you have to something that you can live on. But what I really do like is bring our jobs back, so theyre making much more than the 15 dollars an hour, he added. ",politicsNews,"May 4, 2016 ",1
"U.S. tech firms urge presidential candidates to embrace trade, high-tech visas","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thirteen U.S. industry groups representing technology companies  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Uber Technologies Inc, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and others are pushing for the next U.S. president to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and to make it easier to hire high-tech workers from abroad, according to a joint letter seen by Reuters. Ahead of the Republican and Democratic conventions in July, the tech industry plans to issue on Wednesday an open letter charting a dozen policy recommendations for the candidates running in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The groups are not aligning themselves with either of the two major political parties. Backing for the TPP runs counter to positions taken by presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Trump has made criticism of international trade agreements and a call for tougher immigration policies central themes of his campaign.  In a Republican debate in March the billionaire real estate developer shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, saying he was softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country. Clinton has not said if she would try to renegotiate TPP, which was signed in February but has not yet got congressional approval. She has said she supports expanding the number of visas for high-skilled workers. Silicon Valley has struggled to notch policy wins in recent years on its legislative priorities, including immigration and patent reform, though the tech industry has succeeded in strengthening net neutrality protections and curtailing some government surveillance programs. The coalition letter, signed by groups including the Internet Association, Telecommunications Industry Association and Information Technology Industry Council, is the first time a wide range of technology trade organizations have staked out a common platform during a presidential campaign, according to a person familiar with its writing. The platform also calls for narrowly targeted government access to user data and recognition of encryption as a critical security tool. Trump has urged the restoration of the National Security Agencys (NSA) bulk collection of U.S. phone records, saying that U.S. authorities should err on the side of protecting national security over privacy concerns. Trump also urged a boycott of Apple during the companys high-profile clash earlier this year with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation over unlocking an encrypted iPhone linked to a San Bernardino, California gunman. Clinton has supported some reforms to the NSA and has said a balance needs to be found between privacy and security in the encryption debate. The letter also calls for preventing censorship online by limiting unreasonable third-party liability for speech, support for the sharing economy, and an updated and simplified tax code, among other issues. Signatories also include Allied for Startups, BSA The Software Alliance, Computing Technology Industry Association, Computer & Communications Industry Association, Consumer Technology Association, Semiconductor Industry Association, Silicon Valley Leadership Group, Software & Information Industry Association, Technology CEO Council and TechNet.

Trump wants to help U.S. businesses by lifting slew of regulations: CNBC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outlined economic policy initiatives on Thursday that he would pursue if elected to the White House in November, including refinancing longer-term U.S. debt, lowering taxes and scrapping a slew of federal regulations. The Manhattan real estate mogul said his aim would be to clear the way for U.S. businesses to succeed. Were lowering taxes very substantially and were going to be getting rid of a tremendous amount of regulations, Trump said in a wide-ranging interview with CNBC. The business people they talk about regulation more than they talk about taxes, he said. Trumps path to the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election became clear after a decisive primary victory in Indiana on Tuesday forced his two remaining rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, to drop out of the race. The candidate, who has never held elective office, has been pressed to provide more details on policy proposals. On Wednesday, he said he was open to doing something with the countrys minimum wage, but that any increase would have to be weighed against a potential loss of competitiveness. In the CNBC interview, the billionaire said he supported low interest rates for now and believed the United States should try to refinance some of its debt to help pay for infrastructure repairs. I would refinance debt. I think we should refinance longer-term debt, Trump said. Trump has experience in restructuring his business debt,  including two of his Atlantic City casino companies, and said he has been successful on that front.  Trump told CNBC he would not renegotiate U.S. bonds but would buy back at discounts, depending where interest rates are. Part of the problem is when a lot of this debt comes due,  what happens if the rates are high and we have no budget that can even conceivably take care of this, Trump said. If interest rates go up just 1 percent, Trump said, it would be devastating for the economy. I think there are times for us to refinance, refinance debt with longer term, he said. Because you know we owe so much money. Nobody talks about it - nobody talks about it until the bubble pops. And the bubble could pop, and it could pop and it could be ugly. Trump also warned about the downside of a strong U.S. dollar. I love the concept of a strong dollar, in many respects obviously I like a strong dollar. But when you look at the havoc that a strong dollar causes, he said on CNBC. While there are certain benefits, it sounds better to have a strong dollar than in actuality it is.

"UK PM Cameron says Trump policy on Muslims is wrong, will not apologize","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Thursday he would not apologize to Donald Trump after he became the Republican partys presumptive presidential candidate for calling his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States stupid and wrong. Cameron made the comment about Trump after the reality TV star and real estate developer vowed last December to ban all Muslims from entering the United States if he succeeded in his bid to become the next U.S. president. I wont change that view and I dont change that view and Im very clear that the policy idea that was put forward was wrong, is wrong and will remain wrong, so Im very clear about that, Cameron told reporters when asked if he would now apologize.  However, Cameron did pay tribute to Trump for effectively clinching his partys nomination this week after the departure of his two remaining rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Knowing the grueling nature of the primaries and what you have to go through, anyone who makes it through that extraordinary contest to lead their party into a general election deserves our respect, he said.

Trump's deportation plan could slice 2 percent off U.S. GDP: study,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps vow to round up and deport all of Americas undocumented immigrants if he is elected president could shrink the economy by around 2 percent, according to a study to be released on Thursday by conservative think tank the American Action Forum.  The research adds to concerns about the Republican presidential nominees policy proposals, which range from tearing up international trade agreements to building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.  About 6.8 million of the more than 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally are employed, according to government statistics. Removing them would cause a slump of $381.5 billion to $623.2 billion in private sector output, the Washington-based non-profit said in its analysis.  The study added that removing those workers could leave potentially millions of jobs unfilled due to a lack of legal workers willing to do them. Industries with the highest share of undocumented workers include farming, construction and hospitality, according to the research. The things Donald Trump has said are utterly unworkable, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the forums president, and the top economic adviser to Senator John McCains 2008 presidential campaign.  Asked about the study on Thursday, Trump said he thought the analysts misunderstood his immigration policy, adding he wanted people to come into the country if they came through the system. I saw that report and they dont even have it right, Trump said in an interview on CNBC. We certainly dont want to shrink our economy. Trump, who effectively locked up the Republican nomination this week, has called for the deportation of anyone living in the United States illegally, arguing foreign workers hold down salaries and contribute to unemployment.  That position has drawn strong opposition from business leaders like the conservative billionaire Koch brothers as well as from human rights advocates. Trump has further angered opponents by saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States, and by calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country to shore up national security.  But his hard-line stance on immigration also has triggered strong support among many U.S. voters.  Some 52.6 percent of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in September said they want to see most or all undocumented immigrants deported, compared with 34.6 percent who want to see most or all of them stay.  The American Action Forum analysis used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate the value of the output from undocumented immigrants.  The study did not factor in potential impacts of mass deportations on consumption, investment and other economic factors, the group said.  The U.S. economy is projected to produce some $18.7 trillion worth of goods and services in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. A loss of $400 billion in output would amount to about 2 percent of that figure. ",politicsNews,"May 5, 2016 ",1
Senator McCain says Trump would hurt own re-election bid: Politico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain told supporters in Arizona last month that having Donald Trump on the Republican presidential ticket would hurt his own re-election bid in Arizona, a state with a large Hispanic population, Politico reported on Thursday. If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote, no doubt that this may be the race of my life, McCain said, according to a recording of the event obtained by the news outlet.  Trump has alienated many Hispanics with his harsh rhetoric on immigration, including vowing to build a wall at the U.S. border with Mexico and calling some immigrants rapists.

"Trump supporters see Iraqi, Syrian refugees as major threat: report","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supporters of Donald Trump, the presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee, see refugees arriving from Iraq and Syria as one of the greatest threats to the United States, according to a study released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center. Eighty-five percent of respondents who said they supported Trump saw the refugees fleeing the Islamic State militant group as a threat, compared with 74 percent of Republicans overall, said the study. Only 40 percent of Democrats viewed the refugees from the region as a major threat.  Trumps campaign said in a statement last December that he was calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what is going on. His comments followed fatal attacks in Paris claimed by Islamic State and a deadly shooting spree in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple who the FBI said had been radicalized. U.S. President Barack Obamas promise to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year has sparked a backlash from Republicans, concerned that violent militants could come into the United States posing as refugees. More than 30 governors have tried to block refugees from their states. There are nearly 5 million registered Syrian refugees according to the United Nations, a result of a war in which more than 250,000 people have been killed.  The Pew report, based mostly on telephone interviews with about 2,000 U.S. adults from April 12 to 19, found that 65 percent of Trump supporters also saw the U.S. involvement in the global economy in a negative light. There were also contradictions among Americans when asked about U.S. defense spending and foreign military action. Although 35 percent of all respondents said they were in support of increasing defense spending, the highest level of support since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, almost 60 percent said other countries should deal with their own problems.  Respondents overall saw Islamic State as the top foreign policy concern, followed by cyber attacks and global economic instability, according to the report.  ",politicsNews,"May 5, 2016 ",1
Judge says Clinton may have to testify in email lawsuit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Washington on Wednesday ordered that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton may have to testify in a lawsuit related to the private email server she used while secretary of state.  U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan said the parties in the case, the State Department and conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, also struck an agreement about the scope of the testimonies that some of Clintons former top aides will give in the case. Those testimonies, known as discovery, will take place over the next eight weeks and may yield information that would require Clinton herself to be deposed, Sullivan said in an order.  Clinton has come under fire for using a private email account and server at her home in New York state for official emails when she was Americas top diplomat between 2009 and 2013.  Critics, including likely Republican presidential election rival Donald Trump, say she endangered government secrets and evaded transparency laws but the former first lady denies any wrongdoing. Judicial Watch brought a lawsuit against the State Department to gain access to records related to a Clinton aides employment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also probing her email arrangement. This is a very great victory for transparency and, despite the best efforts of the Obama administration and the Clinton camp, it looks like we might finally get some answers under oath about the Clintons illicit email system, said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch.        Sullivan gave Judicial Watch permission to take testimony from close Clinton aide Huma Abedin and others. They may be asked about the creation and operation of the private server but nothing unrelated to whether State conducted an adequate search in response to Judicial Watchs request for the emails, according to the court order.  It is not typical for a judge to grant discovery to a plaintiff in a Freedom of Information Act case, but Sullivan said in the order that the question remained whether the State Department provided all relevant documents to Judicial Watch.

Pot legalization supporters launch California ballot campaign,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Supporters of a drive to legalize recreational marijuana for adults in California said on Wednesday they had collected more than enough signatures to qualify the measure for the November ballot, formally launching their campaign to win over voters. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, leading a coalition of supporters that includes billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Sean Parker, said the campaign had gathered some 600,000 petition signatures, well above the 365,880 minimum required. The signatures must still be officially certified by state election officials, but you can rest assured this will be on the November ballot, Newsom told a San Francisco news conference to kick off efforts to build voter support for the initiative. The initiative, dubbed the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, would allow an individual aged 21 or older to possess and use as much as an ounce of marijuana for private recreational use, and permit personal cultivation of as many as six marijuana plants. The measure would also establish a system to license, regulate and tax sales of marijuana, while allowing city governments to exercise local control over or disallow commercial distribution within their borders. Opinion polls show attitudes have shifted more in favor of liberalized marijuana laws since California voters defeated a recreational cannabis initiative in 2010. California led the way in legalizing marijuana for medical purposes in 1996, with 22 other states and the District of Columbia following suit, although cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under U.S. law. Voters in four states - Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska - plus the District of Columbia, have gone a step further since 2012 in permitting recreational use for adults.   Opponents of liberalized marijuana laws have argued that such measures carry major public safety risks and would make pot more accessible to youngsters. But supporters of the California initiative said the measure included a number of provisions aimed at keeping marijuana out of the hands of minors, including a ban on marketing to children, explicit warning labels on cannabis products and safe-packaging restrictions. They also said hundreds of millions of dollars in state tax revenue from pot sales would be earmarked for substance abuse prevention and treatment, law enforcement and research.  One key organization backing the latest ballot measure is the NAACP civil rights group, which has embraced the argument that current marijuana laws have led to a disproportionate number of minorities being incarcerated for minor drug offenses.

"Connecticut readies austerity budget vote, aims to cut around $1 billion","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticuts lawmakers are aiming to pass an austerity budget for the coming financial year on Wednesday that cuts spending by nearly $1 billion as the state struggles with revenues that are falling well short of projections. Details of a deal reached between Governor Dannel Malloy and fellow Democrats were sparse early on Wednesday afternoon as budget staffers rushed to prepare the documents ahead of a vote later in the day. The budget for fiscal year 2016-2017, which starts on July 1, will cut spending by $830 million, divert $100 million from transportation and other funds and sweep $30 million from various agency accounts, said Adam Joseph, a spokesman for Connecticut Senate Democrats. The spending plan is aimed at closing a $960 million hole in next years finances that officials have blamed on falling capital gains tax receipts due to a volatile stock market. Malloy proposed an $18.14 billion general fund budget in February that cut discretionary spending but did not raise taxes. Since then the projected revenue shortfall for next year ballooned from $560 million to its current $960 million. The states legislative session ends at midnight on Wednesday but the budget vote could keep legislators up until the small hours. Both chambers of Connecticuts General Assembly are dominated by Democrats.  Connecticut, despite being one of the wealthiest states in the nation on a per capita income basis, has struggled to recover from the financial crisis and recession of 2007-2009. The state also faces a gap of around $260 million in the current fiscal year, despite a series of cuts. Malloy has said 2,000 state employees could be laid off in what he calls a new economic reality. The governor has also frozen pay rises for managers in state government.

Social service groups sue Illinois for $100 million over unpaid work,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Dozens of Illinois social service providers, starved of cash by the states long-running budget stalemate, sued Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and six statewide agencies on Wednesday, seeking more than $100 million for unpaid work since July. The plaintiffs, who provide services for sex-abuse victims, the homeless, senior citizens and at-risk youth, are suffering acute financial hardship as a result of the unresolved budget fight, according to the lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court. It is the latest attempt at judicial relief by groups hurt by the states record-setting, 11-month budget impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats controlling the legislature. The coalition of 64 organizations, calling itself Pay Now Illinois, contended that Rauners June 2015 veto of appropriation bills amounted to an unlawful impairment of the their constitutional right to seek a legal remedy for non-payment by the state of their various contracts. Weve had to deal with this uncertainty now for the 11th month, over 300 days, without being paid, said Andrea Durbin, chairwoman of Illinois Pay Now. Were seeking to be paid in full for the work weve done. Rauners office expressed empathy but urged state lawmakers to approve a spending plan. While we understand that frustration is driving many worthwhile organizations to seek solutions anywhere, including the courts, the only solution is for the General Assembly to pass a balanced, reform-oriented budget as soon as possible, Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said. In another budget-related development, a plan to change how Illinois taxes its residents and businesses stalled in the House of Representatives after a successful lobbying push by Rauner. The proposed constitutional amendment would have stricken the states flat income-tax rates and allowed state lawmakers to impose new, multi-tiered tax rates tied to an individual or companys level of income. Supporters said it would raise an additional $1.9 billion annually for the state. But facing a Wednesday deadline to pass the House, one of the measures sponsors, State Representative Christian Mitchell, said lobbying by the governors office convinced up to five Republicans whose backing was needed for passage to withdraw their tentative support.

"'Three Amigos' Obama, Trudeau, Pena Nieto to meet June 29","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will meet in Ottawa for a North American leaders Summit on June 29, the White House said on Wednesday. The Three Amigos summit, with two key U.S. trading partners, comes as Obama grapples with a wave of anti-free-trade sentiment that has stalled ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping 12-nation pact that includes Canada and Mexico. Obama hopes the U.S. Congress will ratify the deal before he leaves office on Jan. 20. But trade has become a lightning rod issue in the presidential election campaign to replace him. Republican Donald Trump, now his partys presumptive nominee for 2016, has attacked the TPP and describes the tripartite  North American Free Trade agreement as a disaster that needs to be renegotiated or broken. In the Democratic campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders has opposed the trade deal, and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has also expressed concerns. Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States and would suffer greatly if a future president moved to clamp down on free trade. Trudeau, asked how he would deal with a President Trump, said the leaders of both countries would always agree on the need for growth and prosperity. One important way to achieve this was through trade, he added. The level of integration between the Canadian and American economies is unlike anything else ... in the world, he told a news conference in Ottawa.    The last Three Amigos summit was in Toluca, Mexico in 2014. Canada was supposed to host the meeting early last year but canceled it amid tension between then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline. Obama will address Canadas Parliament during the visit, the White House said. He last came to Canada for a bilateral visit in February 2009, the first foreign trip of his presidency. Ottawas relations with Mexico are strained over Canadian rules, introduced under Harper, that impose visas for visiting Mexicans. Trudeau said he hoped to be able to announce within weeks that the requirement would be scrapped. ",politicsNews,"May 4, 2016 ",1
"Following Trump's win, Senate leader reaffirms Garland opposition","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday held firm on his refusal to act on President Barack Obamas nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court even as some conservative activists called on senators to confirm Merrick Garland now that Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The leaders position has not changed on Garland, McConnell spokesman David Popp told Reuters. Since Obama nominated Garland in March, McConnell has refused to allow a confirmation vote, saying it should be up to the next president to fill the courts vacancy left by the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Some conservatives on Wednesday urged the Senate to confirm Garland, a centrist federal appeals court judge, now that Trump appears in line to win the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. They are concerned Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton will defeat Trump in the election and pick a far more liberal nominee than Garland for a lifetime court appointment. Other conservative voices urged McConnell to hold firm, saying that doing otherwise would alienate core Republican voters, hurting the partys election chances in the fall. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who backs McConnells hard-line stance, has refused to hold hearings on Garlands nomination. With his victory in Tuesdays Indiana Republican primary, Trump solidified his position to land the partys presidential nomination at its July convention in Cleveland. His closest challenger, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, quit the race after being drubbed in Indiana. McConnell has repeatedly refused to say which Republican he supports for president. In an interview with Newsmax on Monday, before the Indiana vote, McConnell would say only that he intends to support the partys nominee, whomever that may be. Trump has said he would consult with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank on possible Supreme Court nominees if he is elected president. Leon Wolf of the conservative RedState website predicted that Republicans will lose the White House race in November with Trump as their nominee, and likely lose control of the Senate as well. Wolf wrote in a blog post, The choices, essentially, are to confirm Garland ... or watch as President Clinton nominates someone who is radically more leftist and 10-15 years younger than the 63-year-old Garland. But Erick Erickson, writing for the conservative website The Resurgent, said Republicans should resist the temptation because rushing to confirm Garland might further depress Republican (voter) turnout that is important to keeping the Senate under Republican control.

Maverick Mexico governor tips Trump to win U.S. presidency,"MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - A maverick Mexican state governor on Wednesday tipped presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to win the upcoming U.S. election, likening his own shock victory last year to the billionaires ascent. An outspoken rancher known as El Bronco (the gruff one), Jaime Rodriguez became the first independent governor in modern Mexico, capitalizing on widespread disaffection with established parties to win Nuevo Leon state on the U.S. border. I made a bet ... I said that Trumps going to win, Rodriguez said the day after Trumps main rival for the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz, dropped out of the race. Whats Trump doing? Hes taking advantage of the anger. The whole world says Trump is mad; thats what they said about me. Speaking in Nuevo Leons capital, Monterrey, Rodriguez said he was not a Trump fan, and would not vote for him if he had a ballot. But, he added, he had met with a group of Mexican migrants in the last few days who also told him they thought Trump would win. They had faith in a Trump presidency as the real estate mogul is known as a job creator, Rodriguez said. Once a member of Mexicos ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Rodriguez won a landslide election victory in one of the countrys wealthiest states last June after breaking with the PRI and running an anti-establishment campaign. The week after Rodriguezs victory, Trump launched his bid for the U.S. presidency, putting Mexico in his crosshairs and leaving the Mexican government struggling to come up with an effective strategy to counter his rhetoric. Claiming Latin Americas No. 2 economy is killing the United States on trade, Trump has threatened to disrupt bilateral commerce worth some $500 billion a year and punish companies that move operations offshore. He has also promised to deport millions of undocumented migrants from Mexico and Central America, and force Mexico to pay for a wall on the border between the two countries. Trumps path to becoming the Republican presidential nominee received a further boost on Wednesday when U.S. media reported his last remaining challenger, Ohio Governor John Kasich, was suspending his campaign. Rodriguez is seen by political analysts as a potential candidate for the Mexican presidency in 2018. ",politicsNews,"May 4, 2016 ",1
Chicago mayor vows fiscal fix before muni audience,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel tried to reassure municipal credit analysts on Wednesday that the city and its public school district are not falling into a financial abyss. I will not rest until we fix the fiscal position of both the city and (Chicago Public Schools), the mayor told the National Federation of Municipal Analysts annual conference. But some attendees said his speech did little to alleviate their worries about the citys sinking credit. Im very concerned. I dont see them making any headway, said Susan Dushock, a senior vice president at SunTrust Private Wealth Management, referring to an ongoing political impasse that is hindering Chicagos efforts. The battle between Illinois Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, and Democrats who control the legislature has left the state without a fiscal 2016 budget and has stymied Chicagos efforts to seek pension relief. Chicago continues to struggle with a structural budget deficit and a $20 billion unfunded pension liability. Rulings by the Illinois Supreme Court both this year and last year have made it much more difficult to enact pension changes to lower that liability. Emanuel likened those rulings to putting a straightjacket around us, but vowed to continue negotiating with unions to reach a deal that ensures pensions are paid in a manner that is responsible to taxpayers. He also touted the diverse economy of the nations third-largest city, its ability to snag relocating corporations, and educational improvements at schools. (Emanuel) didnt focus on how to solve the current fiscal crisis, said Richard Ciccarone, who heads Merritt Research Services. CPS is also betting on state solutions for escalating pension payments that have left it with a $1 billion budget gap. The district is calling for a bigger share of state funding to cover pensions and the costs of educating poor children. The city and CPS have been hit with downgrades that pushed their credit ratings closer to or into the junk level and both are paying a huge penalty in the U.S. municipal bond market. Chicago general obligation bonds due in 22 years were trading at 287 basis points over Municipal Market Datas benchmark triple-A yield scale, while the so-called credit spread for CPS bonds due in 15 years was 463 basis points, according to MMD.

Argentine TV ad mocks Trump to promote soccer tournament,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - An Argentine TV station is lampooning U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trumps comments about illegal immigration from Latin America to promote next months regional Copa America soccer tournament in the United States. Our country is in serious trouble! Trump says to ominous music in the commercial made by TyC Sports channel, which will broadcast the June 3-26 centenary tournament in the soccer-obsessed South American country. We are having people coming in through the border that are not people that we want, the candidate adds, against images of Lionel Messi and other top Argentine players descending from a plane and fans massed in national blue-and-white colors. The comments used in the advertisement are taken from Trumps speeches. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the 71-second spot.  The billionaire real estate mogul has caused indignation south of the U.S. border with his views on immigration and promise to build a great wall along the Mexican border.   Theyre coming from South America, Trump says in another clip from his speeches used by TyC, against a backdrop of Argentine stars from Sergio Aguero to Gonzalo Higuain pounding in goals against stumbling defenders. These are total killers, Trump says as the spot shows a close-up of Messi looking mean on the field. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think. We have no protection.  Argentina, which has not won the Copa America since 1993, is among the teams favored to win the tournament, as are Brazil and Chile. Theyre unchecked, and then theyre being sent all over the United States, Trump intones while the names of tournament host cities like Seattle and Houston flash on the screen.  At the end, the TyC ad shows a line of text, also in blue and white, that teasingly aligns itself with Trump: Its true. The best thing you can do is not let them in. This is the first year the tournament, referred to in English as the 2016 Centennial Copa America, will be hosted outside of South America. It also marks the 100th anniversary of the worlds oldest international soccer competition.

"Some Republican pundits, politicians remain defiantly #NeverTrump","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several Republicans took to social media Wednesday to declare they will never back Donald Trump for U.S. president even after Ted Cruz, the billionaire businessmans closest rival, dropped out of the race for the party nomination. The anti-Trump declarations came from a range of quarters, including at least one Republican U.S. senator and a number of political commentators who have been leading voices of the #NeverTrump movement that has resisted his candidacy. Trumps victory in the Indiana primary on Tuesday prompted Cruzs surprise decision to suspend his campaign and left Trump a largely uncontested path to securing the roughly 200 delegates he still needs to lock down the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Reporters keep asking if Indiana changes anything for me. The answer is simple: No, U.S. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said on Twitter. Sasse included a link to a February Facebook post in which he appealed to Trump backers to drop their support. Mark Salter, a former speech writer for Senator John McCain, said he would support former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, over Trump. The GOP is going to nominate for President a guy who reads the National Enquirer and thinks its on the level. Im with her, Salter (@MarkSalter55) tweeted, referring to a common rallying cry among Clinton supporters.  But the high-profile Stop Trump or Never Trump effort launched by conservative Republicans failed to significantly slow Trumps momentum and appeared not to have achieved its mission as the date nears for the Republicans convention in July. After Trumps Indiana victory on Tuesday night, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for the party to back Trump. @realDonaldTrump will be presumptive @GOP nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton, Priebus (@Reince) tweeted. Still, it was clear that Trump faces some difficulty bringing all Republicans on board. Bill Kristol, a neoconservative and editor of the Weekly Standard, offered a scathing retort to former House Speaker Newt Gingrichs call to back Trump. If youre for Trump you functionally are for a man unfit to be president, & for the degradation of [American] conservatism, tweeted Kristol (@BillKristol) early Wednesday. Never ever ever Trump. Simple as that, tweeted Tim Miller (@Timodc), former campaign communications director for Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the White House race earlier this year. Several Republican voters said on Twitter that they were changing their party affiliation, while some posted photos of their voter registration cards lit ablaze. ",politicsNews,"May 4, 2016 ",1
"Don't blame our sanctions, U.S. tells nervous Iran investors","ZURICH (Reuters) - Companies should not blame U.S. sanctions for stopping them investing in Iran, a State Department official told businesses on Wednesday, saying there were many other risks putting off would-be investors. The United States and Europe lifted sanctions in January under a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program, but U.S. sanctions unrelated to the nuclear issue remain, banning dollar transactions with Iran and making it harder for companies to access finance for business in the Islamic Republic. Jarrett Blanc, the State Departments deputy lead coordinator of last years nuclear deal, said companies should tell their Iranian partners that it was not just those remaining sanctions that were holding up business deals. Many times, in the past 100 days, we have found international firms who have said to Iran: Only U.S. sanctions are preventing you from doing business, Blanc told 400 people at a forum for European business with Iran in Zurich. But when we dig a little deeper, and seek to answer questions about precisely your concerns, it turns out that your business decisions, not surprisingly, in fact take into account concerns well beyond sanctions.  Iran has signed billions of dollars of deals with European firms since the nuclear sanctions were lifted, including a $27 billion aircraft order from Airbus. But deals requiring investment inside Iran have moved slowly. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most powerful figure in Iran, has blamed the delays squarely on the United States. The U.S. Treasury ... acts in such a way that big corporations, big institutions and big banks do not dare to come and deal with Iran, Khamenei said in March. Iranian businesses at the Zurich forum said European banks were staying away due to U.S. pressure, and said that could put European companies at a disadvantage to their Asian competitors. They are going to lose opportunities soon, Majid Ghassemi, president of Bank Pasargad, told Reuters. It is against the benefits of European investors, this kind of barrier that the Americans have put up against the banking system in Europe. Parviz Akbaroff, international business manager at infrastructure consulting company Rah Shahr, said European firms had become subservient to U.S. interests. While the United States does not prohibit foreign banks from doing business with Iran, many are wary after facing multi-billion dollar fines during the sanctions era.  Nonetheless, lawyers and consultants have consistently warned would-be investors of a wide range of other risks including complex regulations, unclear dispute mechanisms, labor issues, and corruption. Blanc said investors who acknowledge these concerns privately should communicate them to their Iranian partners. Dont take the easy way out, by just saying U.S. sanctions, U.S. sanctions, U.S. sanctions, he said. ",politicsNews,"May 4, 2016 ",1
How 'Stop Trump' failed to halt the Republican front-runner  ,"(Reuters) - Republican John Hammond III had made no secret of his distaste for Donald Trump and his desire to halt his march to the partys presidential nomination, telling the Indianapolis Star newspaper in March that the mogul was unfit to lead the country. But the Republican National Committee member, a partner at law firm Ice Miller, said no anti-Trump group ever reached out to him, nor did he see any evidence that such groups were in the state until just a few days before voting in Indianas primary election. By the time some direct mail and TV ads popped up, it was too late to make a difference, he said. There was never really any early Stop Trump effort in Indiana, he told Reuters. Trump became the Republican partys presumptive nominee on Tuesday with his resounding win in Indianas primary, which led his main rival U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas to drop out and heaped pressure on distant third-place contender John Kasich, the Ohio governor, to do the same. In the process, Trump dealt a seemingly fatal blow to the high-profile effort known as Stop Trump or Never Trump launched by conservative Republicans. The movement - led by the conservative anti-tax nonprofit Club for Growth and the Our Principles PAC - for months failed to significantly slow Trumps momentum and now appears to be on death watch, political operatives and at least three officials involved in the movement say. It emerged over the U.S. winter as initial skepticism over Trumps chances turned to anxiety among conservatives, who view many of the Manhattan real estate moguls policy pledges as a liberal threat to their low-tax, low-spending principles. But from the start it was hobbled by poor coordination, the lack of a single, influential public leader, and the absence of an agreed-upon alternative to Trump, according to leaders in the movement as well as Republican operatives familiar with it. You have to have a plan of action to deal with him, said Republican strategist Doug Heye, a Trump opponent who has ties to people in the movement. And it appears no one really did. Publicly, leaders in the Stop Trump movement dispute the notion that they were ineffective, saying their efforts in Wisconsin helped head off a Trump win in April. They also say the groups communicate effectively with one another and that they will continue fighting despite the Indiana results. We will continue to educate voters about Trump until he, or another candidate, wins the support of a majority of delegates to the Convention, Katie Packer, chair of the Our Principles PAC said in a statement on Tuesday.  But, in private, three top officials associated with the movement conceded that Indiana was a do or die moment. The movement suffered a major setback when Republican mega donors declined to play the role of Trump Slayers. Both casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, decided not to repeat their experience in 2012, when they lavished hundreds of millions of dollars on Republican candidates only to see no returns. Deprived of such major financial backers, Club for Growth and Our Principles PAC together spent only $27 million on anti-Trump messaging, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons campaign and Super PAC have spent at least $78 million so far, according to FEC reports.  The groups and their associates focused their messaging over the winter and spring on television and social media ads and Twitter blasts highlighting Trumps comments about women being bimbos, dogs and fat pigs, as well as his statements supporting universal health care and higher taxes.  Throughout their campaign, the two groups did not coordinate directly with one another or even converse on a regular basis, according to one Club for Growth official.  It wasnt until last week that Our Principles PAC and the Stop Trump effort in California, led by political consultant Rob Stutzman, even joined forces. Officials at Club for Growth said they werent aware of that California effort.  Some veteran Republican operatives said Our Principles PAC had been a waste of time and money.  Theyve had no leadership. Theyve spent tens of millions of dollars by now and gotten zero message, zero movement, said one Republican familiar with the workings of the movement. The whole thing has been a disaster from the beginning. Many donors, like Trumps rival candidates, underestimated the tycoon, believing he would burn out after his early successes, Republican consultants say. Those who did come forward publicly to support the Stop Trump movement, such as Chicago Cubs owners and Our Principles PAC funders Joe and Marlene Ricketts, were swiftly treated to Trumps social media wrath.  They better be careful, Trump said of the Ricketts in a Tweet in February. They have a lot to hide!  By March, other wealthy families who had donated to the cause wereasking reporters not to identify them in stories anymore because they didnt want their spouses and children to face abuse from the Trump campaign.  I dont think you can underestimate how effective Donalds bullying has been, even among wealthy donors, said one top official at Club for Growth. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski dismissed the notion that donors had been fearful, saying the identity of campaign contributors has long been public information.

"As Trump becomes presumptive nominee, China urges objectivity","BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Wednesday urged people in the United States to take a rational and objective view of the relationship between the two countries, after Republican front-runner Donald Trump became the partys presumptive presidential nominee. Trump has proposed that tariffs on imported Chinese goods be increased to up to 45 percent and asserted that China had waged economic war against the United States, taking American jobs. On Sunday, he compared the U.S. trade deficit with China to rape. China is the United States largest trading partner. Asked whether China was worried at the prospect of a Trump presidency, after his commanding win in Indiana and as top rival Ted Cruz bowed out of the race, Foreign Ministry spokesman said the election was as internal affair he could not comment on.  What needs to be pointed out is that the essence of Sino-US trade and business cooperation is mutually beneficial and win-win, and accords with the interests of both sides, Hong told a daily news briefing.  We hope people in all fields can rationally and objectively view this relationship, he added, without elaborating. Chinese officials have generally avoided criticizing Trump directly, though they have made indirect criticism of his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States and indirectly rebuffed his assertion that China is stealing U.S. jobs. However, last month Finance Minister Lou Jiwei criticized Trump, calling him an irrational type due to his tariffs proposal on imported Chinese goods. The United States reported a $366-billion trade deficit with China in 2015, up from $343 billion in 2014 - the largest U.S. trade imbalance with any nation. Chinas tightly controlled state media has largely stuck to reporting the facts about Trump, with some notable exceptions. In March, influential tabloid the Global Times accused Trump of being a racist, warning that other extremists, such as Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, had both been voted into power. Reacting to Trumps triumph on Wednesday, the official Xinhua news agency noted he could beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton if he toned down his explosive rhetoric. Despite being a celebrity outside the United States, Clinton, the former first lady and secretary of state, simply neither excites nor galvanizes her base, it said in an English-language piece. In a separate report, Xinhua said Trump gets them wrong, from trade balance to basic economics, citing Western media and academics dismissing his criticisms of trade with China. Trump attacks China to woo voters, it said.  ",politicsNews,"May 4, 2016 ",1
Former military intelligence chief advising Trump joins Drone Aviation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who has been advising Donald Trump informally on foreign policy, will join Drone Aviation Holding Corp as vice chairman of its board of directors, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Flynn, who was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014 and has since been advising Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, wants the United States to work more closely with Russia to resolve global security issues. Having evaluated the (companys) technologies, I believe they can positively impact our militarys defense and situational awareness and that is why I am joining Jay and his team in expanding the role of persistent aerial solutions in the marketplace, Flynn said in the statement, referring to company CEO Jay Nussbaum.  Drone Aviation develops and manufactures aerostats and electric-powered drones to give its customers enhanced surveillance and communication capabilities. The companys customers include the U.S. military, Saudi Arabia and the Ecuadorian Air Force, according to its website. Flynn resigned as the head of the Pentagons main intelligence agency a year before his term was officially due to end. He raised eyebrows among some U.S. foreign policy veterans when he was pictured sitting at the head table with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a banquet in Moscow late last year celebrating Russia Today, an international broadcasting network funded by the Russian government. He told Russia Today in an interview published on Dec. 10 that the United States and Russia should work together to resolve the Syrian civil war and defeat the Islamic State militant group. Flynns experience would help ensure that our tethered solutions, today and in the future, will continue to meet the needs of our soldiers and security forces at home and abroad as they respond to evolving threats, Nussbaum said in the same statement.

"Exiting 2016 race, Republican Cruz leaves himself a path forward","INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Ted Cruz carefully left the door open to a future run for president on Tuesday after a campaign that outlasted a long list of rivals but could not overcome the anti-establishment appeal of Donald Trump. Cruz, who still holds his U.S. Senate seat from Texas for another two years before facing re-election in 2018, told supporters in Indiana where he lost badly in the states primary, that his campaign was suspended but that his role in the future of the party was not over. I am not suspending our fight for liberty, Cruz said. He could be among several Republicans who may resurface in the 2020 presidential campaign after failed bids this time, should the presumptive nominee this year, Donald Trump, falter in the Nov. 8 election. The 45-year-old Cruz became a favorite of evangelicals and the partys conservative wing after he won Iowas caucuses, the first nominating contest of the race. He built the best organization of any other Republican campaign this year, but his zealous conservatism fell victim to Trumps outsider appeal. In the days leading up to the Indiana vote, Republicans were reminded of Cruzs take-no-prisoners approach in the Senate when former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called him Lucifer in the flesh and the most miserable son of a bitch he had ever worked with on Capitol Hill. The next test for Cruz will be determining what role he will play in the general election and whether, after months of attacks, he will throw his support behind Trump. Trump clearly would like his support as he tries to unite the Republican Party after a bitter primary battle. I want to congratulate Ted Cruz, Trump said in New York at a victory rally. Hes a tough, smart competitor. Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, gained prominence in conservative circles as the Texas solicitor general, arguing cases on religious liberty and states rights. After he was elected to the Senate in 2012, he alienated colleagues but drew national attention for his role in the 2013 government shutdown.  In a 21-hour talkathon, in which he sought to convince lawmakers to cut funding for President Barack Obamas signature health-care law, Cruz chided the cheap suits and bad haircuts of some politicians and read the childrens book Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss. Cruz cast himself as the leader of a grassroots conservative army when he jumped into the White House race in March 2015, and he argued he was the only candidate who could unite disparate groups of the Republican Party, such as social conservatives and libertarians. He was buoyed by early wins in Iowa and at home in Texas, and Cruz claimed he was the Republican best suited to take on Trump after candidates favored by the partys establishment, such as Jeb Bush, left the race. As Cruz ended his campaign, vendors hawking campaign-themed apparel outside the Indianapolis event quickly discounted the merchandise bearing Cruzs campaign slogan, lowering prices from $20 a shirt to just $5. Supporters lingered in the remodeled train station where Cruz held his rally, some crying and others hugging one another as the news sunk in. Despite having long odds when he announced his candidacy, Cruz beat expectations.      Cruz certainly performed better than anyone in Washington expected, and he still has Texas wired. However, no one is stopping the Trump machine now, Texas-based Republican strategist Joe Brettell said. ",politicsNews,"May 4, 2016 ",1
California senate approves bill ending mandatory prostitution sentences,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California would repeal mandatory jail time for convicted prostitutes under a bill approved by the state Senate amid growing concern that many are victims of human trafficking or addicts who need treatment. The measure by Senator William Monning, a Democrat, reflects a growing national conversation about whether people who exchange sex for money should be viewed as victims rather than as criminals, along with a movement in California to end mandatory sentencing for non-violent offenders. As we learn more, particularly about women who engage in prostitution, were learning more and more about human trafficking, Monning said. There is also an intersection with drug and alcohol use. His bill, which the Senate voted to approve on Monday, would end the states mandatory sentences for repeat prostitution offenders, which currently call for a minimum of 45 days in county jail for a second offense, and 90 days for a third offense. Jail time for the misdemeanor crime is not mandated for first offenders. The bill is one of about 40 trafficking-related measures before California lawmakers this session, according to the office of California Attorney General Kamala Harris. One of them, backed by Harris, would create an inter-agency task force to seek data on trafficking and develop new ways of responding to it, including new law enforcement approaches. The National Organization for Women is backing several human trafficking-related measures before lawmakers this year, and is reviewing Monnings bill, said Jerilyn Stapleton, president of the National Organization for Womens California operations.     Monnings proposal, which passed the Senate 23-14 and now goes to the Assembly, also comes amid a nationwide movement to reduce the number of non-violent offenders who are imprisoned that has won support by many Republicans as well as Democrats. California Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, is backing a ballot initiative that would roll back some mandatory sentencing guidelines, saying the system has taken discretion away from judges and ultimately contributed to recidivism by providing inmates with little incentive for rehabilitation.

Puerto Rico could face financial chaos without Congress plan: Lew,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday said Puerto Ricos financial crisis risks turning the commonwealth into a chaotic mess unless the U.S. Congress can enact a plan to restructure its debt. The challenge is for Congress to act fast enough so that the unfolding crisis in Puerto Rico doesnt cascade out of control, Lew said during an on-stage interview at the annual Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles. The island faces $70 billion in debt overall, a staggering 45-percent poverty rate and a shrinking population. It owes another $1.9 billion on July 1 that Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla says it cannot pay. On Monday the Government Development Bank defaulted on a $422 million debt payment while it agreed to a tentative restructuring framework with some large creditors who promised to hold back from taking legal action for 30 days. Congress is debating a bill to put the islands finances under federal oversight and allow it to restructure debt in a bankruptcy-like process. The bill has faced criticism from conservative and liberal wings of both parties. Lew reiterated there was so far little spillover from Puerto Ricos problems into the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market where it is a major issuer of triple-tax-free debt. In the absence of a restructuring, what you will end up with is a chaotic unwinding which does enormous harm to millions of Americans, including veterans who served loyally in our military. That I believe is something that has more of a potential spillover risk to the municipal bond market than anything else, Lew said. As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico cannot file for bankruptcy protection. It is struggling to pay for basic services like police and firefighters as well as combat the spread of the  Zika virus. Lew reiterated that putting in place an independent oversight authority to work out an orderly restructuring would also ensure fairness to all stakeholders. Some investors are concerned that if all bondholders are treated the same, there is a risk of eroding well established rules governing who gets paid and when in a restructuring. The cost of delay is that you get to a point where there is nothing to restructure. If you get to a point where the restructuring cant work, then you either let chaos happen or you have a bailout. I believe restructuring is the alternative to a bailout, Lew said.     ",politicsNews,"May 3, 2016 ",1
Illinois House backs Democratic redistricting amendment,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A Democratic bid to transfer the highly coveted political power of drawing legislative boundaries from state lawmakers to the Democratically controlled Illinois Supreme Court overwhelmingly passed the state House of Representatives on Tuesday. The proposed amendment to Illinois constitution sailed through the House on a 105-7 vote and now must be approved by a three-fifths majority in the state Senate by Friday in order to be placed on the Nov. 8 general election ballot. Since Democrats controlled the state legislature and the governors office after the 2010 census, they won the once-a-decade right to draw new legislative district boundaries. The process enabled the party to build super-majorities in both the Senate and House. The power we presently have is only to protect incumbents, said Representative Jack Franks, a Democrat from Chicagos far northwest suburbs who sponsored the amendment. Republican Governor Bruce Rauner campaigned to take away legislative redistricting responsibilities from the General Assembly but instead backs a different proposal. Under Franks plan, the Illinois Supreme Court would appoint an eight-member redistricting commission to oversee the drawing of 118 House districts and 59 state Senate districts beginning with the 2022 elections. Critics disliked how Franks amendment mutes the General Assemblys voice in the process. Whats dangerous about what were doing (is that) we as a legislative branch are ceding our authority to a co-equal branch of government, said Representative Christian Mitchell, a Chicago Democrat who voted against the amendment. If the plan clears the Senate, the result could be two competing redistricting proposals on the fall ballot, a scenario Rauner has warned would confuse voters. The initiative Rauner backs is being pushed by a bipartisan coalition that includes Republican former Governor Jim Edgar and former White House Chief of Staff William Daley, brother and son of two of Chicagos longest-serving Democratic mayors. That group, known as Independent Maps, proposes a system where a bi-partisan, 11-member commission would be stocked through a random and public screening process overseen by the state auditor general from a pool of 100 finalists.

Clinton vows to support U.S. coal regions while embracing cleaner energy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday said the United States must move toward a cleaner energy future but not forget those who work in the coal industry. Weve got to both move toward a clean energy future ... but we also have to remember who turned on the lights and powered the factories and provided the energy that we needed to build our country, Clinton said, speaking from West Virginia in an interview with MSNBC.

Cruz unleashes fury at Trump over Lee Harvey Oswald comment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz lashed out at rival candidate Donald Trump on the day of Indianas primary on Tuesday, calling him a pathological liar, narcissist and bully after the front-runner linked Cruzs father to John F. Kennedys assassin. Im going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump. This man is a pathological liar. He doesnt know the difference between truth and lies, Cruz told reporters in a scathing indictment. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And...his response is to accuse everybody else of lying. In a television appearance earlier, Trump linked Cruzs father, Rafael Cruz, to Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, citing a report by National Enquirer, a supermarket tabloid known for celebrity gossip and alien sightings. You know, his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswalds being  you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody brings it up, Trump said on Fox & Friends.  Republicans in Indiana might give New York billionaire Trump an almost unstoppable advantage in his turbulent journey toward the partys presidential nomination.  The real estate mogul holds a double-digit polling lead in the Midwestern state over Cruz, a U.S. Senator of Texas.    Cruz denounced the Enquirer and its chief executive, David Pecker, who has endorsed Trump, for claiming his father, a Cuban immigrant to the United States, was pictured handing out pro-Fidel Castro literature with Oswald in New Orleans in 1963. Yes, my dad killed JFK, he is secretly Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his back yard, Cruz said in a sarcastic retort. Cruz also unleashed fury over Trumps earlier comment about his wife, Heidi. Donald has a real problem with women. Donald is terrified by strong women - he lashes out at them, Cruz said.  The man is utterly amoral. Morality does not exist for him, Cruz said.

Ex-N.Y. legislative leader Silver sentenced to 12 years in prison,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, for decades one of the states most powerful politicians, was sentenced on Tuesday to 12 years in federal prison for collecting millions of dollars in illegal kickbacks. U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan federal court said she hoped the penalty would cause the next corrupt politician to hesitate before accepting a bribe. The prison term could amount to a life sentence for the 72-year-old Silver, who fought prostate cancer last year. The sentencing capped a stunning fall from power for Silver, a Democrat who represented Manhattans Lower East Side and served as speaker of the state Assembly from 1994 to 2015. Silvers counterpart in the state Senate, former Majority Leader Dean Skelos, was also found guilty of corruption just 10 days after a jury convicted Silver of seven counts in December. The legislative leaders were two of the three men in a room, along with the governor, who control virtually all legislation in the state capital of Albany. Their convictions represented the biggest wins in a broad anti-corruption campaign by Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, who has charged numerous politicians with graft. Todays stiff sentence is a just and fitting end to Sheldon Silvers long career of corruption, Bharara said in a statement following the hearing. More than 30 legislators have been forced from office for criminal or ethical issues since 2000, according to the nonprofit watchdog Citizens Union. Prosecutors said Silver awarded $500,000 in secret state grant money to a cancer researcher who, in exchange, funneled patients to Silvers law firm, allowing the lawmaker to collect millions of dollars in referral fees. He was also accused of steering real estate developers to another law firm in exchange for kickbacks and then throwing his support to rent-control legislation favored by the developers. Silver offered an apology during the hearing, saying: Ive let down my family, Ive let down my colleagues, Ive let down my constituents, and I am truly, truly sorry for that. Minutes later, he appeared to have no reaction when Caproni announced the sentence. His lawyers said they plan to appeal his conviction. Steven Molo, one of Silvers lawyers, had asked Caproni for a sentence that tempers justice with mercy, citing Silvers age, health and what he described as a lifetime of good works for the people of New York. But prosecutors said Silver deserved a sentence longer than that of any other convicted New York public official, given his leadership position and the sheer scope of his misconduct. Caproni agreed, telling Silver that corruption attacks the very heart of our system of government before offering a blunt assessment of his behavior. Mr. Silver, those are not the actions of a basically honest person, she said after listing some of his crimes. Those are the actions of a scheming, corrupt politician.     The judge also ordered Silver to pay a fine of $1.75 million and forfeit more than $5 million in ill-gotten gains. He is scheduled to report to prison on July 1. ",politicsNews,"May 3, 2016 ",1
House panel near unveiling new Puerto Rico debt bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to help Puerto Rico deal with its $72 billion debt crisis is being finalized by a U.S. Congress committee following negotiations with the Treasury Department, House Speaker Paul Ryans office said on Tuesday. The House Natural Resources Committee has been struggling to write a bill restructuring Puerto Ricos debt. There has been speculation that it could try to unveil a new bill, after a previous one sputtered, when Congress returns next week from a recess. The statement from Ryans office came one day after the White House said Puerto Ricos financial difficulties were worsening and that Congress needed to act quickly with a debt restructuring bill. Parish Braden, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Committee, said the panel was still making refinements to the legislation, but he added: The basic framework will not change from an earlier version. Braden said he was referring to the potential creation of a control board to help Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, manage its debt. Over the past few weeks, Treasury Department officials have been negotiating the details of a bill that they hope can draw enough support from Democrats and Republicans to pass the House and Senate.

Kansas budget woes weigh on state's credit ratings,"(Reuters) - Moodys Investors Service on Tuesday slapped a negative outlook on Kansas Aa2 credit rating, citing the states reliance on one-shot measures to balance its budget. That followed action late last month by Standard & Poors, which put Kansas AA rating on review for a possible downgrade after the state lowered its revenue estimates for the current and next fiscal year by $228.7 million. Governor Sam Brownback plans to divert $185 million in sales tax revenue from the state highway fund to the general fund and delay a $96.5 million fiscal 2016 pension payment to help fill the gap.  By continuing to balance its budget with unsustainable, nonrecurring resources, including pension underfunding, it is accumulating large and expensive long-term liabilities that it will be paying off for a long time, Moodys said in a statement. The credit rating agency also revised the outlook on $2.1 billion of Aa2-rated Kansas highway revenue bonds to negative from stable. The Kansas budget is feeling the effects from action taken by Brownback and the Republican-controlled legislature in recent years to cut corporate and other income taxes to help the state compete with bordering Missouri and other states for business development and jobs.   The states fiscal year begins on July 1. ",politicsNews,"May 3, 2016 ",1
Bill allowing guns on Tennessee campuses becomes law,"NASHVILLE (Reuters) - Educators and other full-time staffers at Tennessees public state universities and colleges will soon be able to carry handguns on campus after Governor Bill Haslam allowed a bill to become law on Monday without his signature. The bill that the Republican governor allowed to become law had little opposition in both houses, easily passing 69-24 in the House and 28-5 in the Senate last month. The law will go into effect on July 1.  The law, which affects 50 state institutions, was opposed by both the State Board of Regents and the University of Tennessee system. Gun control on college campuses is a growing focus in the national debate over access to guns.  Including Tennessee, 10 states now allow guns on campus, although the Tennessee and Arkansas laws allow only faculty and staff to carry handguns, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks policies in all 50 states. In Georgia, Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican, is expected on Tuesday to either sign or veto a measure that would allow licensed gun owners ages 21 and over to carry concealed handguns on the campuses of public colleges and universities in that state. On Aug. 1, 2016, a so-called campus carry law takes effect in Texas, allowing people 21 and older with a concealed handgun license to carry handguns in classrooms and buildings throughout the University of Texas system. In Tennessee, anyone carrying a gun under the new law must have a permit and notify local police or campus security, whichever has responsibility for law enforcement on campus. Students are not allowed to carry handguns on campus. The law does not allow handguns to be carried into arenas and stadiums during school-sponsored events, and guns are barred in meetings related to disciplinary or tenure matters. Haslam had said he did not believe the state should get involved in such local matters, but chose not to veto the bill. Although SB 2376 does not go as far as I would like in retaining campus control, the final version of the bill included input from higher education and was shaped to accommodate some of their concerns, he said in a Monday statement. Proponents said the bill will lead to greater safety on campuses. Opponents voiced concern about the safety of students, faculty and visitors on campus. ",politicsNews,"May 3, 2016 ",1
Obama says Chinese-led trade deal shows need for TPP: Washington Post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday that a Chinese-led regional trade deal demonstrated the urgent need for Congress to approve the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. Obama has been pushing to finalize the TPP before he leaves office on Jan. 20, but he needs to overcome strong anti-trade sentiment from both the left wing of his own Democratic Party  as well as from the right flank of the Republican Party. Voter anxiety over the impact of trade deals on jobs and the environment has featured large in the campaigns of Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for the Nov. 8 presidential election, and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. In an opinion piece published on the website of the Washington Post on Monday, Obama said he understood voter skepticism but that building walls to isolate ourselves from the global economy would backfire on the American economy. China is negotiating a trade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the world at our expense, putting American jobs, businesses and goods at risk, Obama said in the piece. Obama was referring to the 16-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, and noted that China was seeking to finalize the deal by the end of the year. That trade deal wont prevent unfair competition among government-subsidized, state-owned enterprises. It wont protect a free and open Internet, Obama said, also criticizing the RCEPs lack of protections for intellectual property, labor standards and the environment. Obama, who plans a visit to TPP partners Japan and Vietnam later this month, argued the TPP would allow America to call the shots on trade with Asia. Thats why my administration is working closely with leaders in congress to secure bipartisan approval for our trade agreement, mindful that the longer we wait, the harder it will be to pass the TPP, he said. Asked about Obamas comments, Chinas Foreign Ministry said global trade rules should be discussed by all countries, not just set by one. China has an open attitude towards TPP, which should be promoted together along with RCEP to help achieve the goal of a free trade zone in the Asia Pacific, ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing in Beijing.

Indiana puts Donald Trump’s evangelical support to test,"INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - Donald Trumps success in the race for the White House may well depend on the support of Republican evangelicals suspicious of the front-runners more liberal side as he discloses his social views. A New York businessman who has never held public office, Trump has had some success with evangelicals in states such as South Carolina.  But there are signs of slippage on the eve of Tuesdays nominating contest in Indiana, a conservative Midwestern U.S. state that has voted Republican in nine of the last 10 presidential elections. Trump, 69, has taken stances on Planned Parenthood family clinics and gay and transgender rights that raise Christian conservative concerns, including in such states as Indiana where they make up a high proportion of voters. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist opinion poll shows Trump with a wide lead in Indiana, 49 percent, to 34 percent for his nearest rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and 13 percent for Ohio Governor John Kasich.     Most previous Indiana opinion polls showed a tighter race with Trump leading Cruz by only a few points. A Trump win in the state could be crucial to his chances of securing the nomination but may also offer a gauge of whether he can rally evangelicals. Cruz, 45, emphasizes his Christian faith on the campaign trail. Focused on Indiana, he says Trump is not an authentic Republican. A new Cruz advertisement brands Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as two sides of the same coin. Both support the Obamacare individual mandate. Both support taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. Both support letting transgender men go in little girls bathrooms, it says.  Trump has praised Planned Parenthood family clinics as having helped millions of women even if he opposes funding its abortion component. He backs letting transgender people use the bathroom they feel is appropriate. If evangelicals are unenthusiastic, they could sit out the Nov. 8 general election, potentially handing the White House to former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, or her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. The fear is a lot of them are going to stay home, said Bob Vander Plaats, a leading evangelical activist in Iowa. You cant win without our base. Trump rankled some social conservatives by criticizing North Carolinas controversial law that requires transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender of their birth. The restroom thing is big with a lot of people, said Shan Rutherford, a pastor in Greenwood, Indiana. Rutherford said he was initially drawn to Trumps message, but was put off by his stance on social issues and his insulting demeanor on the campaign trail. Rutherford, who backs Cruz, said if the White House race came down to Trump versus Clinton, he might not vote. The Pew Research Center says 45 percent of registered Republican voters nationwide identify themselves as born-again or evangelical. Pew also found that only 44 percent of Republicans view Trump as a religious person. By contrast, 76 percent viewed Cruz that way. Cruz has assailed Trump for his stance on the North Carolina bathroom law. Trump has said there have been few problems with transgender people using bathrooms. He also has said the question should be left to states to decide. Cruz charges allowing grown men in bathrooms with little girls is opening the door for predators. On Friday, Cruz was endorsed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a social conservative who last year signed a bill that critics said could be used by business owners to deny services to same-sex couples. Trump has said he supports prohibiting companies from firing employees based on sexual orientation, although he has criticized last years U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Cruz has deployed his father, Rafael Cruz, an evangelical minister, as a surrogate in churches in Indiana. A Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll showed 19 percent of respondents would not vote in a White House race between Trump and Clinton. But when filtered to those who attend church nearly every week, the number jumped to 28 percent. The party cannot afford a low turnout in November.  Demographic trends in recent years have favored Democrats, with the pool of Republican voters, overwhelmingly white and older, steadily shrinking. Eric Houseman, a paramedic from Indianapolis who attended a Cruz rally in Franklin, Indiana, predicted Trump would lose support through such missteps as inaccurately referring in January to a book of the Bible as Two Corinthians rather than Second Corinthians or Corinthians II. People are beginning to see hes a lot of talk, Houseman said. Upstate, Ron Johnson, pastor at the Living Stones Church in Crown Point, votes Republican but was adamant that he would not vote for Trump. Trump does not share his Christian values, Johnson said.  I am not going to be part of the demise of this country, he said. But Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor who has become a leading Trump surrogate in the media, said Trumps appeal to evangelicals does not stem from the strength of his religious views. Were not voting for the next pastor. Were voting for the next commander-in-chief, Burns said. ",politicsNews,"May 2, 2016 ",1
Clinton courts Appalachian voters to counter Trump on trade,"WASHINGTON/CARMEL, Ind. (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton met with coal and steel workers in the Appalachian region on Monday in an effort to win over blue-collar voters in a part of the country with strong support for Republican Donald Trump. The real estate mogul made his own pitch on Monday to voters in areas struggling from the loss of industry, telling a crowd in Indiana he would create clean coal jobs. Clinton has increasingly turned her attention beyond the Democratic Party nomination fight with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and is making early moves to try to siphon support from Trump ahead of a possible match-up in the Nov. 8 election. On Monday, she met union leaders and some of the 600 workers who were laid off last year when AK Steel Holding Corp announced it would idle a furnace in eastern Kentucky. She said jobs losses in manufacturing and the coal industry in the area had been a heavy blow. Talk about a ripple effect. Its just devastating communities, Clinton told workers around a table at an Italian restaurant in the town of Ashland.  While the Republican presidential candidates focus on Tuesdays primary contest in Indiana, Clinton launched a trip to Appalachia this week that will include events in Ohio and West Virginia.     She has a large lead over Sanders for the Democratic nomination. Unions typically back Democratic candidates, and union leaders have endorsed both Clinton and Sanders in the 2016 presidential race.  But Trumps pro-coal, anti-trade message and outsider status has resonated with some blue collar union members frustrated with Washington politicians. He and other Republicans also accuse President Barack Obamas administration of waging a war on coal by imposing strict environmental regulations. Im a free-market guy, but not when youre getting killed, Trump said at a rally in Carmel, Indiana. Look at steel, its being wiped out. Your coal industry is wiped out, and China is taking our coal.     The New York businessman won the Republican nominating contest in Kentucky in March, sweeping most of the counties in the economically struggling east of the state. Parts of Appalachia, a region that spans multiple states across the eastern United States, have struggled with poverty and job losses. West Virginias unemployment rate of 6.5 percent in March was well above the national rate of 5 percent, according to Labor Department data. Ohios unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, while the figure in Kentucky was 5.6 percent. It will be an uphill struggle for Clinton there if she wins the nomination. She has pledged more than $30 billion to help regions that depend on coal, but her promise was overshadowed when she said in March that the country would put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. And her husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned on Sunday in West Virginia, encountering protests from Trump supporters.   West Virginia last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for his second four-year term. He is the only Democrat who has won Kentucky since 1980. Trump will take a leap toward winning the Republican nomination if he comes out ahead in Tuesdays Indiana primary. His success in the race for the White House may well ride on the support of Republican evangelicals. Top rival Ted Cruz planned stops to greet voters across the state on Monday, running into a group of Trump supporters in Marion, Indiana who berated him. He deployed his wife, Heidi, and Carly Fiorina, the ex-candidate who Cruz has chosen as his running mate if he gets the Republican nomination, to a coffee shop and art gallery in Carmel, Indiana. Cruz, who lags Trump in delegates to the Republican National Convention in July, told reporters on Monday he would stay in the race as long as we have a viable path to victory. Republicans plan to tie Clinton to what they say is an anemic economy under President Barack Obama. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Monday cited data released last week that showed economic growth slipped in the first quarter to its slowest pace in two years. Struggling Americans will never get ahead under Hillary Clinton. They are going to keep getting taken to the cleaners, Priebus said in an opinion piece for RealClearPolitics.

Pakistan raps Trump over vow to free doctor who helped track bin Laden,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan angrily criticized Donald Trump, frontrunner for the U.S. Republican presidential nomination, for saying he would force the country to free a jailed Pakistani doctor believed to have helped the CIA hunt down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire real estate developer, told Fox News on Friday that, if elected, he would get Pakistan to free Shakil Afridi in two minutes, saying that Islamabad receives a lot of development aid from the United States. Contrary to Mr. Trumps misconception, Pakistan is not a colony of the United States of America, Pakistani Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar said in a statement on Monday. The statement said Afridis fate would be decided by the Pakistani courts and the government of Pakistan and not by Mr. Donald Trump, even if he becomes the president of the United States. The statement came on the fifth anniversary of the killing of bin Laden - architect of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. cities - during a secret raid in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad that damaged relations between the strategic allies. Washington views Afridi as a hero but Pakistan sentenced him in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to militant group Lashkar-e-Islam, which he denies. That sentence was overturned and Afridi is now awaiting trial on another charge. Trump has alarmed U.S. allies with his combative rhetoric and his calls for an America First agenda that many see as a threat to retreat from the world. In his comments about Pakistan and Afridi for Fox News, Trump said: I would tell them let (him) out and Im sure they would let (him) out. Because we give a lot of aid to Pakistan. Afridi has also been accused in Pakistan of running a fake vaccination campaign in which he purportedly collected DNA samples to help the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) track down bin Laden. He has not been charged over those allegations. After his original conviction was overturned, he was charged in 2013 with murder relating to the death of a patient eight years earlier. He remains in jail. In the Fox interview Trump also said he supported leaving the roughly 10,000 U.S. troops still based in Afghanistan instead of withdrawing them by the end of 2017. I would stay in Afghanistan, he said. Its probably the one place we should have gone in the Middle East because its adjacent and right next to Pakistan which has nuclear weapons. The United States led the military invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 to oust the Taliban for sheltering bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders following the Sept. 11 attacks.

Obama takes Supreme Court fight to Republican senators' home turf,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday took the political battle over his pick for a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court to the home states of seven Republican senators up for re-election in November. Obama conducted interviews with local television anchors where he argued that Republican senators should hold confirmation hearings and vote on his nomination of appellate Judge Merrick Garland to the top court. What my argument is: Let the American people see Judge Garland, let him answer questions, let them hear his responses, the Democratic president told WDAF-TV FOX 4 in Kansas City, Missouri, a market that straddles states where Senators Roy Blunt of Missouri and Jerry Moran of Kansas are up for re-election. Republican leaders have been resolute that Obamas successor, who will be elected on Nov. 8 and take office on Jan. 20, should fill the vacancy left by Februarys death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans are hoping their partys candidate wins the presidency and can make the appointment. The court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals, meaning Scalias successor could influence its ideological direction for years to come.     Obama has argued the Senate has a responsibility to formally consider Garlands nomination, telling ABC affiliate WMUR in Manchester, New Hampshire, that the judge was maybe the most qualified nominee that weve seen before the Senate for a Supreme Court seat. New Hampshires Kelly Ayotte is viewed as one of the most vulnerable Senate Republican incumbents. She met with Garland but wants the Senate to wait until after the election to act on the nomination. I know that folks like Senator Ayotte met with him and the fact that theyre not calling a hearing or vote means theyre not doing their job, Obama said in the interview. In a separate interview with WMUR, Ayotte defended her position. In my view waiting for the election, we are in the midst of a presidential nomination process, to have the people weigh in the election in November is important considering we have a 4-4 court, she said. Obama also talked with a television anchor from Iowa, home to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who has helped lead efforts to block Garland. The president spoke as well with anchors from Ohio, where Senator Rob Portman faces a competitive re-election race; Wisconsin, where Senator Ron Johnson is running again; and Phoenix, home to Senator John McCain of Arizona.

Wrestling body revokes ex-House Speaker Hastert's awards,"(Reuters) - The National Wrestling Hall of Fame on Monday revoked all awards bestowed upon former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert after he admitted in court to sexually abusing students years ago when he was a high school wrestling coach. The organizations board of governors unanimously voted for the revocation after an ethics committee found Hasterts actions to be detrimental to the ideals and objectives of the Wrestling Hall of Fame, according to a statement on its website. Lee Roy Smith, the bodys executive director, said in the statement the board wanted to wait until Hasterts criminal case was over before making a decision.  Hastert, 74, once one of the most powerful U.S. conservative politicians, was sentenced on Wednesday to 15 months in federal prison for a financial crime related to sexual abuse of high school wrestlers he coached decades ago. Hastert pleaded guilty last October to the crime of structuring, which involves withdrawing a large sum of money in  small increments to avoid detection. While he was not charged with sex abuse because of the statute of limitations, he admitted to the judge at his sentencing hearing that he had sexually abused teenagers.  The abuse occurred while Hastert was a teacher and wrestling coach in his hometown of Yorkville in the 1960s and 1970s. He later reached a secret agreement with one of the victims to pay him $3.5 million in compensation for pain and suffering. The Yorkville High School wrestlers were state champions during his tenure as coach. The Stillwater, Oklahoma-based Hall of Fame said it revoked its Order of Merit and Outstanding American awards given to Hastert, along with separate awards bestowed by the Illinois Chapter of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and the Dan Gable Museum in Waterloo, Iowa.

"Eyeing an Indiana victory, Trump says, 'It's over'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Front-runner Donald Trump said on Sunday that he will have essentially sealed the Republican U.S. presidential nomination if he wins Tuesdays contest in Indiana, where he holds a big lead over chief rival Ted Cruz. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist opinion poll showed Trump with a wide lead in Indiana, 49 percent to 34 percent for Cruz and 13 percent for a third candidate, Ohio Governor John Kasich. Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire real estate developer, sounded confident in an interview on Fox News Sunday when asked whether Indiana would basically end the long-running Republican race in his favor. Yes, its over, Trump said. Its already over. The poll showed the depth of the challenge facing Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas who is trying to prevent Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates needed to seal the nomination.  Cruzs hopes rest on emerging as a consensus alternative to Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 18-21. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 68, leads U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, 74, of Vermont in the race for the Democratic nomination. On NBCs Meet the Press, Cruz, 45, was asked several times whether he would support Trump if the New York businessman was the Republican nominee. Cruz evaded the question each time and turned the questions into an attack on broadcast media. I recognize that many in the media would love to see me surrender to Donald Trump because that means that Hillary wins. The media has given $2 billion in free advertising to Donald Trump, Cruz said. Cruz said he has momentum in Indiana based on his choice of former candidate Carly Fiorina for his vice president and Fridays endorsement by Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Americans will elect a successor to President Barack Obama on Nov. 8. Trump, who has amassed 996 delegates, according to an Associated Press count, has momentum behind him and looks increasingly likely to win the nomination outright, without a contested convention, perhaps when California votes on June 7. Indiana has 57 Republican delegates. Three are awarded from each of the states nine U.S. congressional districts with the candidate who receives the most votes taking them all. The 30 others are awarded to the candidate who wins the most votes statewide. At a rally in Terre Haute, Indiana, Trump urged Republicans to join his movement and turn out for him in big numbers. The more we can win by in Indiana is so important. Its a mandate ... a really important mandate. Its a mandate for change, but not Obama change. Real change. Its a mandate for genius, he said. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a leading Republican critic of Trump, called him the most unelectable person the party could nominate. Graham had sought the nomination himself. Keep fighting Ted, Graham told CBSs Face the Nation. On the Democratic side, front-runner Clinton told CNNs State of the Union that rival Bernie Sanders has been helpful in bringing millions of people into the partys presidential race, but it was time for him to step aside. There comes a time when you have to look at the reality, said Clinton, who won four of the five Northeastern states that voted last Tuesday and who has a big lead in the delegate race ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 25-28. But at a news conference in Washington, Sanders refused to get out, saying he believes the Democratic battle will end up in a contested convention. Sanders said it was nearly impossible for Clinton to win the 2,383 delegates needed for nomination without superdelegates, who are unelected and free to support any candidate they wish. We intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining, he said. Clinton has 2,165 to Sanders 1,357 delegates, according to an AP count that includes superdelegates who have said whom they support. In his Fox interview, Trump defended at length his views on foreign policy, which he outlined in a speech last week in Washington that drew criticism for sometimes contradictory views. Trump said he would move quickly to destroy Islamic States militancy, but would resist interventionist policies in order to focus on nation-building at home. Trump said every move we made in the Middle East was wrong over the past 15 years, with lives and money wasted. He said he would resist such policies. Asked whether the United States should return to working with strongmen leaders like the late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Trump said: Isnt it too bad that we knocked him out in the first place?

Conservatives in Congress urge shutdown of IRS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Its a U.S. taxpayers dream: make the Internal Revenue Service go away, and the largest conservative group in Congress is endorsing just that. The Republican Study Committee, which counts over two-thirds of House of Representatives Republicans as its members, called recently for the complete elimination of the IRS. The committees support for this idea, once confined to the fringes of conservative ideology, suggests it is more widely accepted on Capitol Hill than ever. But many in Washington, including some Republicans, have trouble taking it seriously. Calls to abolish the IRS have not been well thought through, Republican Representative Charles Boustany said in an interview. Before we start making blanket statements about abolishing the IRS, I think its important to focus on what the tax code for the 21stcentury should look like, said Boustany, who does not belong to the 172-member study committee. In an election year of dramatic rhetoric that is often short on details, the committees proposal, released April 22 and echoing language from a March budget plan, is brief. As part of a wider appeal for federal tax reform, the committee says simply: This proposal takes the bold step of calling for the complete elimination of the IRS. Tax collection and enforcement activities would be moved to a new, smaller and more accountable department at the Treasury. No further specifics were offered for how to replace an agency that is already part of the Treasury, collected $3.3 trillion in revenue in 2015 and processed 240 million tax returns. Texas Representative Bill Flores, chairman of the study committee, was not available for comment. His spokeswoman Caitlin Carroll said the IRS closure proposal should be seen as part of a larger push for comprehensive tax reform. Matthew Gardner, head of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a tax research group, said most tax reform plans would still need a tax collector with enforcement powers. Its hard to imagine a situation in which we wouldnt need a sophisticated tax collection and enforcement capacity, he said. We are in an election year, and bashing the IRS is particularly attractive in an election year, said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center think-tank.   From a global perspective, the IRS does a good job, he said, noting that U.S. income tax compliance is about 82 percent, one of the highest levels in the world. Still, in the United States, antipathy for the IRS is widespread and long-standing. One of Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruzs biggest applause lines on the campaign trail is, Imagine abolishing the IRS! Asked recently about Cruzs line and calls to close the agency, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said: If you want to call it something other than the IRS and that makes you feel better, thats OK with me. But ultimately you got to have somebody somewhere who collects the information, audits it and makes sure its accurate and valid and collects the funding. Cruzs tax plan, unveiled in November, would create a flat 10 percent individual income tax and junk the present tax brackets. High-income households would benefit the most under his plan, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. Some Democrats scoff at the IRS closure proposal. If there are problems at the IRS ... we can straighten it out, said Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings. He added that Republicans should be wary of advocating an idea that sounds Trumpish. Donald Trump, the anti-establishment front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has not called for abolition of the IRS.  Congress has cut the IRS budget 17 percent in real terms since 2010. In mid-April, the House approved several IRS-bashing bills, including one to prevent it from making new hires until the Treasury certifies no agency employees are seriously delinquent on taxes themselves. That bill and another one that would prevent the IRS from spending user fees it collects without congressional approval have been placed on the Senate calendar by Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. This means they can be brought up for debate and a vote, although no action has been set on either proposal.  The IRS has long been a congressional punching bag. But Republicans have been hitting it harder since the IRS several years ago applied extra scrutiny to conservative groups applications for tax-exempt status between 2010 and 2012.  Republican Representative Rob Woodall of Georgia has introduced a bill every year since he entered Congress in 2011 to eliminate income taxes and abolish the IRS. Support for Woodalls bill has grown to 73 co-sponsors, including the heads of the House tax and budget committees, but it has never advanced. Nor has a similar bill in the Senate. It was unclear how House Speaker Paul Ryan would treat the study committees proposal in drafting a party policy agenda ahead of the Republican convention in Cleveland in July. The speaker welcomes input from the RSC and all members of our conference, said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. Ryan has sidestepped calls for abolishing the IRS in the past, while frequently criticizing the agency. ",politicsNews,"May 2, 2016 ",1
May Day rally in Los Angeles features strong anti-Trump theme ,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hundreds of people marched through Los Angeles on Sunday in a May Day rally that took aim at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump for his anti-illegal immigration platform that includes building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The demonstration in Americas second most populous city, which has a large immigrant population, came just days after protesters smashed the window of a police car and blocked traffic outside a Trump campaign event in Costa Mesa, California, 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Los Angeles. On Friday, demonstrators blocked the entrance of a hotel hosting the California Republican convention in Burlingame, south of San Francisco, forcing Trump to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to deliver his speech. The rally in Los Angeles remained peaceful and drew smaller crowds than some past May Day demonstrations in the city, with several hundred people marching through downtown at one point but largely dispersing by midafternoon.  Members of the crowd carried a large blow-up effigy of Trump holding a Ku Klux Klan hood, along with signs that read: Dump Trump.  Hes threatened that should he become president of the United States, in his first 18 months in office, he fully intends to deport all 11 million-plus undocumented persons in the United States. We dont take that lightly, said Juan Jose Gutierrez, of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition. Others waved Mexican or U.S. flags or signs that called for immigration reform and an end to deportations. A Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman said no arrests were made and there were no reports of violence.  Protests have become common outside rallies for Trump, 69, the New York billionaire businessman. He has aroused criticism for his pledge to deport illegal immigrants, even as it helped propel him in the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. He has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists to the United States and has promised to build a wall along the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. Trump said on Sunday he will have essentially sealed the Republican nomination if he wins Tuesdays contest in Indiana, where he holds a big lead over chief rival Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas. California holds its presidential primary on June 7.  ",politicsNews,"May 1, 2016 ",1
Obama torches Trump at his final Washington correspondents' dinner,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday took aim at Democrats and Republicans alike in his final appearance headlining the star-studded White House correspondents dinner, but saved his sharpest barbs for Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. The Republican establishment is incredulous that hes their most likely nominee, Obama told attendees at the black-tie event, which brought together journalists and media moguls with Hollywood stars and power brokers from Capitol Hill and beyond. They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But in fairness he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan, the president said to howls of laughter, referring to contestants on the Miss Universe pageant that Trump formerly co-owned. Obama made fun of the angst many in the Republican establishment have expressed at the prospect that Trump or Tea Party candidate Ted Cruz could win the partys nomination to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish, but instead a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan, Obama said, referring to the top Republican in the House of Representatives, who many have hoped could be lured into running for president. Thats not an option people, Obama said, displaying comedic chops perfected through seven previous appearances at the annual dinner. You may not like steak or fish, but thats your choice. In his remarks, Obama looked back on his presidency and jokingly predicted the country may be nearing its doom. The end of the republic has never looked better, the tuxedo-clad president said looking out at the well-groomed crowd as he blasted Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus. Congratulations on all your success, Obama told Priebus, while wearing a sarcastic grin. The Republican party, the nomination process  its all going great. Larry Wilmore, the host of a show on cable outlet Comedy Central, took his own shots at Trump when he took the podium after Obama, joking that next year the dinner will be called: Donald Trump presents a luxurious evening paid for by Mexico. Trump has famously promised to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to prevent illegal immigration, and he has said he would force Mexico to pay for it. With a bit of nostalgia, Obama reflected on his more than seven years in office, saying he had been a young man of idealism and vigor before he became president. Eight years ago I said it was time to change the tone of our politics, Obama said. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. ",politicsNews,"April 30, 2016 ",1
Cash-flush California GOP allows chairman to seek third term,"BURLINGAME, Calif. (Reuters) - The Californian Republican Party voted on Sunday to extend its term limit to allow the former lawmaker who brought the party back from near-bankruptcy in an increasingly Democratic state to seek a third term as chairman. Buoyed by a flush bank account and the prospect that members votes will matter in a presidential primary for the first time in decades, GOP members at their annual convention near San Francisco voted for a change to longtime party bylaws to allow former state Senator Jim Brulte to run again next year to be the partys chairman. I think hes a great chairman and hes done a lot for the party, said Michael Escoto, 35, a delegate from Los Angeles. Brultes strong hand guiding normally fractious California Republicans was clear throughout the three-day convention, where newly energized members were courted by all three candidates vying for the national partys presidential nomination - Donald Trump, John Kasich and Ted Cruz - along with Carly Fiorina, who is joining Cruz campaign as his potential running mate. Since Brulte took the helm of the then-faltering party in 2013, the California GOP has gone from having less than $200,000 in the bank to its current cash on hand of $4.5 million, according to state campaign finance records. Now, positions cut during layoffs a few years ago have been replaced, and the partys annual convention - previously a sleepy affair - was packed with delegates and guests. The possibility that Californias June primary will matter in the presidential race for the first time in decades if frontrunner Donald Trump does not secure enough delegates before then has energized members. On Friday, anti-Trump protesters blocked the road to the Hyatt Regency hotel near San Francisco International Airport where the convention was held, engaging in scuffles with police and throwing eggs a day after chaotic demonstrations against the candidate in Orange County. Inside, his speech drew a standing ovation, as did appearances later in the weekend by Kasich, Cruz and Fiorina.       Still, Brulte will face a difficult road in a state where Democrats hold all statewide-elected offices and dominate both houses of the legislature.  The Californian Republic Party has become fractured, splitting among Tea Party conservatives, anti-immigration activists, libertarians and an increasingly alienated moderate old guard. There were just under 4.8 million Republicans registered in the state as of Jan. 3, bringing the total down to 27.6 percent of the electorate from 30.4 percent in 2012.

"Facing long odds in California, Cruz courts state's Republicans","BURLINGAME, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruz made a plea to the California Republican Party on Saturday to line up behind him in the states June primary in his uphill battle to stop front-runner Donald Trump from grabbing the nomination. At the same party convention that was the backdrop for chaotic protests against Trump on Friday, Cruz tried to woo party members with support for their long-time issues, such as lower taxes and a harder line on immigration. Former California Governor Pete Wilson gave Cruz his endorsement as he introduced the senator from Texas. Cruz received more applause at the convention than either Trump or third-place candidate Ohio Governor John Kasich, who also spoke on Friday.   If were fractured and were divided, Hillary Clinton wins and the campaign is lost, he said, referring to the Democratic Partys front-runner in the Nov. 8 election for the White House.  Now mathematically eliminated from securing the nomination on the first ballot at the partys convention in Cleveland in July, Cruz aims to stop Trump from receiving the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, forcing a contested convention.  However, the prospect of him being able to do so has grown increasingly slim. Trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality TV star, has continued to notch up wins in the nations nominating contests, including a five-state sweep of the latest string of contests last Tuesday.   Cruz has downplayed the severity of the losses and in his speech Saturday looked forward to upcoming contests, which he has said will put him on the path to thwarting Trump. California is going to decide this Republican primary, he said, referring to the states June 7 contest. Trump has been at odds with the partys establishment and has called the system for nominating its candidate rigged.  Critics say he has played on the fears of his supporters, especially about immigration, by proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and accusing illegal Mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals. On Thursday and Friday, anti-Trump protests erupted outside the candidates California events. On Friday, he was forced to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to a hotel to give a speech to the convention and avoid several hundred loud protesters gathered outside. Cruz hopes to slow Trumps march toward the nomination in Indianas primary on Tuesday. The state awards its 57 delegates on a winner-take-all basis by congressional district, possibly granting Cruz a windfall of pledged delegates.  A Real Clear Politics polling aggregation in the state shows Cruz just behind Trump, 35.2 percent to 37.5 percent.  Polls show Cruz has more of a challenge in delegate-rich California, where he lags Trump 28.3 percent to 45.7 percent.    In an indication of efforts to court the state, Cruz on Wednesday made the unusual move of naming a vice presidential running mate, onetime presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina, who was formerly a chief executive of the California technology company Hewlett-Packard Co.  On Saturday night, she urged the crowd of party faithful, many of whom had backed her as the partys nominee in a failed bid for U.S. senate in 2010, to join her in supporting Cruz. In a dynamic and combative speech, she urged Kasich to get out of the race, and challenged the idea that Trump had locked up the nomination. Donald Trump was here yesterday and he was telling you its over, Fiorina said. But the 30-yard line aint a touchdown.      ",politicsNews,"April 30, 2016 ",1
Anti-Trump protests break out for second day in California,"BURLINGAME, Calif. (Reuters) - Protests erupted in California for the second day in a row on Friday against U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, who is moving closer to winning the Republican nomination after a string of victories this week.  The billionaire businessman was forced to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to a hotel to give a speech to the California Republican convention and avoid several hundred loud protesters gathered outside. That was not the easiest entrance Ive ever made, Trump told the gathering in Burlingame, south of San Francisco, after weaving around a barrier and clambering across a road to get to the venue. It felt like I was crossing the border actually. Demonstrators, some of whom held Mexican national flags, at one point rushed security gates at the hotel and police officers had their batons out.     The mogul had already drawn protests in California, with chaotic scenes on Thursday outside a Trump rally in Costa Mesa. Anti-Trump protesters smashed the window of a police car and blocked traffic. Some 20 people were arrested. Protests have become common outside rallies for Trump who has earned ardent critics, as well as support from Republican voters, for his rhetoric against illegal immigration. His campaign abandoned a rally in Chicago last month after clashes between his supporters and protesters.         He has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists across the U.S. border and has promised to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Trump, who described himself this week as the partys presumptive nominee, would take a large stride toward knocking his Republican rivals out of the presidential race if he wins the Indiana primary next week.                  On Friday, he said he is approaching the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Trump, who has run as a political outsider and only recently started making inroads with the Republican establishment, called for the party to band together behind him. But said he could win the White House without them if needed.  There should be and there has to be unity. Now with that being said, would I win, can I win without it? I think so, to be honest, Trump told the convention. His speech drew applause, though not the fervent reception of his usual campaign rallies. Trumps main rival, Senator Ted Cruz, on Friday picked up the backing of Governor Mike Pence of Indiana in a rearguard battle to damage Trumps chances.                 Im not against anybody, but I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Republican primary, Pence said on an Indiana radio show.  Cruz, from Texas, is trailing the former reality TV star in the Midwestern state after losing to him by a wide margin in all five Northeastern states that held nominating contests on Tuesday.                A CBS poll earlier this week found Trump with about 40 percent of support in Indiana, compared to 35 percent for Cruz. The poll had a margin of error of 6.6 points. Other polls have also shown Trump ahead.     The Republican front-runner was in California ahead of its June 7 primary, when the most convention delegates of the Republican nominating cycle will be at stake.  After his speech, Trump made a similarly unconventional exit out of the hotel via the back door. Cheryl McDonald, 71, of Discovery Bay, said she had to pass through protesters to get inside the hotel. They were yelling. I think the only words they know in the dictionary are profanities, said McDonald, who said she is a Trump supporter. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a distant third in the race for the partys nomination, distanced himself from what he said was a divisive campaign that preyed on voters fears. Im worried about a divided, polarized country, Kasich said. It doesnt have to be that way. ",politicsNews,"April 29, 2016 ",1
U.S. West Point academy set for first woman dean in two century history,"(Reuters) - The United States Military Academy is poised to have its first woman dean in its 216-year history after President Barack Obama nominated to the post a West Point graduate who currently leads the schools Department of Social Sciences. Colonel Cindy Jebb, who holds a Ph.D. in political science from Duke University, needs confirmation from the U.S. Senate to take on the post.

"U.S., European trade negotiators battle political headwinds","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facing deeply entrenched differences and political headwinds, the top negotiators trying to reach a sweeping U.S.-European free trade deal avoided agriculture, public procurement and other thorny issues in talks this week. Instead, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Daniel Mullaney and European Commission lead negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercera said on Friday they concentrated on less controversial areas such as small and medium enterprises and technical language. But both insisted after their 13th negotiating round in New York that they can still reach a deal this year before U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office in January. Mullaney said concerns over a June referendum in Britain over whether to leave the European Union would not slow efforts to reach a deal to boost trade, investment and job growth on both continents, and nor would anti-trade rhetoric from the U.S. presidential campaign trail.   Were confident that we can achieve that kind of an agreement and that when we do, later this year, itll be an agreement that the public on both sides of the Atlantic can support, Mullaney said. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has said he would scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and has been especially critical of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement for destroying U.S. jobs. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, has also said TPP is unacceptable in its current form. I havent seen a worse political environment for trade deals negotiations, said Robert Vastine, a former president of the Coalition of Service Industries, who gave a presentation on services at a forum on the sidelines of the New York talks.   He said the sour environment was contributing to the slow pace of talks and a lack of enthusiasm for making concessions, particularly when any deal would need to be approved under a new U.S. president. In Europe, too, the political environment is challenging, with widespread opposition to allowing more imports of U.S. agricultural products over concerns about genetically modified foods, hormone-raised beef and fierce protection of local food-naming rules for items from Asiago cheese to Parma ham. A new survey released this week by the Bertelsmann Foundation showed waning support for a TTIP deal in both Germany and the United States. The poll, conducted by YouGov, showed that only 17 percent of Germans believe TTIP is a good thing versus 55 percent two years ago. In the United States, only 18 percent of those polled supported such a deal, versus 53 percent in 2014. France has voiced particular frustration at the lack of movement on the U.S. side. French Trade Minister Matthias Fekl this month suggested the talks should be scrapped absent further progress. John Wilson, senior vice president of the Dairy Farmers of America, told the New York forum that his cooperative of 8,500 farms would oppose TTIP unless U.S.-made cheese can break into Europes closely guarded naming rules, known as geographic indications. Weve been producing Asiago cheese for a long time. Its a common name, its a generic name, he said. European Commission agricultural negotiator John Clarke shot back that Europe would fiercely defend its geographical indications, including Asiago, from U.S. imports.   You will certainly not be able to export Asiago from the USA to Europe. Thats absolutely impossible, Clarke said. The services sector remains another problem area, with U.S. officials insisting Europe drop exclusions for some 200 sectors, and European officials frustrated at the U.S. refusal to open up its coastal maritime transport sector. The EUs Garcia Bercera said he was mindful of the public debate in the negotiations. We believe that the task is to convince public opinion in Europe and the United States that trade agreements are instruments to better manage globalization, he said.

Trump praises Sanders but may struggle to win over his voters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Donald Trump moves closer to clinching the Republican presidential nomination, he has offered lavish praise for Bernie Sanders, who faces increasingly slim chances in his battle with Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race. Trump has begun calling for Sanders to run as an independent if he does not win the Democratic nomination and said he may borrow talking points from Sanders speeches criticizing Clinton to use in a possible matchup with the former secretary of state in the Nov. 8 general election. He said some things about her that were so incredible  incredible  and so incredibly bad, Trump said on Tuesday after sweeping five Northeastern primaries, adding Sanders had been telling the truth. Yet data and interviews with Sanders supporters suggest that winning over large numbers of them may be difficult for the New York billionaire businessman.  Even though Trump, 69, and Sanders, 74, a U.S. senator from Vermont, emphasize some common themes such as criticism of Wall Street and international trade agreements, there is only limited crossover appeal between the two candidates, according to Reuters/Ipsos data.  Among voters who back Trump, just 12 percent said Sanders would be their second choice if Trump were not in the race, only slightly higher than the 7 percent who said Clinton would be their next pick. Sanders supporters were even less willing than Trump backers to consider crossing over. Just 8 percent of Sanders supporters said they would vote for Trump as their second choice, roughly the same as the portion of voters who listed Trumps Republican rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich as their second choice.  Sanders supporter Joseph Hayes, 37, of Oregon, still has hope for his candidate. But if it comes down to Trump or Clinton, Hayes said it was an easy, if unpleasant, choice. I would have to vote for Hillary. Reluctantly so, but I would, he said. People who outwardly back both Sanders and Trump are even more of a rarity. Donor rolls show just over two dozen voters willing to support both Trump and Sanders financially. I think Bernie Sanders is too poor to be bought, and I think Donald Trump is too rich to be bought by special interests, said Royce Gourley, a real estate investor, who gave $2,500 to Sanders and $2,700 to Trump, Federal Election Commission filings show.  But Trump could find an opening as both he and Sanders have gained strong followings among voters looking for an outsider candidate who will shake up the Washington establishment.  Both have made significant inroads among laborers and union members who support their opposition to U.S. trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which critics say threaten U.S. jobs.  But the two are far apart on many issues, especially immigration. Trump has proposed building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country.  Sanders has called such proposals crap and often criticizes what he calls inhumane deportation programs.  For Sanders supporters like Dave Berry, 62, of Tacoma, Washington, the wooing may pay off as voters weigh the decision to stick with their party or stir things up in Washington.  I will probably put a check in Trumps column (in the general election), Berry said of a possible Trump-Clinton general election contest. He said he did not think the former reality TV star could win, but felt good about making Clinton uneasy about her prospects of securing an easy win.  One risk for Clinton is Sanders voters who may sit out the election or choose a third-party candidate if their favorite is not on the ballot.  Valerie Benson, 80, of Cleveland, said that if it came down to Trump against Clinton, I dont know that I would vote for anybody then. ",politicsNews,"April 29, 2016 ",1
Oklahoma lawmakers approve bill to revoke licenses of abortion doctors," (Corrects first paragraph of April 22 item to show that bill has not been sent to the governor and adds third paragraph to explain status) By Heide Brandes OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - An Oklahoma bill that could revoke the license of any doctor who performs an abortion may soon head to the governor, with opponents saying the measure in unconstitutional and promising a legal battle against the cash-strapped state if it is approved. In the Republican-dominated legislature, the states House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a Senate bill late on Thursday. Governor Mary Fallin, a Republican, has not yet indicated whether she will sign it. The Senate needs to approve minor changes to the bill before it can go to the governor, lawmakers said. Under the bill, doctors who perform abortions would risk losing their medical licenses. Exemptions would be given for those who perform the procedure for reasons including protecting the mother or removing a miscarried fetus. This is our proper function, to protect life, said Senator Nathan Dahm, the Republican who authored the bill. A handful of representatives argued against the bill, saying it violated the Constitution by prohibiting a doctor from performing a medical procedure that was legal under law. Oklahoma politicians have made it their mission year after year to restrict womens access vital health care services, yet this total ban on abortion is a new low, said Amanda Allen, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. The lobbying group and several other abortion rights organizations have promised court challenges if the bill is enacted.  Supporters of the bill said it will help protect the sanctity of life. If we take care of morality, bill supporter David Brumbaugh, a Republican, said during deliberations, God will take care of the economy. ",politicsNews,"April 22, 2016 ",1
"From bikers to truckers, pro-Trump groups plan forceful presence in Cleveland","(Reuters) - When Chris Cox rolls into Cleveland in mid-July with other motorcycle-riding supporters of Donald Trump, he plans to celebrate the billionaires coronation as the Republican presidential nominee. He also counts on joining protests if a battle over the nomination ensues. Im anticipating well be doing a victory dance, said Cox, 47, a chainsaw artist and founder of Bikers for Trump, thousands of whom he estimates will hit the Ohio city for the July 18-21 Republican National Convention.  But if the Republican Party tries to pull off any backroom deals and ignores the will of the people, our role will change. Bikers For Trump is part of a diverse array of groups coordinating to hold thousands-strong protests and marches if the real-estate mogul is denied outright victory at the Republican Partys nominating convention in Cleveland.  The risks of confrontation and violence surrounding Trump events were highlighted again on Thursday, when around 20 people were arrested following clashes between anti-Trump protesters and police outside a rally for the candidate in California. It was the worst outbreak of violence since Trump was forced to cancel a rally in Chicago in mid-March. Anti-Trump protests are expected in Cleveland. In late March, the left-leaning National Lawyers Guild held a conference in the city to coordinate legal support to protesters in the event of mass arrests during demonstrations. Leaders and members of the pro-Trump groups told Reuters their main goal is to mount a show of support for their candidate, who after a series of primary victories this week looks increasingly likely to clinch the nomination outright ahead of Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich. But if he falls short of the required 1,237 delegates, raising the risk he could lose out in a contested convention, they said they plan to do all they can to exert pressure on party leaders to prevent someone else getting the nomination. Several Trump supporters suggested that tensions could escalate if the party was seen as trying to deny Trump the nomination despite his commanding lead in delegates won in primary contests. The plan either way is send a message to the Republican establishment to respect our votes, said Ralph King, a member of the Cleveland Tea Party. If the party tries to parachute in a white knight to steal the nomination, its not going to end well.   Trump has said that if he fails to get the nomination there will be riots. Though there have been violent incidents at some Trump rallies, organizers insist they work closely with the authorities to avoid violence. The U.S. Secret Service is the lead agency for the convention. Its spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said protests or violence for such an event are factored into all of our contingency plans that have been built up over many, many months. The Cleveland Division of Police also has a security plan in place as it does for all major events of this kind, a spokeswoman said in an email, without providing further details. Bikers for Trump, which Cox founded in August and which he claims has 30,000 members and rising, is just one of a mixed bag of pro-Trump groups that aim to be in Cleveland. Reuters could not independently verify Coxs membership claims for the group, which has provided unofficial security at Trump rallies around the country. Pro-Trump groups planning a presence in Cleveland include some Tea Party-affiliated organizations, a new group called Stop The Steal led by Trump ally Roger Stone, Citizens for Trump, and the Truckers for Trump group.  King, a veteran of Tea Party rallies, is coordinating with other groups and local police to obtain permits for marches and protests during the convention, and to hold a major rally in downtown Cleveland that will then march on the convention site. Stone plans to raise $262,000 through online donations to hire buses and is negotiations with colleges in the Cleveland area on sleeping space for activists. He says he wants Republican delegates Trump has won in primaries to sign a voluntary pledge to back him beyond the first ballot should there be a contested convention.He did not disclose how much money the group has raised. Citizens for Trump co-founder Tim Selaty says he will have activists filming events inside the convention center and broadcasting them live on social mediato document every move. If Mr. Trump walks into the convention center a couple of hundred votes ahead of Cruz and loses the nomination, it will not be a pretty scene, Selaty said. Truckers for Trump says it has 4,000 members and that more than 1,000 are committed to driving their big rigs to Cleveland. The pro-Trump groups say they are not seeking confrontation but fear that opponents of their candidate might start trouble.   Our members will instructed that if theres trouble to stand back and let law enforcement do its job, said Matthew Heimbach, founder of the Traditionalist Workers Party, a pro-white nationalist, pro-working class party, which plans to have a few dozen members in Cleveland. It is unclear is how many nationalists or white supremacists might attend. Trump has adherents on the far right, including former Klu Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, who told his radio show listeners in February that voting for anyone other than Trump was treason to your heritage. The National Socialist Movement, a prominent white nationalist group, told Reuters it did not plan any events.  Brian Culpepper, a spokesman for the Detroit-based group and a Trump supporter, said many members support the mogul. But it does not officially back Republican or Democratic office seekers as it wishes to replace the current system with a white nationalist power structure.

Brady Campaign's ad draws ire of U.S. anti-gun violence activists,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said on Friday it has sharply cut back an online ad that had used the names and faces of mass shooters and urged the news media not to identify them after the group drew criticism from other gun control activists. The group, named for former White House spokesman James Brady, who was wounded in 1981 when a gunman tried to assassinate then-President Ronald Reagan, rolled out the Zero Minutes of Fame campaign earlier this week. Its goal, the group said, was to promote research showing that mass shooters, such as those who carried out the 2012 attacks in Newtown, Connecticut and Aurora, Colorado, had studied past gun attacks before carrying out their own. The prominent use of the names and images of Adam Lanza, who shot dead 20 children and six educators at a Newtown elementary school, and James Holmes, who fatally shot 12 people at an Aurora movie theater, in the two-minute online spot angered fellow anti-gun-violence campaigners. The Brady Campaign's ad prompted a petition (chn.ge/1SCfovp) on activist website Change.org calling for the ad to be taken down. Some 93 people had signed that petition as of midday Friday.  It was very hurtful to many gun violence victims and survivors, said Anita Busch, a Los Angeles-based entertainment journalist whose cousin was slain in the Aurora massacre and who said she posted the petition. For the Brady Campaign to not get it is just shocking, honestly. The ad marked the launch of a piece of software for Googles (GOOGL.O) Chrome web browser that promised to remove the names and images of serial killers from news accounts and Google web searches, replacing them with (name withheld out of respect for the victims). The Brady Campaign, one of the most prominent U.S. gun control organizations, said on Friday it had cut back the ads contents after the complaints. A 14-second version of the ad viewed on Friday featured no names or images of mass shooters. Our video was meant to educate the broader American public about what we can do to prevent gun violence, not to upset those hardest hit by it, Dan Gross, the groups president, said in an e-mailed statement. We take this matter seriously and hope the steps we have taken to fix this are satisfactory to our victim advocates. James Brady survived the 1981 attack and went on to become a prominent gun control activist. He died in 2014. ",politicsNews,"April 29, 2016 ",1
Oklahoma legislation aims to ensure punishment for sex crimes,"OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Oklahoma lawmakers will take up legislation next week aimed at ensuring sex crimes do not go unpunished in the state because the victims were unconscious or intoxicated when they occurred.  In March, Oklahomas highest criminal court ruled the states rape law addresses sexual assault cases involving people who were either unconscious or intoxicated when they were victims of abuse. But the court ruled that Oklahomas forcible sodomy law, which also pertains to oral sex, did not address such cases. The ruling was in response to allegations that a Tulsa teenager sexually assaulted a girl who had passed out after a night of drinking. A lower court judge had dismissed the case last year. Oklahoma Representative Scott Biggs, a Republican, said on Friday he is filing legislation to define forcible sodomy in a way that includes unconscious victims. The bill, which is widely supported, is expected to be heard by the Oklahoma legislature in the coming week, Biggs said. The judges made a grave error, but if they need more clarification, we are happy to give it to them by fixing the statute, Biggs said in an interview. The states highest criminal appeals court said in its ruling: Sodomy cannot occur where a victim is so intoxicated as to be completely unconscious at the time of the sexual act of oral copulation.  It added, we will not, in order to justify prosecution of a person for an offense, enlarge a statute beyond the fair meaning of its language. The ruling in March had gone mostly unnoticed until the public interest journalism site Oklahoma Watch reported on it this month, sparking a public outcry. The case from 2014 involved two high school students who were drinking and smoking marijuana with friends. The boy testified the oral sex was consensual but the girl said it was not, according to Oklahoma Watch, which added that the teens DNA was found on the girl. Unfortunately, legal minds often get stuck on questions of semantics, when it is clear to most of us what the intent of the law is, Biggs said. I cant stress enough how sorry I am for the victim and that she was denied justice, he added. ",politicsNews,"April 29, 2016 ",1
About 20 demonstrators arrested outside of Trump rally in California ,"(Reuters) - Some 20 demonstrators were arrested on Thursday outside a Donald Trump campaign rally in southern California, where the Republican presidential front-runner vowed to his supporters to get tough on illegal immigration if elected.  Demonstrators smashed the window of a police squad car, marched in protest and blocked traffic as police in riot gear tried to disperse the crowd outside of the county fair grounds in Costa Mesa, California, according to local media and the Twitter account of the Orange County Sheriffs Department.   The department said on its Twitter account that about 20 arrests were made and that no major injuries were reported. Trump visited Costa Mesa, a city of more than 100,000 people, a third of whom are Hispanic or Latino, hoping to garner support in California where voters will go to the polls during the states Republican primary on June 7.     A strong primary win in California for the billionaire could thrust him above the delegate count needed to secure the Republican nomination for president and avoid a contested party convention in July.      During the campaign stop on Thursday, Trump promised to get tough on illegal immigration by building a wall on the border between Mexico and the United States, a popular theme of his presidential campaign, suggesting that a wall would stop drugs from coming into this country.   The drugs are poisoning our youth and a lot of other people and we are going to get it stopped, he said, telling the crowd that he would force Mexico to pay for the wall.   After the event, local news showed hundreds of demonstrators surrounding vehicles, waving Mexican flags and holding signs in protest of Trump outside of the Orange County Fair and Event Center. At least one demonstrator was shown jumping on the top of a police car while other demonstrators were seen shaking a police vehicle.  A Los Angeles Times reporter posted a photo on Twitter of a man wearing a Trump T-shirt with a bloodied face.  Trump has come under fire from rivals for fueling unrest with his rhetoric as several of his rallies around the country have been met by protests during the last several months.

Trump's 'America first' speech alarms U.S. allies,"LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps first major foreign policy address alarmed American allies, who view the Republican front runners repeated invocation of an America first agenda as a threat to retreat from the world. While most governments were careful not to comment publicly on a speech by a U.S. presidential candidate, Germanys foreign minister veered from that protocol to express concern at Trumps wording. I can only hope that the election campaign in the USA does not lack the perception of reality, Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. The worlds security architecture has changed and it is no longer based on two pillars alone. It cannot be conducted unilaterally, he said of foreign policy in a post-Cold War world. No American president can get round this change in the international security architecture.... America first is actually no answer to that. Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister who served as UN envoy to the Balkans in the aftermath of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, said he heard Trumps speech as abandoning both democratic allies and democratic values. Trump had not a word against Russian aggression in Ukraine, but plenty against past U.S. support for democracy in Egypt, Bildt said on Twitter, referring to lines from Trumps speech that criticized the Barack Obama administration for withdrawing support for autocrat Hosni Mubarak during a 2011 uprising. Trumps speech, uncharacteristically read out from a teleprompter, seemed aimed at showing a more serious side of a politician who has said he intends to act more presidential after months of speaking mainly off the cuff. He promised a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy in contrast to the reckless, rudderless and aimless policies of Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trumps likely Democratic opponent if he secures the Republican nomination. The speech included no dramatic new policy proposals that might generate headlines, such as his past calls to bar Muslims from entering the United States or to build a wall on the frontier with Mexico. Where he was specific, like rejecting the terms of last years nuclear deal with Iran, calling for more investment in missile defense in Europe and accusing the Obama administration of tepid support for Israel, he was firmly within the Republican mainstream.  A major theme  that more NATO allies should spend at least 2 percent of their economic output on defense  is one that has also been taken up by the Obama administration itself, including repeatedly during the presidents visit to Europe last week. Nevertheless, Trumps rhetoric raised alarm in allied countries that still rely on the superpower for defense, particularly the phrase America first, used in the 1930s by isolationists that sought to keep the United States out of World War Two. Former South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Sung-han, who now teaches at the Korea University in Seoul, said Trump would be the first isolationist to be U.S. presidential candidate, while in the post-war era all the U.S. presidents have been to varying degrees internationalists. Saying the U.S. will no longer engage in anything that is a burden in terms of its relationships with allies, it would be almost like abandoning those alliances, he said. It will inevitably give rise to anti-American sentiment worldwide. Xenia Wickett, head of the U.S. and Americas Programme at Britains Chatham House think tank, said the speech suggests Trump would make Americas allies less secure rather than more. He talked about allies being confident but all of his rhetoric suggested that America should be unpredictable and that Americas allies needed to stand up for themselves. Earlier in the U.S. nomination process, foreign leaders were not shy to condemn Trump openly and publicly. In December, when Trump called for his temporary ban on admitting Muslims, British Prime Minister David Cameron called him divisive, stupid and wrong. Hundreds of thousands of Britons signed a petition calling for Trump to be banned from Britain for hate speech, which was taken up in parliament. Cameron declined to ban Trump, but said: If he came to visit our country, I think he would unite us against him. In January, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel lumped Trump together with the leaders of European far-right parties as not only a threat to peace and social cohesion, but also to economic development. These days, with Trump now seen as likely to win his partys nomination, European officials are more circumspect in public, but sound no less alarmed in private. A Trump presidency would be a disaster for EU-U.S. ties, said one senior EU official involved in shaping foreign policy in Brussels. Right now, we and the Obama administration generally understand each other. I dont think we understand Donald Trump. He has no understanding of the delicate, complex nature of foreign policy on Europes doorstep. Nevertheless, some of the policies Trump shares with other Republicans do have sympathetic audiences abroad. Ryszard Terlecki, head of the parliamentary group of Polands ruling rightwing Law and Justice party, said Trump had a point when criticizing the Obama administration for backing away from plans for increased missile defense. This decision influenced very badly the security of this part of Europe. If it werent for that, the conflict in Ukraine would not escalate, he told Reuters. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly opposed the Obama administrations deal with Iran, and Trumps speech, like an earlier one to a pro-Israel lobby group in Washington, went down well with some right-leaning Israelis. Trump wants an America that is decent, strong, loyal - but also no patsy. And he sees in Israel the most loyal ally of the U.S. wrote Boaz Bismuth, diplomatic correspondent for the pro-Netanyahu daily Israel Hayom. In the Arab world, where governments and their citizens are also alarmed at the rise of non-Arab Iran, Trumps strong rejection of the deal with Tehran is a popular position that would have been embraced if expressed by another candidate. But Trumps previous call to ban Muslims from the United States has made him anathema in the region. Emirati political analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdullah said no speech would be enough to salvage his reputation there: Hes a racist and a chauvinist who will never be widely welcomed in the Arab world. Or, as Kuwaiti twitter user Mohammed al-Ammar wrote: Some of his speech is correct and logical, but the problem is, hes still #Trump. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
Biden visits Iraq in show of support amid multiple crises,"ERBIL, Iraq/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden met Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and other top officials in unannounced visits to Baghdad and Erbil on Thursday to show support for a government battling Islamic State amid political and economic crises. It was the first visit for Biden, the White Houses point person on Iraq, since U.S. forces withdrew in 2011 after nearly nine years of occupation. He was the third and highest-level U.S. official to visit the country this month. Islamic State, also known as ISIL, seized large portions of Iraq and neighboring Syria in 2014. Iraqi forces have won back some territory, such as the western city of Ramadi, but often after long battles that have left the areas destroyed. Bidens trip, several months in the planning, is a sign of the progress Washington believes Iraqi forces have made in beating back the militants over the past year and its hope that the northern city of Mosul can be recaptured before U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office in January. This is a good indication of the United States continued support for Prime Minister Abadis efforts to unify the nation of Iraq to confront ISIL, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The vice president has close relationships with Iraqi leaders and speaks with them about every 10 days. Still, theres no substitute for being able to sit down face-to-face, a U.S. official said. Biden, a longtime U.S. senator before becoming vice president in 2009, said he had been to Iraq almost 30 times during his career. His first stop on Thursday was Baghdad where he met Abadi and Parliament Speaker Salim al-Jabouri to discuss progress in the fight against Islamic State, including plans to retake Mosul. Its real. Its serious. Its committed, Biden told reporters. Iraqi officials say they will retake Mosul this year but, in private, many question whether that is possible. Biden hopes some progress can be made before the extreme summer heat, a senior administration official said. He later flew to Erbil, the capital of Iraqs autonomous Kurdish region, for a 90-minute working dinner with the Kurdistan regions president, Massoud Barzani, to discuss the Mosul offensive in which Kurdish peshmerga forces are expected to have a critical role. The peshmerga have emerged as a key component of a U.S.-led coalitions strategy to degrade and destroy Islamic State, driving the insurgents back in northern Iraq with the help of air strikes despite a financial crisis that has made it difficult to pay salaries. Bidens trip also served to counter a misperception in the region that Iran, which backs powerful Shiite Muslim militias fighting Islamic State in Iraq, has undue influence in the nation, the U.S. official added. But it comes at a turbulent time in Iraqi politics. Abadi has faced resistance to a government overhaul aimed at tackling corruption. He won lawmakers approval to replace a handful of ministers on Tuesday after delays and disruptions. The political battle has also sparked populist protests that forced the government to bring back troops from the front lines to secure the capital. U.S. officials have expressed concern that unrest could distract from the war effort. Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited Baghdad earlier this month to show their support. Its been a pretty all-consuming political affair, a senior U.S. official told reporters, noting recent signs of a calmer trajectory in the drama. Obama has said he has seen momentum in the efforts of the coalition fighting Islamic State, and recently authorized more U.S. forces to go to Iraq and Syria to help train and assist local fighters. Their goal is to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces retake Mosul by the end of the year. The United States has already redeployed several thousand troops to Iraq to help defeat Islamic State. The White House is concerned that not enough is being spent to rebuild parts of Iraq devastated by the fight, a deficit made worse by the low price of oil, Iraqs main revenue source. The United Nations is urgently seeking $400 million from Washington and its allies for reconstruction, while Obama asked Gulf Arab leaders to assist during a visit to Riyadh last week. He also discussed the issue with European leaders in London and Hanover, Germany, and told reporters Iraqi reconstruction would be a topic for the G7 meeting in Japan next month and for NATO. Biden, whose late son Beau spent a year in Iraq with the Army, later spoke with U.S. troops and embassy workers. He showed them a daily tally of the number of U.S. troops serving, killed and injured in the line of duty that he carries in his front suit pocket. The history of this region is a nightmare from which everyone is constantly trying to awake, he said, adapting a line from Irish novelist James Joyce. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
"After long delay, U.S. Senate approves envoy to Mexico","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed President Barack Obamas nominee for ambassador to Mexico after a long delay and behind-the-scenes maneuvering that included renewing sanctions imposed on Venezuelans and a State Department authorization bill. Obama nominated career diplomat Roberta Jacobson for the Mexico City post in June, but she faced resistance from a few lawmakers for reasons including her role in helping negotiate Obamas relations with Communist-ruled Cuba and concerns the administration had failed to make human rights a priority. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee backed her nomination in November, but Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida placed a hold that kept her confirmation vote from going ahead. Rubio, who is Cuban-American and a former 2016 Republican presidential candidate, opposes Obamas moves toward normalizing relations with Havana and often pushes for the White House to take a stronger stand on human rights issues in Latin America. This month, Republican leaders and Obama administration officials came to Rubio to ask what would make him lift his hold on Jacobson. He asked for an extension of a bill he introduced last year imposing sanctions on Venezuelans for human rights violations in connection with the suppression of anti-government protests. The Senate approved a three-year extension of the sanctions measure on Thursday evening. The chamber also approved a State Department authorization bill that was being blocked by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is still in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. A Senate aide said Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would block Rubios Venezuela bill if Rubio did not lobby Cruz to drop his hold on the State Department measure. Cruz dropped his opposition, and the State Department bill also passed the Senate by unanimous voice vote on Thursday night.  Spokesmen for Rubio, Cruz and Corker declined to comment.  Secretary of State John Kerry said he was pleased the Senate finally confirmed Jackson. No one is more qualified than Roberta to represent the United States in Mexico, he said in a statement.

"Trump attacks Clinton on gender, risking backlash from women","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump waded into politically risky territory this week when he accused Democrat Hillary Clinton of exploiting her gender to win votes and said she would have little support if she were not a woman. As Trump and Clinton, fresh off big wins in five Northeastern state primaries on Tuesday, circled each other for a potential matchup in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, his comments portended what could be an unusually nasty campaign. Like other controversial remarks during his White House campaign, Trumps comments drew criticism from a wide spectrum but also reinforced his image - which has been attractive to some supporters - for plain talk that defies political norms. The only thing shes got going is the fact that shes a woman, Trump, 69, said on Thursday on NBCs Today show, refusing to back down from targeting Clinton, 68, for what he called playing the womans card.     Trumps remarks, reaching into an area of gender attacks that is conventionally seen as off-limits, energized Democrats. Keep talking, Donald Trump, Democratic Committee National Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN on Wednesday. Every single day when Donald Trump opens his mouth, he does more to alienate women. Trump, unfazed by the criticism, told supporters in Evansville, Indiana, that he has gotten a bad rap. Nobody cherishes and nobody respects women more than Donald Trump, he said after being introduced by famed former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight. I will be so much better to women than Hillary Clinton. Trump, who can be as free with his personal attacks on men,  has consistently polled poorly with women. Democrats and Republicans both accuse Trump of sexism over verbal insults lobbed at Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina. On Wednesday, Trumps closest Republican rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, named Fiorina, 61, as his running mate should he win the partys nomination, a move that could help him draw womens support. Donald has a problem with strong women, Cruz, 45, told reporters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, before a rally. This is not subtle, its not complicated. U.S. Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, who fended off a 2010 Senate challenge from Fiorina, said Trump is insulting all women when he attacks Clinton and other prominent women, such as Kelly, in this way. Either Trump has spent too much time in his Trump Tower and has no clue about whats happening, or he truly dislikes women and are quite threatened by them, Boxer said on MSNBC. But Trump said women would support his positions on security and jobs. U.S. Representative Renee Ellmers, a Republican who has endorsed him, said she believed Trump could overcome his unpopularity with women voters with his straight talk. To me, this is breaking all the rules, this is going against any of the typical history books and elections of the past, she said. Trumps top aide and other supporters said focusing on Clintons gender was part of Trumps emerging strategy for the general election and that he had no intention of hewing to traditional rules. When he is attacked, he will respond, Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, told Reuters. The campaign is going to proceed under the mantra, which weve had in this campaign from Day One, which is: Let Mr. Trump be Mr. Trump. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month showed a big gender gap in opinions about Trump. About two-thirds of women had an unfavorable view of the billionaire businessman and former reality TV star, while 54 percent of men had a negative view of him. In her political career, Clinton has sometimes benefited from missteps by male candidates. Her 2000 U.S. Senate rival, New York Republican Rick Lazio, was seen as a bully when he stepped close to her on stage during a debate to demand she sign a pledge.  Early in her first presidential campaign in 2008, Clinton accused her male opponents of piling on and said that would prompt more women to support her. Then-Senator Barack Obamas comments during a debate in New Hampshire that year that she was likable enough were seen by some as patronizing, and as helping her win the states primary. If Trump wins the nomination, his willingness to raise Clintons gender and other issues could make for one of the most contentious general election campaigns in recent history. I dont think theres going to be any taboos with Donald Trump, said James Pethokoukis, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Hes not going to treat her with any sort of kid gloves. Retired U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, weighed in on the presidential race during a talk at Stanford University on Wednesday, according to the student newspaper, saying he could vote for his golfing and texting buddy Trump but harshly criticizing Cruz. Lucifer in the flesh, Boehner said of Cruz, who is a staunch fiscal conservative and who angered many of his  colleagues in Congress by leading a government shutdown in 2013. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life, Boehner said. Cruz said Boehner was allowing his inner Trump to come out. What made John Boehner mad is that I led a movement of the people to hold Washington accountable, Cruz told reporters. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1

The video was spurred on by Trump, who, during an appearance on The Today Show last week, said in an interview that he would not care if Jenner used the womens room at his properties.

Congressman wants Homeland Security to address SAT cheating overseas,"(Reuters) - A U.S. congressman called on the Department of Homeland Security to address whether foreign students are cheating on the SAT to get into American universities and illegally qualify for U.S. visas.  In a letter dated Wednesday and sent to the Homeland Security department, Representative Matt Salmon cited a March report by Reuters that detailed the widespread practice of strategic cheating on the SAT by test preparation centers in Asia and what he termed the passive approach of the tests owner  the College Board  to stop cheating overseas.  Salmon, a Republican from Arizona and a member of a House committee on education, wrote in the letter that certain foreign students could fraudulently gain the upper-hand in college admissions by high test scores due to being prepared by these dishonest test-prep centers, thus limiting the options of those students who took the test honestly. Thousands of U.S. colleges use the standardized test to help select applicants. I am concerned that under-qualified students are being admitted to U.S. schools under false pretenses, Salmon wrote.  About 761,000 degree-seeking foreign students currently study in the United States, according to the Institute of International Education. With such a generous foreign student system, Salmon wrote, it is important that we take every effort to ensure its integrity. Homeland Security requires visas for international students to study in the United States. A prospective student must be admitted to a U.S. school before applying for a student visa, and Salmon asked the department whether it had any estimates on how many students may have entered the U.S. with faulty test scores.  In an interview Thursday, Salmon said that he wants to ensure that were not encouraging a bunch of cheats to come and study in our schools.  The College Board, the New York-based not-for-profit that owns the SAT, did not respond to requests for comment. Gillian Christensen, deputy press secretary for Homeland Security, said the department will respond to Salmons letter. In an email, she said the department is committed to ensuring the integrity of the student visa system, while protecting the freedoms and openness that are the hallmarks of our country.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will aggressively pursue those who seek to exploit and corrupt Americas legal immigration system for personal gain, Christensen wrote. Reuters reported in March that the College Board has often reused tests overseas after first giving them in America months or years earlier, even after some test questions began circulating online. College Board officials have said they are unable to assess how many test-takers have seen actual exam material before taking the SAT. But Reuters found students who had attended test-preparation centers in China and who said they had seen questions ahead of time from SATs they subsequently took. Reuters identified 14 times since late 2013 when parts of an SAT given internationally had been publicly exposed before the exam was given overseas. A confidential PowerPoint presentation, prepared by College Board officials in June 2013, revealed that parts of nine of 18 exams in the organizations global inventory had been compromised. Even so, College Board officials confirmed that some portions of those tainted tests were later administered overseas. In his letter to Homeland Security, Salmon wrote: I was greatly disturbed by recent news reports regarding The College Boards passive approach to preventing and addressing cheating on the SAT test abroad.

U.S. senators release final sentencing reform bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A revised criminal justice reform bill moved closer to a full U.S. Senate vote on Thursday when it gained support from more Republicans after being stalled for months in Congress. In a legacy-shaping issue for President Barack Obama, the measures sponsors announced four new Republican co-sponsor senators and a new version of the bill at a press conference in the Senate. The measure now has 37 co-sponsors, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley. Grassley said he had been waiting for the bill to be finalized before asking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring it up for a full Senate vote, but that it is time for those discussions to start right now. As revised, it still lowers mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, but it no longer applies to anyone convicted of a serious violent felony. That change was a response to conservative critics of the bill, which is central to Obamas efforts to overhaul the countrys federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding. That effort has been a rare example of Republican and Democratic agreement in the polarized Congress.   The bills advocates have said they hope the revisions and new co-sponsors, such as Republican senators Mark Kirk of Illinois and Steve Daines of Montana, will convince McConnell to bring up the bill for a Senate vote. Daines and Kirk lent their support after adding minor requirements, including a provision that savings from it go toward purposes such as fighting gangs of national significance. After a group of conservative Republican senators led by Tom Cotton of Arkansas claimed in January the reforms would release violent felons, the bills authors began excising parts of the proposal that eased the sentences of violent criminals.  The bill now includes a new mandatory minimum sentence for crimes involving the opiate fentanyl, mirroring parallel sentencing reforms that await a floor vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. The House legislation is likely to contain changes to mens rea laws that govern criminal intent, said Senator John Cornyn, a sponsor of the Senate bill, at Thursdays press conference.  Mens rea reform was excluded from the Senate measure because its authors were divided on the issue. Democratic lawmakers generally oppose strengthening mens rea requirements on the grounds it would enable more corporate malfeasance as it is difficult to prove the intent of a corporation. To exclude violent criminals from the Senate bill, the authors removed a section that lowered minimum sentences for unlawful gun owners with three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses, known as armed career criminals.  Such criminals represent nearly a fifth of the 12,908 current inmates who would have been eligible for resentencing under the old bill, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

"House votes to repeal U.S. retirement rule, Obama threatens veto","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to repeal a Labor Department rule aimed at protecting retirement savers from profit-hungry brokers, a largely symbolic move that President Barack Obama has threatened to veto. Obamas administration earlier in April released the rule setting a fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients best interests ahead of their bottom lines. Republican political leaders and some in the financial industry responded by trying to override it through legislation, saying complying with it would be expensive for brokers which would result in higher costs for retirement advice that many Americans could not afford. They also say that the rule does not take into account other laws and regulations on financial advice. Thursdays vote of 234 in favor, and 183 opposed split along party lines. Democrats said the fiduciary rule would protect families from paying higher fees and that the Obama administration took into consideration industry concerns when drafting the rule. Bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. have no business getting between you and your financial planner. But thats what the Obama administrations fiduciary rule does, said House Speaker Paul Ryan in a statement after the vote. Its Obamacare for financial planning.  The Senate would have to take up and pass a version of the resolution and then Congress would send a combined bill to Obama to sign into law. Obama made clear that would not happen in a statement issued on Wednesday saying the final Labor Department rule reflects extensive feedback from industry, advocates, and members of Congress, and has been streamlined to reduce the compliance burden and ensure continued access to advice. The rule has followed a long path to fruition. It was first proposed in 2010 and a year later the Labor Department, which oversees retirement plans, had to rescind it in the face of enormous industry backlash. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
Oklahoma lawmaker apologizes for linking Native Americans to alcoholism,"TULSA, Okla. (Reuters) - An Oklahoma state legislator has apologized after saying in the legislature last week that Native Americans are pre-disposed to alcohol abuse, officials said on Thursday. State Representative Todd Russ, a Republican, made the apology in a statement issued by his office this week, his office said on Thursday. During floor debate last week on a measure to amend Oklahomas liquor laws, Russ said: The white man took advantage of the Native American people at the rim of an alcohol bottle.  We see the effects of that today in society because they are predisposed physically. Scientifically we know the truth that they cannot process that like other people, he said. Russ, whose western Oklahoma district includes a portion of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes jurisdictional area, urged members of the legislatures Native American Caucus to vote against the bill, which would allow supermarkets and convenience stores to sell beer and wine. Instead, he received a rebuke for his comments. He may not have intentionally done this, but disparaging Native Americans is an uncalled for, inappropriate comment on the House floor, Representative Dan Kirby, a Republican and a citizen of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation said during the debate. In his apology, Russ offered contrition for the unintended pain I have caused Native Americans by my statement that was based upon outdated information. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
Trump garners two more endorsements in U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Thursday won endorsements from two more U.S. Congress members as he battled to be his partys nominee. Of the 300 Republicans in Congress - 246 in the House of Representatives and 54 in the Senate - Trump now had the explicit support of 11 with the newly announced public backing by Representatives Jeff Miller of Florida and Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania. Trump, a billionaire businessman, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich were vying for the nomination to represent the Republican Party in the Nov. 8 general election.  Donald Trump is the only person who has what it takes to shake up the status quo and entrenched bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., Miller said in a statement. Miller, who will retire from the Republican-controlled Congress at years end, capping 16 years in the House, has chaired the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Shuster, also in his 16th year in the House, has chaired a powerful transportation committee.  Trump backers in Congress have argued that many more lawmakers privately expressed support for Trump, but still have to run in primaries and so have publicly remained neutral. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who endorsed Trump this month, said in an interview that the Trump campaign was cranking up its outreach to Congress. Cruz, a small-government Tea Party favorite, has snared more endorsements from Congress members. The most prominent U.S. Republican lawmakers to publicly endorse Trump was Senator Jeff Sessions, who has been advising the campaign on foreign policy.  The others were U.S. Representatives Chris Collins, Duncan Hunter, Tom Marino, Tom Reed, Scott DesJarlais, Lou Barletta and Renee Ellmers. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
Biden to meet Kurdish officials in unannounced visit to Erbil,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit on Thursday to Erbil, the capital of Iraqs autonomous Kurdish region, to show support for the Kurdish government. The Pentagon announced last week it would provide up to $415 million to Kurdish peshmerga forces, who have played an important role in pushing back Islamic State in northern Iraq. Erbil is also locked in disputes with Baghdad over an oil revenue-sharing deal and the regions contested borders including, around the oil city of Kirkuk. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
White House 'deeply' concerned about China law on foreign NGOs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday the United States is deeply concerned that Chinas new law on management of the activities of foreign non-governmental organizations will narrow the space for civil society in China. Chinas parliament passed a law governing foreign NGOs, state news agency Xinhua reported. The law is part of a raft of legislation, including Chinas counterterrorism law, put forward amid a new push to crack down on dissent by President Xi Jinpings administration.   The White House urged China to respect the rights and freedoms of human rights defenders, journalists, business groups, and others, including by protecting the ability of foreign NGOs to operate in China, Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement.

"Republicans, Obama immigration chief clash over criminal immigrants","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said on Thursday her agency released 19,723 undocumented immigrants last year who had been convicted of crimes, drawing a volley of criticism from Republican lawmakers. In a heated exchange at a congressional hearing into crime committed by illegal immigrants, Republicans grilled top Obama administration immigration official Sarah Saldana.   The issue is at the heart of Republican demands for tighter control of U.S. borders and has often featured in rhetoric over immigration in the 2016 presidential election campaign.     Saldana defended her record and pleaded for comprehensive immigration reform.     I cannot tell you how disheartening it is to sit here and hear a very important issue related to the topic of immigration reform be bandied about as a political football, she said. Republicans on a House oversight committee blamed ICE for releasing undocumented immigrants from jail whom they said went on to commit homicides, sexual assaults and drunk driving offenses.   The topic of released illegal immigrants who commit later crimes gained attention on the campaign trail last year after Kathryn Steinle, 32, was shot and killed in San Francisco by Juan Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant and convicted felon who had previously been deported to Mexico five times.  Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, said in July that Steinles death showed the need for tighter control of the U.S.-Mexico border.  ICE decides whether to deport undocumented immigrants. The Obama administration has a policy of deporting immigrants who pose a violent threat, but it releases some who have served prison sentences for their crimes and are deemed not dangerous, Saldana said.  House oversight committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said the agencys practice was infuriating. When undocumented immigrants have served their jail time but cannot be repatriated, immigration authorities have no choice but to release them, she said.  Only specific crimes require mandatory jailing of immigrants, Saldana said, adding that Congress should consider changing that policy.  Countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti and Guinea have refused to take back some of their citizens after they have been ordered deported from the United States, Saldana said. Saldana said she is meeting with the State Department to persuade them to enforce visa restrictions on countries who do not take back their citizens. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1

Pentagon chief would back lifting restrictions on U.S. arms to Vietnam,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Thursday he would support lifting restrictions on the sale of weapons to Vietnam, in the latest sign of thawing ties between former enemies whose focus has shifted in recent years to Chinas military buildup. When asked by Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, if he would support lifting the restrictions, Carter said at a hearing: Weve discussed this in the past and I appreciate your leadership in that regard, chairman, and yes. Carter did not elaborate, although his comments come ahead of a planned visit to Vietnam by U.S. President Barack Obama late next month. The United States partially lifted a long-time ban on lethal weapons sales to Vietnam in October 2014, nearly 40 years after the end of the Vietnam War, to help the country patrol and defend itself in the South China Sea in the face of growing naval challenges from China. At the time, U.S. officials said future sales could include airborne systems.  Carter pledged on a visit to Vietnam last year to provide it $18 million to help its coast guard buy U.S. patrol boats. But the United States has said that fully lifting the embargo will depend on improved human rights conditions in Vietnam.  There are a number of factors that we must consider with regard to lifting the ban, including progress on human rights, the State Departments top human rights official, Tom Malinowski, said on Tuesday after an annual human rights dialogue with Vietnam on Monday.

House Speaker Ryan invites India's Modi to address Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to address a joint meeting of Congress when he visits Washington in June, an unusual show of warmth for a foreign leader.  This address presents a special opportunity to hear from the elected leader of the worlds most populous democracy on how our two nations can work together to promote our shared values and to increase prosperity, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives said in a statement. The invitation is a sharp turnaround for Modi, who was once barred from the United States over massacres of Muslims. Opportunities to address the House and Senate are considered a great honor. There have only been two in the past year: Pope Francis, on Sept. 24, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on April 29, 2015. When Modis Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies swept Indias elections in 2014, there were initially questions about whether he would qualify for a visa. President Barack Obama quickly dismissed the issue by inviting him to the White House when he called to congratulate him on his victory. In 2002, when Modi had just become Gujarats chief minister, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots in the state. The administration of President George W. Bush denied Modi a visa in 2005 under a 1998 U.S. law barring entry to foreigners who have committed particularly severe violations of religious freedom. Modi denied any wrongdoing. Indias Supreme Court ruled in 2010 he had no case to answer. Washington sees its relationship with India as critical, partly to counterbalance Chinas rising power. Obama has called it one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century.  ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
U.S. says working to cut off North Korean remittances,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said Thursday it is working to cut off revenue streams to North Korea by targeting remittances from its overseas workers, after recent nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a House of Representatives hearing that the United States is working relentlessly to get countries to cut off businesses sending money back to North Korea.  He also said Washington is working to encourage the sending home of North Korean diplomats not engaged in diplomatic activity and to make sure that people did not travel to North Korea, including for the May 6 congress of the ruling Workers Party.     What we are focused on, besides the implementation of the (U.N.) Security Council resolutions, is relentlessly building pressure on North Korea, working principally with our key allies Japan and (South) Korea, Blinken said.  We are working in various ways to cut off all the revenues going to the regime. For example, they have ... overseas workers whose remittances are not going back to their families, but are going to the regime. Were working to cut those off.     Estimates of North Korean workers abroad vary widely but a study by South Koreas state-run Korea Institute for National Unification put the number as high as 150,000, primarily in China and Russia, sending back as much as $900 million annually. North Koreans are known to work abroad in restaurants and on construction sites, and also as doctors.     The United States is also working to make sure North Korean officials are not invited to travel abroad and to ensure North Korean ships and aircraft are not allowed to dock or land in other countries, Blinken said. The senior U.S. diplomat for Asia, assistant secretary of state for East Asia, Danny Russel, said last week that another North Korean nuclear test could trigger new sanctions including an effort to choke off hard currency earnings by its overseas workers abroad. North Korea has conducted a series of missile launches, in violation of U.N. resolutions in the run-up to the Party congress and experts believe it may conduct a new nuclear test before this convenes.

Tennessee law to allow counselors to deny service based on beliefs," (This version of the April 27 story, corrects paragraph 10 to read North Carolina, not South Carolina) By Alex Dobuzinskis (Reuters) - Tennessees Republican governor on Wednesday signed a law allowing mental health counselors to refuse service to patients on sincerely held principles, the latest in a string of U.S. state measures criticized as discriminatory against the gay community. Governor Bill Haslam signed the bill into law three weeks after it was approved by the legislature. It goes into effect immediately. The substance of this bill doesnt address a group, issue or belief system, Haslam said in a statement.  Rather, it allows counselors  just as we allow other professionals like doctors and lawyers  to refer a client to another counselor when the goals or behaviors would violate a sincerely held principle. An earlier version of the bill had allowed counselors to refuse service to patients on religious grounds, but it was amended to remove any direct reference to religion.  The law protects therapists and counselors from legal action when they cite their personal principles in refusing service, despite a provision in the American Counseling Associations code of ethics barring members from such denials of service.  This measure is rooted in the dangerous misconception that religion can be used as a free pass to discriminate, Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, said in a statement. Weinberg called the bill one in a series of attacks on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community following last years ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court striking down state bans on gay marriage. Haslam had previously told Nashville Public Radio he was considering the effect the legislation may have on Tennessee and its citizens, as laws criticized as discriminatory against the LGBT community has drawn increased scrutiny in several states. In North Carolina, a number of companies including PayPal Holdings and Deutsche Bank have canceled plans to add jobs in the state after it passed a law requiring people to use bathrooms or locker rooms in schools and other public facilities that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. Haslam said he decided to sign the counseling bill in part because it forbids denial of service to patients in danger of harming themselves or others. Earlier this month, Haslam disappointed some Christians in the state when he vetoed legislation that would have made the Bible Tennessees official book. The governor said that violated the U.S. Constitution. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
"Wealthy, educated voters fuel Trump's East Coast sweep","WASHINGTON/BETHESDA, Md. (Reuters) - Wealthy, well-educated voters helped carry Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump to victory in this weeks East Coast primaries, a demographic the famously blunt-spoken billionaire had struggled to attract in the past. His sweep of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island on Tuesday included wins in some of the richest and best-educated counties in the country - like Fairfield County, Connecticut, and Newport County, Rhode Island - and added to victories in his more traditional strongholds of white working-class neighborhoods. Exit polls from Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maryland showed Trump winning about half of Republican voters with college degrees, and over half of Republican voters making more than $100,000 a year. On its face, it is hard to believe hed be improving with a demographic group that has been so averse to his style, his denigrating language, said Randall Miller, a professor of American politics at Saint Josephs University in Pennsylvania.  But I think people may have gotten used to Trump, hes not as outrageous as he used to be, he said, adding that familiarity with the businessmans brand in the Northeast may also have helped him. Still, the five states could be an uphill battle for Republicans in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The last Republican presidential nominee to win any of them was George H.W. Bush in 1988. The challenge for the New York billionaire could be to replicate Tuesdays performance in other parts of the country as he seeks to lock down his partys nomination, with 10 state contests remaining.     Nationally, likely voters with a college degree have become increasingly critical of Trump in recent months, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. He is also increasingly unpopular with those who make more than $100,000 a year. But with Trump far ahead of his rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, in the race for the presidential nomination, Miller said Republican voters of all stripes may become more resigned to voting for Trump. I think it is possible he replicates this. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT Trump has historically done well in areas where the collapse of important local industries has put stress on working families - propelling his popularity among poorer white voters drawn to his rhetoric about inept government and failed international trade deals. That narrative persisted in Tuesdays contests. Trump took more than 63 percent of the vote in Forest County, Pennsylvania, where the median family income among whites, at $45,000, is the lowest in the state. But he also got more than 46 percent of the vote in Chester County, Pennsylvania, where median income for whites is the highest in the state, at $108,000.     A Franklin and Marshall College voter survey released last week showed Trumps message of disaffection had sunk in across the state. Just under 40 percent of voters cited government, politicians as the most important problem facing Pennsylvania, with unemployment, personal finances ranked a distant second at 14 percent. In the affluent Maryland suburbs of Montgomery and Howard counties, where more than 60 percent of whites hold college degrees, Trump claimed a smaller 40 percent share of the Republican vote. It was still enough for a first-place finish over Cruz and Kasich. Fred Stubbs, 72, a retired accountant from Potomac, Maryland, said he voted for Trump on Tuesday because he believed the real estate mogul would improve the countrys standing in the world. He added that when he traveled to New York, he regularly dined in restaurants in buildings owned by Trump. Ive always admired him as a businessman, Stubbs said.  ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
"Republican Cruz, hoping to revive struggling campaign, taps Fiorina as No. 2 ","INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, in a last-ditch bid to slow front-runner Donald Trumps momentum, named former business executive Carly Fiorina on Wednesday as his vice presidential running mate should he win the nomination. After crushing losses to Trump in five nominating contests in the Northeast on Tuesday, Cruz praised Fiorina, a former presidential rival, as a principled fighter for conservative values who would be a valuable ally on the campaign trail. Carly is a vice presidential nominee who I think is superbly skilled, superbly gifted at helping unite this party, the U.S. senator from Texas told a rally in Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana. The Midwestern state is the next battleground for selecting the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates for the Nov. 8 presidential election and is shaping up to be Cruzs best - and perhaps last - chance to block Trumps march to the nomination. Cruz acknowledged it was unusual to choose a running mate so early in the race. Traditionally, the winners of the Republican and Democratic nominating races announce their running mates in the period between clinching the nomination and summers national conventions. I think all would acknowledge this race, if anything, it is unusual, said Cruz, 45, adding he wanted to give voters a clear choice and offer a rebuttal to media suggestions the Republican race was over. At a nearby rally in Indianapolis afterward, Trump was scornful of Cruzs move, calling his rival desperate.  In the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton, 68, won four of Tuesdays five contests, building a virtually insurmountable lead over rival Bernie Sanders, a 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont, who vowed to keep fighting until the July convention. In tapping Fiorina as his No. 2, Cruz was apparently trying to recover from Trumps landslide primary wins on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The victories made the uphill climb toward the nomination even steeper for Cruz. Ive had tough fights all my life, Fiorina said after Cruz introduced her. Tough fights dont worry me a bit. Fiorina, 61, dropped her own White House bid in February after a seventh-place finish in New Hampshire. She endorsed Cruz a month later and has been a sharp critic of Clinton. Fiorina and Cruz both said they had grown close since her endorsement, and she sang a few verses of a song she said she sings to Cruzs two daughters on their campaign bus.  The choice of Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard Co chief executive who, like Trump, has never held elective office, could help Cruz with women voters, a group that Trump has had difficulty winning over to his outsider campaign. It also could offer Cruz a boost in the June 7 primary in California, where Fiorina won the Republican primary in 2010 for the U.S. Senate. She was defeated in the general election by incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. Fiorina now lives in Virginia. Trump has amassed 987 of the 1,237 Republican national convention delegates he needs to secure the nomination, to 562 for Cruz and 153 for Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, the third remaining candidate, according to the Associated Press. If Cruz can win a large share of Indianas 57 delegates, it will increase the chances that Trump will not be able to win the nomination on the conventions first ballot. After that, many delegates will be free to turn to Cruz, Kasich or a dark-horse establishment candidate on a second or subsequent ballot. A loss to Trump in Indiana would effectively cripple Cruzs bid, and increase pressure on the party to rally around Trump as the prospective nominee.  Trump called Cruzs decision to pick a running mate a pure waste of time and a desperate attempt to save a failing campaign by an all-talk, no-action politician. He is the first presidential candidate in the history of this country whos mathematically eliminated from becoming president who chose a vice presidential candidate. ... Its a record, the New York billionaire and former reality TV star told supporters in Indianapolis on Wednesday. Trump vowed to campaign extensively in the state between now and Tuesdays nominating contest.  Im not playing games with Indiana, he said. You are going to get so tired of me. Were going to win it, he said. Trump was introduced at the rally by famed college basketball coach Bob Knight, who led Indiana University to three national championships.  Cruz said Fiorina had already proven her mettle in standing up to Trump last year after he insulted her looks in an interview. Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Trump had asked, only to be sternly rebuked by Fiorina in their next presidential debate. Shes faced challenges a lot worse than someone bellowing and yelling and insulting her face, Cruz told the Indianapolis crowd. A breast cancer survivor who lost a stepdaughter to drug addiction, Fiorina served as Hewlett-Packard chief executive from 1999 to 2005. She was forced to resign amid weak earnings as the company struggled to digest a $19 billion merger with Compaq Computer Corp. About 30,000 layoffs took place during her tenure. Fiorinas campaign never took off in the original 17-member Republican presidential field, and she was mostly relegated to the early second-tier debates for low-polling candidates. Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Iowa Republican Party, said Cruz would have been better off picking an experienced politician who could help him secure delegates in a fight at the convention.  Its a real head-scratcher, he said. But some conservatives applauded Cruzs choice. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which works to elect political candidates who oppose abortion rights, said Fiorina was the ideal choice. She will take Hillary Clinton head-on, Dannenfelser said in a statement.

In the battle for Hollywood endorsements - and cash - Clinton rules,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders positions on fracking, free tuition and breaking up big banks wouldnt sound out of place in an Oscar winning-actors acceptance speech.  But in famously liberal Hollywood, long used as an ATM by Democratic campaigns, Sanders message is not resonating as loudly as in other progressive bastions. The more moderate Hillary Clinton has far outpaced the Vermont senator in fundraising and has a deep line-up of A-list stars and top executives among her backers.   Celebrities dont sway votes, but they can persuade people to listen to a candidates message, said historian Steven Ross, author of Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics.  It puts a candidate on their radar, he said. Hollywood actors, studio executives and other employees of the film, TV and music industries have donated at least $8.4 million to Clintons campaign and the independent Super PAC that supports her bid, Priorities USA Action, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance data through March 31.  A pair of Clinton fundraisers held by actor George Clooney this month, at which tickets went for as much as $353,000 per couple, is not included in that total, but were reported by Deadline Hollywood to have raised an additional $15 million. By contrast, Sanders' campaign had raised about $1 million from entertainment industry donors through March 31, according to the campaign finance data. The Vermont senator, who called the price of the Clooney event ""obscene,"" is not associated with a Super PAC and says he does not court wealthy donors. (Graphic on Hollywood flows to Sanders and Clinton: tmsnrt.rs/1U98K4g) All Republican presidential candidates combined collected $460,000, roughly 5 percent of entertainment industry donations, the data showed. Clintons support in Hollywood can be traced back to strong ties her husband built during his first presidential campaign in 1992, said Donna Bojarsky, a Democratic public policy consultant who worked as national entertainment coordinator for Bill Clintons campaign. Bill Clinton connected deeply with Hollywood, she said, in part because he showed a real respect for and appreciation of pop culture. He followed it, and he enjoyed it. Another reason for Hillary Clintons success in Hollywood is the backing of executives. While business people in Hollywood may be liberals, they are less likely to embrace a candidate who attacks corporations, said Ross, the historian. Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist who wants higher taxes on wealthy people and corporations to help pay for college, healthcare, and other programs. Corporate Hollywood is about business and the bottom line, Ross said. The biggest Hollywood contributors to date are behind-the-scenes figures rather than stars, with about two-thirds of Clintons industry support through March coming from just three donors.  Haim Saban, CEO of Saban Capital Group, contributed $3.5 million, while DreamWorks Animation DWA.O CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and director Steven Spielberg donated $1 million each to Clinton and funds supporting her. But it is the celebrity backers who make headlines for a candidate, even if theyre not making hefty contributions. Pop singer Demi Lovato performed at a Clinton campaign rally, and Scandal star Kerry Washington recorded radio and TV ads for the former secretary of state.  I really believe in her capacity to deliver on her messages, Washington said in an interview. Sanders welcomed the band Vampire Weekend onto a stage in Iowa, where they joined the candidate to sing This Land Is Your Land. The Red Hot Chili Peppers performed at a Sanders fundraiser in Los Angeles.  Clintons celebrity support skews toward older men and women, and she attracts more minorities, while younger personalities gravitate to Sanders, said Dan Schnur, director of University of Southern Californias Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and a former Republican political strategist.  These leanings reflect those of voters in general, Schnur said, though there are plenty of exceptions.  Ninety-year-old actor Dick Van Dyke, a Sanders supporter, is happy to buck the trend.  People in my generation are set in their ways, Van Dyke said in an interview. Some people are afraid he might get a little too drastic, that he might do something to upset the apple cart.   Sanders, not known for his sense of humor, has also attracted a number of comedians as supporters, including Danny DeVito, Bill Maher and Sarah Silverman.  Bernie is not for sale, says Silverman, a one-time Clinton backer, in a pro-Sanders video viewed more than 32 million times on Facebook. This is a once-in-a-lifetime candidate who genuinely represents the people. Schnur finds Sanders support among some comedians understandable.If you decide to perform comedy for a living, youve probably got a little bit of an anarchist streak, he said, and Sanders challenges the establishment.  THE BERNIE-HILLARY SPLIT At times the Sanders-Clinton divide in Hollywood has grown heated. When actor Susan Sarandon, a Sanders supporter, said in an MSNBC interview last month that she wasnt sure she could vote for Clinton if she was the Democratic nominee, the reaction in Hollywood was intense. Her comments were seen as lending support to Trump.   Actor Jamie Lee Curtis, a Clinton supporter, tweeted that she respected but disagreed with Sarandon, calling her position dangerous 2 women, minorities & migrants. Debra Messing, one of the stars of NBC sitcom Will and Grace, also joined the Twitter fray, criticizing Sarandon for representing the Bernie or BUST position which is so dangerous for our country. Sarandon, who has donated $2,700 to Sanders, said her comments were reported incorrectly. Of course I wouldnt vote for Trump, she said in an interview with Reuters. She is unrepentant in her support for Sanders. We have to do something more than incremental change, Sarandon said. Sanders is about real change, progressive change, she said. She said she worries about an industry backlash against Sanders supporters, given the reaction to her statements, as well as negative comments from feminist Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about women supporting Sanders.  Its a much easier thing to be supporting Hillary than to be supporting Bernie if you are a woman in the industry.  In the end, Hollywoods Democrats will unite behind Clinton if she wins the nomination, predicted USCs Schnur. A Sanders-nista is not going to flip over and vote Republican, he said.

Exclusive: Half of Americans think presidential nominating system 'rigged' - poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than half of American voters believe that the system U.S. political parties use to pick their candidates for the White House is rigged and more than two-thirds want to see the process changed, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The results echo complaints from Republican front-runner Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders that the system is stacked against them in favor of candidates with close ties to their parties  a critique that has triggered a nationwide debate over whether the process is fair. The United States is one of just a handful of countries that gives regular voters any say in who should make it onto the presidential ballot. But the state-by-state system of primaries, caucuses and conventions is complex. The contests historically were always party events, and while the popular vote has grown in influence since the mid-20th century, the parties still have considerable sway.  One quirk of the U.S. system - and the area where the parties get to flex their muscle - is the use of delegates, party members who are assigned to support contenders at their respective conventions, usually based on voting results. The parties decide how delegates are awarded in each state, with the Republicans and Democrats having different rules. The delegates personal opinions can come into play at the party conventions if the race is too close to call - an issue that has become a lightning rod in the current political season. Another complication is that state governments have different rules about whether voters must be registered as party members to participate. In some states, parties further restrict delegate selection to small committees of party elites, as the Republican Party in Colorado did this year. Id prefer to see a one-man-one-vote system, said Royce Young, 76, a resident of Society Hill, South Carolina, who supports Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. The process is so flawed.  Trump has repeatedly railed against the rules, at times calling them undemocratic. After the Colorado Republican Party awarded all its delegates to Ted Cruz, for example, Trump lashed out in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, charging the system is being rigged by party operatives with double-agent delegates who reject the decision of voters. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has dismissed Trumps complaints as rhetoric and said the rules would not be changed before the Republican convention in July. Trump swept the five Northeastern nominating contests on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The New York billionaire has 950 delegates to 560 for Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and 153 for Kasich, the Ohio governor, according to the Associated Press. A total of 1,237 delegates are needed to secure the Republican nomination. On the Democratic side, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has taken issue with the partys use of superdelegates, the hundreds of elite party members who can support whomever they like at the convention and who this year overwhelmingly back front-runner Hillary Clinton. Clinton has repeatedly emphasized that she is beating Sanders in both total votes cast and in pledged delegates, those who are bound by the voting results - rendering his complaints about superdelegates moot. On Tuesday, the former secretary of state won Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Connecticut, while Sanders won in Rhode Island. Clinton leads Sanders by 2,141 delegates to 1,321, according to the AP, with 2,383 needed to win the nomination. Sanders has also criticized party bosses for not holding enough prime-time television debates and said before a string of primaries open only to registered Democrats this month that independents have lost their right to vote, referring to a voter block that has tended to favor him.  A Democratic National Committee official was not immediately available to comment. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said the U.S. presidential nominating system could probably be improved in a number of areas, but noted that the control wielded by party leadership usually became an issue only during tight races. The popular vote overwhelms the rules usually, but in these close elections, everyone pays attention to these arcane rules, he said. Some 51 percent of likely voters who responded to the April 21-26 online survey said they believed the primary system was rigged against some candidates. Some 71 percent of respondents said they would prefer to pick their partys nominee with a direct vote, cutting out the use of delegates as intermediaries.  The results also showed 27 percent of likely voters did not understand how the primary process works and 44 percent did not understand why delegates were involved in the first place. The responses were about the same for Republicans and Democrats.  Overall, nearly half said they would also prefer a single primary day in which all states held their nominating contests together - as opposed to the current system of spreading them out for months.

Republican donor backs clean energy senators with digital campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican political donor said on Wednesday he would spend seven figures on a targeted digital campaign backing two senators who support clean energy policies, which could help tip the balance in their tight November re-election races.  Jay Faison, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based executive of an audio-vision equipment company, said he would endorse Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire for re-election. Portman is a co-sponsor of a bipartisan energy efficiency bill, while Ayotte is one of the only Republican supporters of President Barack Obamas plan to cut carbon emissions. Both are running in swing states. Faison wants to defend conservatives who have led on clean energy issues. He will use what he calls a digital first approach focused on direct online marketing, social media and data mining to target swing voters who care about climate issues and tailor political messaging, methods he said Republicans have been slow to adopt. For right or wrong, the Republican Party is branded as non-environmental, which we want to help fix, Faison said in an interview. In February, Faison launched a Super PAC that will spend around $5 million to support congressional Republicans who support clean energy and environmental protection. Faison did not say who else he plans to back. The PAC (political action committee) complements the work of Faisons foundation, ClearPath, which he launched last June with $165 million to shift Republicans skeptical view of climate change and clean energy.     In these races and a handful of other House and Senate races, were going to play offense around candidates that take a stand on these issues, Faison said. Faison said support of clean energy could sway blocks of persuadable voters who are growing in influence - millennials and non-whites - in tight races. In a survey conducted by ClearPath of Republican voters, Faison said 73 percent said they want a candidate with a clean energy strategy. These persuadable voters perceive candidates who check the box and take the party line every single time as someone not necessarily watching out for their best interests, Faison said.  The digital strategy ClearPath will use will benefit Republican party leaders who have been reluctant to make digital marketing the centerpiece of their campaign spending, Faison said.  We are going to test that theory. The Democrats are way ahead of us here, he said. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers debate funding gimmick in defense policy bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers in the House Armed Services Committee began debating an annual defense policy bill on Wednesday that would shift $18 billion in Pentagon war-funding to other military needs. The proposed legislation would use the $18 billion to halt cuts to the size of the military and boost training and maintenance in an effort to improve U.S. military readiness. The funding shift would leave $35.7 billion to pay for U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The House panel said that was enough to last through April 2017, giving the next president time to evaluate the security situation and make a supplemental budget request to Congress. Representative Madeleine Bordallo, a Democrat from Guam, said she was concerned that the short-sighted budget gimmick ... may leave our troops short of funding required in the near future. But Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the committee, said that while some people may call it a gimmick, the Democratic majority in 2008 had done something very similar. The U.S. military has warned repeatedly in recent years that ongoing efforts to trim nearly $1 trillion from projected defense budgets over a decade have forced it to postpone training, maintenance and upkeep. The measure, the National Defense Authorization Act, sets U.S. defense policy and authorizes, but does not appropriate, funding for the Pentagon. Lawmakers in the House panel expected to vote on the final version early on Thursday, after which it will go to the full House of Representatives. The draft bill unveiled by Thornberry this week would authorize $610.5 billion in defense spending for the 2017 fiscal year beginning in October. That total is in line with the defense spending plan proposed by Obama earlier this year. The proposal calls for an active duty Army of 480,000 troops, which is 20,000 more than proposed in the presidents budget request. It also seeks significant reforms in the organization of the Defense Department, including expanding the term and the advisory role of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. During debates on the legislation, lawmakers approved an amendment that calls for a senior U.S. defense official to be placed in charge of developing directed energy weapons. The U.S. military hopes directed-energy weapons will provide it with an asymmetric advantage over potential rivals, for example enabling it to counter million-dollar missiles with a weapon that fires projectiles costing only $25,000.

Trump rhetoric shows need to remake case for trade: Zoellick,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Embarrassed by Donald Trumps rhetoric against Mexico, former World Bank President Robert Zoellick said on Wednesday it is time to remake the case for free trade in the United States.  The U.S. presidential race has been peppered with promises to rework trade policy in the United States favor, and many of the strongest attacks have been against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a trade accord between the United States, Mexico and Canada that took effect in 1994. Regarded by Mexican policymakers as a milestone in the countrys economic modernization, NAFTA has been vilified by Republican front-runner Trump and Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders as a job-killing betrayal of U.S. industry. Zoellick, a Republican who also served as U.S. Trade Representative under President George W. Bush, said Mexican officials had understandably been unsettled by Trumps rhetoric and flagging U.S. congressional support for free trade. The bigger issue in the U.S. will be a need to remake the case for trade, he said in a phone interview. That meant more than the traditional corporate lobbying in Congress, said Zoellick, who was World Bank chief from 2007-2012. This is now going to need a broader public push. Part of this will be a challenge to get the Facebooks, the Googles the Apples and others to not only make the case in Washington, but actually use social media, use big data resources and others to explain this to coming generations of Americans, he said. While noting that some Americans had good reason to feel concern about the pace of change and unfettered immigration, Zoellick said Mexico, a significant, modernizing economy, ought to be integrated further into U.S. thinking. If it were up to me, I would bring Canada and Mexico into the TTIP negotiations with Europe, he said, referring to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a planned trade deal between the United States and the European Union. After China and Canada, Mexico is the United States third biggest trade partner, accounting for bilateral commerce worth around $500 billion annually. The United States is also home to an estimated 35 million people of Mexican origin. Claiming Mexico is killing the United States on trade and sending rapists and drug runners north, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs against Mexico and vowed to build a wall to stop illegal immigrants crossing the border. To make Mexico pay for the wall, he has threatened to block billions of dollars in remittances sent home by Mexicans in the United States, a plan Zoellick described as outrageous. As an American, frankly, Im embarrassed by his statements, he said. However, he noted the Mexican government had to walk a fine line in countering Trump without stoking more tensions. A number of serving and former Mexican officials believe their government could have been more active in persuading U.S. businesses and politicians to make the case that both countries will lose out if Trumps talk becomes reality. Zoellick said, however, it was a shared responsibility.  Depending on ones perspective, this is really ... the U.S.s burden to bear. And so while I concur that one would welcome assistance from Mexico, in some ways weve got to get our own act cleaned up in the U.S. first, he said. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
"Hastert loses one Illinois pension, keeps another after sentencing","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois stripped former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert of his teachers pension on Wednesday, but his sentencing for a federal financial crime linked to past sex abuse will not cost him a second, more lucrative state pension. The state Teachers Retirement System moved swiftly after Hasterts sentencing by ending his $16,622-a-year annuity from 16 years of teaching in a far western suburb of Chicago, where the sexual abuse to which he admitted occurred. But Hastert will not lose his $28,025 annual pension from his six years as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives. The Teachers Retirement System, in ending Hasterts pension, cited an Illinois law that prohibits retired educators from drawing pensions if they are found guilty of a felony arising from their service as teachers. Hastert was sentenced by a federal judge in Chicago on Wednesday to 15 months in prison, followed by two years of probation and sex-offender treatment for a financial crime related to his sexual abuse of high school wrestlers he coached decades ago. As a teacher between 1965 and 1981, Hasterts contributions to the Teachers Retirement System totaled $16,327. Since 1997, Hastert received $237,045 in pension payments, the agency disclosed. But his benefit from his years as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives will continue because the crime to which Hastert admitted happened after 2010, more than two decades after his departure from the Illinois statehouse, said Timothy Blair, executive secretary for the state General Assembly Retirement System. The one charge on this that stuck happened well after his time in the General Assembly, Blair said. Obviously, it couldnt be related to his role as an elected official here. As a legislator, Hastert contributed $19,805 to his legislative pension and has received $420,524, Blairs agency disclosed. The federal agency that administers congressional pensions did not respond to questions about Hastert on Wednesday. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
Elections get dirty as adult filmmakers set up political action committee,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California politics got a bit more racy on Wednesday, as producers and actors in the adult film business said they had formed a political action committee, or PAC, to fight a ballot initiative to require the use of condoms when shooting explicit sex scenes. The move by an industry association representing Californias busy pornographers - a $4 billion industry in California whose loss could cost the state tens of millions in tax revenues and up to 20,000 jobs - is the latest chapter in a years-long skirmish with public health advocates over how best to prevent sexually transmitted disease among performers of pornography. Los Angeles, and especially the San Fernando Valley area, has historically been a hub of porn production. A number of high-profile X-rated performers in the area have suffered HIV infections, shaking the industry and local health officials. Nearly a dozen performers were infected with the HIV virus between 2004 and 2014, according to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is backing the ballot initiative. The groups measure, which will appear on the November ballot, would require the use of condoms and lubricants on adult film sets. It requires producers to provide the condoms and to offer free vaccinations and tests for sexually transmitted diseases to all performers. The measure also would allow performers or other individuals residing in California to ask for a state investigation into whether a particular adult film or video was made using condoms. If the state declines to investigate, that person can sue. Porn producers have focused on that section, saying it would lead to the harassment of actors. It opens up the door to extortion and harassment of a predominantly female performer base and small business owners by those outside the industry,said Mike Stabile, a spokesman for the Free Speech Coalition, the porn industry association. The new PAC, dubbed Californians Against Worker Harassment, is just beginning to raise funds, Stabile said. State records show that no contributions have yet been reported for its cause. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is backing the initiative, has already contributed $1.5 million to promote it to the public, state records show. Los Angeles County passed a local ballot initiative also backed by AIDS Healthcare Foundation requiring condom use on porn shoots in 2012. But even though it has proven difficult to enforce, Stabile said the measure has led producers of sexually-explicit movies to film elsewhere. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
Former Kentucky governor says successor may be target of FBI probe,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Former Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear on Wednesday accused his successor Matt Bevin of threatening lawmakers and said such actions may be the target of a federal investigation. Beshears remarks, made at a press conference in the state capital of Frankfort, are the latest in a burgeoning political war between the two politicians. Beshear, a Democrat, accused Bevin, a Republican, of threatening cancellation of road projects in Democratic lawmakers districts unless they switched parties. He demanded that Democratic legislators switch parties and threatened to cancel road projects in their districts if they didnt comply, Beshear said of Bevin, according to a transcript of his speech. When they refused, he said he would destroy them.  I understand that the FBI may be looking into that kind of conduct, he added, according to the transcript. Beshears spokesman, Dan Hassert, confirmed the former governors comments. David Habich, a spokesman for the FBIs Louisville office, said he could not disclose whether Bevin is being investigated. Bevin is currently in Europe on an economic development trip. Jessica Ditto, Bevins communications director, said in a statement that Beshear was trying to protect himself by throwing out baseless accusations. Last week, Bevin called for a probe into how Beshears administration awarded state contracts and solicited campaign contributions. Bevins accusations came shortly before a former Beshear official pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges. On Wednesday, Beshear said Bevin was the one using intimidation, accusing the governor of threatening the jobs of state employees if they did not accuse the previous administration of wrongdoing.  Kentuckys House of Representatives has been in Democratic control since 1921, but the party only has a 53-47 edge. Two members did switch after Bevin won election in November.      The hostilities began before Bevin took office in December after the term-limited Beshear appointed his wife to an unpaid seat on the state horse park commission during his final days in office. Meanwhile, the former governor has launched a campaign against Bevins healthcare initiatives. In addition, Beshears son serves as the states attorney general and has sued Bevin over cuts he ordered in higher education funding. Beshear on Wednesday said he hopes his successor stops with the accusations and moves forward with leading the state. But if he wants a food fight, you know which hes had so far, then Im going answer any unfounded allegations that he keeps throwing out there, Beshear said. ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1
"Carly's croon sparks bewilderment, criticism on social media","(Reuters) - Carly Fiorina was so happy to be named U.S. presidential hopeful Ted Cruzs running mate, she broke into song during her acceptance speech. But the chorus that greeted her on social media was anything but complimentary. Cruz announced at a rally on Wednesday in Indianapolis that the former Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett-Packard would join his ticket. But the unveiling faced scorn on social media after she started to sing while addressing the crowd.

'Cuz we travel on the bus all day; we get to play."" (here) Twitter users reacted with bewilderment, mocking Fiorina over her singing. Carly Fiorina started singing at a rally where shes named VP by a candidate who aint getting the nod, tweeted writer and Ebony columnist Michael Arceneaux (@youngsinick). This election is hilarious.

Ryan wants to end Obamacare cost protections for sick consumers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called on Wednesday for an end to Obamacares financial protections for people with serious medical conditions, saying these consumers should be placed in state high-risk pools.  In election-year remarks that could shed light on an expected Republican healthcare alternative, Ryan said existing federal policy that prevents insurers from charging sick people higher rates for health coverage has raised costs for healthy consumers while undermining choice and competition. The rule, a cornerstone of President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, has been praised by patient advocates for providing access to medical care for people who previously could not afford private health insurance. The Affordable Care Act also bars insurers from excluding coverage for pre-existing conditions. Less than 10 percent of people under 65 are what we call people with pre-existing conditions, who are really kind of uninsurable, Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told a student audience at Georgetown University.  Lets fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage, so that they can get affordable coverage, he said. You dramatically lower the price for everybody else. You make health insurance so much more affordable, so much more competitive and open up competition. Charging the same rates to individuals regardless of their medical history is also a key part of group health plans in the private sector. House Republicans, after repeated votes to repeal Obamacare, have promised to produce their own alternative to the Affordable Care Act as part of a broader policy agenda intended to attract voters in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The policy document is expected just ahead of the Republican presidential nominating convention in July. High-risk pools, which existed before the healthcare law, are state-level entities that guarantee coverage for people with health problems. Analysts say they can be prohibitively expensive and offer less than optimal health coverage.  Republicans have proposed state-based risk pools as an Obamacare alternative in the past. Last week, the conservative Republican Study Committee recommended risk pools as part of the House policy agenda, saying premiums should be capped at 200 percent of a states average.

"Ackman, Valeant pledge reforms after spiking drug prices","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman promised U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that he will urge the board of Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO) to reduce the high prices of four life-saving drugs that are now at the heart of two congressional probes. Speaking before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Ackman revealed that Valeants board will hold a conference call on Thursday to discuss the costs of heart medications Isuprel and Nitropress, as well as Cuprimine and Syprine, two drugs that are used to treat a genetic disorder that causes copper to build up in the bodys organs. Valeant raised the price of Isuprel by about 720 percent and Nitropress by 310 percent, after acquiring them in 2015. The other two were raised by 5,878 percent and 3,162 percent, respectively. My recommendation is going to be to reduce the prices, Ackman testified. The Senate Special Committee on Aging is one of two U.S. congressional panels investigating sky-rocketing price increases of certain decades-old drugs acquired by companies including Valeant and Turing Pharmaceuticals, a company founded by Martin Shkreli. Ackman, a major Valeant shareholder, appeared Wednesday alongside the companys outgoing Chief Executive Michael Pearson and Howard Schiller, a board member and former chief financial officer. Ackman joined the board last month as Valeant faced mounting scrutiny by members of Congress, prosecutors and regulators over its drug pricing, business practices and accounting - issues that have caused its share price to plummet almost 90 percent since August. Valeant has about $30 billion of debt and has been negotiating with creditors, some of whom issued notices of default after it missed a deadline for the filing of its financial results. Ackman said Wednesday that one of his top priorities is to protect the company from bankruptcy. Later, in response to a question from Reuters, he expressed confidence that the company will recover. There is not going to be any bankruptcy of Valeant, he said. We were in a death spiral, and we have taken steps to deal with the banks. We are going to file our 10K on time. We brought in a new CEO. Pearson, Ackman and Schiller all told lawmakers on Wednesday they regretted Valeants pricing decisions. The company was too aggressive and I, as its leader, was too aggressive in pursuing price increases on certain drugs, he said. But many lawmakers on the panel appeared skeptical. They questioned Valeants business model of investing little in research and development, and the companys practice of acquiring decades-old drugs and raising the prices. Senator Claire McCaskill, the panels top Democrat, angrily asked each of the panelists at one point if they could recall one drug that Valeant didnt raise the price on.  Not in the United States, Pearson responded, while Schiller was only able to come up with the name of one drug Valeant acquired after its purchase of Salix. That is not social good, that is social bad, McCaskill said.  Lawmakers also questioned whether Valeants patient assistance and rebate programs are truly helping patients and hospitals afford the medications. Senator Susan Collins, the panels chairman, said her committees investigation has thus far been unable to find a single hospital that has received a discount. I can assure you that many of the large hospital systems are getting discounts on the heart drugs, Pearson said.  Pearson is expected to step down in the coming weeks to make way for the incoming CEO, Joseph Papa, previously of Perrigo Company (PRGO.N). Wednesdays hearing also featured testimony from doctors and a patient with Wilsons Disease who was forced to stop using Syprine because of the price spike.  Dr. Frederick Askari of the University of Michigan told the panel that the cost of Syprine is now so high that it has become less expensive to get a liver transplant and a life-time supply of anti-rejection medications. The patient, Berna Heyman, testified that Valeant refused to help her when she called to complain about the prices. Later, after speaking with the media, the company changed its tune, offered to help, and even sent flowers. I refused the flowers, she said. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
Valeant to pay new CEO Papa base salary of $1.5 million ,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Incs (VRX.TO) new chief executive, Joseph Papa, will receive a base salary of $1.5 million, the company said in a filing on Wednesday. Valeant said on Monday former Perrigo Co Plc (PRGO.N) head Papa would replace Michael Pearson as its CEO. Papa will also receive a cash payment of $8 million to make up for the equity-based compensation he forfeited in connection with the termination of his employment with Perrigo.  Valeant said in March Pearson was leaving the company, just three weeks after returning from a two-month medical leave.  Pearson's base salary for full-year 2014 was $2 million and his total compensation amounted to $10.3 million, according to a regulatory filing. (1.usa.gov/1aapxiM) ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
Clinton sole presidential hopeful to attend Asian American forum,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democrat Hillary Clinton is the only presidential contender scheduled to attend a reception next week organized by a leading political association of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as she seeks to consolidate her support from minority voters.  The Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies Leadership Network, a nonpartisan group that seeks to get Asian Americans elected to political office, said on Wednesday that it had invited all presidential hopefuls to the event in Washington, but Clinton was the only one to accept. The campaigns of Clintons Democratic rival Bernie Sanders and Republican hopeful Ted Cruz did not commit, and the campaign of Republican front-runner Donald Trump campaign responded that he was unlikely to attend, Floyd Mori, president and chief executive of the leadership network said. Republican John Kasichs campaign did not respond.  Minority voters have provided a boost to Clinton as she fends off a challenge from Vermont Senator Sanders for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. African Americans helped her notch key wins in states such as South Carolina and this week in Maryland.  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are a smaller group,  making up about 5.6 percent of the population, according to U.S. Census data. But in recent years they have been among the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the United States.  We are a vote that is becoming increasingly powerful, said Rep. Judy Chu, a Democrat in Congress representing California, who will introduce Clinton at the event. In this election we are the swing vote in the swing states, Chu said, pointing to Virginia and Nevada.  Still, challenges remain in building the Asian Americans electorate into a political force, Mori said.  We are not as good at registering Asian Americans (to vote) as a lot of other populations, he said. We need to do better.  ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
Trump's Washington foreign policy speech,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump delivered a major foreign policy speech on Wednesday, vowing always to put America first.. The following are highlights from his address: No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first.Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at whats happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The air force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s, in combat missions today - these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people dont understand it. And with that economic power we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control. Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility, must end and ideally will end soon. We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. Theyre not supposed to be doing it. No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.If need be, thats whats going to have to happen. And then theres ISIS. I have a simple message for them: Their days are numbered.I wont tell them where and I wont tell them how. ISIS will be gone if Im elected president. And theyll be gone quickly. He (Obama) negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. He (Obama) supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place. Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. After Im elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATOs outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.

U.S. Congress passes legislation to protect firms' trade secrets,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Wednesday passed and sent to President Barack Obama legislation strengthening legal protection for companies trade secrets, including manufacturing processes and computer methods. The House of Representatives voted 410-2 to approve the Defend Trade Secrets Act on the heels of it being unanimously passed by the Senate earlier this month. The legislation, which is backed by the White House, would open the door for companies to sue in federal court for damages related to theft of trade secrets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said the measure will help American innovators protect their intellectual property from criminal theft by foreign agents and those engaging in economic espionage. In urging its passage, Goodlatte rattled off iconic U.S. products including fried chicken from the fast food restaurant KFC and Coca Cola, saying the legislation would provide further protections for their secret recipes.  Theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, is estimated to cost American firms more than $300 billion a year, according to a 2013 report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property. Trade secret theft already is a federal crime, but without the right to sue in federal court, companies must seek redress in state courts amid a patchwork of state laws. Corporations such as Boeing Co and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and computer software lobbyists representing companies such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, have pushed for the enhanced protections. Backers of the legislation have cited a case last year in which a South Korean company, Kolon Industries, was found guilty in U.S. federal court of conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont. The foreign firm was ordered to pay $85 million in criminal fines and $275 million in restitution for illegally obtaining information on the chemical companys Kevlar body armor, which resulted in nearly $1 billion in economic losses for DuPont, according to lawmakers. In allowing civil suits in federal court for illegal procurement of trade secrets including manufacturing processes, formulas, computer algorithms, industrial designs, business strategies and customer lists, the legislation aims to create uniform standards for what constitutes trade secret theft. In todays digital environment, it has never been easier to transfer trade secrets across the globe with the click of a cell phone, tablet, or computer key, said Representative Jerrold Nadler, the leading Democratic co-sponsor of the legislation.

Email privacy bill unanimously passes U.S. House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted unanimously on Wednesday to require law enforcement authorities to get a search warrant before asking technology companies to hand over old emails. The bills prospects in the Senate remain unclear, though the 419-0 vote in the House was likely to put pressure on the upper chamber to approve it. Under the Email Privacy Act, which updates a decades-old law, authorities would have to get a warrant to access emails or other digital communications more than 180 days old. At present, agencies such as the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission only need a subpoena to seek such data from a service provider. Supporters of the legislation say it is needed to update the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). Technology companies and privacy advocates say that statute was written before the rise of the Internet and so is outdated. The issue of law enforcement access to private electronic communications has been at the center of an international debate. This was reflected in the Justice Departments high-profile pursuit of a court order earlier this year to force Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to help unlock an encrypted iPhone linked to one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters.     Separately, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) earlier this month filed lawsuit in federal court against the Justice Department, alleging the government is using ECPA in a way that violates the U.S. Constitution.      The company argued ECPA is too often used to prevent the company from notifying its users, sometimes indefinitely, when investigators pry into emails and other data stored on remote servers. More than a quarter of senators have endorsed similar legislation in the upper chamber to the House bill, including No. 2 Republican John Cornyn.  But it was unclear if Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who holds jurisdiction over the legislation, intends to move it forward during an election year.  The Iowa Republican will review the House bill, consult with stakeholders and his committee and decide where to go from there, a spokeswoman told Reuters in an email. Senators Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee, the Democratic and Republican authors of the Senate bill, praised the House vote in a statement as an historic step toward updating our privacy laws for the digital age and urged quick consideration.

"Ex-House Speaker Hastert gets 15 months, admits sex abuse","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, once one of the countrys most powerful politicians, was sentenced on Wednesday to 15 months in federal prison for a financial crime related to sexual abuse of high school wrestlers he coached decades ago. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Durkin called Hastert a serial sex abuser in handing down the sentence, which was longer than the zero to six months recommended by federal prosecutors. Durkin said the sentence would have been even longer if it werent for Hasterts age, 74, and poor health. Frail and clinging to a walker, Hastert apologized for sexually abusing boys when he was a teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville. Im sorry to those I hurt and misled. I wanted to apologize for the boys I mistreated, Hastert told Durkin at the two-hour sentencing hearing in federal court in Chicago. The judge asked him if he acknowledged sexual abuse of his victims and Hastert said he did. Hastert, the longest-serving Republican House speaker in history and a successful international lobbyist who was earning $75,000 a month, pleaded guilty last October to the crime of structuring. That involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection. He needed the cash after he reached a secret agreement with one of his five sexual abuse victims to pay him $3.5 million in compensation for pain and suffering. The judge said that even though Hastert could not be charged with sex abuse because the statute of limitations had run out, he could take the conduct into consideration at sentencing. Some conduct is unforgivable no matter how old it is. The abuse was 40 years ago but the damage lasts today, Durkin said. Hasterts defense had asked for a probation-only sentence, arguing that his shame and humiliation were punishment enough. His portrait has been removed from the Capitol, the seat of the U.S. Congress, and his alma mater Wheaton College stripped his name from a public policy center. Nothing is more stunning than having the words serial child molester and speaker of the house in the same sentence, Durkin acknowledged. But he said that an extremely aggravating factor in the sentencing was that Hastert lied to federal agents about the money and falsely claimed that the victim was extorting him. He said Hastert must serve two years of probation and go through sex-offender treatment after release, and also pay a $250,000 fine. Scott Cross, 53, one of Hasterts victims, and Jolene Burdge, the sister of another victim who is deceased, both spoke during the hearing. Dont be a coward, Mr. Hastert, Burdge said. Tell the truth. What you did wasnt misconduct. It was sexual abuse of a minor. Cross, the first victim to ever speak publicly about the abuse, choked up as he described how Hastert molested him in the wrestling locker room in 1972. As a 17-year-old boy I was devastated, he told the judge. I tried to figure out why Coach Hastert had singled me out. I felt very alone and tremendously embarrassed. Hastert, a conservative who trumpeted his honesty and small-town values when he was in Washington, D.C., said he did not contest Crosss statement. But his defense said the former politician had forgotten the incident from 1972 and had even approached Crosss older brother, Tom Cross, former Illinois House Republican leader, and asked him to write a letter of support to the judge. The sex abuse victim who received money from Hastert has not been named publicly. On Monday, using the name James Doe, he sued Hastert for $1.8 million, saying he had received only $1.7 million of the promised compensation. Hastert had been out on bail pending sentencing. When there is room for him, he will report to a federal prison where he can get medical treatment after suffering a life-threatening blood infection last year. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
Maine official approves ballot initiative on marijuana legalization,"(Reuters) - A Maine state official on Wednesday validated a petition by pro-marijuana activists that would allow the states voters to determine whether to make recreational use of the drug legal in the northeasternmost U.S. state. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found that activists had collected enough verified signatures to be presented to state lawmakers for consideration, his office said in a statement. The state legislature has the option of approving the proposal as written or placing it on the ballot in November. That move followed a ruling by a state judge earlier this month that overruled an initial decision by Dunlaps office that almost half of the signatures gathered by the campaign were not valid, citing concerns that the signatures of notaries public on various forms submitted did not match up with versions on file in official state records. The referendum would allow adults 21 and older to legally possess marijuana, while levying a 10 percent tax on recreational sales. Marijuana use in public would remain illegal. Maine Governor Paul LePage has publicly opposed the measure, saying he believes marijuana is a gateway drug that leads other sorts of narcotics abuse. Voters in four U.S. states plus the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of the drug in similar ballot initiatives. Advocates have pushed for similar referendums this year in a half-dozen other states, including Massachusetts and California. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
Iran nuclear deal fight threatens Senate spending bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A battle over implementation of the Iran nuclear deal erupted on the U.S. Senate floor on Wednesday as Democrats maneuvered to block a Republican amendment stopping the Obama administration from buying heavy water from Tehrans nuclear program. By a vote of 50-46, Democrats and four Republicans banded together to stop a fiscal 2017 energy spending bill, in order to keep Republican Senator Tom Cotton from offering his amendment to the measure. The legislation had needed 60 yes votes to move ahead. President Barack Obamas administration had warned Congress that it strongly opposed any move to prevent the planned purchase of $8.6 million worth of heavy water, which is non-radioactive and used in nuclear reactors and for making nuclear weapons. Under last years nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and five other world powers, Tehran is responsible for reducing its stock of the substance, which it can sell, dilute or dispose of, under certain conditions. The dust-up put a crimp in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells plans to spend the next several weeks advancing bipartisan appropriations bills to keep the federal government functioning beyond Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. Before the vote, Senator Chuck Schumer, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told reporters that if Democrats allowed the bill to proceed, potentially clearing the way for a vote on the Cotton amendment, Republicans would be emboldened again and again and again to attach to spending bills poison pill amendments the White House opposes. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Cottons focus was on undermining the implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran, and that the administration was gratified Cottons amendment did not advance in the Senate. Im confident that (Cotton) couldnt differentiate heavy water from sparkling water, Earnest said.Cotton said he wanted to insure that the United States taxpayer is not subsidizing a critical component of Irans nuclear industry, which I would add we are not required to do under the nuclear agreement with Iran. Every Republican in Congress opposed the nuclear agreement announced in July, joined by several of Obamas fellow Democrats. Not trusting Tehran to keep its promise to curtail its nuclear program, some lawmakers have tried repeatedly to pass legislation the administration says would undermine it. McConnell said he would try again to pass the spending bill, accusing Democrats of finding new ways to blow up the appropriations process. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
Alabama city makes bathroom access by gender identity a crime,"(Reuters) - An Alabama city appears to be the first in the country to specify criminal penalties for violators of an ordinance requiring people to use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificates, civil rights groups said on Wednesday. The law passed on Tuesday by the city council in Oxford, located about 60 miles east of Birmingham, carries a possible punishment of a $500 fine or six months in jail. The measure raises the stakes in the U.S. bathroom wars that have caused fierce debate among state lawmakers, school officials and Republican presidential candidates. It goes further than a law enacted last month in North Carolina - which has been boycotted by businesses, entertainers and government workers - since it became the first state to bar transgender people from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. North Carolinas law applies to restrooms and locker rooms in government-owned facilities and schools. The Oxford ordinance also includes bathrooms in private businesses and explicitly makes violating the provision a crime, the Human Rights Campaign said. This is a very concerning expansion of the ways in which trans people are going to be and have been policed, said Chase Strangio, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Unions LGBT Project. Its essentially just criminalizing trans existence. Steven Waits, president of the Oxford City Council, said the measure was a response to complaints from residents after retailer Target last week said transgender people and customers could use store bathrooms that matched the gender with which they identify, the Anniston Star reported. Waits said the council adopted the law not out of concerns for the 0.3 percent of the population who identify as transgender, but to protect our women and children, according to the newspaper. Waits did not reply to a request for comment from Reuters. Strangio said the law raises constitutional questions and the ACLU was considering taking legal action to block it. The group already has sued North Carolina over its law. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
U.S. top court poised to overturn Virginia ex-governor's bribery conviction,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared poised to throw out the corruption convictions of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell, a move federal prosecutors fear could undermine their ability to bring crooked politicians to justice. During the one-hour argument, several of the eight justices signaled that McDonnells acceptance of $177,000 in luxury gifts and sweetheart loans from a businessman seeking to promote a dietary supplement did not constitute a criminal act. They voiced concern that the broad interpretation of U.S. anti-corruption law used by federal prosecutors could criminalize numerous commonplace actions by politicians. U.S. Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the justices overturning McDonnells conviction and giving politicians more leeway to accept gifts in return for certain actions would be a recipe for corruption. McDonnells lawyer Noel Francisco argued the former governors conduct was no different than what politicians across the United States do on a daily basis when responding to requests from donors and constituents. McDonnell, 61, is a former Republican Party rising star who served as governor from 2010 to 2014 and once was considered as a possible vice presidential candidate. His wife, Maureen, was convicted in a separate trial. Prosecutors during his trial described the luxurious lifestyle the McDonnells lived thanks to Virginia businessman Jonnie Williams including vacations, designer clothing and shoes, a $6,500 Rolex watch, $15,000 for their daughters wedding, golf outings and more. Liberal and conservative justices alike raised concerns about the Justice Departments interpretation of U.S. bribery law. Stephen Breyer described as dangerous the enormous power over elected officials that federal prosecutors would hold if the court endorsed the Justice Departments position. A ruling is due by the end of June. A decision in McDonnells favor could limit the type of cases federal prosecutors could bring against politicians in the future by requiring that any action taken in return for a bribe must be more than, for example, simply arranging a meeting between a benefactor and a government official. The impact of the decision would depend on how far the justices are willing to go in narrowing the scope of the corruption laws. The justices potentially could overturn the conviction but issue a narrow ruling focusing on the specifics of McDonnells case, including the judges instructions to the jury on how to weigh the evidence, rather than finding that the corruption law used in the case was flawed. Even if his conviction is overturned, McDonnell could face a retrial. Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to favor a broad ruling saying the statutes under which McDonnell was convicted could be unconstitutionally vague because they can cover many different activities. Roberts cited the example of a businessman seeking state tax breaks in return for opening a new plant. Roberts wondered if it would be considered a corrupt act if the states governor accepted an invitation from the businessman to go on a fishing trip to discuss the proposal. Breyer and Justice Anthony Kennedy said politicians need guidance so they know what conduct potentially could be prosecuted. If the law is interpreted broadly, political figures will not know what they are supposed to do and what they are not supposed to do, Breyer said. After a trial that laid bare rifts in his marriage, McDonnell was convicted of 11 corruption counts including conspiracy, bribery and extortion for taking the gifts and loans in exchange for promoting a dietary supplement called Anatabloc made by Williams company Star Scientific. Williams wanted McDonnell to press researchers at Virginia state universities to conduct studies that could help win U.S. regulatory approval for Anatabloc.  A judge sentenced McDonnell to two years behind bars, but the Supreme Court last year said he would not have to report to prison while appeals were ongoing. McDonnells wife was found guilty of nine criminal counts and received a one-year sentence. She remains out of prison while pursuing her own separate appeal. Sonia Sotomayor, one of the only justices to indicate support for the prosecution, suggested it was reasonable to infer that McDonnells intent was to help Williams when he accepted money and gifts. Some justices appeared troubled by the signal a ruling in his favor would send. Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared alarmed by the idea of officials being able to accept payments to arrange meetings without facing potential prosecution. Officials could simply say Ill do it for you if you pay me a thousand dollars, she said. McDonnell, one of few high-level politicians to have his appeal of a criminal conviction heard by the Supreme Court, sat with his wife in the courtroom for the last oral arguments of the justices current term. McDonnells lawyers contend the former governors conduct did not constitute official action in exchange for a thing of value, as required for conviction under federal bribery law.

North Carolina lawmaker: 'we must fight to keep our state straight',"(Reuters) - A Republican candidate running to become North Carolinas attorney general faced criticism on Tuesday after saying we must fight to keep our state straight while discussing a law that restricts transgender bathroom access and gay rights. The measure has positioned the state at the center of a debate over equality, privacy and religious freedom as states propose legislation seen as discriminatory against gay and transgender people in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that legalized same-sex marriage. State Senator Buck Newton made the comment while concluding a speech at a rally on Monday and welcomed the idea of being considered a poster child for the law, dubbed HB 2. The law made North Carolina the first state in the country to require transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. Go home, tell your friends and family who had to work today what this is all about and how hard we must fight to keep our state straight, he said to applause. The North Carolina Democratic Party on Tuesday called the comments hateful and discriminatory, demanded Newton apologize, and called on Republican Governor Pat McCrory to denounce the statement. One of the Republican sponsors of HB 2 just admitted the real purpose of the law: to make North Carolina unwelcoming to (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people, party spokesman Dave Miranda said in a statement.  In a statement on his Facebook page on Tuesday, Newton said liberals were twisting my words. Lawmakers on Monday returned to the states capital to begin a short session designed to address the state budget, though controversy over the law has drawn much attention. A group of Democratic representatives on Monday filed a bill seeking a repeal the law, while Republican lawmakers have shown little willingness to back down. Thousands also flocked to Raleigh to show support or disdain for the law. Business leaders, entertainers and even Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump have come out against the law. Opponents contend it demonizes transgender people and limits government protections against discrimination for gays and lesbians. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
U.S. diplomat Nuland says optimistic about Ukraine reforms,"KIEV (Reuters) - U.S Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said on Wednesday she was encouraged by signs of commitment to reform from Ukraines new government and urged Kiev to start jailing corrupt officials. Months of political turmoil in the run-up to the cabinet reshuffle - the biggest since an uprising in 2014 brought in a pro-Western leadership - have derailed efforts to root out corruption, delaying billions of dollars in foreign loans. Overall, I go home encouraged by the commitment of all the political forces to continuing and accelerating reform, economic reform, anti-corruption reform, in particular judicial reform, she said at the end of her first official visit to Kiev since the political shakeup earlier in April. Former prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk resigned two weeks ago and was replaced by Volodymyr Groysman, a close ally of President Petro Poroshenko.    Obviously corruption is still a very deep problem. Its time to start locking up people who have ripped off the Ukrainian population for too long, she said.  Nuland called for greater political unity, insisting Ukraine must stay the course with a $17.5 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund, whose third tranche of $1.7 billion has been delayed since last October. Pro-European reformists in Ukraine have previously expressed concern that the latest political reboot will not eliminate the influence of powerful business interests on policymaking. Nuland said further U.S. financial assistance to Ukraine - a third $1-billion loan guarantee is in the offing -  would depend on the government sticking to the IMF program.

Baltimore primary voters back reform candidate for mayor after Freddie Gray unrest,"BALTIMORE (Reuters) - A Maryland state senator backing law enforcement reform won a narrow victory on Tuesday in the Democratic nominating contest for the mayor of Baltimore, as the city recovers a year after rioting sparked by a black mans death in police custody. The primary election in the mostly African-American city of 620,000 people comes as Baltimore residents confront rising violent crime and unrest sparked by the death of Freddie Gray in April, 2015.  The incident stoked a simmering U.S. debate on treatment of minorities by law enforcement officers and prompted the current mayor to decline to seek re-election.  While the Republican Party and other parties also held primaries, the Democratic races winner almost certainly will win Novembers general election because Democrats outnumber Republicans 10 to one in Baltimore, about 40 miles (60 km) northeast of Washington. In the Democratic contest, state Senator Catherine Pugh, the chambers majority leader edged out former Mayor Sheila Dixon, 37 percent to 34 percent. Dixon was forced from office in 2010 for allegedly misappropriating gift cards for low-income families. Pugh defeated a field of 13 Democrats vying for the nomination, including DeRay Mckesson, a nationally known activist with the Black Lives Matter movement that sprang up after police killings of minorities in U.S. cities. Mckesson logged 12 percent of the vote. Pugh, Dixon, Mckesson and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake are African-Americans. Pugh, who co-chaired a legislative working group on law enforcement reform, has called for greater accountability for Baltimore police and the use of mobile units to help residents find jobs.  Voters said they hoped the election would bring positive change to the port city. At 7.1 percent, Baltimores jobless rate is above the national average, and the city has been hit by a surge in murders. I think its a very important election. Its time for change, retiree Diane McCants, 67, said at a polling place in West Baltimore. Tyrone Forney, a 52-year-old voter in northeast Baltimore, said the mayors race was critical. We need new faces, new ideas, he said. The onetime steelmaking city exploded into world headlines a year ago after Gray, 25, died from a broken neck suffered in police custody. His death sparked protests and a day of rioting. Six police officers - three black and three white - have been charged in Grays death. Rawlings-Blake, the mayor since 2010, came under fire for her handling of the crisis. She said in September that she would not seek re-election. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2016 ",1
Judge rejects challenge to Arizona presidential nominating election,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - A judge on Tuesday tossed out a legal challenge to a problem-plagued presidential preference election in Arizona, ruling that the woes at the polls were not due to fraud. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge David Gass said there were insufficient grounds for granting the request to void the results of the March 22 nominating election, which was marked by long lines and controversy.  In a ruling from the bench, Gass said there were glitches and possible missteps by election officials but that the results would not have changed. Elections are human endeavors. They are never, ever perfect, Gass said. Glitches are always something that we need to wary of and we need to work hard, and we need to fix them.... But they dont rise to the level of fraud. Gass issued his verbal decision following a two-day hearing on the lawsuit brought by Tucson resident John Brakey, who alleged that election officials committed misconduct. The lawsuit argued officials improperly handled voter registration requests and permitted illegal votes to be cast in the election. He also said erroneous ballots were counted and the number of polling locations were inadequate. He sought a repeat of the election, easily won by Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Brakeys attorney Michael Kielsky told Reuters on Tuesday night that he was disappointed in the ruling, but that it likely will not be appealed. The election brought widespread criticism to Arizona, which saw frustrated voters wait in line for as long as five hours to cast their ballots at a drastically reduced number of polls.  In a cost-cutting move, county election officials slashed the polling locations to 60, compared with 200 in the election in 2012.  Officials immediately took the blame for the mistake, saying the decision was based on past voter turnout and an increase in mail-in votes. The election also faces a separate federal court challenge by the state and national Democratic parties, along with the Clinton and Sanders campaigns. Justice department officials additionally have launched a probe into the handling of the election. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1
House passes bill seeking to counter extremists' recruiting pitches,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved a measure that would for the first time require the Homeland Security department to use testimonials from former extremists to counter recruiting messages from militant groups. Terrorists are radicalizing our citizens online and across borders, which is why we need this legislation, said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul. The measure was approved 322 to 79. International allies of the United States such as Britain have long used testimony by disillusioned former extremists to discourage young people from joining militant groups. Despite support for the technique from U.S. officials including President Barack Obama, the United States has not used it. Lawmakers clashed because the proposal suggests using testimonials to counter foreign terrorist organizations but does not mention domestic extremists.  Concern about domestic extremism has grown more intense since the December shootings by an Islamic State-inspired couple in San Bernardino, California, and the occupation of a wildlife refuge in Oregon by domestic anti-government militants earlier this year.  Republican supporters of the measure emphasized that the bill would not prevent using testimonials from former extremists to combat domestic recruitment.  Congressional aides said on Monday they expect partner legislation to be introduced this week in the Senate. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment, but said in a March memo that such a program could place a significant burden on already limited resources.  The department also said in the memo that it already has the authority to use testimonials from former extremists, but that it wants to avoid giving the impression that its current community outreach efforts might be used to gather them.

Jury deadlocks over tax-evasion charges against Washington state auditor,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - A jury did not convict Washington states auditor on money-laundering and tax-evasion charges on Tuesday in a blow to federal prosecutors who argued that the Democrat had spun a web of lies to avoid paying taxes and defraud thousands of homeowners. The jury in Tacoma also acquitted Troy Kelley, 51, of a single charge of making a false statement to IRS agents in April 2013 after about four days of deliberation following more than five weeks of trial.  This is the first step toward vindication for him, Angelo Calfo, a defense attorney for Kelley, said by telephone.  The criminal allegations against Kelley focus on his former document-tracking business for title companies during real estate sales and refinancing transactions in which he is accused of pocketing roughly $3 million in fees that should have been returned to borrowers from at least 2003 to 2008. A grand jury indicted Kelley, a Democrat elected in 2012, a year ago for his alleged scheme to keep stolen money and hide it from both the Internal Revenue Service and those due a refund for home purchases or mortgage refinancings.  Among the charges Kelley faced was one count of possession and concealment of stolen property related to processing fees that should have been returned to borrowers.  He also faced charges of failing to pay federal taxes, obstructing related IRS collections, money laundering, attempted obstruction of a civil lawsuit, and filing false income tax returns. It was not immediately clear what would happen with the remaining charges, Calfo said. Federal prosecutors could seek to re-try the case, or the judge could grant Kelleys motion to dismiss the charges, he said. After a grand jury indicted Kelley last year, U.S. Attorney Annette Hayes said that he spun a web of lies in an effort to avoid paying his taxes and keep more than a million dollars that he knew did not belong to him, but instead should have been returned to thousands of homeowners across this state. Hayes said in a statement on Tuesday that her office will thoroughly review the counts that the jury deadlocked on before making a decision about our next steps in this case. A judge blocked a recall effort as Kelley fought the charges and he took a leave of absence to prepare his defense. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat, has called for Kelleys resignation. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2016 ",1
Kansas governor withdraws from Syrian refugee program,"(Reuters) - Kansas is withdrawing from plans to resettle Syrian refugees in the state after the federal government failed to provide security information on them, Republican Governor Sam Brownback said on Tuesday. Brownback said in a statement that he repeatedly asked the administration of President Barack Obama for documentation on the screening of refugees who would be relocated from Syria to Kansas. Because the federal government has failed to provide adequate assurances regarding refugees it is settling in Kansas, we have no option but to end our cooperation with and participation in the federal refugee resettlement program, Brownback said. Kansas has received a trickle of Syrian refugees. A family of three and two men have been resettled there in the past 15 months, a spokeswoman for Brownback said by email. Obama pledged last year that the United States would take in 10,000 people fleeing war-torn Syria, under pressure from European leaders who have been inundated with refugees. But the promise came under fire from Republicans concerned that violent militants could come into the United States posing as refugees. Despite opposition from some states, the United States remains committed to admitting the promised number of Syrian refugees in the current fiscal year, which ends in September, said a State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said state governments can consult on the resettlement of refugees, but the program is administered by the federal government. Decisions regarding the admissibility of refugees to the United States are made by the Department of Homeland Security after stringent security checks, the official said, noting that some refugee records are confidential. Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the federal Health and Human Services Department, said that refugee resettlement will continue in Kansas, coordinated by non-profit organizations.  More than 30 governors attempted to block refugees from their states, but courts and attorneys general have said that it is up to the federal government to screen refugees and settle them. U.S. officials told a congressional panel in February that the country has tightened vetting of immigrants and refugees after attacks in California and Paris, and put on hold hundreds of applications from Syrian refugees. More than four million Syrians have fled their war-torn country, according to the United Nations, which calls it the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation. Almost 2 million Syrian refugees are in Turkey and hundreds of thousands live in camps in Jordan, while others have flooded Greece, according to the U.N. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2016 ",1
Rights groups appeal ruling upholding North Carolina voter ID law,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Civil rights groups and churches opposed to sweeping changes to North Carolinas election rules said on Tuesday they would ask an appeals court for a reversal after a federal judge upheld provisions they argue will suppress minority votes at the polls in November. The ruling late on Monday was highly anticipated in a presidential election year in a state that had close results for the White House in 2008 and 2012, and it received praise from the voting laws Republican backers. U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder in Winston-Salem said the state could require voters to show approved photo identification at the polls, one of a number of provisions in the law that challengers have said targets groups of people who typically support Democratic candidates. Schroeder, who was appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush, also upheld provisions that eliminated a week of early voting, ended same-day registration and banned provisional ballots cast outside the correct precinct from being counted. Lawyers for groups including churches, the North Carolina chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. They said they were confident they would prevail.  If this decision remained in effect, the impact on the November election could be devastating, said Penda Hair of the Advancement Project civil rights organization, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.  The U.S. Justice Department, which also challenged the North Carolina law, said it was evaluating its options for moving forward. Were disappointed in the ruling, the department said in a statement. The Republican chairmen of the North Carolina legislatures elections oversight committee criticized the legal challenges as an abuse of the court system. We are glad the court recognized the law provides all voters an equal opportunity to vote, Representative David Lewis and Senator Bob Rucho said in a statement. Backers of the law said the voter ID provision would guard against fraud, though the plaintiffs in the case said there was little evidence of such fraud at the polls.   Schroeder found the Republican-controlled legislature did not act with discriminatory intent when it overhauled the states voting rules in 2013. The revisions were made soon after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina and other states with a history of discrimination no longer needed federal approval for voting law changes affecting minorities. The judge also said the plaintiffs had not established that African Americans or Hispanics had less opportunity to participate in the political process than other people as a result of the law.

"NYC mayor presents $82.2 billion budget, overhauls hospitals","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Citys Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $82.2 billion budget plan for the 2017 fiscal year on Tuesday, and promised an overhaul of the citys ailing public hospitals that treat large numbers of undocumented patients. De Blasio, who hails from progressive circles of the Democratic Party, took office in 2014 after winning a landslide victory on a platform to reduce inequalities in the city. At its core, our budget is our roadmap for lifting up communities, de Blasio said. The strategic investments we have put to work in every neighborhood, coupled with disciplined fiscal management, are producing real results for New Yorkers. De Blasio said the citys public hospital system, recently rebranded as Health & Hospitals, is facing spiraling costs due to undocumented patients and would see a $1.8 billion deficit by 2020 if the city took no action. The executive budget dedicates $2 billion to overhauling the $7.5 billion system, which treats around 1.4 million people per year. About a third of its patients are undocumented immigrants and cost the system over $2 billion each year, the mayor said. Health & Hospitals core revenue from treating poorer patients on federal and state support is under pressure as more private hospitals compete for these patients. That has left the system with a larger share of undocumented patients.     The executive budget plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 closely tracks a preliminary budget estimate of $82.1 billion the mayor presented in January. The total budget represents a small increase over the previous years $81.7 billion spending plan. The executive budget increases the citys reserves by $250 million, bringing its retiree health benefits trust fund to $3.7 billion. General reserves amount to $1 billion and $500 million is allocated to the citys capital stabilization reserve. Budget officials said reserves were the highest in the citys history.

"U.S. military can withstand the sage grouse, lawmakers say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Efforts to protect the greater sage grouse, a bird found in the western United States, do not pose a threat to the U.S. military, two senior Democratic House of Representatives lawmakers said on Tuesday. Debate over the bird was intense a year ago when the House Armed Services Committee was finalizing its version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the $600 billion  annual bill setting out U.S. defense policy. Arguing that protecting the sage grouse would put large swaths of the western United States off limits for military training, House Republicans included a ban on making the bird an endangered species in the House version of the 2016 NDAA. The measure was stripped out as the bill was considered by the Senate and not in the legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama. But it is again in the House version of the 2017 NDAA, which the House armed services panel will debate on Wednesday. Representatives Adam Smith, the top Armed Services Democrat, and Raul Grijalva, his counterpart on the Natural Resources Committee, released letters from Department of Defense officials saying that land use plans intended to protect the bird will not affect military training, operations or readiness to any significant degree. These letters put to bed once and for all the silly speculation that a few birds could hamstring the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, Grijalva said in a statement.

U.S. justices mull propriety of recalling discharged jury to duty,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday wrestled with the question of under what circumstances judges can recall jurors to duty after they have rendered a verdict, in a case involving a man seeking damages after suffering injuries in a Montana car accident. The justices, during an hour of arguments, indicated that a gap of just a few minutes in which there is no opportunity for jurors to be exposed to any information that could prejudice their views of the case may be permissible. That would mean North Dakota man Rocky Dietz, who sued a man named Hillary Bouldin for negligence after the 2009 accident in the city of Bozeman, would lose his bid for a new trial. Bouldin ran a red light and his vehicle hit the passenger side of Dietzs vehicle. Bouldin admitted he was responsible for the collision. The jury initially awarded Dietz nothing. But the judge recalled the jurors within minutes after they had been discharged from duty, reminding them that Bouldins lawyers had earlier stipulated Dietz was due at least $10,000 to cover medical expenses already incurred. The jury subsequently awarded $15,000 to Dietz. Dietzs lawyers objected to the judges action to recall the jury, contending that the fact that the jurors initially had awarded him no money indicated they were not fair and impartial toward him. The justices sought clarity on the outer boundaries of what could be permissible in recalling a jury, such as the amount of time the jury was discharged or whether jurors had a chance to leave the courthouse before being recalled. Questions from justices including Chief Justice John Roberts indicated their greatest concern was to ensure jurors would not be exposed to prejudicial information after being discharged.  Why doesnt it make sense to say, well, if theyre right out in the hall ... bring them back in and ask, just as the judge did here, Have you talked to anybody about the case? Roberts asked. Justice Stephen Breyer said if there are no signs of prejudice, it would be more efficient to recall the jurors rather than conduct a new trial with a different jury.  Now, if it saves a lot of money, and thats the only difference, why dont we say the efficiency argument is what counts? Breyer asked. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a former trial judge, noted that immediately after some trials juries can be exposed to prejudicial remarks, including expressions of emotion from family members and comments from court staff. A ruling is due by the end of June. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2016 ",1
U.S. top court backs New Jersey cop's political retaliation claim,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that a former police detective can sue a New Jersey city claiming he was demoted as punishment after getting a campaign sign for his bedridden mother supporting the mayors rival in a 2006 local election. The court, in its 6-2 ruling, found that Jeffrey Heffernan, a now former member of Patersons police force, was not in fact exercising his rights to freedom of association under the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment because he picked up the sign for his mother and not himself. But the justices decided he could sue the city for violating those rights because the boss who demoted him believed, albeit mistakenly, that Heffernan supported the mayors opponent. We conclude that ... the governments reason for demoting Heffernan is what counts here, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court. When an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in political activity that the First Amendment protects, the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action ... even if, as here, the employer makes a factual mistake about the employees behavior. The high court reversed a 2015 ruling by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissing Heffernans lawsuit on the grounds that a First Amendment retaliation claim cannot be based on an employers perception of a workers actions. The day before Heffernan was demoted, an aide to Jose Torres, Patersons mayor at the time who was running for re-election, saw Heffernan getting a large campaign sign backing another mayoral candidate. Heffernan said he got the sign while off-duty as a favor for his mother after her previous sign had been stolen from her front yard, and that the sign did not reflect his personal preference in the mayoral election. The next day, the police department demoted him from detective and transferred him to the traffic divisions walking squad, a move he saw as political retaliation. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the dissenting opinion, arguing that Heffernan should not be able to sue regardless of whether his demotion was misguided or wrong because he had not been exercising his constitutional rights.

House Democrats question if Valeant is withholding records,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on a powerful U.S. congressional panel are questioning whether Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals may be wrongfully withholding documents in connection with its ongoing probe into sky-rocketing drug prices, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The memo, which was sent to Democratic members of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from the staff of its top Democrat Elijah Cummings, reveals that Valeant previously withheld readily available analyst reports prepared by banks such as Goldman Sachs, saying they were protected by attorney-client privilege. The memo says it also raises questions about other documents that are still being withheld, saying some of these were not drafted by attorneys and do not include communications with attorneys. A spokeswoman for Valeant denied that the company has done anything wrong, saying it has already provided more than 78,000 pages of documents and will continue cooperating. We continue to discuss with the committee the issue of privileged documents, but any suggestion that we have withheld documents inappropriately is incorrect, Laurie Little said in a statement. The April 26 memo comes just one day before three of Valeants top executives are slated to appear before a different U.S. Senate panel that is also investigating high drug prices. The companys outgoing CEO Michael Pearson will be testifying before the Senate Special Committee on Aging late Wednesday afternoon, along with activist investor William Ackman, a majority shareholder and board member, and Howard Schiller, a director and former chief financial officer. Their appearance before Congress comes at an awkward and difficult time for the company, which is under fire from its shareholders and facing a number of ongoing government investigations into drug pricing and distribution, accounting and disclosures, and antitrust matters. Last month, the company announced that Pearson would be stepping down and that Ackman would be joining its board, after a board committee probe into the companys dealings with specialty pharmacy Philidor RX Services uncovered accounting problems dating back to December 2014. The company said it would restate its earnings and delay filing its annual report, opening the door to a possible default on its $30 billion debt. The company has blamed some of the accounting problems on Schiller, and asked him to step down from his board seat. Schiller has refused to do so, and has denied any wrongdoing through his attorney. Valeant plans to file its annual report on April 29, two days after the hearing. Wednesdays hearing will be primarily focused on Valeants drastic price increases for two of its heart drugs. The committee previously planned to vote to hold Pearson in contempt for failing to be deposed, but backed down after he agreed to be interviewed April 18. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2016 ",1
U.S. says Cubans' favorable immigration status to stay in place,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. State Department official said on Tuesday that Washington has no plans to change a Cold War-era law granting special immigration benefits to Cubans, despite President Barack Obamas moves toward normalized relations with the island country. There continues to be a large migration flow out of Cuba. It reflects the difficult economic and human rights conditions in the country, Francisco Palmieri, principal deputy assistant secretary in States Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, told a Senate subcommittee hearing. We have no plans to change the Cuban Adjustment Act at this time, Palmieri said. The Cuban Adjustment Act provides Cubans with benefits granted to migrants from no other country. Once they enter the United States and ask for asylum, virtually all are granted the right to stay, can apply for work permits and, later, green cards, which convey lawful permanent residency. Some U.S. lawmakers have been demanding a fresh look at Cuban immigration policy since the surprise December 2014 announcement from Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro that the two countries would move toward ending decades of estrangement. They argue that most of the Cubans coming to the United States are coming for economic reasons and are not refugees from its Communist government. Fear of an end to their benefits has fueled a surge in departures from Cuba, many via third countries, which has left large groups of Cubans stranded in Central America.  Earlier this year, thousands were airlifted from Panama and Costa Rica to northern Mexico, where they crossed the border into the United States. Senator Marco Rubio, the subcommittee chairman, asked Palmieri about reports that Panama might be planning to send more Cuban migrants north. We have not told them not to do their airlift, Palmieri said. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2016 ",1
House Republican leader sees Puerto Rico bill before July,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday he is hopeful lawmakers can move legislation on Puerto Rico out of the House before the U.S. territory must make a $1.55 billion debt payment in July. But lawmakers will not be able to address the islands fiscal crisis before May 1, when Puerto Rico is due to make a smaller $422 million payment that Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla says it cannot meet, said the California Republican, who is second only to Speaker Paul Ryan in the legislative chamber. Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population, all of which threaten to cause its economy to collapse. The May date, I dont see how we can get it done, McCarthy told reporters.  Congressional efforts to craft legislation to address the crisis have hit a series of roadblocks that McCarthy said he believes lawmakers could surmount before July 1, when Puerto Rico is scheduled to make the $1.55 billion debt payment.          Im hopeful that wed have it out of the House by then, the Republican leader said.  McCarthy said the House has not produced legislation until now because lawmakers are waiting for the U.S. Treasury Department to complete negotiations with island authorities. Democrats reject the claim, however, saying Republicans are unable to move forward because of internal divisions encouraged by outside groups that have sought to characterize the legislative effort as a taxpayer bailout despite repeated denials from the House Republican leadership. Its our No. 1 principle that were going to protect the taxpayers and will not do a bailout, McCarthy said on Tuesday.   As soon as we can get Treasury to get done with what theyre working on, I think that will put us on a faster path, he added. ",politicsNews,"April 26, 2016 ",1
Battle over N.C. transgender law intensifies as lawmakers reconvene,"RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Thousands of people flocked to North Carolinas capital on Monday to show both support and disdain for a law that has thrust the state into the international spotlight over its restrictions on transgender bathroom access and gay rights. Lawmakers returned to Raleigh to begin a short session  designed to address the state budget. But controversy over the new law, which has drawn reaction from U.S. presidential candidates, U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron among others, is expected to dominate. The measure puts the state at the center of a debate over equality, privacy and religious freedom as states propose legislation seen as discriminatory against gay and transgender people in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court last year ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. North Carolina became the first U.S. state to require transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity.  Fifty-four people were arrested at the Legislative Building as they protested against the law on Monday, General Assembly police Officer Scott Cameron said. Our state is a state of crisis, Chris Sgro, executive director of the Equality North Carolina advocacy group, said earlier in the day before activists delivered petitions to Republican Governor Pat McCrorys office demanding the laws repeal. A group of Democratic representatives filed a bill seeking a repeal. But leading Republican lawmakers in the state have shown little willingness to back down, and they were greeted at a rally on Monday by thousands of people who came on church buses and held signs thanking them for the measure. Business leaders, entertainers and politicians including Obama and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump have come out against the law. Opponents contend it demonizes transgender people and limits government protections against discrimination for gays and lesbians.  Supporters including social conservatives and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz say it is needed to protect women and children from sexual predators in bathrooms. On Monday, singers Demi Lovato and Nick Jonas joined a growing list of entertainers who have canceled shows in the state. Lovato wrote on Twitter that she and Jonas were protesting this hateful law. As part of the backlash, companies and associations have relocated conventions and halted job-creating investment projects initially slated for North Carolina.  Republican State Representative Paul Stam criticized companies, including PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O), that have pulled jobs out of North Carolina over the measure. They have offices in countries where homosexuals are executed, he said. The hypocrisy of those who oppose this bill is amazing. ",politicsNews,"April 25, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: U.S. agencies split over fingerprinting parents of child immigrants,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration enforcement officers are proposing that fingerprints be taken from all people claiming custody of children who have entered the United States illegally without an adult relative, a measure that opponents said could keep thousands of families apart. As a new wave of unaccompanied Central American children pours across the U.S.-Mexico border, the proposal underscores the sometimes conflicting goals of federal agencies in dealing with undocumented immigrants, a volatile issue on the presidential campaign trail. Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is ultimately responsible for finding housing for migrant children, told Reuters they have no plans to change fingerprinting policy. They said the proposal  made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in an internal memo seen by Reuters  would delay family reunions and infringe upon the parent-child relationship. One of our goals is to place children with an appropriate sponsor as promptly as we can safely do so. And so any delay for placing the child with their parent is time that were keeping a parent and child separated, said Bobbie Gregg, deputy director for childrens services at HHSs office of refugee resettlement. The memo by ICE officials, drafted in response to a February Senate hearing, proposes expanding fingerprinting, now limited to non-parents, to include parents. ICE says that would allow fingerprints to be checked against an FBI database of criminals to verify the identities of people who say they are parents while ensuring that children do not go to parents who have criminal histories. The proposal is preliminary and could change. It was unclear whether it would ultimately win the backing of the White House. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  which oversees ICE  and the Justice Department advise HHS on its practices and have a role in enforcing overall immigration policy. The White House declined to comment on the proposal. Asked about the documents that describe the fingerprinting proposal, a Homeland Security spokeswoman said the agency does not discuss internal deliberations. Neither ICE nor HHS would comment on whether they have had discussions on the proposal. From January 2014 to April 2015, more than 31,000 parents claimed children who entered the United States from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, according to a study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog unit. They made up 60 percent of those who claimed children, with most of the rest claimed by other relatives. Only 161 non-relative sponsors claimed children. U.S. authorities are required to find housing for illegal immigrant minors while they await a trial to determine whether they will be deported, a process that can take years. Under current law, people who appear at child migrant holding facilities saying they are parents must show the childs birth certificate to prove the relationship. If that is not available, the parent and child must undergo a DNA test. Immigration advocates say the ICE proposal would discourage parents from sending for their children and claiming them, fearing that ICE would use fingerprinting to trace undocumented immigrants for possible deportation. It could keep parents away from their children if they think it is going to land them in a lock-up somewhere, said David Leopold, a Cleveland lawyer who formerly headed the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The ICE officials also said in the memo that the agency supports expanding immigration-status checks to all sponsors, including parents. ICE acknowledged that conducting immigration checks on parents claiming children could reduce the likelihood that sponsors would come forward to take custody of children. Illegal entry into the United States by unaccompanied minors has surged in recent years. Most are Central American children who make the dangerous journey across Mexico and the U.S. border without their parents, fleeing poverty and violence. In the six months through March 2016, almost 28,000 unaccompanied children were apprehended crossing into the United States, close to the record-high number hit in the same period in 2014. (Graphic on unaccompanied minor crossings and relationships to sponsors: tmsnrt.rs/1NmGQQI) An investigation by the Associated Press in January found that HHS had placed some migrant children in homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced into labor for no pay. None of the known abusers had claimed to be parents. A Senate panel in February asked authorities to improve screening of adults claiming custody of child migrants.  The document from ICE is a draft of answers to questions Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley submitted for the record following the hearing. After the AP investigation, HHS said it began doing 30-day follow-up checks on households to which it had assigned a child, while also giving an emergency hotline phone number to all children before they are discharged from HHS custody But ICEs response to Grassley said HHS should go a step further, noting that many state and local child protective service agencies routinely fingerprint parents who reclaim children after periods of separation.

Federal judge upholds voter ID law in North Carolina,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A federal judge upheld a North Carolina law on Monday that requires voters to show certain forms of photo identification at the polls, in a key victory for Republicans in a presidential election year who say the law is needed to prevent fraud. The case tested a central piece of broad voting restrictions passed after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that North Carolina and other states with a history of discrimination no longer needed federal approval for voting law changes affecting minorities. In siding with Republican Governor Pat McCrory and other state officials in dismissing challenges to the law, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder in Winston-Salem wrote in a 485-page ruling that North Carolina has provided legitimate state interests for its voter-ID requirement and electoral system.  In sum, plaintiffs have failed to show that any North Carolinian who wishes to vote faces anything other than the usual burdens of voting, Schroeder wrote. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and individual voters backed by the U.S. Justice Department had argued that the law disproportionately burdened African-Americans and Hispanics, who are more likely than whites to lack the acceptable forms of identification. Democrats argue voter ID laws passed by Republican-led state legislatures target voters who typically support the Democratic party. Proponents of the measures say they are intended to prevent voter fraud. The trial in Winston-Salem was one of a number of closely watched voting rights battles across the country playing out as Democrats and Republicans fight for the White House in November. Governor McCrory, locked in a tough race for re-election this year, said in a statement: This ruling further affirms that requiring a photo ID in order to vote is not only common-sense, its constitutional. The North Carolina law requires voters to show approved credentials such as a drivers license or passport before casting a ballot. Voters who cite a reasonable impediment to obtaining such identification are allowed to cast a provisional ballot.  Schroeder also upheld provisions that eliminated a week of early voting, same-day registration, and prohibited the counting of out-of-precinct ballots. Schroeder said that the plaintiffs did not establish that blacks or Hispanics had less opportunity than others to participate in the electoral process, and pointed out that North Carolina joins only South Carolina in extending voters the reasonable impediment accommodation. Opponents of the law said they would pursue an appeal.  William Barber, president of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, called the restrictive provisions in the law an affront to democracy and vowed to continue the fight against regressive and discriminatory voter suppression tactics.

"On Election Eve for five states, Trump rips Cruz and Kasich","WEST CHESTER, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump, on the eve of primary elections in five states that he is expected to sweep, launched blistering attacks on Monday on rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich for their 11th-hour joint effort aimed at denying him the partys presidential nomination. The Cruz-Kasich agreement, which some stop-Trump Republican strategists say should have been undertaken weeks ago, was forged to try and keep Trump from securing the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination outright and force Republicans to consider the two rivals at the partys national convention in Cleveland in July. Kasich, the Ohio governor, and Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, agreed not to compete against each other in three upcoming nominating contests that could prove to be pivotal: Indiana, Oregon and New Mexico. Trump, speaking at Pennsylvanias West Chester University, near Philadelphia, dismissed the deal as a sign of desperation and predicted he still would win the nomination on the conventions first ballot. With dramatic flair, he compared his plight to a champion boxer whom Trump said he once warned not to go into unfriendly territory because the judges could rule against him. The boxer, Trump said, replied: If I knock him out theres not a damn thing the judges can do. Trump is expected to win all five of Tuesdays nominating contests in the northeastern states of Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, which have a total of 172 delegates at stake. Trump is already ahead in the delegate race with 845, followed by Cruz with 559 and Kasich with 147, according to the Associated Press. After Tuesday, Indiana, which votes on May 3, will be the next big battleground, with 57 delegates up for grabs. The Kasich-Cruz deal already showed signs of bending on Monday, with Kasich telling voters in Philadelphia that people who want to vote for him in Indiana should still do so. Ive never told them not to vote for me, they ought to vote for me. But Im not over there campaigning and spending resources, he said. Cruz took steps to maintain he is a serious contender for the nomination with his campaign team announcing he has developed a short list of vice presidential running mates. Traditionally, candidates wait until they have secured the nomination to select a running mate. One person being vetted for the No. 2 position is former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, an aide to Fiorina said. Fiorina, a businesswoman, endorsed Cruz when she dropped out of the race. Showing no sign of trying to unify Republicans around him with a more serious demeanor, Trump ripped Kasich for refusing to get out of the race and even criticized his eating habits. This is just a guy whos a stubborn guy, who eats like a slob and shouldnt have press conferences while hes stuffing stuff down his throat, Trump said. On Cruz, Trump said he has done a lousy job in the Senate and has shown that he cannot build consensus. Trump agreed to an May 17 interview with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whose questioning of him at a debate last August angered Trump and led him to criticize her for months. Cruz said the deal with Kasich was aimed at preventing a Trump nomination that he argues would assure victory for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The Cruz-Kasich agreement is unique in modern presidential politics and signaled panic after Trumps sweeping victory in last weeks New York primary, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginias Center for Politics. They know hes going to have a great night tomorrow, Sabato said. If things are not shaken up, Trumps going to be the nominee. They have to do something big to shake things up. Theyre hoping that this is it. But Cruz said Trump was the desperate one because he knows he has a difficult path to win the partys nomination. I dont doubt that Donald Trump is going to scream and yell and curse and insult and probably cry and whine some as well, Cruz said in Indiana. That has been Donalds pattern. Trump has dominated the nominating contests so far but still faces a tough path to earn the delegates needed to lock up the nomination before the convention. If no candidate has enough delegate support on the first vote at the national convention, many delegates can switch to another candidate on subsequent ballots. ",politicsNews,"April 25, 2016 ",1
Sexual abuse accuser sues ex-House Speaker Hastert for $1.8 million   ,"(Reuters) - A man who accused former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert of sexual abuse filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming the once powerful conservative politician owes him $1.8 million as a part of an agreement between them to compensate him for decades of pain and suffering. The plaintiff, identified as James Doe, filed the lawsuit in Kendall County Circuit Court in northeastern Illinois, claiming Hastert owes him the unpaid portion of a $3.5 million deal they verbally agreed to in 2008. Doe said he was 14 when he was molested by Hastert, a trusted family friend, high school teacher and beloved coach of the state champion wrestling team in the town of Yorkville, Illinois. Hastert, 74, pleaded guilty in October to a federal charge in Chicago federal court of structuring for evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in small increments. He was taking out the funds to make payments to a man identified in court documents by federal prosecutors as Individual A. Hastert is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday for the financial crime, and faces up to five years in prison although prosecutors have recommended a maximum of six months. Another Hastert accuser known as Individual D, and the sister of another accuser, who is deceased, are expected to testify at the sentencing hearing. Hasterts attorney, Thomas Green, had no comment on the lawsuit, a spokeswoman said in an email. Court documents in Hasterts trial revealed that he was accused of abusing five boys in the 1960s and 1970s, decades before he became one of the countrys most powerful politicians. Does lawsuit claims Hastert sexually molested and abused him in a motel room while they were on a trip to a wrestling camp. For many years to follow, Plaintiff (Doe) suffered severe panic attacks which lead to periods of unemployment, career changes, bouts of depression, hospitalization, and psychiatric long-term treatment, the lawsuit said. Hastert admitted in his plea deal that he paid $1.7 million in cash, from June 2010 to December 2014, to someone he had known for decades to compensate for past misconduct. Doe said in his lawsuit that he confronted Hastert in 2008 after learning that Hastert had sexually abused another person. Doe suggested $3.5 million when Hastert asked him how much would compensate him. Hastert agreed to pay the amount and asked for Doe to keep the agreement quiet, the lawsuit said.

Chief justice calls U.S. patent challenge process bizarre,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday described as bizarre the legal process used by companies to challenge competitors patents as the Supreme Court heard a case involving a vehicle speedometer that alerts drivers if they are driving too quickly. The eight justices heard an appeal filed by Cuozzo Speed Technologies LLC, whose speedometer patent was invalidated in a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review board procedure after being challenged by GPS device maker Garmin Ltd in 2012. The issue before the justices during a one-hour argument in the case was whether the U.S. government has made it too easy for companies to pursue challenges to the patents of other companies.  New Jersey-based Cuozzo challenged the boards action in federal court, and an appeals court last year upheld the agencys action. Cuozzo then asked the Supreme Court to reverse the appellate decision. Garmin is no longer involved in the case. Roberts was the most outspoken critic among the eight justices of the current system in which companies can adopt a dual-track strategy by challenging patents simultaneously in federal court and through the agency review board. Roberts described the system as a bizarre way to ... decide a legal question and a very extraordinary animal in legal culture to have two different proceedings addressing the same question. Justice Stephen Breyer appeared more sympathetic to the patent office. He said the 2011 law that set up the review board procedure may have intended to counter criticism that the patent office issues too many patents that shouldnt have been issued in the first place. So-called patent trolls, entities that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products, have benefited from that generosity. Breyer indicated that the patent office views the law as allowing a second bite at the question of whether a patent should have been issued. Breyer called it a partial-Groundhog Day statute, referring to the 1993 film Groundhog Day in which Bill Murrays character repeatedly re-lives the same day. Companies that are frequent targets of patent suits, including Apple Inc and Google Inc, have turned to the patent office procedure, known as inter partes review (IPR), to try to fight off patent challenges. Google and Apple joined court papers backing the patent office. Cuozzo told the justices that in nearly 85 percent of cases some or all of the patents challenged were canceled. A ruling is due by the end of June. ",politicsNews,"April 25, 2016 ",1
Sentencing reform could help U.S. economy: White House panel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Overcrowded prisons strain state budgets, take people out of the work force and pull families apart more than they reduce crime or boost the U.S. economy, said an Obama administration study discussed on Monday by experts at the White House. The study, undertaken as part of President Barack Obamas efforts to reform the criminal justice system before he leaves office, was conducted by the White House Council of Economic Advisers and focused on the costs of sentencing and incarceration policies. Despite falling crime rates, U.S. prison populations have soared in recent decades as a result of harsher federal and state-level sentencing policies, such as three strikes rules under which offenders much be imprisoned on their third conviction.  Both conservative and liberal panelists discussing the report on Monday agreed that lighter sentences for non-violent offenders and lower barriers to job opportunities after prison would address the economic problems described in the report. This isnt really about the money. This is about the lives that were throwing away, said Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank that co-hosted the event with the liberal Brennan Center for Justice of New York University. Obamas push for criminal justice reform has support from both ends of the political spectrum, with bipartisan legislation pending in Congress that would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for some low-level federal drug crimes. Those proposed reforms are backed by a Brennan Center-affiliated coalition of local law enforcement officers around the country, who agree that the default response to non-violent crimes should not be prison time, said the centers director of justice programs, Inimai Chettiar.  Panelists said the study showed that some existing criminal justice policies are counter-productive. In the arena, far too little of what we do actually makes sense or is backed by specific evidence, said Peter Orszag, who led the Congressional Budget Office in 2007 and 2008. There are 2.2 million Americans behind bars, a prison rate that is more than four times the world average. The Justice Department said on Monday it will expand federal programs that ensure ex-prisoners have the skills needed to find work, and that they also have access to housing, education and financial credit after release.  Every federal inmate should get an individualized re-entry plan tailored to his or her risk of recidivism and ... needs, said a Justice Department press release.  U.S. Attorneys and the Bureau of Prisons are hosting more than 570 events nationwide this week on re-entry initiatives. ",politicsNews,"April 25, 2016 ",1
Boston mayor says not subject of federal probe into labor unions,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, a former labor leader, said on Monday that federal agents had not contacted him in connection with what local media has described as a wide-ranging investigation into whether the citys building unions used strong-arm tactics.

"Republicans Cruz, Kasich reach 'stop-Trump' deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican White House rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced a deal on Sunday to stay out of each others way in some upcoming state primaries in hopes of blocking front-runner Donald Trump from winning the partys presidential nomination. Cruzs campaign said in a statement he would focus on the Indiana and give Kasich a clearer shot in Oregon and New Mexico, states where the Ohio governor expects to do well. Kasich, in turn, agreed to shift resources west and away from Indiana. The Indiana primary is on May 3, Oregons is May 17 and New Mexicos June 7. Trump has won the most state nominating contests, but he has a tough path to earn the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. The Cruz and Kasich campaigns believe their agreement to cede states where the other candidate appears strong could help limit Trumps ability to win more delegates. Some Republican strategists who oppose Trump have been calling for such a deal for weeks. The question for Cruz and Kasich is whether their agreement is too late. If no candidate has enough support by the first vote at the Republican National Convention in July, many delegates will be allowed to switch sides on subsequent ballots.  Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said Trump, who has offended women, Hispanics and other groups with controversial statements, would lose a general election contest against the eventual Democratic nominee in the Nov. 8 election. Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland, where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee, Kasich chief strategist John Weaver said in a statement. Late Sunday, Trump tweeted his reaction to the deal: Wow, just announced that Lyin Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! Trump has frequently complained that the Republican Partys nominating process is rigged against him because establishment party members oppose him. Party officials argue that the delegate selection rules have been known for some time.  The stop-Trump group #NeverTrump welcomed news of the pact. Whether you support Ted Cruz or John Kasich, a second ballot at the Convention is imperative to stopping Donald Trump. Were happy to see the Kasich and Cruz campaigns strategically using their resources to deny Donald Trump delegates where they are in the strongest position to do so, said the groups senior adviser, Rory Cooper.

Billionaire green donor launches U.S. millennial voter drive,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyers super PAC launched a $25 million youth voter drive on Monday in seven political battleground states to help elect candidates that champion climate change policies in Novembers general election.  Steyers NextGen Climate super PAC, a political group that raises funds to boost candidates with strong environmental platforms, said the campaign aims to boost turnout of millennials, who have become one of the largest potential voter groups. In the lead-up to the November general election, NextGen will deploy hundreds of organizers across over 200 colleges to register young voters and facilitate on-campus voting. We are determined that they will be a difference maker, Steyer told reporters on a conference call. The group is targeting seven battleground states where Steyer said millennial voters could make up the difference in a tight race. Those states are Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Illinois and Colorado. Steyer has been the second largest individual political donor in 2016, having spent $13 million so far this year, according to OpenSecrets.org. NextGen said the number of registered millennials has nearly tripled since 2008 from 17.2 million to 50.3 million, making the demographic a key political force in 2016.  Climate change and clean energy is an area where there is widespread millennial interest.  NextGen cited a June 2015 poll that found that 73 percent of young voters want the United States to get 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. The group has not yet announced which candidates it will endorse in the presidential or congressional races but said it has challenged all candidates to say how they would achieve a goal of hitting a 50 percent clean energy target by 2030. He said the air and water impacts of fracking, a controversial drilling technique that has been responsible for a boom in U.S. oil and natural gas production over the past decade, shows the U.S. needs to make a faster transition away from fossil fuels. Steyer said NextGen will spend around $25 million on the months-long campaign and will launch several other initiatives later in the election cycle.  Steyers PAC in 2014 aimed to make climate change into a wedge issue in the 2014 midterm elections, spending over $70 million with mixed results.  But with millennial voters turning out in record numbers in the 2016 primaries, Steyer sees a formula for success. We need to make sure to carry on that momentum until November, he said.

Illinois governor signs higher education stopgap funding bill,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Monday signed into law a bill to send $600 million to cash-starved state universities and community colleges, calling the measure a first step toward compromise between Democrats and Republicans.  An impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has left Illinois without a budget 10 months into fiscal 2016. In bipartisan votes in the House and Senate on Friday, lawmakers approved $600 million, or 34 percent, of the $1.7 billion Democrats had earmarked for higher education spending for the whole fiscal year, which began July 1. Now is the time to build on this bipartisan momentum and focus on enacting a truly balanced budget for fiscal years 2016-2017 alongside meaningful reforms that create jobs and free up resources for education, social services and infrastructure, Rauner said in a statement. Illinois Comptroller Leslie Munger said on Friday that her office would immediately start processing payments for the universities, colleges and for college student grants funded by the legislation.

"Obama, Merkel push for trade deal as foreign crises weigh","HANOVER, Germany (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Sunday he would do whatever he could to advance a controversial trade deal with the European Union in his last eight months in office, but warned that time was running short. Obama has pushed to complete two trade agreements before his term ends on Jan. 20 - with Pacific nations and with the EU - but has run into a growing swell of populist concerns about the impact on jobs, consumer protections and the environment. Time is not on our side, he conceded to business leaders at the Hanover Messe, a massive industrial trade fair. If we dont complete negotiations this year, then upcoming political transitions in the United States and Europe would mean this agreement wont be finished for quite some time. Obama is in Germany to promote the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but the issue was overshadowed by discussions on the crises in Syria, Ukraine and Libya when the two leaders met. On Monday, they are set to hold talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on some of the same issues. But first, they had dinner in a 17th century palace with chief executives of some of the largest U.S. and German companies such as Microsoft, Dow, Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, BASF, Bayer and Siemens. Also at the dinner was Matthias Mller, CEO of Volkswagen, whose company has admitted to cheating diesel emissions tests in the United States, a scandal that involves 11 million vehicles worldwide. Obama normally does not sit through lengthy opening ceremonies. But in a sign of the political capital he is spending on trade - and his affection for Merkel - he took a front row seat for an unusual interpretative dance performance featuring robots, futuristic music and acrobatic break-dancing. The day before Obama arrived, thousands of protesters holding placards with slogans like Stop TTIP marched to express their opposition to the deal, and his motorcade whizzed past a few more as he drove through the north German city. Obama acknowledged his message about the benefits of trade has not broken though. The benefits oftentimes are diffuse, whereas a particular plant or business that feels its been hurt by outside competition feels it very acutely, he told reporters. Obama said he hoped the deal, which supporters say could boost economies on each side of the Atlantic by $100 billion, would be agreed this year. But final ratification will take more time. The Trans Pacific Partnership is first in the queue for the U.S. Congress, which is not clamoring to hold a final vote. Obama said that could change after the Democratic and Republican parties make their final selections of candidates this summer. When were in the heat of campaigns, people naturally are going to worry more about whats lost than whats gained with respect to trade agreements, he said. Germany is the last stop on a six-day foreign tour where Obama has sought to shore up U.S. alliances he views as important not only for the economy but also to defeat Islamic State militants and counter Russian intervention in Syria and Ukraine. Strong growth in Europe is particularly important given the array of pressing challenges - whether its security, defense, migration or refugees, Obama said. Obama came to Germany from London where he urged Britons to vote to stay in the European Union in a closely-watched June referendum or face being at the back of the queue as a non-EU member hoping for a new trade deal with the U.S. Earlier in the week, he met with Gulf leaders in Riyadh to try to allay fears that Washington had become less committed to their security, especially after the nuclear deal with Iran, the regional rival of Saudi Arabia. Obama said he was deeply concerned about a surge in violence in Syria, where government forces have stepped up bombing of rebel-held areas around the strategic city of Aleppo. Merkel urged the parties participating in troubled peace talks in Geneva to agree to humanitarian zones where fleeing Syrians could feel safe from bombardment. She and Obama made clear that they did not favor the creation of classic safe zones which would need to be protected by foreign forces. Both leaders expressed concerns about ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine and said sanctions imposed against Russia following its 2014 intervention there, could not be eased if the situation on the ground did not improve. Ties between Washington and Berlin reached a low point three years ago following revelations of widespread surveillance of German citizens, including the bugging of Merkels mobile phone, by the U.S. National Security Agency. But in recent years, the two Cold War allies have patched things up. Obama praised Merkel for her steady leadership and handling of Europes refugee crisis, saying her decision last year to welcome hundreds of thousands of migrants to Germany had put her on the right side of history. He joked that Merkel, who lacks his easy-going charm, had a really good sense of humor even if it wasnt always on public display, drawing chuckles from the 61-year-old chancellor. Merkel refused to be drawn when asked whether she was concerned that she might soon have to work with Donald Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, who has labeled her refugee policies insane. She said only that she was watching the American election campaign with interest. ",politicsNews,"April 23, 2016 ",1
"Driven up the wall by Trump, Mexico looks to recast image in U.S.","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - At first, Mexicos government did its best to ignore Donald Trump. Then it likened him to Adolf Hitler. Now it has appointed a new ambassador to come up with a better plan. Fed up with the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination labeling Mexico as a cradle of drug-runners, job poachers and rapists, the government is sending in respected diplomat Carlos Sada to lead a fightback. Mexicos new ambassador in Washington, Sada acknowledges his country has neglected its image across the border and aims to fix that with PR and media campaigns, and by lobbying prominent U.S. companies, lawmakers and civic leaders. We need to do a more thorough job so that people understand what (Mexico) contributes, he said after he was sworn in at Mexicos Senate on Thursday. Sadas strategy includes underscoring Mexicos importance to the U.S. economy, although it centers on defending the rights of Mexican citizens in the United States and promoting Mexican culture. That focus has fed doubts over whether the government is trying hard enough to win over its most important audience: American voters. Its vital to improve Mexicos image and protect our people, but thats not enough to change the hateful trend that Trump and other xenophobes before him have stirred up, said Gabriela Cuevas, an opposition lawmaker who chairs the Senates foreign relations committee. They dont understand the extent of the damage Trump has done, she said, urging the government to be more aggressive in mobilizing powerful U.S. interests against Trumps attacks. Claiming Mexico is killing the United States on trade, Trump has threatened to disrupt bilateral commerce worth some $500 billion a year, and promises to deport millions of undocumented migrants from Mexico and Central America. To finance a border wall to keep migrants out, he has controversially proposed blocking billions of dollars in remittances sent home by Mexicans in the United States. The measures would pose a serious threat to Mexicos economy, but for months Mexicos government disregarded Trump, hoping his candidacy would fizzle out. Its the ostrich policy: head in the sand, said Agustin Barrios Gomez, the head of Fundacion Imagen Mexico, a group dedicated to promoting Mexicos image abroad. Mexican officials say U.S. politicians and officials urged it to keep a low profile to avoid aggravating tensions, and played down the real estate magnates chances. The Republicans told us, Well deal with Trump, one senior Mexican government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. When Mexico eventually did respond, President Enrique Pena Nieto compared the brash billionaire s campaign to the rise of Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Mexican officials wince with embarrassment when reminded of the comment, arguing it was tactless and went too far. As Trump railed against Mexico, the government should have made a concerted effort to remind key players in the United States that the two nations economic interests are closely intertwined, diplomats and business leaders say. But over a dozen serving and former senior Mexican officials and lawmakers consulted by Reuters said it did not. They havent so far, but I do see the intention to do it again, said Jaime Serra, a former trade minister who headed Mexicos negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada in the early 1990s.  Trump has not been the only one to criticize Mexico. His Republican rival Ted Cruz also supports a border wall, and backs mass deportations of illegal immigrants. Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders has, like Trump, taken a protectionist line on jobs and says NAFTA was a mistake.  Mexicos cause was not helped by Pena Nieto leaving his diplomatic mission in Washington without an ambassador for six months just as Trump was warming up. And his eventual choice surprised many: Miguel Basanez, an old friend who had never worked in the diplomatic service. It was a bad decision from the start, said a senior lawmaker inside Pena Nietos ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. They didnt grasp the size of the problem. Basanez was cast aside this month, just seven months into the job.  For Basanez and now Sada, the task of promoting Mexico in the United States is complicated by problems at home. Mexicos reputation has been hurt by relentless drugs violence, conflict-of-interest scandals in government and the apparent massacre of 43 trainee teachers by a drug cartel working with local police. To change the image, you have to change the reality, said Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister responsible for North America. Unfortunately, Mexicos internal reality at this point in time has a lot of negatives. ",politicsNews,"April 25, 2016 ",1
Obama takes on role of America's pitchman at German trade show,"HANOVER, Germany (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama slipped on on a pair of virtual reality glasses bedecked with plastic googly eyes and mused about someday using the technology to talk with his daughter after she leaves home for college. The display was but one of many stops on a two-hour tour of Hanover Messe, the worlds largest trade show of industrial technology, and a tour de force of economic diplomacy by Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Its a brave new world, Obama said, doffing the glasses, and moving on to the next elaborate booth. Obama often tours American businesses and factories - and often spends time with world leaders - but the marathon tour with Merkel was a sign of how much the leaders want to conclude talks on an EU-U.S. trade deal before Obamas presidency ends on Jan. 20. This is another chance for me to tell everyone to come here and buy Made in America, Obama said. The high-profile visit was a way to promote the benefits of trade for the economy, said Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade representative, who is negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). It helps underscore you cant build walls around the U.S., Froman said in an interview. Merkel personally invited Obama to feature U.S. businesses at the trade fair and almost 400 U.S. businesses were represented. At times, the tour resembled a protracted television infomercial with the leaders gripping hand-held microphones to ask exhibitors about their products. A herd of photographers galloped from station to station to keep up. Chancellor Merkel is a scientist so she can figure this out very quickly, Obama said as they examined the Gekko Gripper, a modest silver device able to grab hold of space debris. It reminds me of Spiderman, Obama said. Does it have any earthbound application? At the Siemens booth, Chief Executive Joe Kaeser presented Obama with a pair of golf clubs designed using the companys software, a nod to the presidents favorite weekend pastime. Im going to teach Angela how to play, Obama said before posing for a photo. Several stops featured 3-D printers. Obama joked he might soon buy one and start designing things. When I get out of office, Im going to have a lot of time on my hands, he said. ",politicsNews,"April 25, 2016 ",1
Toned-down Trump does not mean retreat from policy: aide,"(Reuters) - A promise that U.S. Republican front-runner Donald Trump will adopt a more presidential campaign style does not signal a retreat from core policies such as his pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border, his top adviser said on Sunday. Senior Trump aide Paul Manafort dismissed rival Republican candidate Ted Cruzs accusation that the real estate mogul had lied about his policies on immigration to fool gullible voters. The tussle over Trumps style and substance preceded Tuesdays Republican and Democratic nominating contests in Pennsylvania and four other Northeastern U.S. states: the next chapter in 2016s drawn-out selection of the candidates for Novembers presidential election. Cruz seized on Manaforts comments at a closed-door meeting of top Republican officials in Florida on Thursday that Trump, 69, would temper the image he has projected so far, saying the part that hes been playing is now evolving. I never said Trump wasnt going to build a wall. I never said Trump was going to change any of his positions, Manafort said on Fox News Sunday. The adviser said Cruz, a 45-year-old U.S. senator from Texas who is Trumps closest rival, was trying to distract voters from his own difficult path to the nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, is also vying to be the Republican candidate. But, despite Manaforts promise of a more restrained tone, Trump has continued to employ insulting nicknames at rallies, on Saturday referring to Cruz as Lyin Ted. The billionaire New Yorker has alarmed some senior party figures with unflattering descriptions of Mexicans, a pledge to immediately deport millions of illegal immigrants and a proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, among other things. The rhetoric has drawn protesters to Trump rallies, sometimes culminating in scuffles. On Sunday, the Connecticut State Police arrested a 20-year-old man, saying he had posted a threat on Twitter to bomb an upcoming Trump rally. On Tuesday - one week after Trumps crushing win in New Yorks primary election - Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island will hold their primaries.  Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons campaign says the former secretary of state now has an essentially insurmountable lead over rival Bernie Sanders. The 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont has no plans to drop out of the race, according to his staff, who are counting on defying pollsters with some surprise wins on Tuesday. Trump is working to accrue the 1,237 delegates to the July 18-21 Republican National Convention needed to win the nomination outright. That would avert a contested convention, in which Cruz, Kasich or a dark-horse establishment figure could win the nomination on a second or subsequent ballot. Manafort predicted Trump would win the nomination on the first ballot at the Cleveland convention. Trump already has at least 844 delegates committed to him, according to the Associated Press. Cruz has 543 and Kasich has 148. In the five Northeastern states, 118 delegates will be at stake. Pennsylvania will also choose 54 delegates not bound to any candidate.  Trump has won more states overall than Cruz has, but the Texan has tried to keep Trump from winning the needed delegates by using selection rules that vary by state. In Colorado, for example, delegates were picked without a popular vote. Hes trying to say the process doesnt matter. Hes trying to say voting doesnt matter, Manafort said of Cruz on Sunday. Hes trying to say all that matters is to destroy the party and see who can pick up the pieces on a second, third or fourth ballot. Were not going to let that happen, Manafort said.  State nominating contests continue through June. Also on Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus played down conservative billionaire Charles Kochs comment that its possible Clinton, 68, would make a better president than the Republicans in the race. Charles, in the past, has gone out of his way to make the case for him being a little bit less partisan than people would expect, Priebus said on ABC.  Its going to come down to four to eight more years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton or a different direction, Priebus said. And I think thats going to be a very powerful case that were going to be able to make as a party. Democrats, including Clinton, have criticized Koch and his brother, David Koch, for using their wealth and a huge funding network they helped organize to support politicians, usually Republican ones, who reflect their opposition to government regulation of industry. The Clinton campaign was not pleased with Kochs faint praise. A response to Kochs comments posted on Clintons Twitter account said, Not interested in endorsements from people who deny climate science and try to make it harder for people to vote.

Republican financier Koch says Clinton might make better president,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, a key source of financing for conservative Republican causes along with his brother, said Democrat Hillary Clinton might make a better president than the candidates in the Republican field. Koch, in an interview to air on Sunday on ABCs This Week program, said that in some respects Bill Clinton had been a better president than George W. Bush, who Koch said had increased government spending. Then when asked if Hillary Clinton would be a better president than the Republicans currently running, he said, Its possible, its possible. ABC said Koch, who along brother David leads an influential political organization called Freedom Partners, has been displeased so far with the tone of the Republican presidential race, in which billionaire Donald Trump leads U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Asked if he could support Clinton over the Republicans, Koch responded, We would have to believe her actions would be quite different than her rhetoric. Let me put it that way. While many conservatives have questioned Trumps commitment to their agenda, a spokesman for the Koch brothers said last month that they would not use any of their money to block him from winning the Republican nomination.

I believe that if you had followed what I said yesterday in Turkey, it is something that has to come out of the Geneva peace talks; it is not about classical safe zones, she said during a news conference with U.S. President Barack Obama. Can one, when one speaks about a ceasefire, identify regions in the talks between the negotiating partners in Geneva where people can feel particularly safe.

White House to make decision on 9/11 report by June: Bob Graham,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will likely make a decision by June on whether it will release some classified material withheld from the public 9/11 Commission Report, a former U.S. senator who co-chaired the congressional inquiry into the attacks said on Sunday. The withheld section of the official report on the 2001 attacks is central to a dispute over whether Americans should be able to sue the Saudi Arabian government for damages. The Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence is reviewing the material to see whether it can be declassified.     Former Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, has been pressing for the release of the information and said that it may shed light on the financial backers for 19 hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept 11, 2001. Graham told NBCs Meet the Press that he believed that some of the withheld classified material could soon be released. The presidents staff at least has said that they will make a decision by June, and I hope that decision is to honor the American people and make it available, Graham said. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said last week that he also supported releasing the material. The release of these pages will not end debate over the issue, but it will quiet rumors over their contents, Representative Adam Schiff said in a statement. As is often the case, the reality is less damaging than the uncertainty. ",politicsNews,"April 24, 2016 ",1
Virginia ex-governor takes corruption appeal to U.S. top court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell contends that if the Supreme Court agrees with prosecutors broad view of bribery law and allows his corruption convictions to stand, it would make a politicians ordinary interactions with donors a crime and upend the U.S. political process. The eight justices will hear arguments on Wednesday in the appeal by McDonnell, a former rising star in the Republican Party, of his 2014 conviction arising from gifts from a businessman who sought to promote a dietary supplement. It is the final case they will hear in their term that ends in June. The legal question concerns whether McDonnells conduct constituted official action in exchange for a thing of value, as required for conviction under federal bribery law. His lawyers contend he merely arranged meetings, asked questions and attended events, the same type of activities that politicians routinely perform in exchange for campaign contributions.  This case marks the first time in our history that a public official has been convicted of corruption despite never agreeing to put a thumb on the scales of any government decision, his lead lawyer Noel Francisco told the justices in legal papers. Officials routinely arrange meetings for donors, take their calls, politely listen to their ideas, and refer them to aides. In criminalizing those everyday acts, the government has put every federal, state and local official nationwide in its prosecutorial crosshairs, Francisco added. In court papers, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said the justices in the past have carefully distinguished general ingratiation between a politician and a donor from quid pro quo exchanges - for example, a governors demanding a $1,000 contribution as the price of an official meeting. But no such issue arose here, because the bribes in this case were personal loans and luxury goods, not campaign contributions, Verrilli said. McDonnell, a former rising star in the Republican Party, and his wife, Maureen, were convicted in 2014 of taking $177,000 in gifts and loans from Virginia businessman Jonnie Williams. McDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison, which he has not yet served. At trial, prosecutors detailed the lavish lifestyle the McDonnells enjoyed thanks to gifts and sweetheart loans from Williams including vacations, designer clothing and shoes. The Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld McDonnells conviction last year. The concern is that under the lower courts definition of official act, anything thats a means to an end ... is now fair game for prosecution, said former prosecutor David Debold, a white collar crime defense lawyer with the Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher law firm. Tara Malloy, a lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center campaign finance law watchdog group, said to convict a politician, prosecutors must prove an explicit corrupt agreement in which the defendant agrees to do something in return for the money, Malloy said. That is not a factor in routine campaign contributions, Malloy added. ",politicsNews,"April 24, 2016 ",1
Donald Trump's unlikely villain: piano-playing Reince Priebus,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - Reince Priebus, the unassuming head of the Republican National Committee, often plays the piano late at night, sometimes with a glass of wine nearby. Tickling the ivories is a lifelong passion for Priebus and he has been doing it more than usual lately, he told Reuters in an interview last week. Its his way of easing the stress from the most combustible Republican presidential race in generations.  It has been a rough ride for the 44-year-old party chairman from Wisconsin, who presided over a three-day meeting of Republican officials in Florida last week. One reason for all that piano playing is the unconventional campaign being run by Republican front-runner Donald Trump. The bellicose billionaire has said that the party rules are rigged and could give Trumps chief rival, Ted Cruz, a chance to become the nominee through a brokered convention, even if Trump racks up more victories in state nominating contests. He said Priebus should be ashamed of himself.  Yet privately, the relationship between the two has improved, their aides told Reuters. Priebus has taken frequent calls from Trump to explain nomination rules or simply hear him out, aides said. But Priebus also has been catching fire from anti-Trump forces who want him to drop his neutrality and do more to thwart Trumps march toward the nomination ahead of the partys convention in Cleveland in July, when it must settle on a nominee to face Democrat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in the Nov. 8 election. If Trump wins the nomination - a prospect increasingly likely after his string of state victories - Priebus will need to unify his party or risk losing in November. On Friday, when Priebus urged the party to rally around the eventual nominee, the blowback from the stop-Trump crowd was intense. The best way for the Republican Party to unite, win and to grow is to reject Donald Trump, said Rory Cooper, senior adviser to a group called #NeverTrump. Adding to Priebuss dilemma is his task of choreographing a convention when the outcome remains uncertain. In most elections, the nomination is settled by late spring, giving party leaders time to focus on the messaging and stagecraft of the summer convention, which is typically centered on building excitement for the nominee. Priebus must plan for several scenarios: a traditional win in which Trump gets the 1,237 delegates he needs ahead of the convention; a contested convention in which Trump still wins; or the selection of Cruz or Ohio Governor John Kasich on a second or third ballot. The Republican convention has not been contested since 1952 and Henry Barbour, an RNC member from Mississippi, noted it was uncharted waters for the party not to have presumptive nominee so late in the cycle. Some corporations are so alarmed about how the race has turned out they have decided not to pour funding into sponsoring the convention. There also is the potential for protests of Trump in Cleveland. Trump himself has warned of riots in a contested convention. Trumps criticism of the nominating rules has been jarring to party officials and the feud could undermine efforts to unify the party. Colorado Republican Party Chairman Steve House said on Facebook his family received death threats after Cruz swept the states 34 delegates. In private discussions with Trump, Priebus said he talks about the daily events of the day or the week or the moment or the debate. He also talks regularly with Cruz and Kasich. Does Trump, with his inflammatory remarks, get under his skin? No, he doesnt because I kind of know where hes coming from. Im not unfamiliar with his opinions. So it doesnt really bother me because I know what the truth is, Priebus said. Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort said Trump and Priebus were communicating frequently and communicating better these days. They dont agree on everything but they agree to try to work things out and they are working things out, he said. An RNC member close to Priebus agreed. Theyre not best buddies or anything but they have a pretty good relationship, the member said. I consider all this back and forth as a little bit of heat of the battle tensions. Trumps complaints about the partys system have prompted some of his own supporters to roll their eyes in dismay. He aint read the rules, said Ada Fisher, a retired physician and Republican National Committee member from North Carolina, who was wearing a Trump button at the Florida event. The prevailing opinion among RNC members was that Trump is simply energizing his anti-establishment supporters, a point hammered home by Manafort, who privately told party leaders Trump is projecting an image and will transition to a more serious demeanor. RNC members vow to protect Priebus from any attempt to replace him should Trump become the nominee. I think any effort to oust Reince will fail and its not the job of our nominee to select the RNC chair. Its the job of the RNC members to select the RNC chair, said Matt Moore, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. ",politicsNews,"April 24, 2016 ",1
"Trump bashes Clinton, promises not to become boring","HOLLYWOOD, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump attacked his top Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Friday, calling her crooked, and promised his supporters that he would not bore them by becoming overly presidential. The comments undercut what his aides had said would be an attempt by the notoriously blunt-speaking Trump to project a more serious image after his win in New Yorks nominating contest this week, including by rolling out more policy details. I can tell you that if I go too presidential, people are going to be very bored, the New York real estate baron told Fox News in an interview that will air on Saturday. He added that he worried his supporters would fall asleep. He went on to say that Clinton is a person whos got many, many flaws and that shes the worst possible representative a woman can have, as he shifted his focus away from Republican rivals and toward the Nov. 8 presidential election. The only thing shes got going is the women card, Trump said in the excerpts released by the network on Friday. We call her Crooked Hillary because shes a crooked person. Shes always been a crooked person.   Clinton said at a campaign event in Pennsylvania she would not respond to Trumps comments about her. Donna Hoffman, the head of the political science department at the University of Iowa, said Trumps fiery personality had put him in a bind at this stage of the race. The impetus to become more presidential is coming from some of the elite organs of the GOP, but he got to where he is today because of his persona, she said. To continue this way will keep him alienated from the party, but to change means his supporters will question his authenticity. In a strong signal that his persona matters, a January survey showed that among Trumps supporters about 43 percent said they liked him because he speaks his mind, while only 8 percent cited his policies. The survey was conducted by the Working America arm of labor organization AFL-CIO. Trumps win in his home state of New York on Tuesday bolstered his chances for the Republican presidential nomination, prompting a more serious study of his prospects in the general election. Trump will give a foreign policy speech on Wednesday at the National Press Club, part of an expanded policy roll-out the campaign is planning, his aides told Republican leaders and lawmakers this week. The speech will come the day after a round of primary contests in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, in which polls show him likely to do well. But Trumps rivals have said he lacks foreign policy expertise, and several foreign leaders have said they are concerned about the idea of Trump in the White House. The mantra that somehow Donald Trump has become the presumptive nominee after New York is ridiculous, Chad Sweet, campaign chairman for Texas Senator Ted Cruz, said on CNN on Friday.     Nationally, Trump has support from nearly half of all Republicans, compared with 28 percent for Cruz and 17 percent for Ohio Governor John Kasich, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Now theres no path to victory for Cruz so he should get out. They should both get out, Trump told supporters in Harrington, Delaware. And when they get out ..., we will start on Hillary Clinton like nobodys ever seen. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on Friday the party was prepared for numerous scenarios, including a contested convention if no Republican has earned the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Republican National Committee officials gathered in Hollywood, Florida to take stock of the race for the White House and prepare for the possibility of a contested convention in July in Cleveland.  Mexicos new ambassador to the United States, Carlos Sada, vowed on Thursday to combat negative publicity in the U.S. campaign after Trump accused Mexico of sending drug traffickers and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a wall at the border. Japanese firms said in a Reuters poll released on Wednesday that a Trump presidency would harm security partnerships.  ",politicsNews,"April 22, 2016 ",1
Hillary Clinton also wants Britain to stay in the EU,"LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton wants Britain to stay in the European Union, her campaign said on Saturday, following an intervention from U.S. President Barack Obama who urged Britons to vote to remain. Hillary Clinton believes that transatlantic cooperation is essential, and that cooperation is strongest when Europe is united. She has always valued a strong United Kingdom in a strong EU. And she values a strong British voice in the EU, Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement provided to Reuters.  Clinton, who spent four years as U.S. secretary of state during Obamas first term, has made her foreign policy credentials a central piece of her campaign for president in the November 2016 race for the White House.  Clintons position on the EU was first reported by Britains Observer newspaper.  Obama, who will leave Britain on Sunday, sparked a row during his three-day trip by bluntly telling Britain it should remain in the European Union to preserve its remaining global clout. He angered critics of the EU on Friday by warning that Britain would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal if it left the club - one of the strongest U.S. interventions in the affairs of a western European democracy since the Cold War.

Severe criminal justice policies hurt U.S. economy: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Longer prison sentences for non-violent criminals and crowded prisons are hurting the American economy more than they are helping it, economists in U.S. President Barack Obamas administration said in a report released on Saturday. The prison population in the United States is 4.5 times larger than it was in 1980, primarily driven by longer sentences and higher conviction rates for nearly all offenses, according to the Councils report. Economists are of one mind that packed prisons, excessively long sentences, and insufficient reentry programs are counter-productive to our economy as a whole in addition to hurting the people involved, Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters in a call on Friday. On Monday, administration officials, economists, business leaders, and scholars will discuss the Councils findings at an event hosted by the White House, the American Enterprise Institute think tank, and New York Universitys Brennan Center for Justice. The United States can reap greater economic benefit through investments in police, prisoner education, and job opportunities for ex-prisoners than it can from putting additional funding toward prisons, the Councils report said. The Councils report was based on a review of existing economics research, and does not estimate the indirect costs borne by the U.S. economy as a result of its current criminal justice policies.  Later this year, the Brennan Center will unveil a study quantifying how much the U.S. criminal justice system costs Americans in terms of employment, wages, and gross domestic product, said the centers director of justice programs, Inimai Chettiar.  Previous administrations have not brought the same focus to how criminal justice policies affect the U.S. workforce, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who led the Congressional Budget Office from 2003-05 and is now president of the American Action Forum think tank. Since the recession of the late 2000s, every aspect of the workforce has been scrutinized more closely, and this sort of popped out, he told Reuters.  ",politicsNews,"April 23, 2016 ",1
U.S. oil baron Harold Hamm endorses Trump for president,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Harold Hamm, chief executive of shale oil producer Continental Resources Inc and Mitt Romneys 2012 energy adviser, endorsed U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday, saying he has the fortitude to make tough decisions.  Hamm, who had previously donated to U.S. Senator Marco Rubios presidential campaign, called the real estate mogul a business leaders candidate who has the will to right what he called a series of mistakes from politicians in Washington, including burdensome government regulations. The next president of the United States must have the courage, determination and intelligence to disrupt politics as usual, Hamm wrote in a public letter. Such an honor to get the endorsement of Harold Hamm, one of the great men in the history of the oil and energy business, Trump said in a statement to Reuters.  Known for his outspoken views on U.S. energy policy and other matters, Hamm once referred to OPEC leader Saudi Arabia as a toothless tiger in the face of growing U.S. oil output. OPEC and Saudia Arabia eventually proved Hamm wrong by using its influence to keep prices low for more than 18 months and counting, exerting sharp pain on U.S. oil producers. Hamms Continental is expected to post a quarterly loss next month. Hamms endorsement followed President Barack Obamas meeting with Saudi Arabias King Salman in Riyadh this week. By endorsing Trump, Hamm has parted ways with former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican candidate for the White House, who has vigorously opposed Trumps candidacy.

Virginia governor signs order restoring voting rights for felons,"RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe signed an order on Friday restoring the voting rights of more than 200,000 convicted felons who have completed their sentences, in a move that could help the Democratic nominee in Novembers presidential election. By using his executive powers, the Democratic governor is circumventing the Republican majority in the state General Assembly. Many of the convicts affected by the order are African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past.  Virginia will no longer build walls and barriers to the ballot box - we will break them down, McAuliffe said in a message on his Twitter account. Advocates of restoring voting rights say it is a way of promoting racial justice, as African-Americans are convicted of crimes and sent to prison at about twice the rate of the overall U.S. population. Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political analyst at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, said a majority of the convicted felons who regained their voting rights were likely members of minority groups. Of the 5.8 million Americans banned from voting, 2.2 million are African-American, according to the Sentencing Project, a prison reform advocacy group. In three states - Virginia, Florida and Kentucky - more than a fifth of black residents outside of prison are barred from voting. About 13 percent of the U.S. population is African-American. McAuliffes order drew immediate criticism from John Whitbeck, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, who said the governor should have excluded those convicted of violent crimes. His decision to issue a blanket restoration, without regard to the nature of the crimes committed doesnt speak of mercy. Rather, it speaks of political opportunism, Whitbeck said in a statement.  Nationwide, restoration of voting rights is an issue that has drawn support from both Democrats and Republicans as a way to improve reintegration of prisoners into society. About two dozen states have eased restrictions on felons casting ballots over the past two decades, according to the Sentencing Project. But the move carries political implications as well. Virginia is considered a key swing state in the 2016 election, and the governors order could tip the balance in favor of the Democratic candidate who wins the partys nomination. While Democrat Barack Obama took Virginia both in the 2008 and 2012 elections, Republican presidential candidates have a history of dominance in the state. Before Obamas victories, Republicans carried Virginia in every presidential election since 1952 except one. In 1964, Democrat Lyndon Johnson won in Virginia as he defeated Barry Goldwater in a national landslide. The governor, who said on Friday Virginia has had some of the most restrictive laws in the country for restoration of voting and civil rights, has made the issue a high priority during his administration. Previous efforts have resulted in the restoration of voting rights to 18,000 Virginians, he said. The order will restore the rights of every Virginia felon who completed his or her sentence and all other requirements as of April 22, affecting 206,000 people immediately, the governor said in a press release.  Before the order, Virginia felons would have to petition the governor, who had broad discretion in ruling on any request. ",politicsNews,"April 22, 2016 ",1
"Unpopularity of Clinton, Trump puts spotlight on potential running mates","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rarely have two U.S. presidential front-runners needed more from running mates than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The Democratic and Republican leaders in the 2016 White House race are unusually unpopular nationally, polls show, despite their success with voters in their respective parties. Clinton has struggled to generate excitement about her candidacy and assuage voter concerns about her trustworthiness, while Trump fares badly among women and minorities in polls. Their weaknesses only increase the importance of their vice presidential pick, who could potentially help them rally support in key demographics ahead of the Nov. 8 vote - if each gets their partys nomination.  Hispanic advocacy groups are lobbying Clinton to choose a Hispanic running mate. The person most often mentioned - Julian Castro, the housing and urban development secretary who is one of the partys rising stars - is opposed by liberal activists who accuse him of favoring Wall Street firms in the sale of distressed mortgages. Some of the groups have started an online petition against Castros candidacy, which has angered the Latino Victory Fund, a nonpartisan advocacy group that has been pushing for a Latino vice-presidential nominee.  These attacks against Secretary Castro are completely unfounded, short sighted, and only serve to pit us against each other, said Cristobal Alex, the funds president. The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce has called on Clinton to choose Castro.  Democratic strategist Joe Velasquez, a Clinton supporter, said a Hispanic running mate could make a difference in swing states like Florida, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia, which have large Hispanic populations. Polls show Hispanic voters overwhelmingly dislike Trump, in part because of his comments likening illegal immigrants to criminals. U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez has also been mentioned as a possible Latino pick. But Clintons decision isnt clear-cut. Given Trumps unpopularity with some moderate Republicans, she may want a vice-president who can wrest away some of those voters. Someone like Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia who personally opposes abortion but supports a womans right to choose, or New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who has close ties to the financial sector.  There was no immediate comment from Castro, Kaine, Perez or Booker. Clinton though could give a higher priority to winning over liberal democrats, who see her as too pro-Wall Street and have flocked to her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Sherrod Brown, a senator from Ohio who is a fierce opponent of global trade deals, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a fierce critic of the banking industry, have both been named as possible vice president picks.   Brown and Warren did not respond to requests for comment. The Clinton campaign confirmed a report in the Boston Globe that Clinton would include at least one woman in any short list of vice presidential candidates to be vetted. Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis is skeptical that Clinton needs to spend much time appeasing the liberal wing of her party if she wins the nomination. As much as people have made out this race between Clinton and Sanders to be an ideological death match, Donald Trump will do more to bring the Democratic Party together than anyone has ever done, he said. Trump is viewed unfavorably by 80 percent of Democrats,     according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.  But other Democrats fear the increasingly bitter Clinton-Sanders battle, has fractured the party. Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, said Clintons pick has to be viewed through a prism of, among other things, their ability to bring on Sanders voters. Reuters/Ipsos polling suggests Clinton would struggle to attract some Sanders voters. When asked what they would do if Clinton was the nominee, 15 percent of Sanders supporters said they would stay home on Election Day and 16 percent said they would vote for the Republican nominee. Forty-nine percent said they would vote for Clinton. Both the Clinton and Trump campaigns refused to comment on the vice-presidential speculation, saying they remain focused on winning their respective nominating contests. Clinton holds a commanding lead among the party delegates who will pick the partys nominee, but Sanders has pledged to keep fighting. Trump may not have the Republican nomination locked down until the summer, if he can beat off challenges by Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is running a distant third in the Republican race. Typically, vice-presidential selections are vetted for weeks after a candidate has emerged as the partys nominee and are announced shortly before the party conventions in the summer.  Trumps polarizing candidacy could make his job of finding a running mate more difficult. For much of the campaign season, many in the Republican establishment, along with well-funded political committees, have been looking for ways to keep Trump from winning the Republican nomination. Trump has stated his preference for an established office-holder rather than a political neophyte like himself, specifically listing Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and Kasich.  Walker, who has endorsed Cruz, laughed when he was asked about the prospect, but has been noncommittal. Rubio has repeatedly rejected the idea. Kasich last week said there was zero chance of his playing second fiddle to Trump, despite mounting speculation that he would be an ideal candidate because of his deep government experience and Ohios crucial role as a general election swing state.  A source close to Kasich told Reuters the governor has no interest in working with Trump as the two dont agree on much.  Cruz, too, said this week he would not be Trumps running mate, while telling reporters in Hollywood, Florida on Wednesday that a Trump-Kasich ticket loses to Hillary Clinton. Tony Fratto, a Republican strategist, said Trump may be forced to turn to guys at the end of their careers, not people who believe they have a future. Someone in their last act who has nothing to lose by accepting an offer from Trump.  That might include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has been one or the few establishment politicians to campaign for Trump, or Florida Governor Rick Scott, who has endorsed Trump. Both are in their final terms in office.  Christie was asked about the prospect in an interview with a New Jersey radio station on Thursday. The way I think about these things, you never say never, he said.  Other names linked to Trump include former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump adviser, and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate. There was no immediate comment from Sessions, Scott and Giuliani. Armstrong Williams, a close adviser to Carson, said the former White House hopeful doesnt want the slot. At this point he has no interest in being in politics ... none, Williams said. I think Trump is looking for someone with government experience, someone who is more political.

Spy chief pressed for number of Americans ensnared in data espionage,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are pressing the nations top intelligence official to estimate the number of Americans ensnared in email surveillance and other such spying on foreign targets, saying the information was needed to gauge possible reforms to the controversial programs. Eight Democrats and six Republicans made the request to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday, reflecting the continued bipartisan concerns over the scope of U.S. data espionage.  You have willingly shared information with us about the important and actionable intelligence obtained under these surveillance programs, wrote the lawmakers, all members of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.  Now we require your assistance in making a determination that the privacy protections in place are functioning as designed. They requested that Clapper provide the information about data collected under a statute, known as Section 702, by May 6. That law, set to expire at the end of 2017, enables an Internet surveillance program called Prism that was first disclosed in a series of leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden some three years ago.   Prism gathers messaging data from Alphabets Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance. Intelligence officials say data about Americans are incidentally collected during communication with a target reasonably believed to be living overseas. Critics see it as back-door surveillance on Americans without a warrant. A recently declassified November opinion from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secretive body that oversees the legality of U.S. spy programs, rejected a constitutional challenge to rules permitting the FBI to access foreign intelligence data for use in domestic criminal investigations. The Republican-controlled House has voted overwhelmingly since the Snowden leaks to require U.S. agencies obtain a warrant before searching collected foreign intelligence for data belonging to Americans, but those proposals have gained minimal traction in the Senate. Civil liberties groups and Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, have previously requested information on the extent of  U.S. data caught up in the foreign surveillance program. The Obama administration, however, has said it cannot provide a precise answer and that any estimate would require reviewing communications in a manner that would raise privacy concerns. In their letter to Clapper, the lawmakers said officials have demonstrated the feasibility of providing an estimate and that any one-time privacy concerns were acceptable in light of the importance of the information. James Sensenbrenner, Darrell Issa, Jim Jordan, Ted Poe, Jason Chaffetz, and Blake Farenthold were the Republicans to sign the letter. Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hank Johnson, Ted Deutch, Cedric Richmond, Suzan DelBene, David Cicilline and John Conyers signed for the Democrats. Conyers is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. ",politicsNews,"April 22, 2016 ",1

Ryan, a Republican, added in a statement that the reported purchase for $8.6 million appeared to be part of the Democratic administrations efforts to sweeten the nuclear deal with Iran and would directly subsidize Irans nuclear program.

Markets ignore Trump presidential bid at their peril,"LONDON (IFR) - The prospect of Donald Trump becoming the next U.S. president and ushering in a period of increased public spending and de-globalisation has not been adequately priced into bond markets, market participants have warned.  Trump, currently a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. president, could prove disruptive for global markets if he comes into power and brings in policies that match the radical nature of his rhetoric. I think one big uncertainty that has so far been ignored by the market is Donald Trump: what happens if he is elected, Patrick Barbe, chief investment officer, European Sovereign & Aggregate, BNP Paribas Investment Partners, told IFR. We dont have any specific policies from him yet, but the tone of what he is saying suggests increased wages, expansion of the public sector and rising government expenses; everything that bond markets tend not to like.  While the U.S. markets will be most affected, the repercussions could be felt throughout the world, as the US still accounts for the largest chunk of the worlds GDP; over 22 percent in 2014, according to the World Bank.  Trump this week recorded a comprehensive victory in the New York primary, injecting renewed momentum into his campaign to become the Republican nominee.  The vote scheduled for November has had a limited effect on bond markets so far. US Treasuries have tended to trade much more on rates expectations than on political risk so far this year, and 10-year UST yields have dropped as much as 36bp since the start of the year to 1.88 percent, according to Eikon prices.  Moreover, there has been very little research or analysis done on the subject up to this point, though that is likely to change as the nomination process continues.  I dont think the market has fully thought through the implications of Trump as U.S. president, but it is definitely moving up the agenda, said David Riley, head of credit strategy at BlueBay Asset Management.  In my view, populist politics typically is also associated with protectionist economic policies. Certainly a concern would be a more isolationist, protectionist U.S., which would reinforce a fear that, after an era of globalization, we would enter an era of de-globalisation. ISSUERS FRONT-RUN In the public sector market there has been record levels of US dollar bond issuance this month, partly because SSA issuers are looking to get their borrowing done ahead of any political risk associated with the U.S. election. Market conditions are primarily driving the issuance as it is looking very solid at the moment, but the U.S. election will cause uncertainty the closer you get to it. A lot of people are getting in ahead of these events, said one syndicate official who covers public sector debt.  There has been $38.9 billion of U.S. dollar bond issuance month-to-date by public sector issuers, according to IFR data, led by the likes of Washington-based supras World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.  With a week still to go, that is comfortably above the US$35bn raised in January - traditionally the busiest month of the year for the SSA sector. ",politicsNews,"April 22, 2016 ",1
U.S. to propose Obama visit Hiroshima in late May: Nikkei,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States will propose that President Barack Obama visits Hiroshima, Japans Nikkei newspaper said on Friday, in what would be the first visit by an incumbent U.S. president to the city devastated by a U.S. nuclear attack 71 years ago. Citing an unidentified senior U.S. government official, the business daily said Washington planned to propose to Tokyo a visit by the president on May 27, at the end of a Group of Seven (G7) summit hosted by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In Washington, a White House official said no decision has been made.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga denied the visit was being arranged and declined further comment. Diplomatic protocol means any announcement should come from the U.S. side. It is not true that a visit to Hiroshima by President Obama is being arranged between the United States and Japan, Suga told a regular news conference.  The schedule of the U.S. president is a matter for the United States to decide. The (Japanese) government will refrain from comment. A U.S. warplane dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, killing thousands of people instantly and about 140,000 by the end of that year. Nagasaki was bombed on Aug. 9, 1945, and Japan surrendered six days later. A presidential visit would be controversial in the United States if it were seen as an apology. A majority of Americans view the bombing of Hiroshima and  Nagasaki as justified to end the war and save U.S lives. The vast majority of Japanese think the bombings were unjustified. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said during a visit to the city this month that Obama wanted to travel there, although he did not know if the presidents schedule when he visited Japan for the May 26-27 summit would allow him to. Hiroshima bombing survivors, and other residents, have said they hope for progress in ridding the world of nuclear weapons, rather than an apology, if Obama makes the historic visit. Hopes for Obamas visit to Hiroshima were raised after a speech in April 2009 in Prague when he called for a world without nuclear weapons. He later said he would be honored to visit the two cities that suffered nuclear attack. Kerry, who toured the Hiroshima Peace Memorial and Museum, called its haunting displays gut-wrenching and said everyone should visit. The displays include photographs of badly burned victims, the tattered and stained clothes they wore and statues depicting them with flesh melting from their limbs. ",politicsNews,"April 22, 2016 ",1
"Trump has been playing a part, will become more presidential: adviser","HOLLYWOOD, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top advisers to Donald Trump assured Republican Party leaders on Thursday that the New York billionaire would adopt a more presidential demeanor soon, to temper the image projected during his campaign so far. Trumps representatives, including newly recruited senior advisers Paul Manafort and Rick Wiley, met privately with leaders of the Republican National Committee at an oceanside resort hotel where the party is holding a three-day meeting. The part that hes been playing is now evolving into the part that youve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change, Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort assured the party leaders, according to an audiotape of the session heard by Reuters. Trump has been projecting an image to energize voters, Manafort said, adding that he will soon concentrate on crooked Hillary, the nickname that Trump has given to Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton. Youll see a different guy, said Manafort. But in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested he was not ready to change from the style that has brought him close to the Republican presidential nomination. I just dont know if I want to do it yet, he said. In recent weeks, Trump has railed against the party for developing what he said was a rigged system in which Cruz was able to amass delegates in Colorado without Republicans actually voting. Chatting over shrimp, crab legs and an open bar, Trumps advisers expressed confidence that their candidate would win the Republican presidential nomination without the party having to resort to a contested convention in Cleveland in July, according to three attendees. Trump, 69, needs 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright for the Nov. 8 election. Rivals Ted Cruz, 45, and John Kasich, 63, are trying to stop him from getting a majority of delegates, so they can force a contested convention in which one of them could emerge as the nominee. Cruz told a conservative talk radio host, Mark Levin, that Manaforts comments show that Trumps campaign style is just an act. Party leaders told reporters after the session that Trumps envoys said Trump, as the Republican nominee, would be able to expand the partys electoral map to include several states Republicans have not won in a general election in a generation. One attendee, South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore, said the Trump team told the group it expected Trump to adopt a more presidential demeanor over the next few weeks.Moore said he was taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether Trump would change. The proof is in the pudding, he said. Manafort told reporters after the meeting that we talked about how were going to expand the map. As for how to change the negative image some voters had of Trump, Manafort said: We just have to present him in a way that shows all sides of Donald Trump. Former presidential candidate Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has endorsed Trump, also addressed the group. Talking to reporters as he walked into the meeting, Carson said his message was that Republicans should stop fighting among ourselves and unite behind Trump. I dont think anyone can win if the Republican Party and the conservatives dont consolidate, he said. Trump, who has alarmed some establishment Republicans with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, has begun to moderate his message in recent days. Trumps campaign has hired staff versed in the ways of Washington and has begun holding regular meetings on Capitol Hill with current and potential supporters.  Trump clashed again on Thursday with Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, this time over a North Carolina law passed last month requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificates. During an appearance at an NBC Today show town hall, Trump sided with critics of the law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature, saying it was unnecessary and that North Carolina was paying a big price because of negative business reaction. His comments drew immediate criticism from Cruz, a staunch social and fiscal conservative who supports the law and said Trump had caved to political correctness as he seeks to broaden his appeal.

Clinton targets young voters with new fundraising group,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton launched a bid on Thursday to draw young voters and small donors to her campaign, targeting the strengths of her rival, Bernie Sanders, as she looks ahead to the general election. Dubbed for45 - for Clinton as the 45th president of the United States - the group will offer associate level membership for as low as $250, according to an invitation seen by Reuters for an April 25 Philadelphia event. We will have an opportunity to fundraise and host low-dollar events, speaking to what we are passionate about and why we support her, said Akilah Ensley, a 32-year-old Clinton supporter planning to join the group. Its important that we engage.      The group held its kick-off conference call on Thursday, featuring the Clinton campaigns finance director, Dennis Cheng, other campaign officials, and actress Lena Dunham, according to an invitation to the call. The group includes two other tiers, according to an information sheet seen by Reuters - a member level with minimum fundraising of $2,500 and an advisor level for raising at least $10,000. The Clinton and Sanders campaigns did not respond to  requests for comment.  The formation of the group underscores the challenge facing the former secretary of state in winning over the young people who have helped power Sanders run. Younger voters are a critical voting block and source of financing should she win the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton has a commanding delegate lead over Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, and checked his momentum by winning New Yorks primary earlier this week. But she has struggled to attract younger voters. While she won New York on Tuesday by 16 points, Sanders took 65 percent of Democratic voters aged 18 to 29, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research and published in the New York Times. Younger voters have also turned out more heavily for Sanders in other states. Sanders so often boasts about his average donation level of $27 that rally crowds now shout the number out along with him.  Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida who is not affiliated with the Clinton campaign, said for45 was a smart way to begin courting Sanders supporters. He compared it with the Gen44 group of young voters that supported President Barack Obama.  Anything that spurs people to get involved financially, it just builds more ownership in the campaign, he said.    ",politicsNews,"April 21, 2016 ",1
Trump offers support for bathroom access based on gender identity,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sided on Thursday with those criticizing a controversial new North Carolina law requiring transgender people to use government and school bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. Trump said the law was unnecessary and people should be allowed to use whichever bathroom feels appropriate. Leave it the way it is, he said during a town hall on NBCs Today show. There have been very few complaints the way it is, added Trump, who is front-runner to be the Republican presidential nominee in Novembers election. National Basketball Association Commissioner Adam Silver also on Thursday made his strongest statements yet suggesting that the leagues 2017 All-Star Game would be moved out of the state if the law is not changed, the Washington Post reported. At a meeting with Associated Press sports editors, Silver maintained that there was no deadline for making a decision about the event to be held in Charlotte, North Carolina. Corporations, entertainers and activists are calling for a repeal of the measure signed into law last month by the states Republican governor, Pat McCrory.  State tourism and business groups say tens of millions of dollars in revenue have been lost as meetings have relocated, and entertainers including Bruce Springsteen canceled concerts. PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) halted or canceled plans to add jobs in protest at the law. North Carolina did something (that) was very strong, and theyre paying a big price, Trump said. Trumps main rival for the Republican nomination, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, reiterated his support for North Carolinas law, which invalidated an ordinance passed in Charlotte and is now the subject of a federal lawsuit. [L2N1700NV] We shouldnt be facilitating putting little girls alone in a bathroom w/ grown men, Cruz, who is a social conservative and  the father of two young girls, said on Twitter. Thats just a bad, bad, bad idea. North Carolinas law has been criticized for denying protections to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community beyond bathroom access. McCrory has signaled a willingness to revise some aspects of the measure, but he and other top Republicans in the state are standing firm on the controversial bathroom provision. McCrory is seeking re-election in November. His campaign has defended the provision saying it affects only bathrooms in public schools and government buildings, and private businesses are free to adopt their own bathroom policies.

Guantanamo shrinking but Obama goal of closing prison still elusive,"GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE, Cuba (Reuters) - Observed from behind a one-way mirror and heavy chain-link fence, a handful of bearded detainees in baggy t-shirts mill around inside a communal cellblock at the Guantanamo Bay military prison, vastly outnumbered by U.S. troops guarding them. This is the shrinking world of Americas notorious offshore prison, a scene that underscores how U.S. President Barack Obama is running out of time  and options  to meet his pledge to close the compound before he leaves office in January. Obama has whittled down the number of prisoners to 80, the lowest since shortly after his predecessor George W. Bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But the president faces political and legal obstacles that may prove insurmountable in his final push to empty the detention center at the U.S. naval station in Cuba, according to some U.S. officials in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1NmI52e) Still, there were growing signs during a carefully scripted media tour this week that operations are beginning to wind down at the prison, where many cells now stand empty. As inmate numbers dwindle - the latest departures being nine Yemenis sent to Saudi Arabia last weekend - participation also has ebbed in what was once a widespread hunger strike. Fewer than five inmates are being force-fed, the chief medical officer told reporters as he displayed a restraint chair of the type where prisoners are strapped down and nasal tubes inserted twice daily. But the 1,100-strong force of military personnel assigned to secure Guantanamos far-flung lockups, ranging from communal compounds for well-behaved prisoners to solitary confinement for those considered most dangerous, has remained largely unchanged. That works out to about 14 guards for each current inmate. Work inside the razor wire is labor-intensive. Squads of guards in protective visors swarmed through an eerily darkened corridor one lunch time, preparing to deliver meals in Camp Six, home to the most cooperative prisoners. Unaware of being watched and recorded through the sound-proof glass, detainees went about their routines. One waved over a guard and complained about not having enough pens for his artwork, while another sat at a steel table doing paperwork. In Washington, Republican lawmakers are readying for a legal battle if Obama tries to move prisoners to U.S. soil. Obamas plan to close Guantanamo, announced two months ago, hinges on bringing possibly dozens of remaining prisoners deemed too dangerous to release to maximum-security prisons in the United States. But that would defy a congressional ban on such transfers. Administration officials have not ruled out that Obama might seek to bypass Congress and resort to executive action to close the prison but say privately he probably wont make a decision until after the November presidential election. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and his party rivals vow to keep the jail open if they win the White House. At its peak, Guantanamo housed nearly 800 prisoners, becoming a symbol of the excesses of the war on terror and synonymous with accusations of torture. Obama, whose promise to shutter the prison dates back to the 2008 campaign, has called it a recruitment tool for terrorists. Nowadays, camp officials credit improved compliance by prisoners to a sense that release is getting closer. Most have been held for more than a decade without charge or trial. Only two detainees are listed for misconduct, which can entail anything from physically assaulting guards to splashing them with bodily fluids, said Army Colonel David Heath, commander of the Guantanamo guard force. Hunger strikers, who numbered more than a hundred at the peak of their protest in 2013, are now just a handful and there is no longer any need for extraction teams to pull them from their cells for enteral feeding sessions, according to Navy Captain Rich Quattrone, head of the camps medical facilities. He insisted the process is safe and humane. But Omar Farah, attorney for Tariq Ba Odah, a Yemeni hunger striker who lost half his body weight and was among the group sent to Saudi Arabia, said force-feeding was utterly humiliating. Guantanamo officials remain mindful of other potential sources of trouble, especially given Islamic religious sensitivities. For instance, when a reporter entered a model cell meant to display living conditions and began inspecting a bookshelf, camp officials rushed over and told her not to touch a copy of the Koran. Her cameraman was ordered to delete the scene. At the detainee library, where Harry Potter books are the most popular items, officials screen out anything deemed to promote jihadist themes or containing graphic violence or nudity.  Inmates sometimes go a step further. A womans photo on the cover of an Arabic-language National Geographic was scribbled over by a detainee apparently offended by her uncovered face.

Republican candidate Kasich passed over by 'Time 100',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Time magazines annual 100 most influential people list had a notable omission this year: John Kasich, the only member of the current presidential field who did not to make the cut. The list included Kasichs rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, front-runner Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, along with Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, in its leaders category, but not the Ohio governor. Kasich has trailed Trump and Cruz throughout the campaign and his organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his omission from the Time list. The Time 100 bills itself as a collection of world leaders, great minds and other icons of the moment, according to a statement released to the media. Trump was depicted in the list as a rule breaker, Cruz a conservative crusader, Clinton a Democratic fighter and Sanders a populist provocateur. Other U.S. political figures who made the cut included Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. Time Deputy Editor Radhika Jones, who oversees the list, told Reuters they chose to include the candidates who are most changing the game. There was never going to be a way to get all the candidates, on the list Jones explained, citing the lists global scope.

Mexico Senate committee OK's air transport deal with United States,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A key committee in Mexicos Senate on Thursday ratified a deal with the United States that would boost competition in air transportation, a Senate spokesman said, paving the way for expansion of the worlds second largest cross-border market. The deal, which both governments have already signed and  modifies a 1960 agreement, would open up new routes for airlines to fly between the countries and allow for an unlimited number of flights. Mexicos full Senate must still ratify the agreement for it to take effect, which is likely to happen in the coming days. While some analysts have welcomed the deal, saying it would lower airfares by boosting traffic, Mexican airline workers have complained it would put the countrys airlines at a disadvantage. The United States, which has a fleet of 7,500 planes compared to Mexicos 300, accounts for 65 percent of total flights in Mexican airspace, well above the 22 percent offered by Mexican carriers. Ratification would also remove the main hurdle to a closer tie-up between Delta Air Lines Inc and Grupo Aeromexico SAB de CV. The carriers have asked the U.S. government to grant them immunity from antitrust law so they can coordinate better flight connection times as well as prices, a request that cannot be granted until the aviation accord comes into force. Delta said last week its deal to buy up to 49 percent of Aeromexico is expected to close this summer. ",politicsNews,"April 21, 2016 ",1
"Kerry, Zarif to discuss U.S. sanctions relief for Iran on Friday: U.S.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions relief will be on the agenda when the Iranian and U.S. foreign ministers meet on Friday amid Tehrans complaints it has been slow to benefit from last years Iran nuclear deal, the U.S. State Department said. Under the July 14 nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions that had crippled its oil-dependent economy. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif plan to sit down in New York on Friday, their second meeting this week. I fully expect that they will continue to talk about the sanctions relief process and the degree to which banks, foreign and domestic, as well as institutions, foreign and domestic, are evaluating their options under the JCPOA, State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters at his daily briefing. Kirby said representatives of the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees many but not all U.S. sanctions on Iran, would not take part in the meeting, and he played down expectations that the talks would yield any concrete proposals. In addition, Kirby told reporters Washington did not share Tehrans view that a U.S. Supreme Court decision that almost $2 billion in frozen Iranian assets must be turned over to American families of people killed in the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut and other attacks constituted theft.

Sanders raises more cash but Clinton makes campaign dollars go further,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has spent about $15 per vote so far in the race for the partys nomination, less than her rival Bernie Sanders, who spent $22, according to campaign finance reports filed on Wednesday. Clintons efficiency with money could offset concern among some of her backers that Sanders, the U.S. Senator from Vermont, has outraised her in each of the last two months as he wages a fierce fight to get onto the presidential ballot. The former first ladys campaign has spent a total of $157.8 million since launching last April and has yielded a total of 10.4 million votes in state nominating contests. That includes $28.7 million for 8.7 million votes in March, the filings show. Sanders, in turn, has spent $168.4 million since launching his bid for the White House, while netting 7.7 million votes. Sanders campaign has often touted its ability to tap a large number of small donors to outraise Clinton. In March, Sanders pulled in nearly $46 million from 900,000 people, with an average donation of just over $26, it said. That compared to $29.3 million for Clinton in March, from 400,000 people.  Some 96 percent of Sanders donors have given less in total than the $2,700 maximum, according to his campaign, meaning he can go back to them for more funds.  Some of Clintons backers say they are nervous about her campaigns fundraising strategy of relying heavily on donors who are able to write big checks, and who max out more quickly. I think were going to see her doing more small dollar fund raisers, said Lorraine Hariton, who has raised more than $100,000 for the campaign.  But the Clinton campaigns spending efficiency has helped it preserve a warchest. At the end of March, Clinton had $29 million left in the bank  more than anyone else running for president. Sanders had just $17 million. Preserving the war chest is crucial for Clintons chance of winning the White House in the general election against a Republican, letting her campaign effectively in swing states, attack her opponents vulnerabilities and defend her own. Should she face off against Republican front-runner Donald Trump, she will need a bank account sufficient to compete with a candidate who has mastered the knack of earning free coverage. Approaching the end of the primary campaign with a surplus is a far different scenario from the one in which Clinton found herself at the end of her failed 2008 bid for the nomination against Barack Obama, when she ended up $9.5 million in debt. An example of the campaigns frugality: it cut advertising spending by $5 million to $12 million in March, a month heavy with primaries and caucuses, by using more digital advertising instead of television ads.  Clinton spent only $1.6 million on digital ads. The campaign also reduced real estate costs and limited increases in payroll as it staffed up.  We set ambitious goals to ensure wed have the resources we need to win a competitive primary and weve blown past every goal, recently surpassing the million-donor mark, spokesman Josh Schwerin said.

Sen. Warren demands answers from U.S. regulators over Cohen firm,"(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a firebrand for strong financial regulation, asked on Thursday why securities regulators approved Steve Cohens new firm as an investment adviser after barring the billionaire from managing other peoples money until 2018. In a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Massachusetts Democrat said the regulators decision to approve the firm, Stamford Harbor Capital L.P., makes a mockery of the SECs core mission to protect investors. The Commission has permitted a recidivist hedge fund manager, well-known for his former companys willingness to evade and ignore federal law, to once again profit from - and potentially exploit - investors, she wrote, calling it the latest example of an SEC action that fails to appropriately punish guilty parties, deter future wrongdoing, and protect investors. In 2012 Cohen was implicated in an insider trading scandal at a unit of SAC Capital Advisors, a hedge fund he founded. The SEC in January reached a settlement with Cohen prohibiting him from serving in a supervisory role at any broker, dealer, or investment adviser until 2018, addressing charges related to the subsidiary.  As the only law enforcement agency to charge Steven Cohen, the SEC imposed important restrictions, including a supervisory bar plus the additional oversight requirements in the settlement that are even stronger than typical remedies, said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SECs enforcement division.  Mark Herr, a spokesman for Point 72 Asset Management, Cohens family office that manages his assets, said the conditions in the settlement were clear. We are not going to manage one dollar of outside money prior to Jan. 1, 2018, he said. Earlier this month the SEC granted registration to the new Stamford Harbor entity, which Cohen owns.  At the time, a Stamford Harbor spokesman said Cohen will not supervise the activities of anyone acting on its behalf, thus allowing him to abide by the agreement. The firm will initially focus on investments in private companies that are illiquid, according to filings. But it could also seek or accept outside capital in the future. Warren said the firm had a shell management structure and the SEC should ensure that future settlement agreements cannot be so easily undermined. She asked for a complete list of other individuals or firms who, like Mr. Cohen, were barred from managing funds (or barred from other activities by SEC) yet are presently indirectly involved in those activities with SEC-registered entities.",politicsNews,"April 21, 2016 ",1
U.S. Capitol replacing flag display over Confederate imagery,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A display of U.S. state flags in a tunnel under Washingtons Capitol complex will be replaced because of controversial Confederate symbols on some of the flags, an administrative committee said on Thursday. In its place, in the busy passageway between the Capitol and adjacent office buildings, depictions of commemorative quarters representing the 50 states, the U.S. territories and Washington, D.C., will be installed, said Committee on House Administration Chairwoman Candice Miller. Michigan Republican Representative Miller said in a statement that she decided to replace the display because of the controversy surrounding the Confederate flag, which is widely seen today as a symbol of racism and slavery.  I am well aware of how many Americans negatively view the Confederate flag, and, personally, I am very sympathetic to these views, she said. Lawmakers who choose to hang their home states flags outside their offices may still do so. In this way all state flags are displayed on Capitol Hill, Miller said.   Only the Mississippi state flag still depicts the Confederate battle flag, in the top left corner. Symbols from various Confederate flags are evident in the flags of Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Arkansas. All these states were among those that seceded from the union in 1860-1861 and joined the pro-slavery Confederate States of America that was defeated by the anti-slavery union in the American Civil War. Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who pushed last year for his states flag to be removed from the Capitol, praised Millers announcement as a step toward removing all signs of the Confederate revolt against our own country. Criticism over public display of the Confederate flag  intensified last year after a white man who gunned down nine black churchgoers in South Carolina was pictured on social media with it. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told a weekly news conference that he supports the decision to change the display. It is expected to be installed once renovations of the tunnel are finished later this year. ",politicsNews,"April 21, 2016 ",1
Senators close to proposal on Zika funds: Republican committee chairman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of senators will soon offer a proposal for more funding to fight a Zika outbreak spreading rapidly through the Americas, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran said on Thursday. Democrats and Obama administration officials have urged the Republican-controlled Congress to grant nearly $1.9 billion in emergency funds to combat Zika, a virus borne by mosquitoes that can cause microcephaly, a rare birth defect. But many Republicans have said they need more information from the administration before approving the measure.  In a temporary fix, the White House said earlier this month it would reprogram $589 million of allocated funds, but said this would be insufficient to deal with the threat. Cochran, speaking at an appropriations committee meeting, did not say how much funding would be in the proposal. The Republican said it would supplement the White House reallocation. We recognize that there is an urgency associated with the threat, Cochran said. This proposal will provide new resources ... It is my expectation that this proposal will be offered to an appropriations measure on the Senate floor in the near future. Senator Barbara Mikulski, the senior Democrat on the panel, said lawmakers must act before July 1. We are in a race against the clock, we are in a race with the mosquitoes and right now I would say that the mosquitoes are winning. Zika was first detected in Brazil last year and linked to a spike in the birth defect microcephaly, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can hamper development, as well as the rare autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. U.S. health officials say local outbreaks are possible in the continental United States once the weather warms, particularly in southern states such as Florida. But mosquitoes that carry the virus could spread further north. Cochran said it had been difficult to obtain the information necessary to thoroughly evaluate the Obama administrations Zika funding request, a complaint also raised by Republicans in the House of Representatives.  Several senators, including Democrat Patty Murray and Republican Roy Blunt, are working on the proposal, Cochran said. Blunt told the panel that he and Murray were largely in agreement and he looked forward to working on the matter over the next few days. I believe we are closing in on a number that is the right number, he said, without elaborating. ",politicsNews,"April 21, 2016 ",1

Nearly half Australians shrink at prospect of President Trump: poll,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Nearly half Australian adults would support their country distancing itself from the United States if Donald Trump became U.S. president, a poll suggests, as the New York billionaire tightens his grip on the Republican nomination race. The telephone poll of 1,202 Australian adults found that 45 percent believed the country should distance itself from the U.S. if it elects a president like Donald Trump, said researcher the Lowy Institute, which commissioned the research. Just 51 percent of Australians believed the country should remain close to the United States regardless of who became president in the Nov. 8 election, the lowest level of support in a generation. By allying ourselves with the United States ... we contribute to global security as well as our own, said Lowy Institute executive director Michael Fullilove. That nearly half of Australians would seek to move away from America in the event of a Trump victory says something quite disturbing about the GOP front runner. Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. have been formal allies since signing the ANZUS treaty to protect the Pacific in 1951, and have been allies in most conflicts of the past century. Australia currently has troops in the Middle East to fight Islamic State alongside the United States. The poll by the Lowy Institute, an independent policy think tank based in Sydney, was conducted between Feb. 26 and March 15. It did not offer any insight into how Australians would want to distance themselves from the United States, nor did it specify a Donald Trump presidency - merely a person like Donald Trump becoming president. But Australias sentiment towards the United States under  Trump is weaker than it was under President George W. Bush in 2007, several years into the unpopular Iraq war. In what was considered a dip, 63 percent of Australians regarded the countrys alliance with the United States then as important to Australias security, Lowy said. Just a year ago, 80 percent of Australians said the alliance with the United States was either very or fairly important, Lowy said. ",politicsNews,"April 21, 2016 ",1
"Japan Inc sees damaged security, less U.S. trade in Trump presidency: Reuters poll","TOKYO (Reuters) - Most Japanese firms think a Donald Trump presidency would harm the Japan-U.S. security alliance and make the United States a less attractive place to invest, a Reuters poll showed, in a further sign of international angst about his candidacy. The Republican frontrunner, known for his unpredictable style and fiery rhetoric, would also cause bilateral trade to shrink if he became president, a majority of respondents said. Portraying Japan as a free-rider on security, Trump has suggested that the U.S. ally might need nuclear weapons to ease U.S. financial commitment to its defense - anathema to the only country ever attacked by atomic bombs. Trump has also said he might withdraw U.S. troops from Japan unless it pays more to feed and house the 50,000 it hosts, and he has accused Japan of stealing U.S. jobs. His comments have only fueled simmering worries amongst some Japanese in recent years about whether Washington would defend Tokyo in a crisis under their alliance - the lynchpin of Japans security policy for decades. The Reuters Corporate Survey, conducted April 1-15, found 78 percent of firms thought Japans security environment would deteriorate under Trump. The remainder said it would not change much. Not one firm thought it would improve. The monthly poll surveyed 510 big and mid-size firms. Around 230 answered questions on the U.S. presidential race. In written comments, companies voiced concerns that uncertainty would grow over U.S. diplomacy and that protectionism would rise, with some saying a President Trump would embolden China as it struggles to exert its influence in the South China Sea and other parts of Asia. It is very easy to imagine China taking advantage of the power vacuum to step up military operations in the region, wrote a manager at an electronics maker.   In particular, Tokyo and Beijing have long been at odds over tiny islands claimed by both in the East China Sea. We worry that geopolitical risk would heighten a lot and Sino-Japanese relations would be extremely strained, which could result in a very negative impact on the Japanese economy, the manager added. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to requests for comment. While the possibility of a President Trump has triggered alarm among some foreign diplomats, economists and business executives, he has moved closer to the Republican nomination after winning a commanding victory in New York states presidential nominating contests on Tuesday. Some respondents to the survey said, however, that they see Trumps comments as mere posturing and did not expect any real change in policy even if he won the Nov. 8 election. Managers answered on condition of anonymity in the survey which was conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research. Around 55 percent of firms said that Trump would be bad for business in the United States, that Japanese corporate appetite for investing in the U.S. would wane, and that trade between the two countries would decline. The amount of Japan-U.S. trade has grown by about a quarter in the past two decades to be worth around $215 billion, accounting for 15 percent of Japans overall trade. The United States is Japans No. 2 trading partner after China, while Japan is the United States fourth-largest trading partner. In contrast to Trump, more than 80 percent of Japanese firms believe Democratic Party frontrunner Hillary Clinton would keep a steady hand on economic relations and maintain the status quo on security. The White House has described Trumps suggestions on Japan adopting nuclear arms as destabilizing. Representatives for Clinton did not respond to requests for comment. She would adopt realistic policies. It would lack freshness and stage no surprise, which would be a relief to us, wrote a manager at a construction firm.

Kansas governor eyes tobacco bonds for budget fix,"(Reuters) - Kansas Governor Sam Brownback offered options on Wednesday for dealing with sinking revenue for the states current and next budgets, including the sale of tobacco bonds. With the fiscal 2016 revenue estimated to drop by nearly $94 million and fiscal 2017 revenue expected to be $134.7 million less than previously projected, the Republican governor said Kansas could raise about $158 million through its first sale of bonds backed by its share of a 1998 multi-state settlement with U.S. tobacco companies. Several states and local governments have sold tobacco bonds with some using the proceeds as a one-time boost for their sagging budgets. Brownback said he would also divert $185 million in sales tax revenue slated for the highway fund to the fiscal 2016 and 2017 general fund and continue a 3 percent university funding cut into fiscal 2017. A second budget-balancing option outlined by the governor would delay a fiscal 2016 fourth quarter pension payment until fiscal 2018 instead of selling tobacco bonds. A third option calls for a 3 percent to 5 percent spending cut for most state agencies in the coming fiscal year. I am prepared to take executive action to help reduce expenditures, however, the legislature has a constitutional obligation to balance the budget and we are hopeful they will work with us on one of the three options.., Brownback said in a statement. He added that he does not support a tax hike to patch up the budget.  The Kansas budget is feeling the effects from action taken by Brownback and the Republican-controlled legislature to cut corporate and other income taxes to help the state compete with bordering Missouri and other states for business development and jobs.  Kansas fiscal year begins July 1.  ",politicsNews,"April 21, 2016 ",1
"Obama, Saudi king discuss strained alliance, Middle East conflicts","RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama met Saudi Arabias King Salman on Wednesday to seek joint action on security threats including Iran and Islamic State - and to talk through tensions between the two allies that have been laid bare in recent weeks. Obamas fourth and likely last visit to the worlds top oil exporter has been overshadowed by Gulf Arab exasperation with his approach to the region, and doubts about Washingtons commitment to their security. Most of the Gulf Arab monarchies have in private been sorely disappointed by Obamas presidency, regarding it as a period in which the United States has pulled back from the region, giving more space to their arch rival Iran to expand its influence.  Obama met for two hours with Salman and a group of top princes and officials at the opulent Erga palace, a meeting that had been forecast to be awkward. Obama was recently quoted in a U.S. magazine interview commenting on the complicated nature of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, and describing some some Gulf and European states as free riders who called for U.S. action without doing enough themselves. The White House said the leaders exchanged views on a series of regional conflicts where the allies disagree, and also explored U.S. concerns about Saudi human rights issues.     The two leaders reaffirmed the historic friendship and deep strategic partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia, the White House said in a statement. Obama has spoken of his desire to persuade Gulf states to arrive at a cold peace with Iran that would douse sectarian tensions and allow all sides to focus on what he sees as a greater threat emanating from Islamic State. More broadly, the president and King discussed the challenges posed by Irans provocative activities in the region, agreeing on the importance of an inclusive approach to de-escalating regional conflicts, the White House said. Obama praised the kings pledge of humanitarian aid to Yemen after a Saudi-led military campaign against the Iran-backed Houthi group - and talked about the need to help parts of Iraq hit hard by Islamic State fighting. They also talked about the need to reinforce a cessation of hostilities between Syrian government and opposition forces, and their support for a political transition in the war-torn country, the White House said. The White House did not say whether the leaders had discussed a bill proposed in the U.S. Congress that, if passed, could hold the kingdom responsible for any role in al Qaedas Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The attack was mounted by al Qaeda, then based in Afghanistan. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals, although no U.S. investigation to date has reported finding evidence of Saudi government support for the attacks. Obama has said he opposes the bill because it could expose the United States to lawsuits from citizens of other countries.  LOW-KEY ARRIVAL Obama arrived too late for the pomp of a televised official welcome for Gulf rulers at the airport, making a low-key entrance before being whisked off by helicopter to the palace. He later met privately at his hotel with Abu Dhabis crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan and discussed the need to find a political settlement for the Yemen conflict, and to head off the actions of potential spoilers for Libyas nascent government. Earlier, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter had talks with his Gulf Arab counterparts on ways of countering Iranian influence and fighting the Islamic State group.  They agreed on joint cooperation towards improving Gulf missile defense, special forces and maritime security, but no new deals were announced.  The GCC secretary general said the bloc and the United States would stage joint maritime patrols to stop weapons smuggling to Iran. American officials said these were already taking place and did not represent a new step.          On Thursday, Obama will attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a group of monarchies comprising Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Apart from Oman, they are ruled by Sunni Muslim dynasties who see revolutionary, Shiite Iran as a threat to their security and say its involvement in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen has fueled conflict and deepened sectarian divisions. That tension surfaced again on Wednesday when Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei attacked Riyadhs attempts to isolate its ally, Lebanons Hezbollah movement, in a series of fiery Tweets.  Hezbollah is shining in the Muslim world. It doesnt matter if a corrupt, dependent and hollow government with the use of petrodollars condemns it in a statement. To hell with it, he wrote. The White House shares the view of Gulf Arab states that Tehran plays a destabilizing role, but its push for the nuclear deal Iran agreed with world powers last year caused fears in Riyadh that Washington was not listening to their concerns.

"Regional crises, not human rights, to dominate Obama-Gulf talks","RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama aired his human rights concerns with Saudi Arabias King Salman on Wednesday, but his talking points on that subject are expected to be get less attention when he meets Gulf Arab monarchs on Thursday. Activists have urged the American leader to push Saudi Arabia over its human rights record, but the regions many geopolitical crises are likely to dominate a summit already overshadowed by strained ties between Washington and the Gulf. The president, who arrived on Wednesday, hopes to allay Gulf countries fears over Iranian influence and encourage them to try to douse sectarian tensions in the region in an effort to confront the threat posed by Islamic State.      Most of the Gulf Arab monarchies have in private been sorely disappointed by Obamas presidency, regarding it as a period in which the United States has pulled back from the region, leaving space for their archrival Iran to expand its influence.  Human rights have not figured high on the list of issues straining the relationship. But Saudi Arabia has increasingly chafed at what it sees as a campaign of vilification by Western media, think tanks and rights groups.  Rob Malley, Obamas adviser on the Middle East, said rights issues would be raised, and deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes met human rights advocates at the White House just before the Riyadh visit to hear their concerns. During a two-hour meeting on Wednesday with the Saudi king and a group of top princes, Obama expressed his broad concerns about human rights issues, the White House said, without listing specific cases. But early signs were that disagreements over human rights would be relegated to the margins of Thursdays talks.  Obama has spoken of his desire to persuade Gulf states to arrive at a cold peace with Iran to ease sectarian tensions and allow all sides to focus on what he sees as a greater threat emanating from Islamic State. On Thursday, he will attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups the monarchical states of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Apart from Oman, they are ruled by Sunni Muslim dynasties that see revolutionary, Shiite Iran as a threat to their security and say its involvement in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen has fueled conflict and deepened sectarian divisions.  The White House shares the view of Gulf Arab states that Tehran plays a destabilizing role. But its willingness to enter a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers last year caused fears in Riyadh that Washington was not listening to Gulf Arab concerns.  Riyadh has come under fire in Western countries for its restrictions on women, suppression of freedom of expression,  strict blasphemy rules and a judicial system that applies Islamic law and frequently beheads convicts.  Rights groups are also pushing for Obama to press Saudi Arabia to end the war in Yemen, for which peace talks are due to take place in Kuwait this week, and where air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition have killed many civilians.  I urge you to take this final opportunity to speak out publicly on human rights issues inside the (Saudi) Kingdom,  Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First, a U.S. monitoring and activist group, wrote in an open letter.  Saudi Arabia has said other countries should not interfere in its domestic affairs by criticizing its human rights record. It insists its Islamic legal system is its own business and that its courts are fair and independent.  It says the war in Yemen was in support of its internationally recognized government and aimed at restoring stability. It says it has taken great care to avoid civilian casualties.

Trump tightens grip on U.S. Republican nomination,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Front-runner Donald Trump showed signs of tightening his grip on the Republican U.S. presidential nomination on Wednesday when chief rival Ted Cruz acknowledged his own only hope of wresting control is a contested convention. Trump delivered a crushing defeat of Cruz in Tuesdays New York Republican nominating contest while Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton broke rival Bernie Sanders string of state victories with a definitive win of her own. Rebounding from a defeat in Wisconsin two weeks ago, Trump set himself up for another big night on April 26, when the Northeast U.S. states of Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Maryland hold primaries. Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race, Trump tweeted on Wednesday. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! Trump, 69, predicted some amazing weeks ahead for his campaign. Cruz, at a news conference on the sidelines of a Republican National Committee meeting in Hollywood, Florida, said neither he nor Trump will amass the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination without a contested convention in Cleveland starting on July 18. What is clear today is that we are headed toward a contested convention. Nobody is able to reach 1,237. Im not going to reach 1,237, and Donald Trump is not going to reach 1,237, said Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas. New York boosted Trumps delegate tally to 845, while Cruz has 559 and Kasich 147, according to the Associated Press. Next Tuesdays contests offer 172 delegates for Republicans.  CLINTON LEADS TRUMP -POLL If Trump, a New York billionaire, and Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, go on to secure their respective parties nominations, a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll shows Clinton with a sizeable lead if the Nov. 8 election were held today.   In the latest poll of likely general election voters, 45 percent said they would support Clinton while 35 percent would support Trump if the two were running against each other. The April 15-19 poll surveyed 1,334 people and had a credibility interval of 3.1 percentage points. A former reality TV star, Trump has adopted a more measured tone in recent days and appears to be trying to heal wounds inflicted by a campaign that has alarmed many in the Republican establishment. He sent campaign advisers to the party meeting in Florida that began on Wednesday. Theres only two issues left for Republicans: Will Trump get 50 percent of the delegates prior to Cleveland, and if not, how close will he be? New York gives him a nice boost, but it will take weeks before we know the answer, said Ari Fleischer, who was White House spokesman under President George W. Bush.  Cruz, 45, came in third in New York. Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, a long-shot candidate, sought to use his second-place showing in New York as proof he is emerging as Trumps central challenger. Trump won at least 89 delegates in New York, while Kasich got at least three, according to the AP. Cruz did not win any, prompting Trump adviser Sarah Huckabee Sanders to urge him on CNN on Wednesday to get out of the way once the math of delegate counts makes it impossible for him to prevail. The win by Clinton, 68, makes it nearly impossible for Sanders, 74, to overtake her commanding lead in delegates needed to secure the nomination. Clinton clinched at least 175 out of 291 New York delegates, while Sanders won at least 106, according to the AP. A U.S. senator from Vermont, Sanders has vowed to fight until the Democrats nominating convention in Philadelphia starting on July 25. Democratic strategist Jim Manley said Clinton has the delicate task of trying to attract Sanders supporters drawn to his leftist campaign promises, while switching focus to the task of beating the eventual Republican nominee. She runs a risk. If she goes too far to the left shes going to upset independents and others that shes going to need in the general, Manley said.    ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
Pot legalization group says to meet White House officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Activists in a group supporting marijuana legalization said on Wednesday that White House officials had invited them to a meeting next week to talk about issues surrounding the substance. I hope to establish an ongoing dialogue with the White House and cannabis reformers, said Adam Eidinger, co-founder of the DCMJ activist group.  This meeting is hopefully the beginning of many meetings where the White House will make reforms before this administrations time ends, said Eidinger, who has led efforts to legalize pot in the nations capital.   The White House had no immediate comment. President Barack Obamas final term ends in January.  DCMJ had written to Obama, his senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and other White House officials asking for a meeting. A source at the group said the meeting on Monday would be held with officials from the White Houses Office of Public Engagement, but he did not know exactly what marijuana issues they wanted to discuss.  The group wants the federal government to remove marijuana from the so-called list of Schedule One drugs that includes substances like heroin and cocaine. Activists say many Americans, especially blacks and Latinos, are needlessly jailed and medical research into cannabis is delayed because of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act that initiated the listing. It was signed into law by former President Richard Nixon. Obama has long said he supports decriminalizing marijuana but not legalizing it. He has called for reform of the criminal justice system for disproportionately incarcerating African-Americans for non-violent drug offenses like possession. Last year, Obama, who has been open about smoking pot in high school, said young people should care more about issues like climate change than legalizing the substance.

Republican establishment warms to Trump after big New York win,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican officials began meeting on Wednesday, a day after Donald Trumps crushing victory in a New York presidential nominating contest, and said he has been winning growing acceptance within their ranks - but they want to see the billionaire do more to mend fences with the party establishment. Trump, the front-runner to become the Republican presidential candidate in Novembers election, was the focus for the partys spring meeting of 168 Republican National Committee (RNC) members in Hollywood, Florida. The three-day conclave at an oceanside resort will take stock of the race for the White House and prepare for a possible contested convention in July in Cleveland. The New York real estate moguls win Tuesday in his home state over rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich was an important milestone for RNC members, who said it could put him on a pathway to acquire the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright without a contested convention.  There are a fair number of RNC members who were discounting his chances of success when we met in January and now see that hes building a substantial lead and may in fact get to 1,237 before we get to the convention, said Steve Duprey, an RNC member from New Hampshire. The New York results were such an overwhelming win, Duprey said. Its impressive. Thats what Ive heard people talking about. RNC members said Trump could help improve the climate by taking steps to end the bad blood that has developed between him and the committees leadership, including RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. Trump has said that Cruzs harvest of delegates in Colorado, where rank-and-file Republicans did not vote or caucus, showed that the partys nominating process is rigged. He has wondered whether Priebus, who is popular with the RNC ranks, should continue in his job if Trump is the nominee. I think its time for that rhetoric to end, said Jeff Essmann, chairman of the Montana Republican Party. Bob Kapel, the RNC member representing Washington, D.C., noted that Trump had toned down his rhetoric in his New York victory speech on Tuesday night, and said he would like to see that continue. Kapel is a delegate for former candidate Marco Rubio and now backs Ohio Governor John Kasich. Nevertheless, Kapel said of Trump and the Republicans: Were about winning the White House. Obviously, I have issues with him, but our nominee will be our nominee. South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore said Trumps recent hiring of Rick Wiley, a Republican veteran who was former presidential candidate Scott Walkers campaign manager, was a good sign. Its a positive signal despite a lack of general outreach over the past year, and I think the Trump campaign, for all the bluster, recognizes that the RNC will be an integral partner if he is the nominee and itll be almost impossible to win the presidency without the RNC as a partner, Moore said. In a good sign for Trump, there appeared to be no significant move by the Republican leadership, at least at this meeting, to change the rules governing the convention. There has been talk of rewriting the rules in a way that could benefit an establishment-backed candidate like Kasich. Trump, Cruz and Kasich all sent envoys to the meeting to explain their pathways to the nomination. A source familiar with the situation said Wiley and other Trump representatives were meeting with Republican officials from the five Northeastern states that will hold primary elections next Tuesday: Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maryland. Cruzs campaign manager, Jeff Roe, held a closed-door briefing with RNC members to explain how Cruz would be a better Republican nominee than Trump, saying the U.S. senator from Texas would energize the partys grassroots supporters. Roe dismissed talk that Cruz might now be in trouble. Cruzs pathway to the nomination is now almost entirely dependent on forcing a contested convention and winning the nomination on the second or third ballot. Theres going to be ebbs and flows to this campaign, Roe told reporters. This campaign is going through (the last primary elections on June 7 and likely to the convention.

Trump leans toward replacing Fed chief if he wins White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump would be inclined to replace Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen if he wins the White House despite supporting the U.S. central banks efforts to keep interest rates low, he told Fortune magazine. I think shes done a serviceable job, Trump said in an interview published late on Tuesday, as the billionaire real estate mogul moved a step closer to becoming his partys nominee with a resounding win in New York states Republican nominating contest.  I dont want to comment on reappointment, but I would be more inclined to put other people in. Yellen was nominated for the top Fed job by Democratic President Barack Obama, and began her four-year term in February 2014. Nominees need Senate approval, after which they are protected from political interference until their terms expire. In his interview, Trump said he absolutely backed efforts to diminish the Feds power and allow Congress to launch so-called audits, or outside reviews, of its policy decisions. He also backed away from his pledge to erase the more than $19 trillion in U.S. debt in eight years. Representatives for the Fed declined to comment on the report.  Were Yellen to step down in 2018 after only one term, it would be the shortest Fed chairmanship since 1979. Since then, Fed chairs from Paul Volcker to Alan Greenspan to Ben Bernanke, Yellens predecessor, were reappointed by at least one incoming U.S. president.  Trump said he favored the low interest rate environment and that raising rates would be a blow to the U.S. economy. Trump had accused the Fed in November of keeping rates low to help Obama, an assertion the White House rejected. The best thing we have going for us is that interest rates are so low, the New York billionaire businessman told Fortune.  If rates are 3 percent or 4 percent or whatever, you start adding that kind of number to an already reasonably crippled economy in terms of what we produce, that number is a very scary number, Trump added. The Fed cut its key overnight lending rate to near zero in late 2008 and kept it there for the next seven years to help the economy recover from the financial crisis. It raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point last December, its first hike in nearly a decade. Trump told Fortune he would take advantage of lower rates to refinance the countrys debt and boost government spending on infrastructure and the military. The magazine will publish a full transcript of the interview later this week.  He moved away from comments he made to the Washington Post earlier this month pledging to eliminate the national debt over a period of eight years. Instead, Trump told Fortune he could tackle a portion of it. You could pay off a percentage of it, depending on how aggressive you want to be, he said. Id rather not be all that aggressive. Id rather not have debt, but were stuck with it.  Trumps main Republican rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, has said he would audit the Fed and move it to a rules-based monetary policy. Other U.S. presidential candidates, including Democrat Bernie Sanders, have also pledged to change the Fed. ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2016 ",1

Lawmakers may ask Air Force to look at restarting F-22 production,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee is planning to ask the Air Force to assess the cost and feasibility of restarting production of Lockheed Martin Corps F-22 fighter jet in the face of greater security threats around the world. The radar-evading jets formally entered service in December 2005, but then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates canceled the program in 2009 amid efforts to control Pentagon spending and orient the department toward the wars it was then fighting. Only 187 of the stealthy, high-tech jet fighters were produced, about a quarter of the 749 originally planned. The last was delivered to the Air Force in 2012. In its portion of the National Defense Authorization Act, the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces has included a provision directing the Air Force secretary to carry out a comprehensive study of the cost of resuming production of the F-22. Congressman Mike Turner, chairman of the subcommittee, said restarting production should be considered because of threats to U.S. air superiority. As a result of our adversaries closing the technology gap, and increasing demand from allies and partners for high-performance, multi-role aircraft to meet evolving and worsening global security threats, the committee believes that the prospect of restarting the F-22 production line is worthy of further exploration, Turner said in a statement on Wednesday. The committee is asking for the report by Jan. 1, 2017. Consideration of the NDAA, the annual defense policy bill, is still in its early stages. The defense bill must be approved by the House Armed Services Committee, the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate before going to the president for his signature. Gates decision to halt the F-22 fighter jet sparked criticism from some lawmakers, but was ultimately upheld by Congress. Lawmakers argued that Air Force studies have shown the military needs more of the high-end fighters to be ready for conflicts with other major powers. The last four F-22 aircraft produced cost about $150 million each. In August, the United States said it would deploy F-22 fighter jets to Europe as a part of a broader effort to support eastern European members of the NATO alliance that have been unnerved by Russias intervention in Ukraine. The Air Force has also been using the aircraft to carry out attacks against Islamic State. ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2016 ",1
Oklahoma can consider PTSD in sentencing veterans under proposed law,"OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - An Oklahoma bill that allows judges to take into consideration a diagnosis of PTSD for veterans unanimously passed the state Senate on Tuesday, adding to a series of U.S. laws seeking to address mental illness among military veterans. Oklahoma House Bill 2595 allows judges to take into account a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a mitigating factor when sentencing veterans who have been diagnosed with the illness. The bill, which now goes to the governor for a decision on approval, follows similar measures in states including Alaska and California.  This is neither a Democratic or Republican issue, but just something we should have for veterans, said state Representative Richard Morrissette, a sponsor of the legislation and a Democrat in the Republican-dominated Oklahoma legislature. We train men and women to defend our nation in combat and then we expect, upon their return to civilian life, the trauma experienced by these individuals to be erased from their psyche. That is an unreasonable and unfair expectation, he said. State data shows that compared to other states, Oklahoma has a higher percentage of veterans who have been deployed in danger areas overseas. More than 63 percent of the Oklahoma National Guard was deployed as of 2014 to Iraq or Afghanistan, and more than a third were deployed multiple times, the data showed. According to the National Institutes of Health, the United States had 161 bills that dealt with PTSD in 2014 and 43 traumatic stress, non-PTSD bills.  In 2014, California allowed courts to consider PTSD, sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury or mental health problems as a mitigating factor in granting probation and treatment instead of jail time, it said. In 2014, Alaska passed the first law allowing judges to consider PTSD as a mitigating factor during the sentencing of veterans, it said. ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2016 ",1

War of words with pope no issue for Trump backers: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Support for Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump among his partys church-going Catholics has risen since Pope Francis suggested the U.S. businessman was not a real Christian, a Reuters/Ipsos poll shows. Trump has averaged support among 47.9 percent of Catholic Republicans in the 50 days since the leader of the worlds 1.2 billion Roman Catholics made the comment on Feb. 18, up from 39.8 percent in the 50 days that preceded it. Their brief tiff is one of a series of controversies that have failed to dent the New York billionaires popularity, including his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, his insults to women, and his plans to wall off Mexico if elected president on Nov. 8. The Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,117 church-going Catholic Republicans had a credibility interval of 4.8 percentage points. Asked about plans for a wall on the border with Mexico, the pope said in February: A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. A papal spokesman later said the pontiff was in no way singling out Trump or trying to sway voters. The blunt candidate, after initially saying it was disgraceful for the pope to judge anothers faith in God, said Francis was a nice man who was probably misinterpreted by the media.  Catholics are a sizable U.S. voting bloc, comprising about a quarter of the electorate, says Georgetown Universitys Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. Catholics nearly evenly split their presidential votes between Republicans and Democrats, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.  Part of the increase in Trumps support among Catholics is likely related to the dwindling number of Republican White House candidates, a field that has dropped from 12 in January to three - the Presbyterian Trump, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Southern Baptist, and Ohio Governor John Kasich, an Anglican. But Mark Gray, a senior research associate at Georgetown, said the results also showed that Catholics who heard the popes message about Trump were not swayed. Many Catholics probably felt that the popes comments were not a directive on how they should vote or who they should support, and still others may never have been aware of the popes comments to begin with, he said. While opinion polls have shown few U.S. Catholics think it necessary to agree with the pope on every issue to be a faithful Church member, a Washington Post-ABC poll last September showed the pope had an 86 percent favorability rating. Father William Paul McKane, a Catholic priest in rural Montana who supports Trump, said he felt the popes comments had backfired with his flock. I call it paradoxical, to put it gently, that the pope said that, when he lives behind walls that are about 40 feet high and 40 feet across, he said, referring to the walls around Vatican City. That comment hurt his credibility with my parishioners. McKane said he appreciates Trumps speaking plainly about issues like security and the economy - issues he said were in line with Christian values of protecting the innocent - even if he dislikes some of the candidates more fiery comments. Trumps verbiage does not sound compassionate, McKane said. I dont hold him up as a paragon of Christian virtue, but Im not looking for that in a candidate. Im looking for someone who is prudent and can make good political decisions. While support for Trump among ordinary Catholic Republicans is high - roughly equal to that among Republicans as a whole - the small sums of money flowing to the candidates from Christian priests, bishops, pastors and other clergy of all denominations tend to favor the evangelical Cruz. Cruz received $155,500 in contributions from about 380 members of the Christian clergy who each gave above the $200 reporting threshold through February, compared with about $700 from 10 people for Trump and $3,500 from nine people for Kasich. McKane is the only contributor listed in Trumps campaign finance disclosures who identified himself as a Catholic priest, based on a Reuters review. On the Democratic side, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont - the only Jewish candidate - has received some $85,400 from about 280 people ordained for religious duty in the church, compared with about $192,500 from about 250 individuals for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  Clinton polls much better among church-going Catholic Democrats, with 67.8 percent support, compared to Sanders 29.3 percent, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, despite Sanders bid to liken his view to the popes, especially on wealth inequality and climate change. Sanders and the pope met briefly on Saturday at the Vatican, where Sanders addressed a conference on social justice.  ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmaker wants hearing on bill to curb shell company abuse,"(Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker has called for a congressional committee to hold a hearing on legislation that would make it easier for law enforcement to identify legal owners of shell companies to curb future abuse. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, made the request in a letter dated April 20 to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas.  The letter, seen by Reuters, came weeks after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists worked with media outlets including The Guardian and BBC to report on 11.5 million leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca.  The documents contained information on about 214,000 offshore companies and showed how individuals and corporations were able to hide assets and avoid taxes. The documents have come to be known as the Panama Papers. Maloney wrote in a letter that data from the leak also highlight the ease with which criminals and corrupt officials can use anonymous shell companies to hide assets from law enforcement.  A spokeswoman for Rep. Hensarling did not respond to a request for comment. It is important to remember that for individuals and companies that have been blacklisted by the U.S. government, anonymous shell companies are one of the only ways for them to effectively move their money around the world - money that is often associated with corruption, drug trafficking, and even terrorist activity, Maloney said in the letter. In February, Maloney and Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, reintroduced legislation that would require the U.S. Treasury Department to collect information about owners of shell companies, in the event that states are not already doing so. Another version of the bill, sponsored by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, would require states to identify and collect information about legal owners of companies formed through state laws. In an April 14 letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, Whitehouse also called for a hearing. Neither Maloney nor the Whitehouse have authority to schedule hearings. Earlier versions have been circulating in Congress since at least 2008 when then-Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, sought to crack down on shell company abuse in states with liberal incorporation laws. States have fiercely opposed efforts that would require them to collect identifying information, calling for the Internal Revenue Service to do so instead, among other alternatives. Separately, the Treasury Department inched closer on Friday toward finalizing a rule requiring banks to identify legal owners of shell companies. ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2016 ",1
'Reality' of 9/11 report less damaging than rumors: U.S. Democrat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee called on Wednesday for the release of part of a government report on the Sept. 11 attacks, saying this would diminish speculation that the 28 pages contained proof of Saudi involvement. The release of these pages will not end debate over the issue, but it will quiet rumors over their contents, Representative Adam Schiff, the intelligence panels ranking Democrat, said in a statement. As is often the case, the reality is less damaging than the uncertainty. The still-classified section of the official report on the 2001 attacks is central to a dispute over whether Americans should be able to sue the Saudi Arabian government for damages. The Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence is reviewing the material to see whether it can be declassified. Congressional aides said members of the House intelligence committee had seen the report. President Barack Obama, who was visiting Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, said he would not sign legislation making its way through Congress that would allow such lawsuits, if the Saudis were found to have any responsibility. Schiff has repeatedly called for the declassification of the 28-page report section. In his statement on Wednesday, he suggested the release of a redacted version to help address speculation that they contained proof of official Saudi government or senior Saudi officials involvement in the attacks. The 9/11 commission investigated those claims and never found sufficient evidence to support them, Schiff said. ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2016 ",1
"Senate passes bill to bolster power grid, speed LNG exports","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate passed the first broad energy bill in nine years on Wednesday, legislation containing modest measures popular with both Republicans and Democrats to modernize the power grid and speed the permitting process for liquefied natural gas exports.  The bill, which passed 85-12, attempts to protect the power grid from extreme weather events such as ice storms and hurricanes, and from cyber attacks. It also aims to spur innovations in storage of power from wind and solar energy. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill last year. The Energy Policy and Modernization Act would increase U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), eventually helping to give European consumers alternatives to relying mainly on Russia for gas.    After disagreements held the bill up for months, senators last week dropped measures from the bill to aid Flint, Michigan overcome a drinking water crisis, in which children have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead, and on offshore drilling.   Lawmakers from both the House and Senate will next iron out differences over the bill. The Senate bill, for instance, requires the Department of Energy to issue a decision on LNG projects within 45 days of an environmental assessment, while the House bill directs the DOE to make the decision on permits after 30 days. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state who co-sponsored the bill, said shortly before it passed that she hoped the chambers would move quickly so that we can realize the opportunity to help our businesses and consumers plan for the energy future.  The White House has signaled that President Barack Obama would sign the Senate bill.  Energy policy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners said the chances the bill would be signed into law this year were about 65 percent, because the White House has had some differences with the House bill.  Charlie Riedl, the head of industry group the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, said the vote was a big step forward and that certainty about the regulatory process is crucial for projects that cost billions of dollars to build.  Rob Cowin, director of government affairs at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group, said the bill falls far short of what is needed to promote wind and solar power, but is better than doing nothing. The Senate on Tuesday passed several amendments to the bill, including restricting most sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil prices are low. ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2016 ",1
Supreme Court upholds Arizona legislative districts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously upheld the state legislative districts in Arizona drawn by an independent commission, rebuffing complaints that the electoral maps diminished the clout of Republican voters. The court, in its 8-0 ruling, said the commission that draws legislative boundaries did not violate the U.S. Constitutions principle of one person, one vote. The case focused on state legislative districts drawn for the 2012 election based on 2010 census numbers. The challengers said the new districts favored Democrats over Republicans by packing Republican voters into certain districts in a way that would minimize their influence in neighboring districts while enhancing the sway of Democratic voters. In mapping out the state legislative districts, Arizonas independent commission carries out a function that in most other states is handled by state legislators.  Writing for the court, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the deviations in numbers between district populations was not significant enough to be legally troubling, particularly as the states redistricting commission was trying to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters. The challengers have not shown that it is more probable than not that illegitimate considerations were the predominant motivation behind the plans deviations from mathematically equal district populations, Breyer wrote. A federal court in Arizona upheld the districts in a 2014 ruling, saying the commission had made a good faith attempt to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The group of Republican voters who brought the case then appealed the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court. The case was the second in as many years concerning Arizonas independent commission. In June 2015, the court rejected another challenge to the commissions role in drawing congressional districts. In that decision, the court found that the ballot initiative that set up the commission did not violate the U.S. Constitutions requirement that state legislatures set U.S. House of Representatives district boundaries. Wednesdays ruling was the second by the court this month touching upon the issue of one person, one vote. On April 4, the justices also ruled unanimously in a Texas case to uphold the method all 50 states use in drawing legislative districts by counting every resident and not just eligible voters. In that case, the justices rejected a conservative challenge that could have diminished the influence of urban Hispanics. The case is Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-232. ",politicsNews,"April 20, 2016 ",1

Contested convention chances down after Trump takes NY: PredictIt,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chances of a contested Republican presidential convention slid to their lowest in more than three weeks on Wednesday after Donald Trump swept to a critical victory in New Yorks primary, according to PredictIt, an online market for placing bets on U.S. and world politics. With Trump netting most of the states 95 delegates and further solidifying his front-runner status, the probability of a contested, or brokered, Republican convention dropped to 50 percent Wednesday morning, down 2 points from Tuesdays closing level, according to data from PredictIt, which is run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand.  That is the lowest level since March 28 and some 29 percentage points below its peak in early April, after rival Ted Cruz crushed Trump in the Wisconsin primary and went to win all 14 Wyoming delegates last weekend. Ohio Governor John Kasich, who came in second in New York, remains a long-shot candidate. Tuesdays outcome in New York could provide a critical turning point for Trumps momentum. In fact, the chances of his clinching the Republican nomination have been increasing steadily. By Wednesday morning, the probability reached 63 percent, after an early April slump to 36 percent. To win the nomination outright, Trump must line up 1,237 delegates before the Republican Partys convention in July. If he fails to do so, party leaders may face the prospect of negotiating a compromise candidate there. The next test comes on April 26, when five northeastern states hold their primaries.

Apple refused China request for source code in last two years: lawyer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has been asked by Chinese authorities within the last two years to hand over its source code but refused, the companys top lawyer told lawmakers on Tuesday in response to U.S. law enforcement criticism of its stance on technology security. The congressional testimony highlighted an issue at the heart of a heated disagreement between Apple and the FBI over unlocking encrypted data from an iPhone linked to last Decembers San Bernardino, California shootings - how much private technology companies should cooperate with governments. Law enforcement officials have attempted to portray Apple as possibly complicit in handing over information to Chinas government for business reasons while refusing to cooperate with U.S. requests for access to private data in criminal cases. I want to be very clear on this, Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell told Tuesdays hearing under oath. We have not provided source code to the Chinese government. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, asked about the comments, said she did not understand details of the situation. She did not elaborate. Chinas Public Security Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Apple has previously denied the accusation as a smear originating from the U.S. Department of Justices effort to force Apple to help unlock the iPhone 5c used by one of the two  San Bernardino killers, who were inspired by Islamist militants. The claim resurfaced in the hearing called by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee to examine potential common ground between law enforcement and the technology sector in the  encryption debate, though more than three hours of testimony yielded little clear agreement. Captain Charles Cohen, commander in the Indiana State Police, repeated the suggestion that Apple has quietly cooperated with Beijing, which strictly regulates technology in exchange for access to its market.  But when pressed by Representative Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, for the source of that claim, Cohen only cited news reports. That takes my breath away, a visibly frustrated Eshoo said. That is a huge allegation. The Justice Department had argued in the San Bernardino case that it would be willing to demand Apple turn over source code that underlies its products, though at the time it only sought the companys cooperation in writing new software that would disable the passcode protections on the phone. Technology and security experts have said that if the U.S. government was able to obtain Apples source code with a conventional court order, other governments would demand equal rights to do the same thing. After winning a court order in February, the Federal Bureau of Investigation dropped its case against Apple last month when it said it had found a third party entity to help investigators hack into the iPhone used by gunman Rizwan Farook. On Tuesday, Apple and the FBI were making a second appearance in Congress since March to testify over law enforcement access to encrypted devices, a decades-old dispute between Silicon Valley and Washington that gained renewed life from the San Bernardino case. While that standoff underscored national security concerns posed by advances in technology security, the growing use of strong default encryption on mobile devices and communications by criminal suspects is handicapping investigators ability to pursue routine cases, law enforcement officials told the hearing. Apple and other companies defend the technology as integral to protecting consumers. The FBI relies heavily on the services and specialized skills that we can only get through the private industry, and that partnership is critical to our success, testified FBI technology official Amy Hess. Separately, the tech advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation sued the Justice Department in San Francisco federal court on Tuesday, seeking to force the disclosure of any secret orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that may have forced companies such as Apple or Google to decrypt communications.   Thomas Galati, chief of intelligence at the New York Police Department, said his investigators had been unable to open 67  Apple devices from October 2015 to March 2016. Those phones were implicated in 44 violent crimes 23 felonies, including 10 homicides, two rapes, and the shooting of an officer, Galati said. The government has redoubled its efforts to use the courts to force Apples cooperation in cracking encrypted iPhones by announcing plans to continue with an appeal in a New York drug case. The secrecy surrounding the method used on the San Bernardino phone has prompted criticism from security researchers who said Apple and others should be made aware of the flaw, in accordance with a White House vulnerabilities review process that favors disclosure. But Obama administration sources have told Reuters the group that helped unlock the device has sole ownership of the method, making it highly unlikely the technique would be disclosed by the government to Apple or anyone else. I dont think relying on a third party is a good model,  Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, the committees top Democrat, said at the hearing. ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
Senator Hatch raps House's Puerto Rico debt bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A high-ranking Republican senator on Tuesday dismissed as not satisfactory draft legislation aimed at addressing Puerto Ricos fiscal crisis before a looming debt default on May 1, deepening intraparty divisions on the complex rescue effort.   Orrin Hatch of Utah, who chairs the powerful Senate Finance Committee, told reporters that draft legislation introduced this month by the House Natural Resources Committee is not satisfactory and its not going to work.And were not going to be able to pass it over here in the Senate. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow Republican leaders already were struggling to advance a bill to help Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, deal with its crippling $70 billion debt. Their efforts have been complicated by opposition from some conservative lawmakers, even as they have been negotiating with the Obama administration over details.   Some conservative House Republicans, who want to protect creditors rights, have balked at an element of the bill that could allow Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, a so-called cram-down debt restructuring.    Hatch, too, wants to protect creditors, but said the bill must include cram-down authority to ensure that more senior bondholders, like those holding Puerto Ricos constitutionally backed public debt, are better protected.   Lets face it, youve got to protect the preferred creditors. If you dont do that, I mean, youre violating the rule of law to begin with, Hatch said, adding that he is working on a different approach to the legislation.   The internal division showcases the complexity of the task facing lawmakers - to keep Puerto Ricos economy intact, while also protecting the competing interests of 18 classes of bondholders owed money by the island.    In a brief interview with Reuters on Tuesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop expressed confidence that once rank-and-file House Republicans familiarize themselves with his bill, it will gain momentum. He added that bondholders and other players were beginning to contact lawmakers to talk up the legislation.   Time is of the essence. Puerto Ricos Government Development Bank owes creditors $422 million on May 1, a payment the islands governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said it cannot afford. A default at GDB, the primary liquidity source for most of Puerto Ricos public agencies, would be the islands most significant default to date. The bill would also create a federal board to oversee Puerto Ricos finances, but legislators are debating how much power it should have.   Hatch on Tuesday said an oversight board would need the power to resolve the problems.   If you dont give them the power to do that, its just another bailout, he said. Well be back here two years from now. Hector Negroni, a prominent municipal finance investor, objects to the draft bill, saying it changes the rules under which debt was sold to investors and puts creditors at the bottom of the pile while ignoring the priority of payments.  That pivot will have a more adverse affect on the municipal bond market than any potential default in Puerto Rico, Negroni said on Saturday, in a panel discussion held by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Washington.  So we have a framework here which doesnt help Puerto Rico, harms the state and local marketplaces by risking an expectation and change in the rules and raising borrowing costs, he said. So if it is not for Puerto Rico, and it is not for state and local governments, Im not sure who this bill is for.   Representative Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday that the bill is falling victim to intra-party divisions among Republicans. Hoyer said Republicans should collaborate with Democrats to advance a bill by next week that would need the support of only 40-50 of the Houses 246 Republicans.  That would be a dangerous political step for Speaker Ryan, however, because he would be turning his back on a majority of members of his own political party on a major piece of legislation during an election year.  For now, Republicans seem to be at risk of not doing it at all, Hoyer said, referring to a Puerto Rico debt relief bill. (The story is refiled to clarify that Negroni spoke on Saturday, not Friday, paragraph 15) ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
Senior U.S. lawmakers want India PM Modi to address U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee called on Tuesday for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address a joint meeting of Congress during a visit to Washington in June. Given the depth of our relationship with India across a range of areas - defense, humanitarian and disaster relief, space cooperation, conservation and innovation - we believe this is an ideal opportunity for the Congress to hear directly from the prime minister,Representatives Ed Royce, the Republican committee chairman, and Eliot Engel, the panels ranking Democrat, wrote to House Speaker Paul Ryan. The invitation would be a sharp turnaround for a leader who was once barred from the United States over massacres of Muslims. A spokeswoman for Ryan said she had no announcement at this time about whether Ryan would extend the invitation. Invitations to address the Senate and House are considered a great honor. There have been only two in the past year: Pope Francis, on Sept. 24, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on April 29, 2015. When Modis Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies swept Indias elections in 2014, there initially were questions about whether he would qualify for a visa. President Barack Obama quickly dismissed the issue by inviting him to the White House when he called to congratulate him on his victory. In 2002, when Modi had just become Gujarats chief minister, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots in the state. The administration of President George W. Bush denied Modi a visa in 2005 under a 1998 U.S. law barring entry to foreigners who have committed particularly severe violations of religious freedom. Modi denied any wrongdoing. Indias Supreme Court ruled in 2010 he had no case to answer. Washington sees its relationship with India as critical, partly to counterbalance Chinas rising power. Obama has called it one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century. The letter to Ryan was also signed by Republican Representative George Holding and Democrat Ami Bera, the co-chairmen of the Congress Caucus on India and Indian Americans.

"On Oklahoma bombing anniversary, a pitch for Garland for Supreme Court","(Reuters) - Victim advocates and former prosecutors used the anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing on Tuesday to lobby the U.S. Senate on behalf of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, who oversaw the prosecution of bomber Timothy McVeigh. The group, which also includes law enforcement officials, said in a letter to Senate leaders that Garland, a federal appeals court judge picked by President Barack Obama for the Supreme Court, is a man of integrity and brilliance who proved his mettle in obtaining the conviction of McVeigh. Twenty years ago, the nation could not find a better lawyer to manage the investigation and prosecution of what was then the worst crime ever committed on American soil. Today, our nation could not find a better judge, nor a more honorable man, to join its highest court, the group of 15 connected to Garland through the case said in the letter. It was the latest effort by Garland supporters to put pressure on the Republican-led Senate to act on his nomination to fill a vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans who control the Senate are refusing to advance the nomination, prompting Democrats to accuse them of obstructionism and of ignoring their constitutional obligations. Republicans insist the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office Jan. 20, fill the vacancy, hoping a Republican will win the White House and choose a conservative rather than the centrist Garland. McVeigh used a fuel and fertilizer bomb to turn Oklahoma Citys Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building into a tomb of rubble on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people.  More than 680 people were injured in the attack. McVeigh was later executed.  In the letter that included former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, Garlands boss at the time of the McVeigh trial, the group credited him with running an intricate and complex operation to secure a conviction that would stand up to any sort of appeal. The pressure to get it right was unyielding  and Judge Garlands support was critical. He was not just a supervisor; he was a mentor, a counselor, and a friend, the letter said. In Oklahoma City on Tuesday, the remembrance ceremony was held in a church near the blast site and marked with prayers and 168 seconds of silence for the victims.  ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
"U.S. judge approves court, police accord for Ferguson, Missouri","(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday approved an agreement between the U.S. Justice Department and Ferguson, Missouri, to reform the citys police department, a pact prompted by the 2014 shooting of an unarmed black teenager that sparked violent protests. U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry of Missouris Eastern District approved the 129-page accord, which also outlines the revamping of the St. Louis suburbs municipal law code. The Justice Department and Ferguson recognize that the ability of a police department to protect the community it serves is only as strong as the relationship it has with that community, the consent decree signed by Perry said. The agreement requires Ferguson police officers to undergo bias-awareness training and the department must implement an accountability system. The city also agreed that police must ensure that stop, search and arrest practices do not discriminate on the basis of race or other factors protected under law. The largely black community of Ferguson erupted into violent protests in 2014 after a grand jury chose not to indict white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old African-American Michael Brown. The city council in Ferguson approved the agreement in March after receiving assurances from the Justice Department that it would work with Ferguson to ensure it would not cripple city finances. A number of U.S. cities have entered into police reform pacts, including Seattle, Washington and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The decree came the day that a white St. Louis police officer shot and killed a black carjacking suspect about 10 miles (16 km) southeast of Ferguson. St. Louis Metropolitan Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters the suspect pointed a gun at officers and one opened fire. No officers were injured and there was no dash camera in the police cruiser, he said. ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
UnitedHealth plans to exit Obamacare exchanges,"(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc on Tuesday said it would largely exit the Obamacare individual insurance market in 2017, citing expectations for mounting losses from the program. UnitedHealth is the largest U.S. health insurer and one of the biggest sellers of plans on the exchanges, which were created as part of President Barack Obamas national healthcare law. UnitedHealth sells these plans in 34 states this year, up from 25 states last year. Next year, we will remain in only a handful of states, UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said in prepared remarks as part of the companys first-quarter earnings report.  The company warned investors late last year that it was losing money on the new plans and might exit the market. On Tuesday, the company raised its 2016 expectation for losses on the exchanges by $125 million to $650 million. UnitedHealths Hemsley said that the shorter term, higher risk profile of the new members, as well as the smaller than expected enrollment, suggested UnitedHealth could not offer plans on a sustained basis.  For the first quarter, United Healths profit was better-than-expected and UnitedHealth shares rose 1.9 percent to $130.29 in early New York Stock Exchange trading.  Other health insurers including Aetna Inc and Anthem Inc are also large players on the exchanges. In recent months they said they will continue to sell exchange plans.  The company has 795,000 customers from the exchanges, more than half of them new to UnitedHealth, it said. It expects about 650,000 members by year end.  The government said in February that more than 12 million people had signed up for Obamacare-related insurance through HealthCare.gov or a state-based exchange as of Jan. 31. Previous government expectations had been for more than 20 million people. UnitedHealth raised its expectations for 2016 profit, in part because of a more favorable tax rate that also helped it beat Wall Street expectations for the first quarter. Lower sales and administrative costs and a decline in amortization of intangible assets also helped its first quarter results. On an adjusted basis the health insurer earned $1.81 per share, compared with Wall Street analyst expectations for earnings of $1.72 per share, according to ThomsonReuters I/B/E/S. Net profit rose to $1.61 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $1.41 billion or $1.46 per share, a year earlier.  The company now expects 2016 adjusted net earnings of $7.75-$7.95 per share, up 15 cents per share from its previous estimate.    ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
UnitedHealth's Obamacare exit adds pricing pressure on rivals,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Incs decision to exit most of its Obamacare health insurance exchanges next year means rivals will need to raise prices further to prop up an unprofitable business, healthcare analysts and policy experts said on Tuesday. The largest U.S. health insurers move would likely reduce consumer choices, particularly in states where UnitedHealth has been one of only a handful of players to offer insurance under President Barack Obamas healthcare law, they said. Large pullbacks by providers like Anthem Inc and Aetna Inc are unlikely as they each await approval from the administration for proposed merger deals with smaller rivals, some analysts said. Spokespeople for Aetna and Anthem declined to comment on Tuesday. UnitedHealth is one of the biggest sellers of Obamacare plans, offering them in 34 states in 2016. The company warned in November that it was losing too much money on the business due to low enrollment and high service costs. On Tuesday, it said it would exit all but a handful of those markets. Many of the estimated 650,000 UnitedHealth plan members at the end of 2016 would need to find another insurer. You will see significant rate increases for 2017 as the (health) plans try to figure out what is a premium at which (they) can make money, said Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at research firm Avalere Health.  The government provides income-based tax credits to most exchange users, which would help soften the blow from any higher premiums, she said. In terms of viability of the exchanges, I dont think that this is going to affect that in the long term, said Yevgeniy Feyman, deputy director of health policy at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. Even if other insurers decided to leave, he said, he could not envision the exchanges being so unprofitable that they ceased to work. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation study found UnitedHealths departure would leave only one insurer in 29 percent of the 1,855 counties where it offered health plans. The report found that if United had not participated in the exchanges in 2016, the national weighted average benchmark silver plan would have been about 1 percent higher in 2016. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which provides tax credits to help uninsured individuals buy medical coverage. They have said it creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and have warned that insurers would be left to cover sicker and older individuals. U.S. health insurers including Aetna and Anthem have also lost money on the exchanges, but have not said they would exit. The Obama administration estimates more than 12 million people signed up for private insurance on the exchanges for 2016. Insurers are in the midst of submitting proposed premium rates for 2017 ahead of mid-May deadlines set by state exchanges and insurance regulators. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini has questioned whether the Obamacare business was sustainable, but said he was working with the government to improve it. Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish has said that the company was committed to the exchanges. I would still be surprised if other major insurers followed Uniteds lead. United was in some sense in a category all its own, Kaiser Family Foundation Senior Vice President Larry Levitt said.  Health plans sold to individual members represented a small part of UnitedHealths revenue compared to large-scale contracts with employers, while Aetna and Anthem both had substantial business serving individuals. Aetna and Anthem are undergoing a U.S. Department of Justice review of what would be an historic consolidation in the health insurance industry. Aetna has proposed buying rival Humana Inc, while Anthem has agreed to buy Cigna Corp. ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
U.S. House committee votes to smooth e-cigarette regulatory path,"(Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee on Tuesday approved an amendment to an agricultural funding bill that would make it easier for e-cigarettes to win regulatory clearance than currently proposed by the Food and Drug Administration. Under a proposed FDA rule, almost all e-cigarette and vapor products introduced after Feb. 15, 2007, would be required to meet regulatory standards that the industry considers excessively stringent. The House Appropriations Committee voted 31-19 on Tuesday in favor of easing the process. The amendment was offered by Republican Tom Cole of Oklahoma and Democrat Sanford Bishop of Georgia. A vote by the full House of Representatives on the spending bill has not yet been scheduled. What happened today is a big boost of momentum for the industry, said Arnaud Dumas de Rauly, treasurer of the Vapor Technology Association, which represents manufacturers and businesses. Were happy to have bipartisan co-sponsors because up until now we only had Republican buy-in. Now we have Democratic buy-in as well. Public health advocates criticized the amendment, saying it benefits industry at the expense of public health.  The 2009 Tobacco Control Act allows a new tobacco product to be authorized for sale if it can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market before February 15, 2007. If no such product exists, the new product must undergo a much more stringent review under the agencys premarket tobacco application (PMTA) process. The vapor industry says almost all its products would be subject to PMTA review under the FDAs proposal because only one e-cigarette was on the market in the United States before the grandfather date. Since then, some 100,000 new e-cigarette and vapor products have been introduced. Moving or invalidating that grandfather date would allow some or all of the products to act as predicates for future products, something public health advocates say would allow e-cigarettes and other tobacco products to escape a critical first-step review by the FDA. The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said in a statement changing the date would make it easier for new products to stay on the market before it is determined whether they attract youth or otherwise harm public health.     A premarket tobacco application requires a company to prove, with scientific data, that the new product will not harm the population as a whole. So far only one company, Stockholm-based Swedish Match AB, has cleared that bar. Last year the FDA authorized the sale of eight of its smokeless snus products. The FDA is expected soon to issue a final rule giving it authority for the first time to regulate e-cigarettes and vapor products, which generated $3.3 billion in U.S. sales last year. The agency already has authority to regulate cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-you-own tobacco. The Tobacco Act gave it the option of extending its authority over other tobacco products after issuing a rule. ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1

Secret U.S. court issues first order for phone data under new law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The secretive U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has issued its first order allowing the National Security Agency to collect telephone records under a new electronic spying law Congress passed last year. According to an order from the court posted Tuesday on a website operated by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the court issued the order on Dec. 31. The order, signed by FISC Chief Judge Thomas Hogan, said the court concluded that a surveillance application, apparently submitted by the NSA, met the requirements of the USA Freedom Act, which President Barack Obama signed last year. That law replaced an older one that allowed NSA to collect telephone metadata - records of American citizens and residents calls, including their origin and destination, when a call was placed and how long it lasted. However, U.S. intelligence officials have said the NSA did not collect the content of phone calls under this program and did not look at the data without some specific justification. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed classified details of the collection program in 2013, and last year, Congress and the Obama administration narrowed the governments power to collect such domestic telephone metadata. Under the new law and revised procedures, the government no longer collects bulk telephone metadata, but must request targeted information from telecoms companies after obtaining authorization from the foreign intelligence court. The identities of the telecoms providers and the individuals or numbers whose metadata the NSA has targeted were redacted from the version of the court order released on Tuesday. Hogan says in the opinion that the government was seeking the ongoing daily production of detailed call records relating to an authorized international terrorism investigation, but does not offer further detail about the nature of the investigation. In his order, the judge accepts the argument that while the government was obliged to explain why targeting the telephone numbers of individuals is relevant to its investigation, it does not need to demonstrate the same relevance when examining numbers called from the initially targeted phones. The judge also said that although the new surveillance law requires government agencies to promptly destroy telephone metadata that it might have mistakenly collected on U.S. persons, they sometimes can retain such data for as long as six months if they have reason to believe it could provide evidence of a crime.

Kentucky's Republican governor calls for probe of Democratic predecessor,"LOUISVILLE (Reuters) - Kentuckys Republican governor on Tuesday called for an investigation into how his Democratic predecessor awarded state contracts and solicited campaign contributions, opening a new round in the feud between the two political families. Governor Matt Bevin said he has asked for the hiring of a law firm to determine whether Steve Beshears administration coerced state employees into donating to political campaigns.  The call by Bevin comes just over a week after Beshears son Andy, Kentuckys attorney general, sued Bevin in an effort to block funding cuts to public universities that he said are illegal.  Bevin on Tuesday said his administration also has concerns about contracts, some issued through a no-bid process, that may have rewarded family members of Beshears staff. The law firm would have the ability to subpoena witnesses and records, and work closely with the state inspector general, he said. These discoveries ... raise questions that must be answered in an open and transparent way, Bevin, who is the just second Republican elected to the states highest office since 1971, said at a press conference. Only then will the citizens of the commonwealth begin to have confidence in their government. Beshear, who was barred from seeking reelection due to term limits, strongly denied the charges in a Facebook post. There was never any attempt to pressure employees to make political contributions, and we followed both the spirit and the letter of procurement laws, he said, adding Bevins move was a pathetic spectacle. Andy Beshear said Bevin was not properly pursuing the issue. The attorney general said in a statement Tuesday that he agreed issues such as no-bid contracts should be scrutinized, including a pair awarded by Bevins administration.       The governor is once again overstating his authority, Beshear said, adding that the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission and not the cabinet was the appropriate agency for any such probe. Before taking office in December, Bevin called Steve Beshears appointment of his wife to an unpaid seat on the state horse park commission an embarrassment. Meanwhile, the former governor has launched a campaign against Bevins healthcare initiatives. ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
House leader wants review of 9/11 bill that would let Americans sue Saudis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan did not immediately endorse a Senate bill on Tuesday that would allow Americans to sue the government of Saudi Arabia over the Sept. 11 attacks, saying it should be reviewed to ensure it would not hurt diplomatic relations. With President Barack Obama traveling to Saudi Arabia  Tuesday, lawmakers have been discussing the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in January but has not been scheduled for debate in the full Senate or the House of Representatives. I think we need to review it to make sure that were not making mistakes with our allies and that were not catching people in this that shouldnt be caught up in this, Ryan, a Republican, told reporters. Some U.S. citizens whose relatives were killed in the 2001 attacks want to be able to sue Saudi Arabia because most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. The al Qaeda militant group, then based in Afghanistan, was blamed and the United States and its allies invaded the country. No U.S. investigation to date has reported finding evidence of Saudi government support for the attacks. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama did not support the legislation and would not sign it. Obama will seek to reassure Gulf allies about Washingtons support on his trip. Some lawyers working with the Sept. 11 victims families have insisted that the bill would come up for a vote quickly and easily pass Congress. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said no vote has been scheduled. Senate aides said there was at least one Republican hold on the measure. Im still looking at it, McConnell told reporters, calling the measure an important bill. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said lawmakers and the Obama administration were trying to resolve concerns about whether individuals should be able to sue foreign governments. There are some sovereign immunity issues that need to be worked through, Corker said. He declined to comment on whether he supported the legislation, because the bill has not been finalized. The New York Times reported on Friday that Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told U.S. lawmakers his country would be forced to sell up to $750 billion in U.S. assets in response to the bill if it passed. Several members of Congress and senior aides said they were unaware of any such threat, outside of the newspapers report. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, a lead bill sponsor said the Saudis had not talked to him about that threat. But he, and other senior Democrats said they wanted the bill to move ahead despite the White Houses objections. If the Saudi government was complicit in terrorism, and a trial so determines, it would be a real deterrent to other governments not to be complicit in terrorism, said Schumer, who represents New York, the state hardest hit in the attacks. Corker said he had been in close contact with the administration, but had not discussed the bill with Saudi officials for some time. Ryan said the bill did not come up while he was on a visit to Riyadh. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who supports the bill, said it was tied up  by State Department concerns about sovereign immunity. I think Americans need some redress when theyre hurt. ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
U.S. chief justice uses sign language as deaf lawyers sworn in,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In an historic first, U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts used sign language from the Supreme Court bench on Tuesday as he welcomed a dozen deaf and hard-of-hearing lawyers who took part in a ceremony authorizing them to argue cases before the court. The 12 members of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Bar Association were sworn in as members of the Supreme Court bar. After they were presented to the court for admission, Roberts signed in American Sign Language: Your motion is granted.Membership in the Supreme Court bar allows a lawyer to argue cases before the justices but most of its members never actually do so.  Roberts, appointed by Republican President George W. Bush in 2005, is believed to be the first U.S. chief justice to use sign language from the bench. It was also the first time members of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Bar Association took part in a swearing-in ceremony at the court. The lawyers then stayed for oral arguments in two cases in the ornate courtroom, assisted by an interpreter standing in front of the mahogany bench where the eight justices sit. The lawyers were permitted to use an instant transcription service that was transmitted to electronic devices. Normally, no electronic devices are allowed in the courtroom. One of the attorneys, Teresa Curtin of the Weitz & Luxenberg law firm, said in a statement the event was aimed at encouraging more people with disabilities to embark on legal careers. When she began her law career in the late 1980s, there was only a handful of deaf lawyers in the United States, while now there are around 250, Curtin said. In 1982, a deaf lawyer, Michael Chatoff, argued a case before the Supreme Court, assisted by a real-time transcription system.

New York Republicans and Democrats are holding presidential nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election. Delegate-rich New York, the fourth most populous U.S. state, is a big prize for the candidates. There is nothing more sacred in our nation than the right to vote, yet election after election, reports come in of people who were inexplicably purged from the polls, told to vote at the wrong location or unable to get into their polling site, city Comptroller Scott Stringer said. Stringer said his office had received reports of polling stations that failed to open on time and were unable to tell voters when they would be operational. A voter in the borough of Queens reported a broken machine and staff instructing voters to place their ballots in a slot for processing at a later time. In a letter to the New York City Board of Elections, the comptroller cited reports that polling staff were unable to operate voting machines, were giving out conflicting information and erroneously directing voters to alternate sites. Of particular concern, Stringer said, were allegations of widespread removal of eligible voters from registration rolls and incorrect party affiliations on voter records. Stringer said eligible Democratic voters in Brooklyn fell by 120,000 from November 2015 to April 2016 without explanation.   Board of Elections officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

"U.S., Iran discuss fulfilling nuclear deal pledges to Tehran","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday discussed ways of ensuring that last years historic nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers is implemented the way it was originally envisioned. We agreed were both working at making sure that the ... nuclear agreement is implemented in exactly the way that it is meant to be and that all the parties to that agreement get the benefits that they are supposed to get out of the agreement, Kerry told reporters at United Nations headquarters in New York. We will meet again to sort of solidify what we talked about today, he said, adding that he and Zarif would resume discussions in New York on Friday on the sidelines of a signing ceremony at the U.N. for the Paris climate agreement. Zarif said they discussed ways to make sure that we will draw the benefits that Iran is entitled to from the implementation of the agreement. Tehrans top diplomat added that he and Kerry on Friday would discuss ways of getting their ideas into operation. Neither Kerry nor Zarif offered any details about the ideas they discussed. U.S. officials said on Monday that Kerry was expected to raise Tehrans concerns over difficulties accessing the global financial system despite the lifting of some U.S. sanctions under the nuclear deal. Iran and six world powers clinched a historic nuclear agreement in July 2015, which allowed for the easing of some sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and United Nations in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. Tehran has called on the United States to do more to remove obstacles to the banking sector so that businesses feel comfortable with investing in Iran without penalties. Current U.S. policy bars foreign banks from clearing dollar-based transactions with Iran through U.S. banks. But U.S. officials have said the Obama administration is considering ways in which non-U.S. companies could use the dollar in some business transactions with Iran. State Department spokesman John Kirby said on Monday that Kerry would also press Iran to use its influence over the Syrian government to end Syrias five-year-old civil war.  Neither Kerry nor Zarif mentioned Syria. ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
"Washington, DC lawmakers finalize ban on public pot smoking","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington, D.C.s city council on Tuesday permanently banned the smoking of marijuana in public or in clubs, a spokeswoman for Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said, voting 7-6 for a second time to approve the prohibition.

U.S. justices weigh federal fraud claim over woman's death,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday struggled with the question of when federal contractors can be sued for defrauding the government in a case involving a 19-year-old Massachusetts woman who suffered a fatal 2009 seizure at a mental health facility. The parents of Yarushka Rivera claimed that UniversalHealthServicesInc, which owned the facility, provided gravely inadequate treatment and used unsupervised and unqualified personnel. Their lawsuit said King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services, one of the nations largest hospital operators, defrauded the government because it was receiving federal Medicaid funding to provide treatment to low-income people and failed to comply with all necessary requirements. Rivera died in October 2009 of a seizure after being treated at the mental health center in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Julio Escobar and his wife, Carmen Correa, filed suit against UniversalHealthServices in U.S. District Court in Boston in 2011. They said they had received information that more than 20 treatment providers at the Lawrence facility, including a nurse who prescribed medication to Rivera, were not properly licensed or supervised as required by state law and federal regulations.  The parents sued under the False Claims Act, which allows individuals to make claims that the federal government has been defrauded.  During the one-hour oral argument, liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan signaled support for the parents fraud claims. Sotomayor said billing for services that were not carried out in full was like a government contractor providing the military guns that dont shoot. Kagan similarly questioned whether the claim against Universal Health Services was any different than a failure by a federal contractor to provide the military boots that can be worn and food that can be eaten. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts appeared more hostile to the fraud claim, saying companies should not necessarily be liable for fraud just because they do not follow every procedure. That causes concern, of course, because there are thousands of pages of regulations under Medicaid or Medicare programs,  Roberts said. Medicare provides healthcare assistance to the elderly. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2014. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it in March 2015. Universal Health Services then appealed, asking the Supreme Court to resolve what kind of lawsuits can be brought under the False Claims Act. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed briefs backing the company, saying fraud claims should be allowed only when they involve specific violations of the terms of a contract with the government and not violations of other regulations.

Trump candidacy: Where some fear to tread others see a path to victory,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hes a successful businessman making his first foray into politics. He wants to secure the southern border with Mexico and dump global trade deals. And like Donald Trump, he wants to be the Republican establishments worst nightmare.  Hes Paul Nehlen, who has emerged as a Republican rival to Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, in his home district in Wisconsin. Ryan, the most powerful elected Republican in the country, is the epitome of that establishment. While many Republican operatives fear Trumps tumultuous presidential bid will hurt House and Senate races this year, a handful of candidates like Nehlen are embracing Trumps message, although not always the man himself. A loss by Ryan or another high-profile incumbent would send shockwaves through the party and could prompt fellow establishment Republicans to rethink positions on advocacy of free trade and support for immigration reform. In New Hampshire, where Trump won the nominating contest, or primary, by 20 points, Jim Rubens, a former Republican state senator who has endorsed the billionaire businessman, is attempting to unseat incumbent Senator Kelly Ayotte.   In Arizona, another state Trump won, state senator Kelli Ward is challenging veteran Senator John McCain by talking up securing the border and courting voters at Trump rallies, although she has not endorsed the presidential candidate.   The dynamic of outsiders challenging establishment candidates is one that has been taking place within the Republican Party for several election cycles, but in Trump, the insurgency has a new, more popular face. Beyond the races in Wisconsin, Arizona and New Hampshire, it has played out in states like Alabama, where Jonathan McConnell greeted voters outside a Trump rally in Huntsville in a bid to unseat veteran Senator Richard Shelby, and North Carolina, where Rep. Renee Elmers, facing a challenge to her seat, said she had voted for Trump in that states presidential primary. But, unlike the anti-establishment wave that swept Tea Party-aligned lawmakers into Congress in 2010, these candidates do not appear to represent a new anti-Washington groundswell, suggesting there are limits to Trumps brand of politics, which at times runs deep against Republican orthodoxy on issues such as trade and taxes. I been surprised that there havent been any Senate or House incumbents that have lost primaries as a result of a groundswell of support for Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, said Nathan Gonzales, an independent analyst on congressional races in Washington.  Shelby, for example, soundly defeated challenger McConnell in Alabamas Republican primary race in March. Other candidates could try to replicate his message, but no one can replicate Donald Trump, Gonzales said. Still, many analysts and political operatives believe Republicans unhappy with Trump as the nominee wont vote in the general election, potentially causing Republicans to lose their congressional seats to Democratic contenders. It would be easy, to dismiss Nehlens challenge to Ryan, who is popular among Republicans inside and outside of Wisconsin and has a large campaign warchest. A poll last month by Marquette University Law School showed him with more than an 80 percent approval rating among Wisconsin Republicans. But less than two years ago,Eric Cantor, then the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, was also considered a rising Republican star. He suffered a shock defeat in the 2014 congressional elections in Virginia to an obscure conservative college professor, David Brat. Cantor, too, had looked unbeatable. That race is what reinforced in my mind this is possible, Nehlen said in an interview. Trump has frequently criticized Ryan for the $1.1 billion budget deal struck withDemocratic President Barack Obama last December. And Ryans support of trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and comprehensive immigration reform is squarely at odds with Trumps positions.  Nehlen said those two issues motivated him to mount his challenge to Ryan, although he stopped short of saying he embraced Trumps candidacy. Rubens, who is challenging Ayotte in New Hampshire, isnt as restrained. I admire his independence, Rubens told Reuters.  Rubens, like Trump, calls for a fence along the southern border and for doing away with so-called birthright citizenship, a policy that grants anyone born on U.S. soil a citizen.  Ayotte, a first-term senator, was praised by conservatives when she ran in 2010 and was endorsed by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin at the height of Palins popularity. But she earned their wrath when she backed immigration reform. She also frustrated moderates by voting against a bill that would block suspected terrorists from buying guns. Ayotte, Gonzales said, is an example of someone who cant come out guns blazing against Donald Trump. She needs every Republican possible in the state. In Arizona, Ward is challenging McCain, the moderate who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, in a state where rancor over immigration issues runs high. Ward has said she supports Trumps claim that Mexico was sending criminals to the United States. Mexico has ridiculed the allegation.  Ward has an opportunity. A poll released last month by the firm Public Policy Polling showed McCain with a 33 percent approval rating among Republicans in Arizona.  ",politicsNews,"April 19, 2016 ",1
U.S. says Kerry to meet Iran foreign minister on Tuesday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in New York on Tuesday to discuss implementation of the Iran nuclear deal and ways Tehran can use its influence to end Syrias civil war, U.S. officials said on Monday.

Senate passes bill to boost travel security after Brussels,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved legislation that would boost domestic travel security in the wake of the Brussels attacks and authorize the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration through September 2017. The 95-3 vote sends the measure to the House of Representatives, where lawmakers have been unable to make headway on their own FAA bill because of differences over a provision to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system.   The bipartisan Senate measure, which sidesteps the privatization issue, contains a series of travel security provisions that Senate Republicans have promoted as the most comprehensive increase in airport security in nearly a decade.  The measures include doubling the number of transportation security teams with bomb-sniffing dogs at domestic airports, as well as stronger vetting of airport employees and increased security at check-in and baggage claim areas. The bill also authorizes spending for FAA operations, airport improvements, aviation research and development, and requires airlines to compensate passengers for lost bags and refund charges for undelivered services.  Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Chairman John Thune said the legislation would make travel safe and secure and more passenger-friendly. The Senate measure also contains a lengthy section on unmanned aircraft that would require new policy standards for commercial drones involving safety, privacy, design and identification and the use of data gathered by the aircraft.

U.S. top court appears unlikely to revive Obama immigration plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas bid to save his plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits ran into trouble on Monday at the U.S. Supreme Court in a case testing the limits of presidential power. The court, with four conservative justices and four liberals, seemed divided along ideological lines during 90 minutes of arguments in the case brought by 26 states led by Texas that sued to block Obamas unilateral 2014 executive action that bypassed Congress. Liberal justices voiced support for Obamas action. The  conservatives sounded skeptical. A 4-4 decision would be a grim defeat for Obama because it would uphold lower court rulings that threw out his action last year and doom his quest to revamp a U.S. immigration policy he calls broken. More than a thousand people in favor of Obamas action staged a raucous demonstration outside the white marble courthouse on a sunny spring day, with cheery mariachi music from a red-and-black clad band filling the air. A smaller group of Obama critics staged their own rally. In order to win, Obama would need the support of one of the courts conservatives, most likely Chief Justice John Roberts or Anthony Kennedy. But they both at times hit the Obama administrations lawyer, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, with tough questions. Kennedy expressed concern that Obama had exceeded its authority by having the executive branch set immigration policy rather than carry out laws passed by Congress. Its as if the president is setting the policy and the Congress is executing it. Thats just upside down, Kennedy said. A ruling is due by the end of June. Obamas plan was tailored to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. Obama said the program, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), was aimed at preventing families from being torn apart. The case comes during a heated presidential campaign in which the status of the roughly 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally, most of them from Mexico and other Latin American nations, has been a central theme. Immigration is also a global concern, with Europe now struggling with a flood of immigrants fleeing violence in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. The Republican-governed states that filed suit asserted that the Democratic president overstepped his authority provided in the Constitution while his administration said he merely provided guidance on how to enforce deportation laws. A 4-4 ruling is possible because there are only eight justices following Februarys death of conservative Antonin Scalia. One possible compromise outcome would be that the court could uphold Obamas plan in part while leaving some legal questions unresolved, including whether the government can provide work permits to eligible applicants. Obama would also win if the justices decide the states had no legitimate grounds to sue. Texas said it had standing to sue because it would be hurt by the additional costs it would incur by providing drivers licenses to those given legal status. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted the basic problem that the government lacks the resources to deport everyone in the country illegally, meaning it must set priorities. There are these people who are here to stay, no matter what, Ginsburg said.  Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized Texas argument about the economic harm caused by Obamas action, saying millions of immigrants are here in the shadows and will affect the economy whether we want (them) to or not. Verrilli said the federal government has regularly launched programs aimed at giving large groups of immigrants temporary legal status as part of its role establishing enforcement priorities due to limited resources. Asked by Roberts if the government has the power to allow all immigrants who are in the country illegally to stay, Verrilli said: Definitely not. Shortly before the plan was to take effect, a federal judge in Texas blocked it after the states filed suit. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision in November. Obamas executive action arose from frustration within the White House and the immigrant community about a lack of action in politically polarized Washington to address the status of people living in the United States illegally. He took the action after House of Representatives Republicans killed bipartisan legislation, called the biggest overhaul of U.S. immigration laws in decades and providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, that was passed by the Senate in 2013. Obama, stifled by Republican lawmakers on many of his major legislative initiatives, has drawn Republican ire with his use of executive action to get around Congress on immigration policy and other matters including gun control and healthcare.

"Immigration overhaul backers sing, dance, chant at U.S. Supreme Court","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dancing, singing, chanting and cheering, throngs of supporters of President Barack Obamas plan to protect millions of people in the country illegally from deportation and provide them work permits rallied on Monday outside the U.S. Supreme Court. More than a thousand demonstrators from around the country flooded the sidewalks and streets around the white marble courthouse as the justices heard arguments on whether to reinstate Obamas executive action, blocked by lower courts. They greatly outnumbered conservative opponents of Obamas action. Due to the crowds, police closed a section of the street separating the courthouse from the Capitol building to traffic. Chicagoan Omar Martinez, 24, said he landed a congressional internship because of an Obama program that let someimmigrants who entered the country illegally before age 16 receive a renewable, two-year work permit and exemption from deportation. Its not just a Latino issue, Martinez said. Its a multicultural, multinational issue. You have people who are contributing to the economy, contributing to tax funds but cant fully enjoy what it means to be a U.S. citizen. Demonstrators brought their young children to the rally and a mariachi band played. Members of the Korean American Resource and Cultural Center danced in the street with a small band of drummers. A gospel choir from Howard University, a historically black college, sang several hymns including civil rights anthem Aint Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.  Speakers at the conservative Tea Party Patriots rally could barely be heard over boos, screams and chants of stop the hate from Obama supporters. Iowa Republican congressman Steve King shouted back: Are you an example of the America we can expect if this court finds that the president can write law and violate the Constitution at will? If so, were in for a rough ride in the future. Iowan Greg Cummings, 51, said his opposition to Obamas action has nothing to do with race. He said his wife emigrated from Honduras when she was 11 and is now a high school English teacher. Its a national sovereignty thing, Cummings said. A country without borders ceases to be a country. The United States cant be an open society to all the Earth. Zaira Garcia, 23, a recent University of Texas graduate, recalled how her Mexican fathers employers would sometimes withhold pay because they knew he was not in the country legally. Its inhumane, the way people who are undocumented can be taken advantage of, Garcia said. It made us realize and appreciate the sacrifice my parents made to come here.

"North Korea can learn from Iran nuclear deal, U.S. says","SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea, which conducted a fourth nuclear test in January in contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions, can learn from a deal struck between Iran and world powers to freeze its nuclear program, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. North Korea, which regularly threatens the United States and rich, democratic South Korea, also conducted a long-range rocket launch in February, defying U.N. sanctions. The Security Council last month expanded those sanctions aimed at starving North Korea of funds for its weapons program on a resolution drafted by the United States and China. Iran made a fundamental choice. It decided to freeze and roll back its nuclear program and allow inspectors to come in and create the time and space to see if we could agree a comprehensive agreement, Blinken told reporters in Seoul. Iran and six world powers clinched the nuclear agreement in July 2015, which allowed for the easing of sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and United Nations in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.     Its our hope that the DPRK will be inspired by that example, said Blinken, speaking after a meeting with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts. DPRK stands for Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, North Koreas official title.   Recent diplomatic progress between the United States and Cuba and Myanmar demonstrated U.S. willingness to engage with countries like North Korea, Blinken said. If a country, even one with which weve had the most profound differences, is prepared to engage seriously and credibly in answering the demands of the international community, we are also prepared to engage, Blinken said. Blinken said on Monday the United States would respond strongly in the case of a further North Korean nuclear test, days after the Norths failed attempt to launch what the United States believes was an intermediate-range ballistic missile.

Sanders hits Clinton on campaign finance hours before New York votes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders accused front-runner Hillary Clinton of apparent campaign finance violations on Monday, ratcheting up the rhetoric against his rival one day before New York states crucial primary elections. Sanders questioned whether Clintons campaign violated legal limits on donations by paying her staffers with funds from a joint fundraising effort by Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, or DNC. Sanders has long maintained that the DNC has favored Clinton over Sanders. The U.S. senator from Vermont is a democratic socialist who has run as an independent in his Senate campaigns. While the use of joint fundraising agreements has existed for some time - it is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest, Sanders campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said. The Clinton campaign dismissed the charge, with chairman Robby Mook saying Sanders was making baseless accusations. It is shameful that Senator Sanders has resorted to irresponsible and misleading attacks just to raise money for himself, Mook said. The accusations surfaced as the Democratic and Republican candidates engaged in a final frenzy of campaigning before Tuesdays primaries. Both the Democratic and Republican primaries are expected to be the states most decisive in decades in the selection of the parties candidates for Novembers general election. Former U.S. Secretary of State Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, the national front-runners, were favored to win their respective primaries in the state that both call home. Victories would be a tonic for both candidates following a series of losses. In recent weeks, Sanders has defeated Clinton in nominating contests. On the Republican side, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Trumps closest challenger, has outmaneuvered the billionaire businessman in the fight for delegates to the Republican National Convention that will pick the partys nominee in July. By the end of Monday - the last official day of campaigning before the New York primaries - tens of thousands of New Yorkers will have heard the candidates closing pitches. At St. Johns Riverside Hospital in Yonkers just north of New York City, Clinton spoke to doctors, nurses and others at a hospital cafeteria, asking for their votes and taking a jab at Cruzs dismissal earlier in the campaign of New York values. I think New Yorks values are Americas values, she told the crowd. Cruz defended his New York values catchphrase on ABCs Good Morning America in Times Square on Monday, saying New Yorkers had suffered under the left-wing Democratic policies of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo. Sanders needs a strong victory in New York, where 291 delegates to the Democratic convention in July are at stake, if he is to overtake Clinton. With 2,383 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination, Clinton has 1,758 to Sanders 1,076, according to an Associated Press tally. That total includes unpledged superdelegates who are free to back the candidate of their choice but told the news service whom they support. For Trump, the question is whether he will make a clean sweep of all 95 Republican delegates at stake by earning the majority of votes in all 27 congressional districts in the state.  Total victory in New York would help Trump avoid the possibility that the nomination could be wrested from him at the partys July 18-21 convention in Cleveland if he arrives without a majority of at least 1,237 delegates. In that scenario, another candidate could win on a second or subsequent ballot. Trump has 744 delegates to 559 for Cruz and 144 for Ohio Governor John Kasich, according to the Associated Press. The count includes endorsements from several delegates who are free to support the candidate of their choice. In Wyoming, in the latest state-by-state delegate battle, Cruz was awarded all 14 delegates, according to a party official on Saturday.  Lyin Ted Cruz cant win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him & K, Trump tweeted on Monday.  On ABC, Cruz responded by saying that Trump was throwing a fit because he has lost several recent state contests. The stakes are too high to hand the election to Hillary Clinton, which is what nominating Donald Trump would do, he said. ",politicsNews,"April 18, 2016 ",1
U.S. to send more troops to Iraq to tackle Islamic State,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The United States will send more troops to Iraq and will put them closer to the front lines of battle there to advise Iraqi forces in the war against Islamic State militants. U.S. defense officials said on Monday that Washington will deploy about 200 additional troops, mostly as advisers for Iraqi troops as they advance towards Mosul, the largest Iraqi city still under Islamic State control. As we see the Iraqis willing to fight and gaining ground, lets make sure that we are providing them more support, U.S. President Barack Obama said in an interview with CBS News. My expectation is that by the end of the year, we will have created the conditions whereby Mosul will eventually fall, Obama said. The United States has also authorized the use of Apache attack helicopters to help the Iraqis as they can provide quicker air support and precision fire. The advisers will accompany Iraqi units of about 2,500 troops moving closer to the front lines of battle. Until now, the advisers were limited to larger divisions of about 10,000 troops located further back from the battlefield.  The change will allow them to offer quicker advice to Iraqi troops as they try to retake Mosul, likely facing stiff resistance from an entrenched enemy. But it could also leave the U.S. advisers more vulnerable to enemy mortars and artillery. This will put Americans closer to the action, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said. Their whole purpose is to be able to help those forces respond in a more agile way. The decision to enlarge the U.S. military force was made in close concert with Iraqi authorities, said Carter, who met U.S. commanders and Iraqi officials including Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on a visit to Baghdad. Iraq is engulfed in a political crisis over anti-corruption reforms that is crippling state institutions and threatening to slow the campaign against the militants.   The increase raises the authorized troop level in Iraq to  4,087, not including special operations personnel, some logistics workers and troops on temporary rotations.  The Pentagon will also provide up to $415 million to Kurdish peshmerga military units, who have played an important role in pushing back Islamic State in northern Iraq. Part of that funding will likely be spent on basics like food, said Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland, head of the U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State. Right now the peshmerga are not getting enough calories to keep them in the field, MacFarland said. The increase is the latest move by the United States, which invaded Iraq in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussein, to step up its campaign against the hardline Sunni jihadists. Since December, Iraqi forces trained by the U.S. military and backed by coalition air strikes have taken back territory from Islamic State, which seized swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014. Some U.S. troops already in Iraq will be shifted to establishing logistics for Iraqi forces as they move towards Mosul, Carter said. These include supply lines, particularly important as Mosul is 400 km (250 miles) north of Baghdad. Most of the new U.S. advisers, who will make up the bulk of the new troops, will be Army Special Forces, as are the about  100 advisers now in Iraq. The rest of the troops announced on Monday include support crew for the Apaches and security forces to protect the advisers. The United States will also deploy an additional long-range rocket artillery unit to support Iraqi ground forces in the battle for Mosul, Carter said. Two such batteries are already in place in Iraq. The officials did not rule out the possibility that lasting success might require further U.S. commitments. If it doesnt take us all the way, well come back and have another discussion and ask for more if we need to, McFarland said. ",politicsNews,"April 18, 2016 ",1

Were not doing the fighting ourselves, Obama said, but when we provide training, when we provide special forces who are backing them up, when we are gaining intelligence, working with the coalitionsthat we have, what weve seen is that we can continually tighten the noose on Islamic State. My expectation is that by the end of the year, we will have created the conditions whereby Mosul will eventually fall, Obama said. ",politicsNews,"April 18, 2016 ",1
White House: Not in Saudi interest to destabilize global economy over 9/11 bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House expressed confidence on Monday that Saudi Arabia would not follow through on a reported threat to sell U.S. assets if Congress passed a bill that could hold the kingdom responsible for any role in al Qaedas Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The New York Times reported on Friday that Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told U.S. lawmakers that the country would be forced to sell up to $750 billion in Treasury securities and other U.S. assets in response to the bill if it passed. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama did not support the legislation and would not sign it. The bill would allow the Saudi government to be sued in a U.S. court for any role in the Sept. 11 attacks.  Im confident that the Saudis recognize, just as much as we do, our shared interest in preserving the stability of the global financial system, Earnest told reporters. Obama, who is traveling to Saudi Arabia later this week, said he opposes the bill because it could expose the United States to lawsuits from citizens of other countries.  If we open up the possibility that individuals in the United States can routinely start suing other governments, then we are also opening up the United States to being continually sued by individuals in other countries, Obama said in an interview broadcast on CBS News on Monday. Most of the 19 attackers on Sept. 11, 2001 were Saudi nationals who hijacked four planes and flew them into New York Citys World Trade Center, the Pentagon near Washington and into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers revolted. The attack was mounted by the al Qaeda militant group, then based in Afghanistan. No U.S. investigation to date has reported finding evidence of Saudi government support for the attacks. The debate over the congressional legislation has gained traction on the U.S. presidential campaign trail. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has broken with the Democratic administration and said she supported the bill. Her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said he shared the Obama administrations concern that the legislation could open up the United States to liability from other countries but said it was important to look into any potential Saudi role in the attacks. I think its important to have a full investigation and an understanding of the role, the possible role, of the Saudi government in 9/11, he said on NBCs Today program. Clinton and Sanders remarks on the issue on Monday came on the day before New York states Democratic primary, a crucial race for both candidates. Businessman Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in the race for the White House, dismissed concerns about a Saudi sell-off of U.S. assets. Thats OK, Trump told New York radio show host Joe Piscopo in a phone interview on Monday morning. Letem sell em. And well all buy them, Joe, thats OK. ... Its called a fire sale, nothing better than a fire sale. The bill, which has 22 co-sponsors, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, but it has not come up for a vote in the Republican-dominated Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells office said on Monday that no vote has been scheduled. Family members of victims who were killed in the September 2001 attacks urged Obama to support the legislation and to bring up the issue on his trip. It is not acceptable ... to succumb to the demands of a foreign government that we abandon principles of American justice while we pursue our diplomatic goals, they wrote in a letter to Obama that was released to the media. In September, a U.S. judge dismissed claims against Saudi Arabia by families of victims of the attacks, saying the kingdom had sovereign immunity from damage claims.

"U.S. poised to approve Boeing fighter jet sales to Qatar, Kuwait","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is poised to approve two long-delayed sales of Boeing Co fighter jets to Qatar and Kuwait, and could announce the multibillion-dollar deals during President Barack Obamas visit to the Gulf this week, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Both deals have been stalled amid concerns raised by Israel that equipment sent to Gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and be used against it, and by the Obama administrations broader decision-making on military aid to the Gulf.  However, the Pentagon and the State Department both have  signed off on the sale of some 36 F-15 fighter jets to Qatar and 24 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to Kuwait, both built by Boeing. The White House is expected to follow suit shortly. The sale to Kuwait is worth about $3 billion and the one to Qatar is probably close to $4 billion, sources familiar with the matter said. The last hurdle now is getting approval from the National Security Council and the White House, said one of the sources. The Pentagon had no immediate comment. A senior Obama administration official said it was the administrations policy not to comment on potential arm sales until it has formally notified Congress of an intent to sell something. But, the official said, the United States is committed to the security and stability of the Gulf region and defense sales  fit into the overall U.S. regional diplomatic strategy. Expected approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House seeks to shore up relations with Gulf allies as they increase their military capabilities amid growing fears that Washington is drawing closer to Iran in the aftermath of the nuclear deal with that country. Senior U.S. officials, including Navy Secretary Ray Mabus have publicly urged approval of the weapons sales, which will help maintain production of the fourth-generation Boeing fighter jets, while the newer and more advanced Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet enters service in coming years. One senior U.S. defense official said the Pentagon is keen to see the Boeing F-15 and F/A-18 production lines in St. Louis continue and does not want to foreclose any options on fourth-generation aircraft at this point. Boeing already is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy long-lead materials such as titanium to prepare for a possible Kuwaiti order for F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and a  separate U.S. Navy order for 12 jets put on the services unfunded priorities list submitted to Congress. The Navy is hoping that Congress will provide the funding to pay for the Boeing jets in fiscal 2017, although the planes were not included in its base budget request. It already has earmarked funding for more F/A-18E/F jets in fiscal 2018. A larger concern now is the Boeing F-15 line, which is set to end in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved.

Milestones in the Supreme Court immigration case,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday heard arguments in a challenge by 26 states to President Barack Obamas executive action to defer deportation of certain immigrant children and parents who are in the country illegally. Here is a chronology of the case, United States v. Texas: June 15, 2012 - The Obama administration, through the Department of Homeland Security, initiates the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which suspends deportation for two years for people who entered the country illegally at least five years earlier, before they were age 16, and who were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012. Nov. 20, 2014 - Obama, through unilateral executive action, initiates a new deferred-deportation and work-authorization policy for immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents and who have been living illegally in the United States since Jan. 1, 2010. These people must pass certain background checks for possible past criminal convictions. The program is called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). The Obama administration also expands the earlier DACA program by eliminating the age-31 cap and increasing deferred deportation from two to three years. Dec. 3, 2014 - Texas and other Republican-governed states sue the Democratic Obama administration in U.S. district court in Texas. They assert that Obamas Nov. 20 executive actions, which bypassed the Republican-led Congress, violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) notice-and-comment requirements for new federal agency rules and violated the U.S. Constitutions dictate that a president take care that laws are faithfully executed. In all, 26 of the 50 U.S. states eventually sign on to the lawsuit: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Feb. 16, 2015 - U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen in the border city of Brownsville, Texas issues an injunction blocking enforcement of the programs nationwide. The judge says the Obama administration had failed to offer notice and seek comments under the Administrative Procedure Act. Administration lawyers counter that the actions did not arise from official rule-making but rather from Homeland Security Department discretion on deportation priorities. May 26, 2015 - After the administration appeals the judges decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, based in New Orleans, upholds Hanens injunction, pending an appeal on the merits of the case. Nov. 9, 2015 - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit rules for Texas and the other states, throwing out Obamas DAPA and expanded DACA actions because, the court says, they were subject to notice-and-comment requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act. Jan. 19, 2016 - The Supreme Court agrees to hear the  administrations appeal. The justices say they will review the Administrative Procedure Act issue as well as whether the program violates the take care mandate. A key question before the justices is whether Texas and the other states even have legal standing to bring the case based on a claim that Obamas action would cost the states financially in certain public services such as the cost of issuing drivers licenses to illegal immigrants. Feb. 13, 2016 - Justice Antonin Scalia dies, leaving the Supreme Court with only eight members - four liberals and four conservatives - and the possibility of a 4-4 deadlock. Such a split ruling would be a defeat for Obama because it would leave in place the 5th Circuit decision disallowing his executive action. April 18, 2016 - The Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the case United States v. Texas.

Factbox: Legal issues in Supreme Court immigration case,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday heard arguments in a challenge brought by Texas and other states to President Barack Obamas executive action on immigration. The eight justices confronted a series of legal questions beginning with whether Texas and the other state challengers even had grounds to bring the case. Obamas November 2014 orders affect immigrants in the country illegally whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents or who themselves have been in the United States since they were children. Here is a look at some of the key legal questions in the case: To bring a case, challengers must first demonstrate that they have legal standing, arising from some injury or negative consequences. In this case, that means the states need to show that they would be hurt by the Obama administrations deferral of deportation for immigrant parents and children with deep ties to the United States but who are in the country illegally. The state of Texas has taken the lead in the lawsuit against the Obama administration to block the presidents actions. Texas asserts that it has standing largely because of the expected financial cost to the state of processing temporary drivers licenses for illegal immigrants with new authorization to live in the United States. Texas subsidizes the cost of processing drivers licenses and contends Obamas actions would cost it millions of dollars. The Obama administration rejects that basis for standing to file suit, asserting that any such costs are incidental and could be avoided by the state. Obama administration lawyers say Texas could eliminate the subsidies for these drivers licenses and eliminate the harm claimed by the state. If a majority of the justices finds that Texas lacked a sufficient injury to sue, the case of United States v. Texas ends there and the Obama administration wins. RULE-MAKING REQUIREMENTS If the justices agree that Texas has standing to bring the case, they then would consider whether deferred-deportation policies that were part of Obamas actions violated rule-making requirements in a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act. Under that law, federal agencies typically must issue a general notice of a proposed rule and give interested parties a chance to comment. Obama administration lawyers say the deferred deportation practices are not binding rules subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. Rather, they characterize these policies as an outgrowth of the U.S. Department of Homeland Securitys discretion in determining deportation priorities. The administration contends that the homeland security secretary should be able to focus his departments limited resources on deporting serious criminals and securing the border. There is also the question of whether the deferred deportation violates a dictate of the U.S. Constitution that presidents must take care to faithfully execute the nations laws. Texas and the other states that brought the lawsuit say Obama, in taking executive action that bypassed Congress, crossed that line because Congress is in charge of deciding who is a lawful or unlawful immigrant. The Obama administration says it was faithfully executing the authority to determine priorities under immigration law. ",politicsNews,"April 18, 2016 ",1

U.S. to give Philippines eye in sky to track South China Sea activity,"MANILA (Reuters) - The United States will transfer an observation blimp to the Philippines to help it track maritime activity and guard its borders amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, a U.S. diplomat said on Monday. Philip Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said Washington would give Manila, its oldest Asia-Pacific security ally, $42 million worth of sensors, radar and communications equipment. We will add to its capability to put sensors on ships and put an aerostat blimp in the air to see into the maritime space, Goldberg said in an interview with CNN Philippines,  The blimp is a balloon-borne radar to collect information and detect movements in the South China Sea, a Philippine military official said.  China claims almost the entire South China Sea, believed to have huge deposits of oil and gas. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the waters, through which about $5 trillion in trade is shipped every year. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited the Philippines last week to reaffirm Washingtons ironclad commitment to defend Manila under a 1951 security treaty. China has been expanding its presence on its seven artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago and on Monday landed a military plane for the first time on one of them, Fiery Cross Reef. It comes ahead of a planned U.S. freedom of navigation patrol this month near the Spratlys. Carters visit also signals the start of U.S. military deployment in the Philippines, with 75 soldiers to be rotated in and out of an air base north of Manila. Goldberg said the two allies had agreed to set up a system for secure and classified communications as part of a five-year, $425 million security initiative by Washington in Southeast Asia.  Manila will receive some $120 million in U.S. military aid this year, the largest sum since 2000 when the American military returned to the Philippines for training and exercises after an eight-year hiatus.  They signed a new deal in 2013 allowing increased U.S. military presence on a rotational basis and storage of supplies and equipment for maritime security and humanitarian missions.

U.S. pledges 'strong response' in event of another North Korean nuclear test,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States will respond strongly in the case of a further North Korean nuclear test, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, days after the Norths failure to launch what the United States believes was an intermediate-range ballistic missile. North Korea conducted a fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the next month, both in contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Expanded U.N. sanctions aimed at starving North Korea of funds for its nuclear weapons program were approved in a unanimous Security Council vote in early March on a resolution drafted by the United States and China. Blinken, who is meeting senior Japanese government officials in Tokyo, told reporters North Korea would be digging itself deeper into a hole if it pursued further provocations. There will be additional strong response in case of another (North Korean) nuclear test, Blinken said, adding that such actions by North Korea were unacceptable. Blinken said the United States would consider a number of possibilities while adding that it was premature to be specific. Some experts expect North Korea to conduct its fifth nuclear test in the near future, possibly before its party congress in early May, following the embarrassing missile failure on Friday.

Chinese official calls Trump 'irrational' on trade,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei criticized Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, calling him an irrational type due to his proposal that tariffs on imported Chinese goods be increased to up to 45 percent. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Sunday, Lou said, Trump is an irrational type. If he were to do this, that would be in violation of the rules set by the World Trade Organization. Lou said that if the United States put Trumps proposal into effect, it would not be entitled to its position as the worlds major power. The U.S. needs to recognize that the U.S. and China are mutually dependent on each other. Our economic cycles are intertwined. He acknowledged that rhetoric in a U.S. presidential campaign can become heated. China is the United States largest trading partner. Chinese officials have generally avoided criticizing Trump directly, though they have made indirect criticism of his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States and indirectly rebuffed Trumps claims that China is stealing U.S. jobs. Chinas tightly-controlled state media has largely stuck to reporting the facts about Trump, with some notable exceptions. Last month, influential tabloid the Global Times accused Trump of being a racist, warning that other extremists, such as Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, had both been voted into power. Trump on Sunday again asserted that China had waged economic war against the United States.  Theyve taken our jobs, theyve taken our money, the billionaire businessman said at a campaign rally in New York. We cant continue to be ripped off like were being ripped off. At a Republican presidential debate last month, Trump said China will not allow free trade or U.S. manufacturers to compete freely. The 45 percent (tariff) is a threat that if they dont behave, if they dont follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you, he said. Republican rival Ted Cruz criticized the 45 percent tariff proposal, saying during the same debate that it would be passed on to U.S. consumers.  How does it help you to have a president come and say ... Im going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing. That hurts you, the U.S. senator from Texas said. The United States reported a $366-billion trade deficit with China in 2015, up from $343 billion in 2014 - the largest U.S. trade imbalance with any nation. The deficit is up nearly 12 percent in the first two months of 2016 to $57 billion.  ",politicsNews,"April 17, 2016 ",1
Cruz adviser says Trump campaign taking 'banana republic' approach,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior adviser to Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz on Sunday accused rival Donald Trumps campaign of taking a banana republic approach by complaining that party rules for selecting a nominee are rigged against him. Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, the Texas senators delegate operations manager, said on ABCs This Week that the Trump campaign is challenging the delegate selection process because theyre getting beat on the ground. Cuccinelli and Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, as well as the third Republican candidate, Ohio Governor John Kasich, traded punches over the delegate selection process on Sunday news shows.  Trump remains the front-runner in the race to be the Republican Partys candidate in Novembers general election. But it remains unclear whether the billionaire businessman will arrive at the partys July 18-21 convention in Cleveland with the 1,237-delegate majority needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot. The next big face-off is New York states primary on Tuesday, with 95 delegates at stake.  Opinion polls show Trump, a New Yorker, well ahead of his rivals, with Kasich and Cruz trailing behind. The latest CBS News poll, released on Sunday, showed Trump ahead in New York, with 54 percent of those surveyed to 21 percent for Cruz and 19 percent for Kasich. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, a former New York senator and U.S. secretary of state, and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will also face New York voters on Tuesday. Polls show Clinton is still favored to win, although Sanders, a New York City native who is hoping for an upset win to ensure the continued viability of his campaign, has managed to narrow the gap in recent days. Trump, meanwhile, has become increasingly agitated as the Cruz campaign outmaneuvers him in the complex art of securing delegates that are not simply allocated by a popular vote.  At a news conference in New York Citys Staten Island borough on Sunday, he repeated his assertion that the system was crooked. Youre basically buying these people, he said, referring to convention delegates. I could put them in the best planes and bring them to the best places in the world, he added. But he said he was not interested in wooing delegates that way, describing it as undemocratic. The party rules for picking delegates vary by state. Cuccinelli said Cruz has been winning elections. And when we win, Trump whines. This is a banana republic approach from the Trump team, he said. ... They have a media campaign. But Ted Cruz has built a grassroots campaign. On Fox News Sunday, Trumps Lewandowski pointed to Florida, where the candidate won the primary in a landslide. But Trump can count on the support of only 69 of the states 99 delegates because the state Republican Party chairman is allowed to appoint 30. Ted Cruz does well in places where party bosses get to set those rules and people dont get to go and vote, Lewandowski said. Another senior Trump adviser, delegate selection specialist Paul Manafort, told ABC the campaign will protest results in Missouri and Colorado. But in several interviews on Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus again denied that the delegate selection rules are rigged against Trump. Kasich ridiculed Trump and his campaign for suggesting the delegate selection rules are fixed and that a dirty trick allowed Cruz to win Colorados nominating contest without a statewide vote. Kasich, interviewed by CNN, said Trump should act like youre a professional. Be a pro.  (This story corrects New York state poll numbers in 7th paragraph) ",politicsNews,"April 17, 2016 ",1

Obama immigration action goes before Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case on Monday that tests the boundaries of presidential powers, confronting the question of whether President Barack Obama exceeded his authority with unilateral action to spare millions of people in the country illegally from deportation. The case, one of the most consequential of the courts current term that ends in June, pits Obama against 26 states led by Texas that filed suit to block his 2014 immigration plan. The high court is evenly divided with four liberal justices and four conservatives following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia. That raises the possibility of a 4-4 split that would leave in place a 2015 lower-court ruling that threw out the presidents executive action that bypassed the Republican-led Congress. The arguments in the case come at a time when immigration is a divisive issue in the U.S. presidential campaign, with top Republican contenders advocating deporting all of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally. Obama took the action after Republicans in the House of Representatives killed bipartisan legislation, billed as the biggest overhaul of U.S. immigration laws in decades and providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, that was passed by the Senate in 2013. Obamas plan was tailored to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. Obamas program was called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). Shortly before the plan was to go into effect last year, a federal judge in Texas blocked it after the Republican-governed states filed suit against the Democratic presidents executive action. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision in November. The Supreme Courts ruling is due by the end of June. Obamas action arose from frustration within the White House and the immigrant community about a lack of action in politically polarized Washington to address the status of people, mostly Hispanics, living in the United States illegally. Obama has drawn Republican ire with his use of executive action to get around Congress on immigration policy and other matters including gun control and healthcare. On the immigration action, the states contend Obama exceeded the powers granted to him by the Constitution by intruding upon the authority of Congress. ",politicsNews,"April 17, 2016 ",1

April 18, 2016 - Oral arguments scheduled in United States v. Texas. A ruling is expected by the end of June. ",politicsNews,"April 17, 2016 ",1
Ted Cruz wins Wyoming Republican presidential nominating contest,"CASPER, Wyo. (Reuters) - Republican U.S. presidential hopeful Ted Cruz won all 14 delegates at stake on Saturday in Wyoming, besting rival Donald Trump, who made little effort to win the rural state, and further narrowing the gap in the race for the partys nomination. Cruz is trying to prevent Trump from obtaining the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination at the July convention in Cleveland. By continuing to rack up small wins, Cruz is gaining ground on the New York real estate mogul, who has thus far failed to shift his focus on the local-level campaigning necessary to win delegates. Trump has been critical of the process, again on Saturday calling it rigged while speaking at a rally in Syracuse, New York. He has repeatedly complained about Colorado, which awarded all 34 of its delegates to Cruz despite not holding a popular vote. Trump said his supporters are becoming increasingly angry with states such as Wyoming and Colorado. Theyre going nuts out there; theyre angry, Trump said in Syracuse. The bosses took away their vote, and I wasnt going to send big teams of people three, four months ago, have them out there.  While Trump has won 21 state nominating contests to Cruzs 10, the billionaire leads the Texas senator by only 196 delegates (755-559). That means he must win nearly 60 percent of those remaining before the partys political convention in July. Wyoming does not hold a primary vote. Instead, 475 party activists convened in Casper on Saturday to hold a state convention and award 14 delegates.    Previously, 12 other delegates had been designated at county-level conventions. Cruz won 10 of those, with one going to Trump and another being elected as unbound. Cruz spoke at the convention, capping off a months-long effort to organize support in the state. Trump had originally planned to send former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who remains popular among conservatives, as a surrogate, but she canceled at the last minute. Cruz spoke about local issues in Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state. He discussed the Democratic attack on the fossil fuel, saying President Barack Obama has tried to put the coal industry out of business through government regulations targeting air pollution.  America is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and we are going to develop our industry, Cruz said. At the same time, Trump was speaking at a rally in Syracuse, New York, ahead of the states Republican primary on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"April 16, 2016 ",1
Clinton backer George Clooney condemns 'obscene' sums in White House race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Actor and director George Clooney, a supporter of Hillary Clintons presidential bid, broke ranks over campaign financing on Saturday to condemn the obscene sums of money in U.S. politics and praised Clintons chief political rival in the process.    Clooney made the remarks in an interview with NBC News Meet The Press the day after he and his wife, Amal, hosted a fundraiser on Democratic Party hopeful Clintons behalf Friday night with a price tag of up to $353,400 per couple.  We had some protesters last night when we pulled up in San Francisco and theyre right to protest. Theyre absolutely right. It is an obscene amount of money, Clooney said in excerpts released on Saturday. The interview will air on Sunday. Bernie Sanders, a U.S. Senator from Vermont and Clintons rival in the race for the Democratic nomination to run for the White House in the Nov. 8 election, has pounced on former secretary of state Clinton over the big-ticket event and for accepting large sums of money for her campaign. The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right. Its ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics. I agree completely, Clooney said.  In response to the dinner, the Sanders campaign on Friday evening sent out an email to supporters asking them to help reach their fundraising goals by chipping in $3.53 apiece, instead.

Pope says its crazy to see his meeting with Bernie Sanders as political,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Saturday that his meeting with Bernie Sanders, contesting the Democratic candidacy for the U.S. Presidency, was not meddling in politics and that anyone who thought otherwise should look for a psychiatrist. Sanders and the pope met briefly on Saturday morning at the Vatican guest house where Francis lives and where Sanders and his wife spent the night after he addressed a Vatican conference on social justice. When I came down, I greeted him, I shook his hand and nothing more. This is called good manners and it is not getting involved in politics, the pope told reporters in answer to a question aboard the plane returning from the Greek island of Lesbos, where he visited a refugee camp. [L5N17J063]. If anyone thinks that greeting someone is getting involved in politics, I recommend that he look for a psychiatrist, he said, laughing. In an interview with ABC News after the meeting, Sanders called the pope a beautiful man, adding I am not a Catholic, but there is a radiance that comes from him. I just conveyed to him my admiration for the extraordinary work he is doing raising some of the most important issues facing our planet and the billions of people on the planet and injecting the need for morality in the global economy, Sanders, a Brooklyn-born son of Polish Jewish immigrants, told ABC. The Democratic hopeful from Vermont has campaigned on a promise to rein in corporate power and level the economic playing field for working and lower-income Americans who he says have been left behind, a message echoing that of the pope. The meeting came just days before Tuesdays Democratic party primary in New York, where polls say he is trailing Hillary Clinton. After he won seven of the last eight state contests, a loss in Sanders home state would give front-runner Clinton a boost toward the partys presidential nomination. Sanders has said the trip was not a pitch for the Catholic vote but a testament to his admiration for the pontiff. ",politicsNews,"April 16, 2016 ",1
Obama urges more consumer choices for cable TV set-top boxes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday weighed in on the debate over allowing consumers to switch from pricey cable television boxes to less expensive devices, urging regulators to set an example for the rest of government on how to boost competition.     Consumers can spend nearly $1,000 over four years renting cable set-top boxes. Allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, according to the administration.   Competition is good for consumers, President Barack Obama said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. And ultimately its good for business. The more competition we have, the more products, services, innovation takes place. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February proposed a rule to open competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market.  It set a 60-day comment period for the rule that could deal a financial blow to cable companies. The administration issued a rare filing on the rule by the FCC, an independent agency.  The rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Incs Google, Apple Inc and TiVo In, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. It was unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office in January. Cable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal, saying it could stifle innovation. Under the rule, minority programmers would be damaged, consumers would lose privacy protections and be saddled with the costs of re-engineering networks, said Michael Powell, the head of trade group National Cable & Telecommunications Association.   The companies also contended the White House is pressuring the FCC, which they said was inappropriate. This action not only damages the only companies seriously investing to build broadband infrastructure for this country, it also does great harm to the confidence we should be able to have in the impartiality of the FCCs proceedings, said Jim Cicconi, a senior executive vice president at AT&T Inc. Obama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition. In a teleconference call with reporters, Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, would not speculate on what kind of pro-competition measures the order could spur. The administration is looking to add to consumer-friendly actions on cell phones, net neutrality and retirement advice.  This is going to be a whole of government effort to empower consumers, workers and small businesses, Furman said. ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
Former TV 'Apprentices' denounce Trump White House bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former contestants on Donald Trumps reality television show The Apprentice put their old boss in the hot seat on Friday, saying the U.S. Republican front-runner has widened racial divisions and should not be president. Trumps one-time admirers, most from racial minorities, urged the New York billionaire to tamp down his divisive rhetoric as he campaigns to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama in the Nov. 8 election. We are all disappointed and in some ways shocked to see what is being spewed from Donald regarding his views on women, immigrants, and the list goes on, said Randal Pinkett, winner of the 2005 fourth season of the reality television show. We strongly condemn Donalds campaign of sexism, xenophobia, racism, violence and hate, he said at a news conference in Manhattan. Pinkett said Trump is not worthy of the highest office of the land, and said there had been glimpses of those attitudes in private conversations and time spent off-screen with Trump during the making of the TV show. Running for 14 seasons, The Apprentice gave Trump a national platform, and his often blunt and unfiltered style helped make the show a major hit. The show featured groups of business-minded contestants vying for a titular apprenticeship in Trumps organization. At its peak, nearly 21 million people watched the show. Trumps proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States and to build a wall at the Mexican border have drawn criticism even within his party. His campaign has been accused of tacitly encouraging violence at  large and rowdy rallies where Trump supporters have at times clashed with protesters. On Friday evening, as protests broke out at a rally in Hartford, Connecticut, Trump belted out his usual response: Get them out of here! I always say dont hurt that person, right? he said.  Pinkett told Reuters he had contacted former apprentices and said their effort was independent and timed to precede New York states crucial primary election on Tuesday. At the news conference, Pinkett was joined by former Apprentice contestants Tara Dowdell and Kwame Jackson; another former contestant, Marshawn Evans Daniels, participated via video link. Their efforts seemed unlikely to dent Trumps comfortable advantage in New York opinion polls against Republican rivals Ohio Governor John Kasich and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Trump dismissed his former aspiring protgs on Friday as failing wannabes out of hundreds of contestants.  How quickly they forget. Nobody would know who they are if it werent for me, he said in a statement. They just want to get back into the limelight like they had when they were with Trump. Total dishonesty and disloyalty. Trump pulled ahead of Cruz and Kasich this week in the national Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Among Republicans, 45 percent support Trump, compared with 29 percent for Cruz and 21 percent for Kasich.  On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are tied at 47 percent. The poll had a credibility interval of 4.6 percentage points. In an apparent bid to establish a more presidential footing,    Trump turned from his usual platform of Twitter to the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal to denounce the Republican National Committee over a nomination process he said was rigged. Fridays piece, along with an endorsement by tabloid newspaper the New York Post, signaled a possible detente with media magnate Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp (NWSA.O) owns both newspapers. A News Corp spokesman declined to comment on the relationship between the two billionaires. Murdoch took to Twitter last year to denounce Trumps comments that many illegal immigrants from Mexico were bringing crime to the United States, tweeting: Trump wrong. The Journal in July called Trump a catastrophe in a withering editorial. Trump on Wednesday met privately with Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly after a feud that had lasted months. Another Murdoch-controlled company, 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), owns the channel.  NBC, the network that aired The Apprentice, cut ties with Trump last year after he described someMexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. Trumps other well-known NBC venture, the Miss USA pageant and Miss Universe pageants, was also dropped from the line-up around that time.  Other Apprentice contestants have backed Trump, including actors Stephen Baldwin, Gary Busey and Lou Ferrigno, former basketball star Dennis Rodman and reality television star Jesse James. Pinkett, however, in remarks directed at Trump, said: I am calling, we are calling, for you to do better. ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
Sanders' tax returns highlight contrast with rival Clinton,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who has made income inequality a top campaign theme, had taxable income of $205,271 in 2014, putting him almost in the top 5 percent of American earners, according to the release of Friday of his federal tax return. That figure was still far below the millions earned by his main Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in recent years.  Sanders and his wife, Jane, paid $27,653 in federal income taxes in 2014, an effective federal tax rate of 13.5 percent, on income of $205,271, which is their adjusted gross income before deductions. That figure is just below the $206,563 that Census data show as the lower limit for the top 5 percent of U.S. households in 2014. But Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had income approaching $140 million over the last eight years, according to previously released returns. Sanders on Thursday described himself as one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.     Median net worth among members of the U.S. Senate in 2014 stood at $2.9 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit organization that tracks money in politics. The return released on Friday does not include information on Sanders net worth. The return does show Sanders had federal taxable income after deductions of $140,994.  Sanders has run a populist effort, vowing to reform what he calls a corrupt campaign finance system reliant on millionaires and billionaires at the expense of average voters. Clinton, in contrast, has much stronger ties to the financial system, including six-figure payments for speeches she gave to several financial institutions in recent years.  Sanders often expresses skepticism that someone with those kinds of ties can effectively overhaul banks and other institutions. Clinton says she is steadfast in her commitment to eroding income inequality and creating a safe financial system.     The two have clashed repeatedly over the topic - most recently Thursday night at a debate in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. At that event, Sanders promised to release his tax returns after Clinton raised the issue. Youll get them, yes, Sanders said. They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately - unfortunately - I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. Clinton has a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination for the November presidential election. ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
Trump campaign manager says he called reporter after run-in: CNN,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps campaign manager said on Friday he was relieved a battery case against him was over but disputed a reporters claim that he never tried to get in touch after she accused him of bruising her arm. Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said on Thursday that Lewandowski, 42, would not be prosecuted on a misdemeanor battery charge involving Michelle Fields, previously a reporter for the conservative news outlet Breitbart. Police charged him on March 29 with intentionally grabbing and bruising Fields arm at a campaign event.      Lewandowski told CNN he called Fields on the night of the March 8 incident in Florida after seeing her boyfriends Twitter account that something had occurred. He said he never heard back. I didnt know what happened, honestly, he said. It was a brief interaction, and it wasnt memorable to me, and Im sorry about that.

Carnival expects Cuba to allow Cuban-Americans on inaugural cruise,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cruise company Carnival Corporation believes Cuba will soon modify rules that bar Cuban-Americans from traveling on its planned cruises to the island, the company said on Friday, after pressure mounted for the trip to be postponed.  Carnival is due to become the first U.S. cruise company to sail directly to Cuba in more than half a century on May 1, but the exclusion of Cuban-Americans has prompted a lawsuit against the company and protests in Miami. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday that Carnival needs to not discriminate and called on Cuba to change the policy.  A State Department official later said Kerry in no way meant to convey that Carnival is supporting policies that are discriminating against Cuban American travelers. Asked whether Carnival was considering cancelling the trip, spokesman Roger Frizzell said the company was confident Cuba would change its rules before the sailing date.     We continue to believe that Cuba will modify its regulation before we sail on May 1 based on our ongoing discussions with Cuban officials, Frizzell said, citing rules that allow Cuban-Americans to visit Cuba by air as an example.  Cuban-born Americans cannot visit the island by sea, due to a Cuban law that dates to the Cold War era, and therefore are barred from joining in Carnivals sailing to the island.

Protesters nationwide denounce big money in U.S. politics,"BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative and independent protesters channeling themes from the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders dumped faux contributions into Boston Harbor on Friday, one of some 30 nationwide demonstrations planned against big money in politics. In Washington, police arrested 142 members of a more liberal group called Democracy Spring including 12 who cuffed themselves inside the Capitol Rotunda to protest the influence of special interests and to denounce laws making it more difficult to vote. Nearly 1,000 Democracy Spring demonstrators have been arrested in Washington this week. Both the week-long protests in Washington and Fridays nationwide demonstrations led by the activist group Represent.Us have tapped into some of the voter frustration seen on the presidential campaign trail. From super PACs (political action committees) to lucrative job offers and campaign contributions, there are tons of perfectly legal ways to bribe a politician, said Charlotte Hill, communications director for Represent.Us. The group, which has promoted anti-corruption resolutions in American cities, says it neither endorses nor opposes any presidential candidate. Represent.Us said it would stage events in 33 cities. Trump, a billionaire Republican, and Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist running for the Democratic nomination, have both criticized the influence of large campaign contributions in their surprising runs for the White House. It doesnt matter if youre conservative or progressive. Two hundred and forty-three years after the original Boston Tea Party, Americans of all political stripes are still facing taxation without political representation, said Dan Krassner, political director of Represent.Us. About 40 activists attended the symbolic re-staging of the Boston Tea Party near the spot where American colonists dumped tea into the harbor to protest taxes levied by the British. Represent.Us activists tossed a stack of wooden crates into the water, representing campaign contributions. In Washington on Friday, Democracy Spring activists cuffed themselves to scaffolding in the Capitol Rotunda.  We the people demand a democracy free from the corruption influence of big money and voter suppression, the protesters said in unison. Another 130 were arrested for unlawful demonstrations, Capitol Police said. A few hundred chanting demonstrators marched up Capitol Hill with signs saying Sweep Big Money out of Politics and Corporations are not people. They also protested the high cost of college loans, economic inequality and fracking. We need to get money out of politics and overturn Citizens United (a Supreme Court decision on campaign contributions), said David Cheplowitz, 27, of Rochester, New York.

U.N. rights chief decries 'bigotry' in U.S. presidential race,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights launched a thinly veiled attack on U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and other presidential hopefuls on Friday, in a speech entitled The road to violence. Bigotry is not proof of strong leadership. It is evidence of the lowest and most craven lack of faith in the principles that uphold a land of the free, Zeid Raad al Hussein said in a speech at a university in Cleveland, Ohio.  Less than 150 miles away from where I speak, a front-running candidate to be President of this country declared, just a few months ago, his enthusiastic support for torture,... inflicting intolerable pain on people, in order to force them to deliver or invent information that they may not have.  We have heard hateful slander of foreigners, and multiple candidates declaring their support for extensive and intrusive surveillance of people based on their religious beliefs  vast and discriminatory systems to single out and discriminate against Muslims. Zeids speech, the Klatsky Lecture at Case Western Reserve University, also recalled the Nazi holocaust and the genocide of Bosnian Muslims for which former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was jailed last month.  He said the eyes of the world would be on Cleveland when it hosts the Republican National Convention in July, and it was his deepest hope that Americans would use it to demonstrate their profound understanding of human dignity and human rights. And yet, in what may be a crucial election for leadership of this country later this year, we have seen a full-frontal attack  disguised as courageous taboo-busting  on some fundamental, hard-won tenets of decency and social cohesion that have come to be accepted by American society. He said the price for the dangerously divisive rhetoric would be paid by innocent people falling victim to violent acts, not by politicians. We have heard these calls to hatred  calls stigmatizing and demonizing minorities, beginning the validation of violence, he said. Real courage would mean standing up for the great and enduring values of this society.   ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
"Puerto Rico rescue falters under attack by conservatives, investors","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An aggressive advertising and lobbying campaign by conservative activists and financial interests this week stalled a plan in the U.S. Congress to rescue Puerto Rico from crippling debt, while lawmakers adjourned on Friday with no clear path forward. As its economy reels and basic services are threatened, the U.S. island territory is pleading for help from Washington, but lawmakers have been unable to formulate a response, or even estimate when they might be able to advance a legislative fix. Puerto Rico is staring down a May 1 deadline for paying about $422 million to Government Development Bank bondholders. With that as a backdrop, the Republicans who control the U.S. House of Representatives huddled privately for 90 minutes on Friday to hear ideas, then decided to go home. There may be different ways to fix a problem that may include doing nothing and allow it to work through the court system, conservative Republican Representative Mick Mulvaney, of South Carolina, told reporters following the meeting. In the face of an election-year wave of radio, television and print advertisements warning of a federal bailout for Puerto Rico, House Republicans had already put off planned committee votes on a rescue package earlier this week. The Center for Individual Freedom, a conservative activist group, has spent $200,000 on television advertisements around Washington, D.C., this month, according to the Sunlight Foundation, a lobbying watchdog. The centers ads call for a halt to the Washington bailout of Puerto Rico. Another group that opposes a Puerto Rico rescue, Main Street Bondholders, has run newspaper ads. Radio spots have reached Utah voters warning of a radical plan to usher Puerto Rico into bankruptcy and urging local Representative Rob Bishop to protect investors. Bishop chairs the House committee overseeing Puerto Rico legislation. With a 45 percent poverty rate and $72 billion in debt, Puerto Rico needs an orderly way to shed some of its debt, leading Republicans agree, though compromise on details remains elusive. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the Obama administration and congressional Democrats support a rescue effort to help Puerto Rico. A proposal backed by Ryan and Bishop would lead investors towards a voluntary reduction of loans and a compulsory write-down if no compromise were possible. Democrats have pressed for changes to a draft bill, knowing their votes likely will be needed to win passage in the House. Ryan has insisted that there is no bailout under development, while scurrying to figure out how he can please conservative Republicans without alienating too many Democrats. Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, a conservative stalwart, told reporters: The liberal, financially irresponsible members of the Republican conference will cozy up to the Democrats and they will work out an agreement. Anti-rescue ads are also running in Louisiana, whose  Representative Garret Graves said on Friday: The campaign has been effective in distorting reality. ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
Obamas donated less to charities in 2015 as income slipped,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle donated less to charities in 2015 as their income also dipped, tax returns released by the White House showed on Friday. The Obamas donated $64,066 to 34 charities last year, down nearly 9.4 percent from their donations of $70,712 in 2014 to 33 charities.  For both years, the couple donated slightly less than 15 percent of their income to charity. On average, Americans donate about 3 percent of their income to charity, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. The Obamas earned $436,065 in 2015, down nearly 8.7 percent from $477,383 in 2014, continuing a downward trend as sales of the presidents books slowed. As president, Obama is entitled to a $400,000 annual salary. Most of the rest of the couples income came from the book sales.  Their top charity donation of $9,066 went to Fisher House Foundation, which provides housing for military families near military hospitals. The couple gave the organization $22,012 in 2014.  The couple also gave $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation, an organization that honors the life of Vice President Joe Bidens son, who died of brain cancer last year.  The Obamas paid $81,472 in total tax, with an effective federal income tax rate of 18.7 percent. Biden and his wife Jill, a community college professor,  reported a combined income of $392,233, up from $388,844 in 2014.   ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
Obama tax inversion rules may overstep authority: U.S. lawmaker,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas proposed rules to stop U.S. companies from reincorporating abroad, if only on paper, to avoid U.S. income taxes appear to overstep legal authority, a top Republican lawmaker said on Friday. Representative Kevin Brady said his staff is scrutinizing the rules, which were unveiled last week by the U.S. Treasury Department. Legal experts have offered mixed views on the viability of any court challenge.  The new rules, intended to discourage tax inversions, led to the collapse of U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Incs $160 billion acquisition of Irelands Allergan Plc. We recognize there is broad discretion in some areas of that tax code, Brady, a Texas Republican and chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But it certainly appears that Treasury overstepped its authority, especially in effect, taking legislative proposalsthat havent passed this Congress or any other Congress and essentially making it law through regulation. Brady gave no indication of what his committee might do. It was unclear what action, if any, the Republican-controlled Congress would take against the inversion rules in an election year marked by voter anger over taxes and international trade. I share the concern about inversions. Everyone does. But theres a right way and a wrong way to tackle them, Brady said.  An inversion is a tax-driven deal in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller, foreign business and adopts its tax domicile to reduce the combined companys overall tax burden. The deals most often involve reincorporating in Ireland or Britain. Though inversions have been going since the 1980s, a new wave has been under way for about five years. The Pfizer-Allergan deal would have been the biggest inversion of all time. There is bipartisan agreement on the need for comprehensive tax reform to address inversions, but the deeply divided Congress is unlikely to tackle this until 2017, especially with elections coming in November, analysts said. In the interim, the Obama administration has tightened  inversion rules in limited areas, drawing Republican criticism.  The administrations strategy wont solve the fundamental problem and likely will make it worse, Brady said. ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
Mississippi governor signs law allowing armed church security,"(Reuters) - Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed a gun rights bill on Friday allowing churches to create security programs designating members to carry firearms to defend worshipers against violence. The legislation, called the Mississippi Church Protection Act, also makes it easier for residents in other settings to carry concealed weapons, drawing criticism from national gun control advocates. It was passed amid heightened concerns about church security after a gunman last June killed nine black worshippers during a Bible study session at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, an attack that authorities say was racially motivated.  Churches deserve protection from those who would harm worshippers, said Bryant, a Republican, in a Twitter post explaining his decision to sign the measure into law. In most states, churches could address security concerns with similar programs without the need for a new law, according to Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association gun rights lobbying group which supported the measure providing civil liability immunity. The legislation also allows Mississippi residents eligible to own a gun to carry a firearm in holsters without a permit, she said, expanding on a state law enacted last year allowing for similar access in purses, bags and briefcases. However, gun control proponents called the law dangerous. Mississippi law enforcement, families and faith leaders all spoke out against this reckless bill that will allow dangerous people to carry hidden, loaded handguns in public without a permit, said Shirley Hopkins Davis, a volunteer with the Mississippi chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, in a statement. Participants carrying firearms for church security programs must have safety training and meet permitting standards. (Story refiles to fix typo in eighth graph to public).

Sanders at Vatican says rich-poor gap worse than 100 years ago,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, addressing a Vatican conference on social justice on Friday, decried the immoral gap between the worlds rich and poor that he said was worse than a century ago. The Democratic hopeful from Vermont has campaigned on a vow to rein in corporate power and level the economic playing field for working and lower-income Americans who he says have been left behind, a message echoing that of Pope Francis. The trip is inconveniently timed for 74-year-old senator,  coming four days before a Democratic party primary in New York. A loss there would blunt his momentum after winning seven of the last eight state contests and give front-runner Hillary Clinton a boost in her drive to the partys presidential nomination. Sanders said in his speech to the Pontifical Academy of Social Science that the Roman Catholic Churchs first encyclical on social justice, written in 1891 by Pope Leo XIII, lamented the enormous gap between the rich and the poor. That situation is worse today. In the year 2016, the top 1 percent of the people on this planet own more wealth than the bottom 99 percent, the self-described democratic socialist said. At a time when so few have so much, and so many have so little, we must reject the foundations of this contemporary economy as immoral and unsustainable, he said. Sanders, the Brooklyn-born son of Polish Jewish immigrants, has said the trip was not a pitch for the Catholic vote but a testament to his admiration for Pope Francis, whom he is not expected to see during his flying visit.  He will be back on the campaign trail on Sunday. After reading the speech in the academy building inside the Vatican grounds, Sanders walked outside one of the city-states gates to talk to reporters and was greeted by chants of Bernie, Bernie, Bernie from a vocal group of local supporters. Pope Francis sent a message to the academy, saying he had wanted to meet the conference participants in the evening, but could not because he is leaving Rome early on Saturday to visit refugees on the Greek island of Lesbos. Saying he was proud and excited to be here, Sanders praised the popes visionary views about creating a moral economy, an economy that works for all people and not just for the people on top. Reflecting the themes of his campaign, he said he and the pope both agreed that weve got to ingrain moral principles into our economy and there is no area where that is clearer than the area of climate change. The greed of the fossil fuel industry is literally destroying our planet. Pope Francis wrote a major encyclical, or papal treatise, last year on the need to respect the environment.     In other parts of his speech, Sanders decried reckless financial deregulation, including rules on political party financing, that he said had established a system in which billionaires can buy elections in exchange for laws that would make them only richer. Rather than an economy aimed at the common good, we have been left with an economy operated for the top one percent, who get richer and richer as the working class, the young and the poor fall further and further behind, he said. Sanders will spend less than 24 hours in Rome before returning to the campaign trail before the New York primary on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
Immigrants in limbo as U.S. top court weighs Obama action,"BALTIMORE (Reuters) - In the port city of Baltimore, where Europeans once streamed into America after crossing the Atlantic by ship, a 47-year-old immigrant named Rhonda is in a desperate position. She said she wants to provide for her teenage daughter but cannot get a work permit because she is in the United States illegally. Id like, as a parent, to provide for my daughters needs. Homelessness and moving around has been rough, said Rhonda, a native of Trinidad and Tobago who has lived in the United States since 2001 and spoke on condition that her last name not be used to protect her daughter. In Houston, Daniel Castillo Garcia said he is apprehensive about his toddler sons future because the 19-year-old Mexican native is in deportation proceedings after being picked up by U.S. federal agents near the border. Im very worried for my son because I need to provide for him, said Garcia, who has lived in the United States since being brought into the country by his mother as a child in 2007. For these two and many others like them, perhaps their only realistic hope is that the U.S. Supreme Court revives President Barack Obamas 2014 executive action on immigration, which was thrown out by a lower court. That plan was designed to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, do not have a criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. Rhondas 16-year-old daughter and Garcias 2-year-old son are citizens by virtue of being born in the United States. The court hears the case on Monday and is due to rule by the end of June. Rhonda said she cannot get a work permit because she overstayed her original 10-year visa. She and her daughter are staying in temporary housing provided by her church because she has no income. For a year, she was separated from her daughter, who plays the violin and hopes to attend college, because they could find nowhere to live together. Rhonda, who said her Christian faith keeps her positive, believes work authorization would make the difference because employers increasingly demand such documentation. Thats why Im in such hardship. Im very anxious for something to happen, she said. In Baltimores heavily Latino Fells Point neighborhood, South Broadway is lined with store fronts advertising services in Spanish, ranging from tax preparation to cellphone providers. Catholic Charities runs an immigrant resource center offering legal advice as well as education and health services. Its managing attorney, Adonia Simpson, said about half the roughly 600 people she counsels annually have no option beyond Obamas program, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), if they want to legalize their status and get work permits. Initial enthusiasm about Obamas plan waned when a federal judge put it on hold in February 2015, just before it was due to begin. All Simpson can do for now is ask clients to gather documentation to be ready to apply. The community is getting very discouraged, Simpson said. In Maryland alone, about 56,000 people could be eligible for the DAPA program, according to the Migration Policy Institute think tank. Obamas plan was challenged by Texas and 25 other states that argued he exceeded his authority in bypassing Congress to take the actions. The president has violated the Constitution, and we are trying to prevent the president from implementing executive action that we believe is lawless, Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said. The Supreme Court is hearing the case at a time when immigration has become a hot issue in the U.S. presidential campaign, with top Republican contenders calling for all illegal immigrants to be deported. An estimated 11 million immigrants are in the country illegally. In Houston, Garcia has pinned his hopes on the court reinstating Obamas program. DAPA will help me get that freedom and help me to keep going and have a good future for myself and my son, Garcia said in an interview translated from Spanish by his attorney.

"Clinton, Sanders Democratic debate draws 5.6 million viewers: CNN","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The latest 2016 presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders drew an audience of some 5.6 million TV viewers, CNN said on Friday, below other recent Democratic debates. Thursdays debate, aired live from Brooklyn, saw front-runner Clinton and Bernie Sanders challenged each others judgment and experience ahead of Tuesdays crucial nominating contest in New York. Clinton and Sanders attacked each other over Wall Street, gun control and other issues on Thursday in a series of exchanges that laid bare the mounting pressures on them both but seemed unlikely to change the dynamics of the race. CNN said Thursdays debate ranked 7th among Democratic debates this presidential cycle. Audiences for Republican debates have generally been twice as high as those for the Democratic contenders.

Most House members sign letter backing Israel at U.N.,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 90 percent of the U.S. House of Representatives has signed a letter urging President Barack Obama to use U.S. veto power to block any United Nations resolutions seen as biased against Israel, one of the letters lead sponsors said on Friday. U.S. Representative Nita Lowey said 394 members of the 435-member House signed the letter that was sent to Obama on Thursday. It was written as the Palestinian Authority renewed its drive to persuade the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israeli settlements in Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The United States vetoed a similar resolution in the Security Council five years ago. With U.S. efforts to broker a two-state solution in tatters since 2014, France has been lobbying countries to commit to a conference that would get Israelis and Palestinians back to negotiations to end their conflict. The congressional letter backed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but insisted that negotiations between the two sides are the only path to peace, not United Nations action or an international conference. The only way you can get there is if the two parties can be brought together and really go over all the issues, Lowey said in a telephone interview. Lowey is the top Democrat on the House subcommittee that oversees U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid. Republican Representative Kay Granger, who chairs the subcommittee, also sponsored the letter. Lowey said she had not yet had a response to the letter, but she hoped administration officials were carefully reading it. Support for Israel is one of the few issues that has the support of Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress. ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmaker calls on IRS chief to resign over handling of hacked data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service should resign due to the agencys inability to improve its defenses against hacks on taxpayer data, a Republican lawmaker said on Friday. Republican Representative Barbara Comstock said new leadership is needed to replace IRS Commissioner John Koskinen due to failures to secure Americans sensitive information from malicious intrusions, escalating a line of attack from Republicans who frequently criticize the federal tax collection service. Commissioner Koskinen has provided little confidence that cyber security is a top priority at the IRS, Comstock said in a statement shared with Reuters, adding she was concerned the agency apparently has no one in charge of cyber security. The IRS did not immediately comment. More than 700,000 individuals may have had their personal information pilfered by hackers during an intrusion last year, the IRS announced in February. That number has been repeatedly revised upward from initial estimates that were far smaller. Comstock, in her statement, cited a Government Accountability Office report released last month that found the IRS struggling to upgrade its information security plan. The IRS agreed to work toward implementing dozens of outlined recommendations. Koskinen appeared before congressional committees this week and said complying with the GAO recommendations was a priority. The commissioner has been under near-constant fire from Republicans since he took over the agency in 2013 amid controversy over whether the IRS was targeting conservative groups.  More than 60 Republicans have signed on to a resolution introduced in October to impeach Koskinen on charges that he has impeded a congressional investigation into the IRSs treatment of conservative groups. Comstock is the first lawmaker to call for Koskinens resignation solely for cyber security reasons, an aide said. Koskinen is not the first Obama administration official to be targeted by Congress for his handling of cyber security. Last year Katherine Archuleta, head of the Office of Personnel Management, resigned after several lawmakers from both parties called for her ouster following the theft of personal data of more than 21 million individuals. Comstock said Friday that Koskinen should follow the lead of Archuleta and other top executives who have left due to poor handling of hacks to allow for new and trusted leadership at the IRS.

Republican Party says complaints over delegates 'distracting',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican officials on Friday defended the process for selecting delegates who will choose the partys presidential nominee, denying a barrage of accusations from front-runner Donald Trump that it is a rigged system aimed at subverting him.Front-runner Trump has skewered the party during the past week because of rules he has lambasted as crooked and said the Republican National Committee should be ashamed of themselves. The New York billionaire moved from his preferred platforms of Twitter and television interviews to a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Friday to air his views on the delegate-selection rules, which vary from state to state. What we are seeing now is not a proper use of the rules, but a flagrant abuse of the rules, Trump wrote. The RNC has stood by its process and the friction between party officials and Trump has increased all week. Without mentioning Trump by name, the party released a statement on Friday outlining the delegate selection process in states with upcoming contests - plans it said have been in place since October. The rules surrounding the delegate selection have been clearly laid out in every state and territory and while each state is different, each process is easy to understand for those willing to learn it, the party statement said. It ultimately falls on the campaigns to be up to speed on these delegate rules. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus emphasized each state writes its own rules.  The complaining that goes on is something that I think probably distracts from what we really need to do, which is come together as Republicans, Priebus said on NBCs Today program. Trump is leading among the three Republicans seeking the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election to oppose either former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side. The real estate mogul must win 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination before the partys July 18-21 convention in Cleveland. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz is trying to block Trump from reaching that number on the first round of ballot voting in hopes of triggering a contested convention. That could allow Cruz, Ohio Governor John Kasich or another last-minute entrant to win the Republican nominee. Trump has blasted such a scenario. The political insiders have had their way for a long time, he said in the Journal, posted online Thursday. Let 2016 be remembered as the year the American people finally got theirs.

"Cruz says will target taxes, bank regulation if elected: CNBC interview","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on Friday he would make lifting tax and regulatory burdens a priority if elected president and protect the small banks he said were being hurt by stricter bank regulations. Cruz, who is running to become the partys 2016 nominee in the Nov. 8 presidential election, targeted the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law as enabling the nations large banks. The big banks have all gotten bigger, Cruz said in a CNBC interview. Cruz has said he would not bail out big banks if they failed again, as the did during the 2007-8 financial crisis triggered by faulty mortgage lending practices. The people that have been hammered are the little guys, he said. Its the community banks, its the small financial institutions that are going out of business at a record pace. The lawyers and lobbyist for giant banks were in the room with the Democratic senators who wrote Dodd-Frank because they could absorb the cost of that while the little banks could not, Cruz said. Cruz said the nations tax structure is helping strangle U.S. economic growth and he would try to scale back taxes including corporate and death taxes. Cruz has advocated a flat tax rate, which he acknowledged would be difficult to enact. Cruz said he would also try to achieve monetary stability and end the roller coaster with the U.S. dollar. The U.S. senator from Texas told CNBC that a higher minimum wage would cost U.S. jobs and that setting minimum wage should be left up to states. Raising the federal minimum wage has been a cornerstone of the Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, although the two disagree on how much it should be raised from the current $7.25. Republicans generally do not embrace a high minimum wage and front-runner Donald Trump has embraced a lower federal rate. ",politicsNews,"April 15, 2016 ",1
"In Wyoming, Cruz shows edge over Trump in grasp of nuances of White House race","(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ted Cruz is poised to notch another small but important victory in his battle with billionaire Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination at a hotel convention center in the ranching city of Casper, Wyoming, this weekend.  A committee of Wyoming Republicans is likely to hand Cruz most of the states 14 remaining delegates to the partys national convention in July, political operatives, including Trump supporters in the state, told Reuters. That may not seem like a big number, but both men are engaged in a fierce struggle to win as many as possible of the party insiders who could decide the presidential nominee at a contested convention.  Cruzs strength in Wyoming underscores the contrast between the way the rivals handle this nuance of American politics: where Cruz focuses on organizing at a minute level to court delegates in preparation for a convention fight, Trump has run a national campaign focused on winning the popular vote in early nominating contests and has paid little attention to the more arcane elements of U.S. presidential politics.    Cruzs effort has included personal visits to far-flung areas, regular conference calls among his state supporters, and hospitality suites to court backers within state parties, while Trump has assailed the delegate system as rigged and only recently reorganized his campaign to focus on them.  I think Cruz has done a good job with how they targeted states, said Jason Osborne, a Republican strategist who has advised Trump, and who previously worked on former candidate Ben Carsons campaign. An operation like Trumps was built for something completely different.  Trumps campaign did not respond to requests for comment.  The United States has a unique system for picking presidential nominees. A combination of nominating polls  usually in the form of state primaries, caucuses, and party conventions  are used to apportion delegates to candidates.  In the Republican race, a candidate needs to win a majority of the total 2,472 delegates to get the nomination. While Trump has won 21 state nominating contests so far to Cruzs nine, the billionaire leads the Texas senator by only 208 delegates (743-545).  To avoid a convention fight, Trump needs 1,237 delegates to secure the nomination. That means he has to win nearly 60 percent of the remaining delegates before July.  Cruzs effort in Wyoming, Americas least populous state, is a window into his broader delegate strategy and helps explain how he has become a formidable candidate despite his relatively underdog performance in the primaries so far.  The effort began in 2015, while most other candidates were focused on the early races in Iowa or New Hampshire. Ed Buchanan, a trial attorney in Cheyenne, got a call from Heidi Cruz, the candidates wife, in October asking if he would become the state chairman for Cruzs presidential campaign.  Buchanan, a former speaker of the State House, agreed to the role, which has taken him to every corner of the state trying to court support and build a slate of delegates.  Some states allow the voters to select the delegates who will attend the Republican convention on their behalf, but in most, like Wyoming, Colorado and North Dakota, voters have no say in who goes to Cleveland.  If Trump doesnt have the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, many delegates will become free at the July convention to pick a candidate based on their personal preference, not the choice of the voters in their state.  That is why campaigns want their supporters among the delegates and that is where Buchanan comes in.  He is responsible for assembling a list of the Cruz campaigns preferred delegates, which he will present to the Casper conference. Each would-be Cruz delegate has promised not to switch allegiances if the voting at the Cleveland convention goes beyond one ballot.  Buchanan expects them to stick to their word. If they dont, it will not go unnoticed, he said.  Its a small state. The people who are in political circles know each other and that would not be forgotten, he said.  In Wyoming, Cruz won nine of the 12 delegates who were selected at county-level meetings in March. Nearly 1,000 of the states most active party members will decide in Casper this weekend the remaining 14 delegates to be voted on.  Cruz will speak on Saturday and his supporters have organized a hospitality room, where they will have freebies like campaign buttons and food.  Trump has not campaigned in the state and will spend the weekend in New York, which holds a major primary next week. He will send former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in his stead.  Cruz was here, and that makes a difference to a small state, former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming said in an interview.  Trump has been slow to adapt his campaign to the delegate fight and has instead attacked the process.  I know the rules very well, but I know its stacked against me by the establishment, Trump said on CNN on Tuesday.  It is likely now too late to combat Cruzs operation in Wyoming.  Dick Shanor, who will attend the national convention to support Cruz, said supporters organized to get like-minded voters to show up at the county elections last month, helping the senator to score those early delegate wins.  Jack Volsey, a Trump supporter from Rock Springs, Wyoming, had a different experience. He said he sent a message to a pro-Trump Facebook group in the state asking how he could participate in his county convention, but he never heard back. He was eventually selected as an alternate delegate to this weekends gathering, but he has decided not to go.  Im not going to go there to sit on the sidelines when Im sure its a done deal already.

Trump talks up 'New York values' as protesters demonstrate against him,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Thursday talked up New York values and urged his home state voters to give him a big win next week, but his rivals warned nominating Trump could lead to disastrous losses to the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. The New York billionaire is in danger of being forced to try to capture the Republican presidential nomination through a contested convention because opposition from rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich is chipping away at his lead. As protesters chanted outside and waved signs against Trump, Trump told the New York state Republican Partys gala that he needs the momentum that a victory in the states primary would bring next Tuesday. New York is so important, Trump said, trying to regain the momentum he lost after Cruz defeated him in Wisconsin last week and captured all of Colorados delegates. Trump identified himself with New York values of hard work and compassion after Cruz charged Trumps version of these values are basically Democratic positions. Whether Trump can win the 1,237 delegates he needs for the nomination is an open question as both Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and Ohio Governor Kasich, try to block him from getting enough delegates. They want to extend the fight to a contested convention in Cleveland when Republicans gather to formally choose their nominee in July. In his speech to the group, Kasich tried to raise questions about Trump without mentioning his name. He said Republican candidates across the country would be at risk with a candidate with a negative message at the top of the ballot. Trump has drawn many protests for policy positions that include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, deporting 11 million illegal immigrants and banning Muslims temporarily from entering the United States. We risk losing everything from the White House to the courthouse to the state house if we dont advance a positive, uplifting, unifying message to this country. That is what we need to do, said Kasich, who spoke after Trump. Cruz, speaking after Kasich, continued the theme, pointing to polls showing Trump losing badly to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and getting far less support from women and minority voters. Cruz presented himself as a unity candidate who can bring the various wings of the party together. If we nominate a candidate who loses to Hillary Clinton by double digits, who loses to women by 20 points, who loses Hispanics by 40 points, who loses young people, we cannot win in the general (election), said Cruz. Before the event started in the Grand Hyatt hotel near Grand Central Station, a group of protesters stormed the hotel mezzanine with a banner that read: NYC Rejects the Party of Hate. Eleven of them were reported arrested. Outside the hotel, many anti-Trump demonstrators called the New York billionaire businessman a fascist or white supremacist. They even teased him about his signature hairdo. We Shall Over Comb, read one sign. Others said: Deport Trump, No allegiance for Trump, and Black lives matter. A series of speakers addressed the protest crowd with a loudspeaker. Police set up portable barriers to keep protesters separated from traffic and allow pedestrians to pass on busy 42nd Street.  Although Trump is from here, there is no place for him here, said one of the speakers, Nabil Hassein, 27, of the group Millions March NYC.  Kasich scored a victory with the endorsement of former New York Governor George Pataki, an unsuccessful candidate for the  Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election.The Trump campaign got some good news when a Florida prosecutor announced that Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, would not be prosecuted on a misdemeanor battery charge involving a reporter he was accused of grabbing at an event last month.

John Kerry: Carnival should not bar Cuban-Americans from cruises to Cuba,"MIAMI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned Carnival Corp  on Thursday for barring Cuban-Americans from its planned cruises to Cuba and called on the Cuban government to change its policies to allow them. Carnival needs to not discriminate, Kerry said in an interview with CNN en Espanol and the Miami Herald. Cuban-born Americans cannot visit the island by sea, due to a Cuban law that dates to the Cold War era, and therefore are barred from joining in Carnivals sailings to the island, the Miami Herald has reported. People born in Cuba can, however, travel to the island on an airplane. American citizens, Cuban Americans have a right to travel, and we should not be in a situation where the Cuban government is forcing its discrimination policy on us, Kerry said. So we call on the government of Cuba to change that policy and to recognize that if they want a full relationship, a normal relationship, with the United States, they have to live by international law and not exclusively by their own, he said during a trip to Miami. Carnival officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company has told the Miami Herald it had no choice but to enforce the rule when booking tickets for its new Miami-to-Havana route. It said it has asked the Cuban government to waive the rule before the first ship sails on May 1. A State Department official said, Secretary Kerry in no way meant to convey that Carnival is supporting policies that are discriminating against Cuban American travelers. Miami is the center of the U.S. Cuban-American community, and many of its residents from the island nation, who fled Cuba after its Communist revolution, are vehemently opposed to President Barack Obamas moves toward more normal relations with Havana. Critics of the policy say Washington should not ease a half century of restrictions on travel and trade until Cuba has free elections and its human rights record improves.  Kerry, who gave two interviews to local media, met with business leaders and addressed college students, said Cuba could move more quickly to improve its rights record. But he said he was sure a more open relationship with the United States would yield positive changes. I think more could happen faster. More should happen faster. But Im not surprised. Nobody expected that. This has been 50-plus years of the status quo ... but there are changes that are in place for the positive, Kerry said. ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
Democrats to sue Arizona officials over primary voting problems,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - The Democratic National Committee will file a federal lawsuit over the actions of Arizona election officials during the presidential primary that caused long waits at the polls and critics said disenfranchised voters, especially minorities.   Officials said the lawsuit, to be filed in U.S. District Court in Arizona on Friday, will target the decision to sharply reduce polling locations in Maricopa County, which caused up to five-hour waits for voters casting ballots in the March 22 primary. The lawsuit will also question the states arbitrary rejection of provisional ballots at alarming rates, with a large number coming from minority voters, according to a DNC statement. Republicans are using every tool, every legal loophole and every fear tactic they can think of to take aim at voting rights wherever they can, the DNC chair, U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said in a statement.  Joining the suit will be the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Arizona Democratic Party, former Navajo Nation leader Peterson Zah, the Ann Kirkpatrick for Senate campaign and affected voters, the statement said. The Democratic nominating contest for the Nov. 8 presidential election was won by Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. Their campaigns both said they would join the lawsuit. Named as defendants in the legal action are Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell. A spokesman for the secretary of state declined to comment on the specifics of the case, saying: The secretary welcomes any inquiry.  A spokeswoman for Purcell declined to comment but told CNN last week there were no intentional efforts to keep people from voting. The election became mired in controversy from the outset as county voters spent hours to vote at one of 60 polling sites, a reduction from 200 sites in 2012. Officials said the move was an effort to cut costs. County officials immediately took the blame for the decision, saying they misjudged voter turnout based on recent history and increasing mail-in votes.  The election, called unacceptable by the states governor and a fiasco by the Phoenix mayor, has prompted questions by the U.S. Department of Justice over its handling by county officials.  The county, Arizonas most populous, has said it will comply with an April 22 request for information from the head of the voting section of the departments civil rights division. A county spokeswoman had no comment on the lawsuit. ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
No prosecution for Trump campaign manager Florida battery charge,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps campaign manager will not be prosecuted in Florida on a misdemeanor battery charge involving a reporter, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said on Thursday. Corey Lewandowski, 42, was charged on March 29 by police in Jupiter with intentionally grabbing and bruising the arm of Michelle Fields, then a reporter for the conservative news outlet Breitbart. The incident occurred when Fields tried to question Trump at a campaign event on March 8. Mr. Lewandowski has a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. There is insufficient evidence to rebut these defenses, said Aronberg, a Democrat, noting that Lewandowski had grabbed the reporters arm against her will. Aronbergs office said it faced a legally higher standard than law enforcement. State prosecutors offices must show proof of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and whether there is a reasonable chance of conviction. Law enforcement can bring charges on probable cause, and Aronberg said police had acted appropriately.  He added that politics did not factor into his decision. Police released a video of the incident showing Fields walking alongside Trump and trying to question him. Lewandowski is seen grabbing her arm and pulling her backward. Fields had brushed or touched Trumps arm following a campaign news conference, after which Lewandowski reached out and grabbed her arm, said Aronberg, citing a video recording. Trump has repeatedly defended Lewandowski, and the campaign released a statement noting that the campaign manager was gratified by the decision of prosecutors. Lewandowski appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the Palm Beach State Attorney and his staff who carefully reviewed this matter, as well as Mr. Trumps loyalty and the support of his colleagues and family during this time, the statement said.  But the decision was a disappointment to Fields, Aronberg said, noting that his office had talked with her on Thursday. Fields on Wednesday posted on Twitter, For those asking, office of prosecutor asked 2 weeks ago if Id be ok with an apology from Corey. I said ya but havent heard back about it. Aronberg said an apology to the reporter might have avoided the legal proceedings. ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
"Apple, FBI to clash again in Congress over encryption","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the FBI will return to Congress next week to testify before lawmakers about their heated disagreement over law enforcement access to encrypted devices, a congressional committee announced on Thursday.  Apples general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and Amy Hess, executive assistant director for science and technology at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, will testify on separate panels before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday, in addition to other law enforcement officials and technology experts. FBI Director James Comey appeared before a separate congressional committee last month to defend his agencys pursuit of a court order to compel Apples assistance in unlocking an iPhone linked to one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters. Sewell also testified at that hearing. The FBI has since abandoned the San Bernardino case, a surprising development that came after a still-secret third party helped the government hack into the iPhone. But the U.S. Justice Department redoubled its efforts last week to use the courts to force Apples cooperation in cracking encrypted iPhones by announcing plans to continue with an appeal in an unrelated New York drug case. Other witnesses appearing include Thomas Galati, chief of the New York Police Departments intelligence bureau; Charles Cohen, commander of the Indiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force; and Matthew Blaze, a professor and computer security expert at the University of Pennsylvania. Earlier this week, two U.S. senators released draft legislation that would empower courts to order technology companies to hand over data in an intelligible format, even if encryption has rendered that data inaccessible to anyone other than the owner. Security researchers and civil liberties advocates say the bill amounts to a ban on strong encryption, which is necessary to keep malicious hackers at bay and protect the overall security of the Internet.

"Cyber as big a threat as Iran, North Korean ICBMs: U.S. admiral","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Constant cyber attacks on the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and its key weapons programs pose as great a threat as development of intercontinental ballistic missiles by Iran and North Korea, the admiral who heads the agency said on Thursday. Vice Admiral James Syring told a House Armed Services subcommittee that the agency had taken inordinate measures to defend its own networks, but he remained concerned about potential vulnerabilities among defense contractors. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency develops and runs a multilayered system of defenses against ballistic missile attacks by potential enemies. The system includes ground-based interceptor missiles in Alaska and California as well as high-end radar equipment to detect attacks. Syring said the agency carried out continuous monitoring of its classified and unclassified networks, but said cyber attacks were increasingly directed against private contractors and unclassified, controlled technical information that they housed on their networks. What weve got to do is get them up to where we are in terms of our protection levels, and I view it as a very near-term, very real requirement across the (Ballistic Missile Defense System), he said. U.S. defense officials have been increasingly vocal about escalating and constant cyber attacks originating from China, Russia and other countries. Syring did not answer directly when asked about his knowledge of attacks on the agencys networks by China or the Chinese military, telling lawmakers he would provide fuller answers during a classified hearing.  Syring told a similar Senate hearing on Wednesday that the agency was working hand-in-glove with private contractors to ensure that future contracts contained the necessary cyber security requirements, protections and standards. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told Reuters this week that the Pentagons Cyber Investment Management Board had prepared a list of top-priority weapons programs that required cyber security updates and investments. He said the details were classified, but said some of those programs were launched years ago before cyber attacks became commonplace. ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
Senate committee approves authorization for U.S. commodities regulator,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday approved a reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, nearly three years after the legislative authority for the countrys commodities and swaps regulator expired. The head of the CFTC, Timothy Massad, praised the committee for clearing the way for the full Senate to vote on authorization. I am committed to continuing to work with Congress throughout this process, particularly on making sure end-users like agricultural producers can continue to safely and affordably use the derivatives markets, while ensuring these markets do not generate excessive risk to our financial system, he said in a statement.  The CFTC has operated on year-by-year funding since the end of 2013 because Congress has not passed a new authorization, which lawmakers say created uncertainty in many markets. The House of Representatives has already approved a similar bill. Republicans, who control the Senate, said the bill would allow farmers, ranchers and small energy providers to use derivatives for hedging operational costs without being ensnared in regulation intended to prevent the risky type of swap deals that contributed to the financial crisis.  The bill allows for anticipatory hedges and the management of a hedge when it serves as a risk management tool for our producers and commercial end-users and not an investment or for speculation, said Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas. Still, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a proponent of strong Wall Street oversight, said the bill as written would also benefit financial players. Its clear that this bill is all about helping Wall Street traders and big energy companies like Koch Industries under the guise of helping farmers, he said. Massads major concern involved funding. The senior Democrat on the committee, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, sought to add a provision that would create a model for backing the CFTC similar to that used for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which offsets taxpayer funds it receives with fees and fines. The proposal was not included in the final bill.  The funding language proposed by Senator Stabenow addresses the fact that we are the only federal financial regulator without some form of fee-based funding, Massad said.

"Six years after BP spill, U.S. sets new offshore oil safety rules","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Thursday unveiled new oil well control rules to prevent the kind of blowout that happened six years ago on a BP Plc (BP.L) rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The Interior Departments Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced the finalized regulations, which include more stringent design requirements and operational procedures for offshore oil and gas operations. The new standards come nearly six years after a deadly explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the cost of Louisiana, which led to the worst oil spill of all time. The Macondo well blowout and the fire on April 20,2010 killed 11 workers.  Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told reporters the rule took six years to complete because the agency wanted to understand the root cause of the disaster. There are a number of things that went wrong, she said. It was important that we understood those things and the evolution of technology. The Interior Department said it took into account industry and other stakeholder feedback since it first proposed the rule last April.  To improve the culture of safety on oil rigs and prevent future spills or blowouts, the new rule tightens requirements for blowout preventers, well design, well control casing, cementing and sub-sea containment.  It also calls for real-time monitoring, third party reviews of equipment, regular inspections and safe drilling margin requirements. The agency estimates the new rule would cost the industry $890 million over a 10-year period, but would yield $1.5 billion in benefits.  Republican Louisiana Senator David Vitter slammed what he called an overarching rule that would kick our oil and gas industry while its down.  Industry lobby group the American Petroleum Institute said it is still reviewing the document, but said technical problems in the initial proposal could cause unintended consequences if they remain. Offshore drilling has seen at least 1,066 injuries, 496 fires and explosions, 22 losses of well control, 11 big oil spills and 11 fatalities since the Deepwater Horizon accident, according to the Interior Department. Jacqueline Savitz, vice president of the ocean protection advocacy group Oceana, said the new standards were a significant improvement over the status quo since Congress has not passed legislation to improve offshore drilling safety but are absolutely not sufficient to protect our oceans. Earlier this month, a federal judge in New Orleans approved BPs $20 billion settlement, paving the way for Gulf restoration to begin. ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
"Celebrity U.S. presidential picks prompt alliances, rifts","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pop star Demi Lovato is jazzed about Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Comic Sarah Silvermans enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders is no joke. Meanwhile, 1980s sitcom star Scott Baio wants Republican businessman Donald Trump to be in charge.  With Tuesdays New York primary approaching and Californias contest scheduled for June, celebrities are getting increasingly vocal about their presidential picks. The trend is prompting newfound alliances and rifts among Hollywoods elite, many of whom have donated to candidates vying for the office and actively campaigned for them.  Celebrities are hardly shy about voicing their political preferences, but their opinions could carry more weight this year. The primaries in New York and California, where many of them live, actually matter for a change. Usually, both parties nominees for president are effectively determined earlier in the process. Prominent female comedians are split on whom they support in the Nov. 8 election. While Silverman is backing Sanders, two actresses who have played Clinton in satirical sketches on the show Saturday Night Live say they are fans of the former secretary of state. Amy Poehler appeared in a Clinton campaign video while Kate McKinnon said on an episode of Close/Up with The Hollywood Reporter last year that she is rooting for her. And cast members from the 1980s sitcom Cheers are not toasting the same candidate. George Wendt is listed on Sanders website as a supporter while Ted Danson recently campaigned for Clinton in New Hampshire.  Meanwhile, Kirstie Alley voiced enthusiastic support for Trump last week, sparking a Twitter storm.  HELLO BOYS! This is my formal endorsement of @realDonaldTrump & Im a woman! (last I checked), Alley tweeted.   As primary results roll in, like-minded luminaries among the politically active rich and famous are linking up with each other on social media to show their support in numbers. Last week, Jamie Lee Curtis tweeted a photo of herself with  Scandal star Kerry Washington. Both women squeezed into a shirt together that said Yaaas, Hillary!  Love for a fellow supporter can come in the form of a tweet. After singer Barbra Streisand questioned the criticism over the former first ladys paid speeches in a tweet in late March, Girls star Lena Dunham, who has campaigned for Clinton, declared on Twitter that she was inclined to marry the ten-time Grammy Award winner. Others are engaging in political spats as raucous as the bickering on a Bravo reality show. Actresses Debra Messing and Susan Sarandon traded barbs last month on Twitter over their support for Clinton and Sanders, respectively. Sarandon suggested that principled people might have difficulty voting for Clinton due to her environmental record.  Did you see how @SusanSarandon just called us unprincipled? Messing tweeted to fellow actress and Clinton supporter Kathy Najimy.  Alright @DebraMessing report me to the homeroom teacher and lets STOP, Sarandon replied.  On the Republican side, celebrity Trump supporters are defending themselves on social media. Singer Aaron Carters Twitter endorsement of Trump in February prompted a barrage of snarky comments. He later wrote, NO! you guys arent going to bully me into my beliefs. While many celebrities are staunch in their views on the next president, some are trying to be more open-minded. Caitlyn Jenner, who famously revealed her identity as a transgender woman last year, said in an interview on the Today Show in March that she was a Republican. But her daughter Kendall and stepdaughter Kim Kardashian, as well as fellow costars on Jenners reality show I Am Cait, are Clinton fans. A month ago, Jenner posted a photo on Instagram with Clinton with the hashtags #learningfrommygirls and #willingtolisten.  Still, Clinton fans would be wise not to count her as a supporter just yet. On a March episode of her show, Jenner said she would never ever ever vote for Hillary. ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
Trump's 'Paterno' comment sparks jeers on social media,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump drew guffaws and derision on social media after he asked a campaign rally in Pittsburgh, Hows Joe Paterno? The legendary Penn State University football coach died four years ago.  I went to school in this state. I know a lot about Pennsylvania and its great, Trump said. Hows Joe Paterno? We gonna bring that back? How about that whole deal?  The term ""Joe Paterno"" quickly became a top trending topic on Twitter, with many asking if Trump knew Paterno was dead. A video clip was posted on YouTube.  Paterno, once one of the most revered college athletic coaches in the United States, was fired by Pennsylvania State University in 2011 over a child sexual abuse scandal involving assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. Paterno died on Jan. 21, 2012. Sandusky was later convicted on child sex abuse charges.  Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the candidate was referring to a statue of Paterno that was removed from the campus in 2012. A Quinnipiac University survey in 2015 showed that many Pennsylvanians want it returned to the campus.  Penn State spokesman Ben Manning said on Thursday the university does not comment on candidates campaign speeches.  Social media users mocked Trump for seemingly implying that he would bring Paterno back to life.  ""Someone should tell Trump that Joe Paterno is dead and also that he conspired with a serial child rapist,"" tweeted kept_simple (@kept_simple).  BuzzFeed political editor Katherine Miller (@katherinemiller) tweeted, ""Trump obviously meant when are we going to bring back the Paterno statue and then, subsequently, Paterno back from beyond, through sorcery.""  Twitter users with accounts geo-tagged to the universitys home, the town of State College, had mixed reactions.  ""Bring Paterno back? @realdonaldtrump has odd expectations of his abilities, and responsibilities, as president,"" tweeted Holly Swanson (@StateCollegeMom).  Not all reaction was negative.  ""All Trump has to do is say he'll bring the Paterno statue back. He'll win PA in a landslide,"" Kalooz (@Kalzony53).  Trump had weighed in on the fallout from the Sandusky scandal in July 2012 when the National Collegiate Athletic Association levied sanctions against Penn States football program. He said in a tweet that the program should be suspended.  ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers target May 1 for Puerto Rico debt crisis bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican and Democratic leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday expressed optimism over prospects for a bill helping Puerto Rico out of its debt crisis, but they indicated that a legislative fix could still be weeks away at least. Democratic and Republican lawmakers are working in good faith to finalize legislation addressing Puerto Ricos debt crisis by May 1, Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said, I think we are going to get there. Pelosi said at her weekly news conference that Democrats still have some concerns about the bill and are working with Republicans to address them. Republicans who control Congress outlined a plan this week to help Puerto Rico write off billions of dollars in debt if an agreement with creditors is out of reach. That plan would create a forum for investors to negotiate with Puerto Rico officials while the islands government tries to curb deficit spending that has created $70 billion in debt.  Ryan told reporters at a separate press conference on Thursday that there were not enough Democratic votes in the House Natural Resources Committee to help get the measure approved. But House Republican aides acknowledge that they also have work to do on their side of the aisle, especially in convincing some of their more conservative members that a Puerto Rico aid bill is needed. Underscoring that, Ryan is calling together his 246 Republican members for a closed meeting on Friday to review the legislation that is taking shape and to urge support. One aide characterized the message Friday as being aimed at helping Republicans understand that if they do not support a Puerto Rico bill now, much more costly bailout measures likely would be necessary down the road. Ryan said his priority on Puerto Rico is twofold: To protect the American taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall Puerto Rico if the status quo continues going in the direction its going. Pelosi said Democrats main concern with the Republicans first draft of the legislation was the part of the bill on restructuring. Negotiators were moving forward on the makeup of a proposed oversight board, Pelosi said, but a new wrinkle has emerged over the role of creditors in the U.S. commonwealths debt restructuring decisions. Ryan said an oversight board would be the best possible way to prevent taxpayers from bailing out Puerto Rico. ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1

"Thornton, Arkansas congressman who figured in Nixon impeachment, dies","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (Reuters) - Former U.S. Representative Ray Thornton of Arkansas, who helped draft the articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon, has died in hospice care in Little Rock at the age of 87, officials said on Thursday. Ray was an Arkansas gem who passionately served the people of this state for many years. He was a man who had a genuine heart for the people of Arkansas. said Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson.     Thornton, a Democrat, held a variety of elected and appointive positions in Arkansas.He was state attorney general before winning a seat in Congress in 1972.  After failing to win a U.S. Senate race in 1978, Thornton served as president of two state university systems, then ran successfully in 1990 for U.S. Congress in a different district. He was courageous in the House of Representatives with his votes on the Nixon impeachment, said Robert Brown, a retired justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court and a former political aide. Ray did as much as a public servant in Arkansas as anyone in recent history, and he did it all with a courtliness and sense of humor that seem to be sorely lacking in todays politics. Thornton, whose health had been declining for weeks before he died on Wednesday, enraged then-President Bill Clinton, a fellow Arkansan and Democrat, by voting against the presidents 1993 budget bill designed to reverse years of deficits. Thornton said he was merely honoring a pledge to his constituents to oppose any tax increases, especially a motor fuels tax regarded as onerous. Thorntons opposition and pressure from the White House compelled another Democrat, Representative Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania, to change her position and support Clintons legislation. Mezvinsky was defeated in the next election. Her son, Marc, later married Clintons daughter, Chelsea. Upon leaving Congress a second time, Thornton was elected to the Arkansas Supreme Court, where he helped strike down a state law establishing term limits for members of Congress. In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Thorntons finding, ruling that states lacked the authority to restrict federal tenures. ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1

This is one of the reasons I adamantly oppose any steps this administration may take to give Iran access to the dollar, he told reporters at a weekly press conference.

House Speaker Ryan backs continued aid to Egypt,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he backs continuing the $1.3 billion in annual military aid that Washington sends to Egypt, but that its human rights record makes it more difficult to support the Cairo government. We give $1.3 billion a year to Egypt. I dont think we should take that away, Ryan said during a meeting with foreign policy reporters at his U.S. Capitol office after a visit to Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region. He said he had raised the rights issue with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The aid package for Cairo has been in focus in Washington because of growing unease among both Ryans fellow Republicans and Democrats that Sisis government is exploiting security concerns to crack down on dissent. Ryan said he told Sisi: You make it more difficult for us to be supportive of you when you have so many human rights violations, adding that every U.S. official who visited Cairo should make that case. However, he stressed that it is essential that Washington not allow Egypt to become a failed state. Ryan also told reporters it was too soon to weigh in on an emergency funding Marshall Plan that some lawmakers have proposed to boost countries in the region socially and economically rather than only focus on military aspects in the fight to counter Islamic State and other militant groups. I think its too soon to jump to that conclusion, Ryan said, when asked whether he would support some sort of emergency appropriations program like the Marshall Plan suggested by  fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.

"Trump takes steps to reset his campaign, tries to soften his image ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican front-runner Donald Trump took fresh steps to reset his campaign on Wednesday, hiring a top Republican operative and scheduling a meeting between aides and U.S. lawmakers as he girds for a new phase in his White House bid. Trump is under pressure to professionalize his campaign beyond a close-knit group of advisers and expand the appeal of his anti-establishment candidacy in the face of fierce opposition from rival U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and a well-funded anti-Trump operation run by establishment Republicans. Trump announced he had hired Rick Wiley as his national political director. Wiley, a long-time Republican strategist, had been campaign manager for Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor who dropped out of the presidential race last autumn. He brings decades of experience, and his deep ties to political leaders and activists across the country will be a tremendous asset as we enter the final phase of securing the nomination, Trump said in a statement. In addition, Trumps campaign arranged a meeting in Washington of about a dozen U.S. legislators as the fierce anti-establishment candidate tries to build more relationships inside Washington and broaden his appeal. The meeting with the lawmakers and senior Trump adviser Ed Brookover is planned for Thursday morning on Capitol Hill, congressional aides said. About a dozen lawmakers are expected to attend, some of whom have endorsed Trump and some of whom have not but who are interested in his message. Trump will not be there. A series of policy speeches Trump plans to begin delivering soon could be among the topics discussed, one source said. Theyre definitely planning several policy speeches ... and they are looking for input on those, a Republican source familiar with the situation said. The Trump campaign received some good news when Politico reported that campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was charged last month in Florida with battery on a reporter, will not be prosecuted. Palm Beach County State Attorney David Aronberg is scheduled to announce the decision not to press charges on Thursday afternoon, Politico reported, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. In another development, Trump met privately at Trump Tower in New York with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after months of attacking her for the tough questions she asked him at a Republican debate last August about his treatment of women. Tensions between Trump and Kelly, and controversial remarks he has made about abortion, have contributed to Trumps negative image with women. Opinion polls show the New York billionaire is viewed unfavorably by women by a wide margin. Kelly said on her Fox News show she had asked for the meeting and used it to request an interview. We met for about an hour just the two of us and had a chance to clear the air, she said. In recent days Trump has attempted to soften his image with important constituencies such as female voters. A group interview on CNN on Tuesday night featured Trump, his wife, Melania, daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr., and showed a more personal side to the often-brusque businessman. Melania Trump said she had fussed at Trump to stop tweeting at night. If he would only listen, she said, chuckling. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said the hiring of Wiley and, two weeks ago, of delegate specialist Paul Manafort suggest that Trump is preparing for a contested convention in July should he not win outright the 1,237 delegates needed for the Republican presidential nomination.  Without having good people on your team who understand how to navigate those waters, youre in big trouble, he said. The steps point to a new phase of Trumps campaign after vulnerabilities were exposed when he was beaten in Wisconsin by Cruz and outmaneuvered by Cruz in the competition for delegates in Colorado. As the Trump campaign attempts to get a better handle on the complicated delegate selection process, Trump is expected to send a contingent to a Republican National Committee (RNC) meeting in Florida next week. Trump has been in a war of words with the RNC, accusing the party apparatus of having rules that, for example, allowed party regulars in Colorado to select delegates without giving Republicans there a chance to vote. Trump on Tuesday said that RNC Chairman Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself. Priebus, who met Trump two weeks ago at RNC headquarters in Washington, said the delegate-selection rules have been in place for a year and it is the responsibility of each campaign to understand them. Complaints now? Give us all a break, Priebus tweeted. ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2016 ",1
"Unions endorse Sanders, Clinton for president as NY race nears","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders won his first endorsement from a fellow U.S. senator on Wednesday, and he and rival Hillary Clinton both announced backing from New York City labor unions as they battled to win next weeks state primary. The Transport Workers Union Local 100, representing 42,000 workers in the New York region, backed Sanders as he struggled to dent Clintons lead in a state each has called home. Deriding fierce attacks against unions over the last several decades, Sanders called organized labor the last line of defense against corporate greed in America. Weve got to stand together, take on the big-money interests and make it clear that our government works for all of us, not just the 1 percent, the U.S. senator from Vermont said. Following his endorsement announcement, Sanders joined a picket line of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) workers, who went on strike on Wednesday after contract talks hit an impasse. He thanked the workers for fighting corporate greed and told them: Today you are standing up not just for justice for Verizon workers. Youre standing up for millions of Americans. Clinton, a former two-term senator from New York, scored her own union endorsement from Local 3 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, representing more than 27,000 area workers. Sanders trails Clinton in the number of delegates won in primaries and caucuses. The former U.S. secretary of state has 1,758 delegates to Sanders 1,069, according to the Associated Press. A candidate needs 2,383 delegates to win the nomination to be the partys candidate in the Nov. 8 election. Clinton on Wednesday also won backing from New Yorks Daily News, which called her a superprepared warrior realist who understands the economic toll the country has faced, while labeling Sanders utterly unprepared with politically impossible goals. The newspapers editorial board interview with Clintons Brooklyn-born rival this month prompted criticism of Sanders as lacking detailed understanding of some of his main policy initiatives. U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, announced his endorsement of Sanders in a New York Times column, saying he supports Sanders for his work battling economic inequality, opposing trade deals and fighting for the middle class. It is time to recommit ourselves to that vision of a country that measures our nations success not at the boardroom table, but at kitchen tables across America, wrote Merkley, the junior U.S. senator from Oregon. Merkleys announcement precedes Oregons May 17 primary. ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2016 ",1
Trump's jobs homecoming a long shot even in manufacturing hot spots ,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla (Reuters) - When U.S. manufacturing employment peaked, Jimmy Carter was president, inflation was 11 percent, and craftsmen at Frontier Contact Lenses made the companys products one at a time on diamond-tipped lathes. As presidential candidates promise to reclaim jobs lost in the intervening decades, they might want to visit the company now. Bought by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in 1981, the fully automated factory allows four workers to produce in a 12-hour shift what more labor-intensive methods produced in a year. The Jacksonville plant and one in Ireland make 4 billion soft contacts a year, and between the robots and lasers and computer algorithms no worker touches the product from the start of the process through final packaging. I dont think you could even make 4 billion lenses using the old method, said David Turner, vice president of research and development for Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. Youd need a guy with a lathe in every town. Since peaking at 19.5 million in 1979, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs has fallen 37 percent to around 12.2 million as of March, or just over 10 percent of the private sector workforce. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1WqpioK) That may be as good as it gets. Despite the promises made on the campaign trail by Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and other candidates, the next president will find it hard to raise manufacturings share of a U.S. labor force that keeps shifting toward services. While much of the jobs debate has centered on trade pacts  that Democrats and Republicans have backed over the last quarter century, both successful and struggling companies and sectors offer evidence of long-term trends that neither sharp trade negotiators nor aggressive political leaders can easily reverse. Even critics of trade deals acknowledge that labor intensive industries, such as textiles, which once employed hundreds of thousands of less-skilled workers, are probably gone for good. Technology continues to diminish the share of labor in production and its spread around the world has made other nations - notably China, but also Korea, Brazil, Mexico and former Soviet bloc countries - competitive both as exporters and in their own markets. Investment worldwide is drifting steadily toward services, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and Americans are spending relatively less of their income on manufactured goods.     A Reuters analysis of federal data for 1,267 categories of goods shows that the United States has been running a trade deficit in more than 500 of them since at least 1992 - before the North American Free Trade Agreement came into force or China joined the World Trade Organization, events often cited as turning points for U.S. manufacturing. Since the 2007-2009 recession manufacturing has added about 800,000 jobs, but that has lagged overall job growth. As a result manufacturings share of private employment has continued to fall, from about 11 percent since the recession ended. The move toward a more global market hurts the marginal, low-skilled worker, but it was inevitable and you cannot roll it back, said Brookings Institution senior fellow Barry Bosworth. At CareerSource Northeast Florida, a job development group, President Bruce Ferguson, Jr. said by necessity he focused on finding a path for entry level service sector employees to move up a career ladder, because services are where the growth is.   The raw (manufacturing) numbers dont look anything like the service sector and they never will, he said.  A majority of 6,500 Americans surveyed in March as part of Reuters/Ipsos 2016 campaign polling acknowledged that free trade brings lower prices, but also saw it as a drag on wages and jobs and an important issue for the next president to confront. Tapping such concerns, Trump has promised punitive tariffs to bring back jobs for those left behind in the current recovery, particularly the roughly two thirds of Americans without a college degree.    Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton switched gears as a candidate to oppose a major Pacific trade deal and promises billions in public support for manufacturing. Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders calls for worker protection against what he considers unfair trade, while Republican Ted Cruz has focused on trimming government red tape. However, playing tough on trade carries some risks and there are limits to what trade talks and tariffs can accomplish. The U.S. steel industry is a case in point. The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates around 12,000 jobs were lost to a recent jump in imports, mainly from China. It reckons those jobs could be recovered with steps, such as the anti-dumping duties imposed by Washington late last year. That pales, however, in comparison with more than 200,000 jobs that the sector has lost since the early 1980s, some because of imports, but some because the amount of labor needed to produce a ton of steel has fallen from 10 hours to less than two.  There has been a short term loss that is definitely attributable to imports, while a longer term trend reflects technological innovation, said Kevin Dempsey, the institutes senior vice president.  Such dynamic is not limited to old industries like steel. Florida is home to successful manufacturers big and small in a wide range of sectors, which export nearly half of their output - double the national average. Yet, as is the case nationally, the share of jobs available to those with a high school degree has been shrinking since 2000, according to federal data, and wages have been stagnant. Johnson & Johnson Vision Cares recent approval of a $300 million expansion, which added some 100 jobs, cements the companys U.S. presence, but also shows how technology and innovation reshape the landscape. The companys local workforce has risen to around 1,700, but about 60 percent of that are white collar and non-manufacturing jobs - from research positions for PhD scientists to those in sales and a highly automated shipping operation. Florida development officials say the trend is clear: manufacturers keep cutting the labor content of their products and each round of investment tends to drive up the skill levels that workers need. That may benefit the states economy, but acts as a reality check for workers who hope that the November 8 presidential vote can reverse decades-old trends. How do you evaluate a company that says we will spend a lot of money and make the workforce more qualified but not create many jobs? said Aaron Bowman, senior vice president for business development at JAXUSA Partnership, a regional economic development agency and division of the local chamber of commerce. Over time you see more projects that bring in fewer jobs but a bigger bang.     ",politicsNews,"April 14, 2016 ",1
Republican Cruz speaks highly of Rubio when asked about possible VP running mate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican White House hopeful Ted Cruz said on Wednesday he is looking at who he might select as his vice presidential running mate should he become the partys presidential nominee, and that he thinks highly of former rival Marco Rubio. Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, appeared on a CNN town hall with his wife, Heidi, and two daughters and showed a more personal side. He trails front-runner Donald Trump in the race to get 1,237 delegates to seal the nomination, but he expressed confidence he can emerge as the winner if he can chip away at Trumps lead and force Republicans to pick their nominee at a contested convention in July. Cruz said he and his team are looking at possible vice presidential running mates. Were in the process now of looking at a number of different options, said Cruz without mentioning names. Asked about Rubio, Cruz called him an amazing communicator who inspired millions across the country in his presidential campaign. I consider Marco a friend, said Cruz, adding that anyone would naturally look at Marco for the No. 2 position on the Republican ticket. Cruz and Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, engaged in bitter fights over illegal immigration during the campaign. Rubio was forced from the race after losing the Florida Republican primary on March 15. Cruz said they have now put those differences behind them. The town hall included some exchanges that were aimed at showing what Cruz is like at home. Heidi Cruz said that shortly after they were married, her husband once brought home 100 cans of soup, a haul that was so big she took them back. Asked if he had ever not followed his wifes advice, Cruz said he could not remember any examples, but Heidi Cruz had a ready response for him.

"Sanders, Clinton join picket lines, fight for union support","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton joined striking Verizon workers picket lines on Wednesday after Sanders was endorsed by New York City transit workers in his fight for union support that has largely gone to Clinton. Sanders addressed hundreds of striking workers in Brooklyn as brothers and sisters and thanked them for their courage in standing up to what he characterized as corporate greed by the mammoth communications company. Employees cheered as Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn, criticized Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) for wanting to take away health benefits, outsource jobs and avoid federal income taxes, calling it just another major American corporation trying to destroy the lives of working Americans. Today I became a Bernie supporter. Basically just having his presence and knowing that he acknowledges the working class matters, said technician Kerryann Reid, 36, who said she has worked for Verizon for 15 years. It was a scene tailor-made for the U.S. senator from Vermont, who has focused on income inequality in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders is trying to catch up with Clinton, the front-runner, in Tuesdays primary in New York, a state both candidates have called home. On Wednesday afternoon, several dozen workers picketing a Verizon store in Manhattan cheered as Clinton arrived to show her support.  This has been going on for months, she said of the deadlocked contract talks, adding that the employees needed all the support they could get. Despite Sanders daily championing of the rights of working-class Americans, Clinton has racked up the lions share of support from organized labor, a crucial base for the Democratic Party. Among Democrats and independents who belong to a labor union, 50 percent support Clinton and 36 percent back Sanders, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll in March. In comparison, Clinton and Sanders have been about even in the poll among all Democrats and independents. The poll from March 1 to March 31 included 780 people who said they were Democrats or independents and belonged to a labor union. It had a credibility interval of 4 percentage points. Nearly 40,000 Verizon employees went on strike on Wednesday in one of the largest U.S. walkouts in recent years after contract talks hit an impasse. You are standing up not just for justice for Verizon workers, youre standing up for millions of Americans ... and youre telling corporate America that they cannot have it all, Sanders told the striking workers. Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam accused Sanders of getting the facts wrong and oversimplifying the situation, dismissing the candidates views as contemptible. The company has to adapt to competition and technology, but still provides good jobs and benefits to thousands, he said in a statement. Sanders fired back on Twitter at McAdam and General Electric Co (GE.N) Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, who criticized Sanders in an opinion article last week. I dont want the support of McAdam, Immelt and their friends in the billionaire class, Sanders wrote. I welcome their contempt. While Sanders whipped up the crowd in Brooklyn, Clintons campaign issued a statement criticizing Verizon for wanting to outsource more jobs and urging the company to go back to the bargaining table. To preserve and grow Americas middle class, we need to protect good wages and benefits, including retirement security, Clinton said. And we should be doing all we can to keep good-paying jobs with real job security in New York. Earlier in the day, Sanders announced the endorsement of Transport Workers Union Local 100, representing 42,000 workers in the New York City area.  Clinton, meanwhile, won the backing of a local unit, representing more than 27,000 area workers, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, one of the unions involved in the Verizon strike. The other union involved in the strike, the Communications Workers of America, has endorsed Sanders for president. Other influential unions that have backed Clinton include the AFSCME, a public employees union with 1.6 million members, and the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, which has about 2 million members in a variety of professions. In what was widely viewed as a win for Sanders, the AFL-CIO, the countrys largest labor union federation, in February declined to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary. Sanders also won his first endorsement from a fellow U.S. senator, Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, on Wednesday, while Clinton was endorsed by New Yorks Daily News, which called her a superprepared warrior realist.

Trump campaign manager will not be prosecuted on battery charge: Politico,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps campaign manager, who was charged in Florida last month with battery on a reporter, will not be prosecuted, Politico reported on Wednesday, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. Corey Lewandowski was charged with intentionally grabbing and bruising the arm of Michelle Fields, then a reporter for the conservative news outlet Breitbart, when she tried to question Trump at a campaign event on March 8. Palm Beach County State Attorney David Aronberg is scheduled to announce the decision not to press charges against Lewandowski on Thursday afternoon, Politico said. ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2016 ",1
U.S. Congress panel postpones work on Puerto Rico debt bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to help Puerto Rico climb out of a debilitating debt crisis hit new resistance in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, prompting Republicans to cancel a planned work session that was set for Thursday on the measure. The House Natural Resources Committees planned markup of legislation Republicans unveiled late on Tuesday was being called off, panel Chairman Rob Bishop announced in a statement. He said the Obama administration was still negotiating provisions and that it would be unfair to all members to force a vote with the talks ongoing. One congressional aide said the abrupt move was being taken because there was not enough support among panel members to get the legislation approved and sent to the full House of Representatives for debate. It was unclear when the committee would reschedule a work session. Earlier on Wednesday, a U.S. Treasury official told the committee that the U.S. Congress must allow Puerto Rico to erase a share of its debt or investors will face a long, uncertain fight to recover their money from the cash-strapped island. Republicans who control Congress outlined a plan this week to help Puerto Rico write off billions of dollars in debt if an agreement with creditors is out of reach. That plan would create a forum for investors to negotiate with Puerto Rico officials while the islands government tries to curb deficit spending that has created $70 billion in debt. Such a plan would signal to Wall Street that the Puerto Rico financial crisis is manageable, said Antonio Weiss who is handling the issue for the Treasury Department. Without congressional action, Weiss said, investors face years of combat in the courts. Chaos will ensue and the (Puerto Rico) economy will face another lost decade, he told the Natural Resources panel of the House of Representatives. As a territory of the United States, Puerto Rico answers to Congress and its people are American citizens. Roughly 2.5 percent of the islands population is migrating to the mainland each year to escape the financial crisis, Weiss said. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday said the Congressional rescue plan was the right move but many Republicans disagree. Wall Street would be rattled if Congress rewrote the terms of Puerto Rico debt and that could sour investor appetite for other municipal bonds, said Representative Jeff Duncan of South Carolina. I believe were going down a slippery slope here, Duncan said on Wednesday at a hearing on the proposal. Rather than meddle in markets, he said lawmakers should stand aside and let Puerto Rico settle its disputes with investors.  Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican who also sits on the Natural Resources panel agreed. Congressional intervention at this point would serve to alter the rule of law, he said in a statement. Weiss told lawmakers that the current rescue plan was not perfect but it was the cheapest option since it only involves rewriting some rules for investors. The alternative to this legislation ... will in fact become a bailout, Weiss said. He noted that the Zika virus is spreading across Puerto Rico and the island is poorly-equipped to handle that emergency while the financial crisis looms. ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2016 ",1
Puerto Rico creditors cancel lawsuit after governor's emergency order,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - - Creditors of Puerto Ricos Government Development Bank on Wednesday withdrew a lawsuit that sought to prevent a run on the bank ahead of a $422 million debt payment due on May 1. Hedge funds including Brigade Capital Management and Claren Road Asset Management, which hold some of GDBs $3.75 billion in debt, said in a statement that the lawsuit had no purpose now that Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has declared a fiscal emergency at the bank. The emergency declaration, issued on Saturday, prevents GDB from lending and paying certain debts, and blocks depositors from withdrawing any money not required to fund essential services. This is essentially what the creditors had sought in their lawsuit, which was filed four days before Garcia Padillas declaration. Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, and a shrinking population, all of which threaten to collapse its economy. GDB owes creditors $422 million on May 1, a payment Garcia Padilla has said it cannot afford. The emergency declaration aimed to keep money in the bank while the bank negotiates a restructuring with creditors. While the U.S. territory has missed some minor debt payments in the last year, a default at GDB - the primary liquidity source for the islands public entities - would be by far the most significant. Default would also likely push the bank into receivership.  Efforts to avoid that fate parallel a push by federal lawmakers to find a legislative solution to Puerto Ricos debt.

Dealmakers say a Trump presidency would be bad for M&A,"(Reuters) - A Donald Trump presidency would be bad for corporate dealmaking, according to a global survey of people who advise companies on mergers and acquisitions, or M&A. Nearly two-thirds of 1,500 respondents - including investment bankers, lawyers and people who work for private equity firms - said a Trump presidency would create uncertainty that would deter executives from launching bids. The survey was conducted in April by Intralinks Holdings Inc IL.N, which provides confidential meeting rooms used by companies when they allow would-be bidders to look through their accounts. The real story is that dealmakers crave less disruption, and Trump has been a polarizing figure on a global scale, Matt Porzio, vice president of strategy at Intralinks, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. His unpredictable style and fiery rhetoric have some investors worried that as president he could trigger trade wars, hurt the economy and add a lot of volatility to financial markets. The New York real estate developer prides himself on his ability to make good deals, and M&A professionals in the United States were less concerned about his impact on business than their peers elsewhere. According to the survey, 46 percent of U.S. dealmakers said they believed Trump would have a negative impact on M&A activity, compared with 83 percent of dealmakers in Latin America. Trump has sparked controversy with his call for building a wall along the Mexican border and for deporting 11 million illegal immigrants from the United States. Some 71 percent of dealmakers based in Europe and 75 percent in Asia thought Trump would be bad for business. Globally, only 45 percent of respondents thought that U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described socialist who is competing with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, would be bad for M&A activity. But the same proportion - 45 percent - thought Clinton would have a positive impact on mergers and acquisitions, making her the candidate viewed to have the highest positive impact on corporate tie-ups.

Senate panel releases draft of controversial encryption bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Wednesday issued a formal draft of a controversial bill that would give courts the power to order technology companies like Apple to help authorities break into encrypted devices or communications for law enforcement or intelligence purposes. The proposal arrives just days after an earlier draft leaked online and drew fire from security researchers and civil liberties advocates who warned it would undermine Internet security and expose personal data to hackers. Those same groups on Wednesday said the new draft is little different from the leaked version. The bill comes as the U.S. Justice Department has redoubled its efforts to use the courts to force Apple (AAPL.O) to unlock encrypted iPhones. Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Senate intelligence committees Republican chair and top Democrat, said in a statement they intended now to solicit input from the public and key stakeholders before formally introducing the bill. I am hopeful that this draft will start a meaningful and inclusive debate on the role of encryption and its place within the rule of law, Burr said. Based on initial feedback, I am confident that the discussion has begun. The new discussion draft does not require manufacturers or communications companies to process, transmit or store data in any particular format.  Rather, it requires companies, upon receipt of a court order, to turn over to the government data in an intelligible format even if encryption has rendered that data inaccessible to anyone other than the owner. Companies must ensure their products be capable of complying, the bill states. Critics say that amounts to a ban on strong encryption. The latest version of the bill narrows the scope of cases where a court can issue an order. Those include crimes that caused or could cause death or serious injury or that involve drug offenses or child victims, in addition to foreign intelligence operations, according to the text. Andrew Crocker, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said changes in the new discussion draft were minimal and the bill still threatened Internet security because companies would only be able to comply by weakening encryption in all their products. The proposed legislation, which is expected to continue facing strong opposition from the technology sector and privacy advocates, faces an uphill battle in a gridlocked Congress. This flawed bill would leave Americans more vulnerable to stalkers, identity thieves, foreign hackers and criminals, said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden in a statement.

U.S. House panel says Puerto Rico bill in limbo as talks continue,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop on Wednesday said Obama administration proposals to change a Puerto Rico debt relief bill are under negotiation, requiring the panel to cancel a Thursday work session on a Republican bill. The administration is still negotiating on provisions of the legislation, creating uncertainty in both parties, Bishop said in a prepared statement. He added that it is unfair to all members to force a vote in the committee as negotiations continue. Bishop, a Republican, had hoped to work on the legislation Thursday and hold a committee vote that would have sent it to the full House of Representatives for consideration. One congressional source told Reuters that the Thursday session was being canceled because the legislation lacked adequate support in the committee. ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2016 ",1

"U.S. Treasury, Democrats concerned over Puerto Rico plan ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress was ironing out a new plan on Wednesday to rescue Puerto Rico from crippling debts that threaten the island territorys funding for hospitals and emergency services, as the treatment of bondholders simmers as a point of contention. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats raised concerns about legislation being floated by Republicans. It would steer creditors and holders of Puerto Rico bonds toward a new, independent board that would seek a fair way to write down an estimated $70 billion in debt. Puerto Ricos economy has struggled for years and the U.S. territorys government has borrowed heavily to pay its bills. Its bankruptcy reorganization options are limited under present law and Congress has become involved. The Republican bill imposes an unworkable, mandatory process on debt restructurings that will only delay the ability to reach a comprehensive resolution, Treasury Department Counselor Antonio Weiss told a congressional panel. All of Puerto Ricos many debtors would have to complete a complicated process before any single entity could begin to restructure, Weiss said in prepared testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, which hopes to advance legislation soon. Republicans control the U.S. Congress, but they likely will need support from Democrats to pass a rescue plan. Weiss painted a dire picture of Puerto Rico, where he said essential government services are being curtailed because of a lack of cash, hospitals have closed some floors amid layoffs, and fuel for emergency vehicles is running dry. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking to reporters,  complained of television ads airing in some parts of the United States that she said were misleading. The actions being weighed, Pelosi said, do not cost the taxpayers one dollar. Pelosi said Democrats are concerned about the negative impact of the legislation on working people in Puerto Rico, as well as the effects of transferring federal lands on Vieques without providing for strong conservation protections.  If the House committee can amend the bill in a way that a majority of members approve, it would advance to the full House. Many investors would face a loss under the Republican plan and are lobbying Congress to protect their bottom lines. The rescue plan adopts some principles of bankruptcy law, and some lawmakers have balked at the idea of letting Puerto Rico modify its bonds, saying it would create chaos for municipal markets.

Critics slam proposed South Carolina transgender bathroom bill,"(Reuters) - A South Carolina bill to require transgender people to use public restrooms matching their sex at birth was slammed by critics on Wednesday, and former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr said he would cancel a performance in North Carolina where a similar law has been passed.  We need to take a stand against this hatred, Starr said in a statement. Spread peace and love. He said he was canceling a June performance in Cary, North Carolina, to protest that states law. Rocker Bruce Springsteen has also scrapped a concert in the state. So-called bathroom bills have fueled debate about privacy, religious freedom and equal rights and drawn stern reactions from major corporations and entertainers who call them discriminatory. Most of the speakers at a subcommittee hearing in Columbia, South Carolina, on Wednesday said the bathroom measure proposed there defied logic. This bill is an undisguised attack on some of our most talented and most vulnerable citizens, Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said, adding it would cause irreparable economic damage. Supporters said opening restrooms and locker rooms to the opposite gender in schools would violate students right to privacy.  Republican Senator Lee Bright, who sponsored the measure, said he feared adult men would use more lenient bathroom policies as an excuse to prey on women and children. I dont believe that transgender people are pedophiles, he added. U.S. Attorney Bill Nettles told lawmakers he was unaware of any assaults by transgender people or people pretending to be the opposite sex in South Carolina bathrooms. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a Republican, has said the proposed law was unnecessary and unlikely to win legislative approval this year. North Carolina Republican Governor Pat McCrory on Tuesday tweaked his states law with an executive order, adding protections against discrimination for state employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. But McCrory and top Republican lawmakers said they would not repeal the measure, despite companies such as PayPal Holdings and Deutsche Bank halting plans to add jobs in the state. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, on Wednesday signed an anti-discrimination order protecting the rights of gay and transgender state employees and employees of state contractors. Edwards said the order was good for business. ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2016 ",1
Obama to issue new offshore drilling rules on Thursday: source,"(Reuters) - The Obama administration will announce Thursday safety regulations for offshore oil and natural gas drilling to prevent the kind of explosion that happened six years ago on a BP rig in the Gulf of Mexico, an official told Reuters. The Department of Interior will unveil the final version of its well control regulations, which will require more stringent design and operating procedures for well control equipment used in offshore oil and gas operations, said the official, who is close to the rulemaking process.  The agency first released the proposal last April to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the deadly Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The Macondo well blowout and the fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20, 2010 killed 11 workers.  BP agreed in October to pay more than $20 billion in fines to resolve nearly all claims from the oil spill, marking the largest corporate settlement of its kind in U.S. history Last year, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said the rule would build on industry standards for blowout preventers and reform well design, well control, casing, cementing and real-time well monitoring.

Long-stalled email privacy bill advances in Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation that would require law enforcement to obtain a search warrant before asking technology companies to hand over old emails unanimously moved forward in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, notching a long-awaited win for technology companies and digital privacy advocates. The House Judiciary Committee voted 28-0 to approve the Email Privacy Act, which would update a decades-old law to mandate federal authorities get a warrant to access emails or other digital communications that are more than 180 days old. Currently, law enforcement and civil agencies can ask a service provider to turn over such aged private communications with only a subpoena, which is subject to less judicial oversight than a warrant. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he planned to bring the bill to a full vote the week of April 25, boosting its chances to become law this year.  If the bill passes the House as expected, it will head to a gridlocked Senate, where more than a quarter of the lawmakers, including No. 2 Republican John Cornyn, has endorsed similar legislation. Debate over law enforcement access to Americans electronic communications intensified this year with the Justice Departments pursuit of a court order to force Apple to help unlock an encrypted iPhone linked to one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters. Prior to Wednesdays vote, the bill had gained sponsorship from 315 of a possible 435 House lawmakers, making it the most supported bill in the chamber to not earn a vote. Disagreements over whether civil agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission should be allowed to rely on subpoenas continually slowed the bill, which has floated around Congress for several years.     The White House also has said it favors reforming the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act, but it has not endorsed specific legislation. A package of minor amendments from Representative Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the committee, was adopted Wednesday, including the removal of a requirement to serve warrants to the subject of an investigation. The bill requires a warrant to be given only to the email provider. That change and others prompted ire from a coalition of more than 50 civil liberties groups, trade associations and technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft  and Facebook. While maintaining their support, the coalition said in a letter to the committee that the bill does not achieve all of the reforms we had hoped for. ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2016 ",1
"Republican, signaling a shift, says more money needed for Zika fight","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. House of Representatives Republican Tom Cole said on Wednesday more funds will be needed to fight the Zika virus in the United States, signaling a shift from insistence by many Republicans that the Obama administration should use existing funds for the effort to combat the growing threat. The Zika outbreak began last year in Brazil and has spread rapidly through the Americas. U.S. officials say local outbreaks are possible in the United States, particularly in southern states like Florida and Texas where the mosquitoes that carry the virus are active. Democrats and Obama administration officials have been urging the Republican-controlled Congress to grant nearly $1.9 billion in emergency funds to fight the virus. In a temporary fix, the White House said last week that it would redirect $589 million in allocated funds to prepare for Zikas arrival in the continental United States. Representative Cole, who chairs the health appropriations subcommittee, said the funds should last until the end of the governments fiscal year on Sept. 30. Theres going to need to be additional money, I dont think theres any doubt about that, Cole told reporters after a House Republican meeting. Were having discussions about that now. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who is from Florida, broke with other congressional Republicans on Zika last week, announcing his support for President Barack Obamas $1.9 billion request to fight the virus. On Wednesday, Rubio wrote to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to urge it to clear a backlog of Zika diagnostic tests and prioritize testing for pregnant women, saying he had seen media reports that some pregnant women have waited up to a month for CDC to complete their tests. The White House on Wednesday said a bill that passed on Tuesday was a positive first step in combating Zika but lamented its lack of additional funds needed to fight the virus, which has been linked to a rare birth defect in babies called microcephaly and neurological disorders in adults. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he anticipated that President Barack Obama would sign the bill, which provides financial incentives to companies developing treatments for Zika. Cole said lawmakers have not decided whether any new money to fight Zika would be provided in an appropriations bill, or attached to a continuing resolution keeping the government open at current spending levels, if lawmakers end up passing such a measure later this year. I think the problem is real, certainly there will need to be additional money at the NIH on this, Cole said, referring to the National Institutes of Health. House Speaker Paul Ryan said, however,that if more money is needed to fight Zika, lawmakers will address the matter through the regular appropriations process. We will address the situation through the regular appropriations process as the need arises, and our appropriators are looking at how to do just that, Ryan said at a press conference.

JPMorgan passes up chance to counter Sanders' criticism,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has been lambasted by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, but Chief Executive Jamie Dimon opted not to fire back on Wednesday while reviewing quarterly results and taking questions about his latest failure with regulators. No comment, Dimon quickly responded on a conference call with reporters when asked about Sanders recent statement that JPMorgan was among companies destroying the moral fabric of the nation. Nor was Dimon willing to respond to a follow-up question about the tone of the U.S. presidential campaign. To drive home the refusal, his top communications adviser, Joseph Evangelisti, stepped in and said, Were not going to comment on political statements. Dimon also turned away from the chance to make his case again that JPMorgans size is an advantage. In the past he has argued that JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is good for customers, shareholders and the country because of the stability and efficiency that come with its scale and diverse mix of business. JPMorgans earnings came on the same day that federal regulators gave the bank and four other big banks a failing grade for their plans to show that they can be quickly and safely dismantled in bankruptcy.

House Speaker Ryan's campaign fundraising tops $17 million in first quarter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that he has raised $17.2 million in congressional campaign contributions during the first three months of 2016 through a network of political action committees organized to help House Republicans in the November election. The announcement came a day after Ryan strongly rejected any notion that he could become this years Republican presidential nominee. It underscored his role in helping fellow Republicans as he works to win agreement on a budget resolution and to shape his caucus into an effective mouthpiece for Republican social and fiscal policy. The first-quarter fundraising allowed the Wisconsin congressman to transfer $11 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee during the period, including a monthly NRCC record of $6.3 million in March, according to Ryans political office.   The figures also provide new evidence of Ryans fundraising prowess, which has shown signs of surpassing the performance of his predecessor, Ohio Republican John Boehner, by some measures.  All told, Ryan has now raised $23.5 million as speaker, through a network that includes his Team Ryan joint fundraising committee, his Ryan for Congress campaign committee and his Prosperity Action political action committee, his staff said.

Clinton to propose creation of immigrant affairs office,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton on Wednesday will propose the creation of a new national Office of Immigrant Affairs should she win the White House in November, as she seeks to woo minority and immigrant voters in New York less than a week before the states primary. The office would coordinate policies and programs among federal agencies and with state and local governments, Clinton said at an event in New York City where she met with immigrant-rights activists. Its an issue that cuts across all levels of government, she said. She added that it would expand the efforts of President Barack Obamas Task Force on New Americans, which was created in 2014 to help immigrants and refugees integrate better into the United States. In contrast, Republican candidates have largely proposed tougher immigration rules. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has called for building a wall along the border with Mexico and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. The New York primary on Tuesday could either help former Secretary of State Clinton consolidate her status as the Democratic front-runner or hand a significant victory to rival Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking to defy expectations and win the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Both candidates are campaigning across the state, looking to win over New Yorks diverse population, including voters from immigrant families. Around 19 percent of the states population is Hispanic or Latino, according to the U.S. Census. With 247 pledged delegates at stake, the state is among the most significant nominating contests left on the calendar before the Democrats July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia. Clinton holds a double-digit lead in opinion polls over Sanders in New York, the state where he was born and which she served for eight years as a U.S. senator. She also holds a commanding lead in pledged delegates overall so far, leaving Sanders only a narrow path if he is to win the nomination out from under her, a task some pundits say is already beyond him. A Democratic candidate needs 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination. Those can come from any combination of pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses, as well as so-called superdelegates, who can vote as they choose.    ",politicsNews,"April 13, 2016 ",1

Republican Paul Ryan on 2016 presidential race: Count me out,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he would reject any attempt to draft him as a Republican presidential candidate, trying to quash speculation that he could surface as a unity choice should Donald Trump or Ted Cruz falter. Let me be clear: I do not want nor will I accept the nomination of our party, Ryan said in remarks at the Republican National Committees Washington headquarters. Ryan, the top elected Republican in Washington and the partys 2012 vice presidential candidate, has been the subject of persistent speculation that he could emerge as the nominee if an impasse over the partys pick develops at the July 18-21 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Ryan has repeatedly said he is not interested in entering the presidential race, but advocates for such a scenario have pointed out that he was cool to becoming House speaker until he was finally persuaded to take over from John Boehner last year. Some recent steps taken by Ryan generated a new round of political chatter, such as his release of a campaign-style video and a trip to Israel. Ryan, who will preside over the Cleveland convention, said his goal is to ensure there is integrity in the process. He said the 2016 nominee should be someone who has actually run this year and said he would urge delegates to pass a rule limiting the nomination only to actual candidates. I should not be considered. Period. End of story, he said. Still, Ryan offered his views on the state of the race, complaining that insults get more ink than ideas and that Republicans still owe it to the voters to show what they would do if given a mandate. I believe that we can once again be an optimistic party that is defined by our belief in the limitless possibility of our people, he said. Republicans who see a disaster looming in the Nov. 8 presidential election if Trump or U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas is the nominee have harbored hopes of drafting a popular party figure like Ryan or 2012 candidate Mitt Romney. For that to happen, no candidate would have won the 1,237 delegates required to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention, and delegates would have to approve a consensus alternative on a second or subsequent ballot. The latest national Reuters/Ipsos poll said Trump still leads Cruz among Republican voters but that his advantage has been narrowed. Trump had 41 percent support to 35 percent for Cruz of 598 Republicans surveyed from April 8-12.  In the Democratic race, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont each had 48 percent support, according to responses from 719 Democrats polled.The two have been tied frequently since February. Ryans announcement could give some hope to long-shot Republican candidate John Kasich, who portrayed himself as an antidote to what he called the divisive politics of Trump and Cruz. In a speech in New York City, Kasich criticized his rivals as wanting to take the United States down a path of darkness and offered himself as a more optimistic alternative, with a week to go before New York states Republican and Democratic primaries on April 19. Kasich - running a distant third behind Trump and Cruz and with no chance of capturing the Republican nomination unless he can emerge from a contested convention - did not mention Trump and Cruz by name but left no doubt as to who he was talking about. Some who feed off of the fears and anger that is felt by some of us and exploit it feed their own insatiable desire for fame or attention. That could drive America down into a ditch, not make us great again, Kasich said, referring to Trumps signature line. Trump is favored to win the April 19 primary in his home state. He holds a huge lead in opinion polls there, with Kasich running a distant second and Cruz in third place. A victory for Trump would help tamp down concerns among supporters that he is suddenly vulnerable after Cruz beat him in Wisconsin last week and won all Republican delegates in Colorado on Saturday. At a rally in Rome, New York, Trump blamed the Republican National Committee for setting up a system in which Colorado Republicans picked their delegates without letting people vote. The rules are no good when you dont have democracy, he said, reiterating his allegation that the delegate selection process was rigged. Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told Fox News on Monday that the process for choosing delegates had been set by states for more than a year and was no secret. In some good news for Trump on Tuesday, he was formally declared the winner of Missouris Republican primary, which was held on March 15. ",politicsNews,"April 12, 2016 ",1
Puerto Rico rescue plan strains U.S. Republican caucus,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading Republicans on Tuesday outlined a plan to help Puerto Rico shed crippling debt and accused investor-allied groups of misleading lawmakers about the proposal. The rescue would steer creditors and holders of Puerto Rico bonds toward a new, independent board that would seek a fair way to write down an estimated $70 billion in debt. Banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and Puerto Rico citizens all hold paper issued by 18 entities on the U.S. commonwealth and many of those investors, if not all, would face a loss. Lawmakers in Congress are being lobbied - and attacked - by investor groups that are trying to protect their bottom lines. They are deceitful, said Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who leads the House Natural Resources Committee. Bishop said accusations likening the Puerto Rico rescue plan to a government bailout were crap, and the plan had the virtue of protecting taxpayers and not spending government money. The rescue plan does, however, adopt some principles of bankruptcy law and that makes it controversial. Investors could be forced into a settlement over the objections of holdout bondholders under certain circumstances, according to a draft of the bill. Some lawmakers said allowing Puerto Rico to modify its bonds could mean chaos for municipal markets. If they can do it for Puerto Rico, they can do it for every other state, Rep. Tom McClintock said of the damage that the rescue bill would do. McClintock, a California Republican, said he was very concerned about the plan after a half-hour meeting Tuesday afternoon of Republicans on the Natural Resources panel. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement that he supported Bishops effort because it holds the right people accountable for the crisis (and) shrinks the size of government. Ryan also said he liked the idea of an independent board settling investor disputes, adding that legislation passed last week to halt payments on Puerto Ricos debt was troubling. The Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative lawmakers, said in a statement it was still reviewing the bill, but we are encouraged that there appear to be some improvements. Ryan will need the votes of many fiscally-conservative Republicans - and as is seen likely, some Democrats - if he is to get the rescue package through the House of Representatives. The plan will face a test on Wednesday when the Natural Resources panel begins to amend the plan during a law-writing session known as a mark up. An aide to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said her office was still reviewing the legislation. ",politicsNews,"April 12, 2016 ",1
Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Grassley tells Garland no hearings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Merrick Garland, President Barack Obamas U.S. Supreme Court selection, failed to persuade Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley during a private meeting on Tuesday to hold confirmation hearings on his nomination. As he indicated last week, Grassley explained why the Senate wont be moving forward during this hyper-partisan election year, Grassleys office said in a statement that described the meeting as cordial and pleasant. The two men met for 70 minutes in the Senate dining room. The Iowa Republican two decades ago also sought to block Garlands nomination to the federal appeals court on which he currently serves as chief judge. Garland later met privately with Lisa Murkowski, one of the dwindling number of moderate Senate Republicans. Her office issued a statement that also seemed to close the door on confirming Garland. Garland was nominated by Obama, a Democrat, on March 16 to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans who control the Senate are refusing to advance the nomination, prompting Democrats to accuse them of obstructionism and of ignoring their constitutional obligations. Republicans insist that the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office Jan. 20, fill the vacancy, hoping a Republican will win the White House and choose a conservative rather than the centrist Garland. Democrats applauded those Republicans willing to meet with Garland but said public hearings are essential. Dark-money groups (conservative contributors) are trying to do the Republicans dirty work and sully Judge Garlands name while Republican senators prevent Judge Garland from explaining his views to the public, New York Senator Chuck Schumer told reporters. That is cowardly, its backward and it is wrong. The White House released a letter written by 15 former presidents of the American Bar Association to Senate leaders urging a timely hearing and a vote on Garlands confirmation. The stated refusal to fill the ninth seat of the Supreme Court injects a degree of politics into the judicial branch that materially hampers the effective operation of our nations highest court and the lower courts over which it presides, the former ABA leaders stated. The conservative Tea Party Patriots and Judicial Crisis Network praised Grassley for holding firm against hearings. In a Reuters-Ipsos poll that included 900 registered Democrats and 788 registered Republicans conducted April 5-12, 55 percent said the Senate should hold confirmation hearings. The respondents were split along party lines, with 61 percent of Democrats supporting Garlands confirmation compared to 22 percent of Republicans. ",politicsNews,"April 12, 2016 ",1
Congress sends Obama bill on Zika drug development,"(Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday approved a bill to provide financial incentives to companies developing treatments for the Zika virus, and the White House said President Barack Obama was expected to sign the legislation although it is insufficient to meet the challenge. The measure allows the Food and Drug Administration to include Zika drug developers in the agencys priority review voucher program. The program encourages manufacturers to study treatments for diseases that might not be profitable by expediting the regulatory review of a more lucrative drug in their research pipeline. The House of Representatives passed the bill on a voice vote, without a roll call, weeks after the same measure was approved by the Senate. White House spokeswoman Katie Hill said Obama was expected to sign the bill, which she called a small step that could encourage the private sector to tackle Zika. But it contains no funding and is ultimately insufficient on its own, since it doesnt provide the $1.9 billion in funding that our public health experts have said is needed right now to prepare Americans for the imminent local transmission of Zika in this country, she said in a statement. Democrats and administration officials are urging the Republican-controlled Congress to grant nearly $1.9 billion in emergency funds to combat the spread of Zika. In a temporary fix, the White House said last week that it would redirect $589 million in allocated funds to prepare for the mosquito that carries the disease to emerge in the continental United States. According to the World Health Organization, there is a strong scientific consensus that the Zika virus can cause the rare birth defect microcephaly in newborns. But the link between the virus and the birth defects has not been scientifically established. On Tuesday, Brazil confirmed 1,113 cases of microcephaly and considers most to be related to Zika infections in the mother. Drugmakers who are working on Zika-related drugs, or considering such research, include Sanofi SA, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.  Zika was first detected in Brazil last year and is spreading through the Americas. The World Health Organization had declared a global health emergency due to the viruss possible link to microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, in adults. On Monday, top health officials said the mosquito that spreads the virus is now present in about 30 U.S. states, making local outbreaks a possibility. They have also predicted hundreds of thousands of people would be infected in Puerto Rico when the mosquito season kicks in this summer. A pharmaceutical company may be given a priority review voucher to develop a drug for an infectious disease, in this case Zika, which may not generate much profit for the manufacturer. The voucher gives the company the right to an accelerated review by the FDA of any other, more lucrative, drug in its pipeline. Developing a new drug can take years and cost millions of dollars. A standard FDA review takes at least 10 months to complete - longer if the agency requires additional information. Being able to shave time off that process and get a profitable drug onto the market faster can be worth millions of dollars to a manufacturer. Under the agencys priority review program, companies who submit a drug for review that is intended to treat serious conditions or whose drug shows a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing treatments is eligible to be reviewed in six months, at least four months faster than usual. A priority review voucher gives a company the right to a six-month review on any product, regardless of whether it meets the conditions normally required to receive an accelerated review. It also gives the company the right to sell the voucher to another company. The law currently makes any company eligible for a priority review voucher that is developing a drug for one of more than 20 tropical diseases listed under the voucher program. These include malaria, cholera, leprosy, dengue, tuberculosis, and Ebola. The FDA has the authority to add other infectious diseases to the list which primarily affects poor countries.

Obama expected to sign bill on Zika drug development: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to sign a bill to provide financial incentives to companies developing treatments for the Zika virus, a White House spokeswoman said, but the bill passed by the House of Representatives on Tuesday is insufficient to meet the challenge. We hope that this legislation encourages private sector partners to address the challenge of Zika, but it contains no funding and is ultimately insufficient on its own, since it doesnt provide the $1.9 billion in funding that our public health experts have said is needed right now to prepare Americans for the imminent local transmission of Zika in this country, spokeswoman Katie Hill said.

"Hillary Clinton, NYC mayor assailed for racially charged joke","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A comic gag turned into a gaffe for Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, triggering a storm of social media comment accusing them of being insensitive to African-Americans. Clinton on Saturday took the stage with de Blasio at the Inner Circle, an annual media roast of city and state politicians that traditionally ends with New Yorks mayor delivering a snarky rebuttal in the form of a rehearsed skit, often with the help of Broadway cast members. This year Leslie Odom Jr., who is black and plays Aaron Burr in the hit Broadway show Hamilton, participated in the skit in which Clinton teased de Blasio about his delay in endorsing her bid for the White House. Sorry, Hillary, I was running on C.P. Time, de Blasio said, referring to the phrase colored peoples time, an in-joke used to indicate chronic lateness but also viewed as a negative stereotype. I dont like jokes like that, Odom said, apparently as part of the skit. Clinton then delivered the punchline: Cautious politician time, she said. Ive been there. The joke set off angry reaction on social media with commentators criticizing Clinton, who has strong support from black voters, and de Blasio, whose wife Chirlane McCray is African-American, for insensitivity. Despite opinion polls showing Clinton has overwhelming support among African Americans heading into New York states Democratic primary next Tuesday, some supporters worry her challenger Bernie Sanders has begun making inroads.  De Blasio, who was Clintons campaign manager in her successful election to the U.S. Senate in 2000, defended the joke in an appearance on CNN on Monday. It was clearly a staged show, he said. I think people are missing the point here. In a statement on Monday, the mayors office said, Lets be clear, in an evening of satire, the only person this was meant to mock was the mayor himself - period. Certainly no one intended to offend anyone. In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine, Clinton distanced herself from the skit. Well, look, it was Mayor de Blasios skit, she was quoted as saying. He has addressed it, and I will really defer to him because it is something that hes already talked about. ",politicsNews,"April 12, 2016 ",1

Chicago schools would have less funding in governor's budget,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The head of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) said on Tuesday that Illinois Governor Bruce Rauners fiscal 2017 school funding budget would hurt the financially ailing district. Projected per-district funding levels released by the Illinois State Board of Education on Tuesday indicate CPS would receive nearly $893 million in the fiscal year that begins July 1, a drop of $74.4 million from the current fiscal year. It makes our already grave fiscal crisis graver, CPS CEO Forrest Claypool told reporters. Thats why his budget must be defeated. He added that state funding for the nations third-largest public school system was cut by $106 million in fiscal 2016. CPS is struggling with a $1.1 billion structural budget deficit caused largely by escalating pension payments. The district, which has credit ratings in the junk level, has been dependent on borrowing to generate cash flow.   The Republican governor in February proposed boosting per-student funding in K-12 public schools to $6,119, the highest level in seven years. However, some districts like CPS would have a decrease in general state aid based on lower enrollment and other factors. Claypool said Illinois needs to replace its radically discriminatory education funding formula, claiming it short-changes Chicagos poor and minority children. He called a new funding plan unveiled by Senate Democrats last week a step in the right direction, but not a complete fix. Legislation unveiled by Democratic Senator Andy Manar is aimed at providing more funding to high-need, high-poverty schools. Claypool said he was also encouraged by Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigans proposed amendment to the Illinois Constitution that would make public education a fundamental right, while giving the state the preponderant responsibility for funding schools.

"U.S. presidential rivals Clinton, Sanders tied in support among Democrats: poll"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top contenders in both the Democratic and the Republican presidential nominating races have roughly equal support among members of their respective parties, according to a national Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.  The results suggest the race to get onto the Nov. 8 presidential ballot is tightening, as candidates prepare for their next state contest, in New York next week.  In the Democratic race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont each had 48 percent support, according to responses from 719 Democrats polled from April 8-12.The two have been tied frequently since February.  In the Republican race, celebrity real estate developer Donald Trump had 41 percent support, to 35 percent for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, according to responses from 598 Republicans. The result was within the polls credibility interval.  Cruzs support has risen in recent weeks, making him the first candidate to rival Trumps popularity among Republicans since neurosurgeon Ben Carson in November.    ",politicsNews,"April 12, 2016 ",1
"Securities, commodities regulators press U.S. Congress for more funds","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The heads of the U.S. agencies that regulate securities and commodities pressed a Senate committee on Tuesday to boost their budgets in the face of growing sophistication in financial markets and technology, but lawmakers gave no sign extra dollars were coming soon.  In his proposed budget, President Barack Obama requested an 11 percent increase for the Securities and Exchange Commission, bringing its spending to $1.781 billion. He also sought a 32 percent increase for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to give the agency overseeing the $400 trillion U.S. swaps market as well as commodities trading, a $331 million budget. The SEC offsets any taxpayer funds it receives with user fees and fines, which means its spending does not affect the federal deficit. But Senator John Boozman of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on financial services, said that did not leave it free of oversight.  Congress has a responsibility to ensure those funds are being spent in a manner that protects investors, helps markets operate efficiently and spurs economic growth for all Americans, he said at Tuesdays hearing. He added that access to more funding does not necessarily ensure that an agency will successfully achieve its mission or spend that funding responsibly. For the SEC, additional funding is imperative if we are to continue the agencys progress in fulfilling its responsibilities over our increasingly fast, complex and growing markets, Chair Mary Jo White said. It would help the SEC hire 250 staff in critical, core areas and continue to improve our information technology.  The new staff would allow the SEC to conduct more exams, increase data analytics and improve intelligence gathering for enforcement cases, she added. At the hearing, CFTC Chair Timothy Massad said the agency does not have the resources necessary to adequately oversee its markets, especially with an industry that is changing and innovating at the speed of light and that is much larger and more complex than even just a few years ago. More than a third of the extra dollars requested would go toward information technology, he said. Part of the increase, $15.5 million, would go toward enforcement because the CFTC faces an increasing number of well-financed defendants with high-powered defense teams. Massad added the CFTC was working to change the levels of its fines, saying levies for many violations were far too low. ",politicsNews,"April 12, 2016 ",1
Kerry defends trade deals against campaign attacks,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry defended a 12-nation Pacific trade agreement on Tuesday against what he suggested was fear-mongering by the leading U.S. presidential candidates. Without mentioning Trump by name, Kerry argued that the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that the Obama administration negotiated would be good for the U.S. economy even as he acknowledged U.S. workers fears about free trade agreements. Many Americans still feel a sense of anxiety about TPP and T-TIP. In fact, theyve been revved up to have some anxiety about anything related to trade, Kerry said in a speech in Los Angeles, also referring to a trade deal with Europe called the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Some of workers mistrust of trade agreements comes from politicians who play to fears, he added. It comes also from legitimate anger about the economic status of millions of our fellow citizens who have not gained from trade. Voter anxiety and anger over international trade and the trade pact have helped propel Trump, the Republican front-runner, whose main opponent for the Republican nomination, Senator Ted Cruz, also opposes the deal. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton worked on TTP as President Barack Obamas first secretary of state, calling it the gold standard of such deals, but is now against it, saying it does not adequately protect U.S. workers. Senator Bernie Sanders, her main Democratic rival, also opposes it. Given the criticism of TPP in the presidential campaign, prospects for it receiving a vote before the Nov. 8 election are diminishing, and some lawmakers have said it would be better to consider it during the lame duck  session after the vote. Still, Obama administration officials have been stepping up their campaign to promote TPP, especially emphasizing the deals geopolitical benefits of strengthening ties with Asian allies in the face of an increasingly aggressive China.

"Not an endorsement, but close; Obama comments hint at support for Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama seemed to inch a little closer on Tuesday to endorsing former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons presidential bid. During remarks at a museum dedicated to highlighting the fight for womens equality, the president, who has made clear his admiration for his one-time rival but has not officially endorsed her, said he hoped one day people would be amazed that the United States had not had a female commander-in-chief. I want young girls and boys to come here, 10, 20, 100 years from now to know that women fought for equality, it was not just given to them, Obama said of the museum. I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the board room or in Congress. That there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the Oval Office. Clinton is running against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to be the Democratic Partys 2016 presidential candidate. She lost the 2008 race to Obama, who was then a U.S. senator and who later made her the nations top diplomat in his administration. Obama, perhaps realizing that people would read his remarks as a hint of support for Clinton, tempered them by saying he did not know when a woman would win the White House. I dont know how long itll take to get there, but I know were getting closer to that day because of the work of generations of active, committed citizens, he said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obamas remarks indicated the country was ready for a woman president, but he stressed the candidates would be judged on their values and policy agenda. Obama remains hugely popular with the base of Democratic supporters who helped propel him to the White House and re-elect him in 2012. An endorsement of Clinton could help her vanquish Sanders, who is behind the former first lady in amassing the number of delegates needed to become the nominee but has remained a strong challenger with wins in a number of state nominating contests.

Trump remittance plan would violate Mexican rights: Mexico cenbank,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Donald Trumps proposal to force Mexico to pay for his planned border wall by threatening to block remittances from illegal immigrants would be a major violation of Mexicans rights, Mexicos central bank governor said on Tuesday. The Republican presidential hopefuls campaign said last week that if elected in November, Trump would use a U.S. anti-terrorism law to cut off such money transfers unless Mexico made a one-time payment of $5 billion to $10 billion for the wall. However, speaking in Mexicos Congress, Mexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens dismissed the idea. The remittances are the property of the people that make them, and they have every right to be able to carry out international transfers, Carstens told reporters.

"Grassley, Garland reprise 1990s judicial confirmation fight","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chuck Grassley and Merrick Garland go way back, but when the Republican Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and President Barack Obamas U.S. Supreme Court nominee meet for a private breakfast on Tuesday, they will not exactly be sharing fond memories. Two decades ago, Grassley, an Iowa Republican, spearheaded a fight against Garlands nomination to the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Just like now, a Democratic president, in that case Bill Clinton, submitted Garlands nomination to a Republican-controlled Senate. Garland, then a top Justice Department lawyer, was denied a Senate confirmation vote in 1995 and 1996 despite earning bipartisan praise. Finally, in 1997, after Clinton renominated Garland upon winning re-election in 1996, was he confirmed to a seat on the court that was a launching pad to the Supreme Court for Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas, as well as the late Antonin Scalia. Fast-forward to 2016: Another Democratic president has chosen Garland to replace Scalia only to have Grassley and a Republican Senate maneuver to block the nomination without so much as a Judiciary Committee hearing. Nothin against him, the 82-year-old Grassley, who describes himself as just a farmer from Butler County, told Reuters. Even so, Garland, 63, will sit down with Grassley on Tuesday and be told that once again, his nomination will be put on ice. In 1995 and 1996, Garland was entangled in what ended up being a 12- or 15-year crusade, Grassley said, to reduce the number of judges on the federal appeals court that Clinton chose him to join. Two decades later, Grassley again offered no criticism of Garlands qualifications. Grassley, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has decided to ignore Garlands nomination in the hope that a Republican will be elected president on Nov. 8 and, after taking office in January, would choose a conservative rather than the centrist Garland. Its not about him because were living by the principle let the people have a voice, Grassley said, referring to the November presidential and congressional elections. Grassley, no stranger to controversy during 35 years in the Senate, has become the target of Democrats scorn in this Supreme Court drama. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said Grassley could go down as both inept and the most obstructionist Judiciary Committee chairman in history. Other voices have weighed in against Grassley and his fellow Republicans, with the Des Moines Register newspaper in his home state calling the Garland blockade un-American. Grassley, facing re-election in November, insists he will not buckle, and called the Registers editorial hyperbolic rhetoric. In a Senate speech last week, he recounted showdowns dating back to the 1980s when he took on a popular president from his own party, Ronald Reagan, over budget matters. I am no stranger to political pressure and to strong-arm tactics, Grassley said. Grassley then turned his attention to Roberts, criticizing a speech the chief justice made shortly before Scalias death about the politicization of the confirmation process and warning Roberts, appointed by Republican George W. Bush, to keep his mouth shut in the Garland fight. Now thats a political temptation that the chief justice should resist, Grassley said. ",politicsNews,"April 11, 2016 ",1
California to hike funds for new parents on family leave,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California will increase the amount of money new parents can receive through the states paid family leave program under a bill signed on Monday by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown. The measure, passed last month by the Democratic-controlled state legislature, will increase the amount paid to new parents or people caring for a sick family member to as much as 70 percent of their regular income for the poorest workers, up from 55 percent, beginning in 2018. Those earning more will also get an increase in payments, to 60 percent from 55 percent. The legislation also eliminates a seven-day waiting period imposed on receiving the benefits. The program will apply to all parents who take time off from work to bond with a child within one year of birth, adoption or placement as a foster child. It will also provide payments to people who take time to care for seriously ill relatives. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, welcomed the move by the most populous U.S. state and urged Congress to enact a national paid leave plan. This action means more hardworking Californians will have the peace of mind to know that they can take care of a new child or a sick family member, Obama said in a statement. Yet millions of Americans still dont have access to any form of paid leave.  The California law aims to help more people take family leave, especially poorer Californians who could not afford to stop work if they got only 55 percent of their regular income, according to the bills author, Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic assembly member. Money for the program will come through the states disability insurance system, which is funded from payroll deductions. Costs are projected at up to $587 million annually when it is fully implemented by 2021, but the law expires in 2022, and would have to be reauthorized at that time. A state analysis showed the Employment Development Department would increase worker contributions by 0.1 percent from 2019 to 2021 to pay for it.  ",politicsNews,"April 11, 2016 ",1
Trump blasts 'rigged' rules on picking Republican delegates,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump lashed out at what he called the partys rigged delegate selection rules on Monday after rival Ted Cruz swept all of Colorados 34 delegates over the weekend. The New York billionaire, who has been outmaneuvered by Cruz in a series of recent state meetings to select national convention delegates, said the process was set up to protect party insiders and shut out insurgent candidates. The system is rigged, its crooked, Trump said on Fox News on Monday, alleging the Colorado convention results showed voters were being denied a voice in the process. There was no voting. I didnt go out there to make a speech or anything, theres no voting, Trump said. The people out there are going crazy, in the Denver area and Colorado itself, and theyre going absolutely crazy because they werent given a vote. This was given by politicians - its a crooked deal. Trump has 743 bound delegates to 545 for Cruz, according to an Associated Press count, in the battle for the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot and avoid a messy floor fight at the Republican National Convention from July 18-21. But both are at risk of not acquiring enough delegates for a first-ballot victory, leaving many free to switch their votes on later ballots. That has set off a fierce scramble by Republican candidates to get their supporters chosen as convention delegates and brought new scrutiny to the selection rules, which vary by state. Trump, who has brought in veteran strategist Paul Manafort to lead his delegate-gathering efforts, complained about Cruzs recent success at local and state party meetings where activists pick the actual delegates who will attend the national convention. Trump accused Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, of trying to steal delegates in South Carolina. Trump won the state primary in February, but Cruz supporters got four of the first six delegate slots filled at congressional district meetings on Saturday, according to local media. Cruz also succeeded at getting more of his supporters chosen as delegates in Iowa, where he won the caucuses in January, and at last weeks state convention in North Dakota. Now theyre trying to pick off those delegates one by one, Trump said. Thats not the way democracy is supposed to work. They offer them trips, they offer them all sorts of things and youre allowed to do that. You can buy all these votes. Trump distributed a video of what he said was a Colorado voter setting his Republican Party registration on fire in protest of the process. Great people being disenfranchised by politicians, Trump said on Twitter, adding the Republican Party was in trouble. Guy Short, a Cruz backer in Colorado who was elected as a Republican national convention delegate for the sixth time, disputed Trumps allegations. Donald Trump is a liar, Short told Reuters in an email. Nobody was offered anything. In fact, I spent thousands of dollars of my own money campaigning to become a delegate because its that important to make sure Donald Trump is NOT our nominee. Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told Fox News the process for choosing delegates had been set by states for more than a year and was no secret. Not understanding that is one thing, but its hardly rigged when its done right out in the open, he said. Cruz campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart said Trump was insulting the process to distract from his losses. He has a pattern of whining when he isnt winning, she said in a statement. Trumps organizational troubles even extend to two of his children. Eric Trump, 32, and Ivanka Trump, 34, missed the deadline for registering as Republicans to vote in next weeks New York primary. State records show both are registered voters who are not enrolled in a party, ABC News reported. For already registered voters, any request to switch party affiliation must have been made by early October. The deadline for new voter registrations was March 25. Trump was the target on Monday of a new ad by the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, that listed Trumps comments on women, Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Both Clinton and rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, have tried to position themselves as the Democrat most capable of defeating Trump. Donald Trump says we can solve Americas problems by turning against each other, Clintons ad said. Its wrong and it goes against everything New York and America stand for.

Police arrest 400 at U.S. Capitol in protest of money in politics,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Police arrested more than 400 protesters outside the U.S. Capitol on Monday from Democracy Spring, an organization seeking to remove big money from politics and combat restrictive voter identification laws. The mostly calm and orderly demonstration resulted in arrests for what the U.S. Capitol Police called unlawful demonstration activity such as crowding and obstruction. Organizers vowed to repeat the demonstration every day for a week. The protest was held to demand Congress take immediate action to end the corruption of big money in our politics and ensure free and fair elections, Democracy Spring said on its website. The group lists actor Mark Ruffalo and academic Noam Chomsky and dozens of well-known activist groups among its supporters. We believe this is the peoples house, and Congress should be responsive to the people. We need to protect voting rights, said Peter Callahan, the groups communications coordinator. Protesters hoisted a scarecrow-like effigy of a corporate lobbyist holding money bags and a sign reading, Warning: Massive civil disobedience is next. Police arrested those who sat on the stairs of the East Front of the Capitol, the seat of the Senate and the House of Representatives.  Democracy Spring traces its roots to the end of the Occupy Los Angeles movement, and its rise coincides with the presidential campaigns of Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom speak against the influence of campaign contributions on politicians. While most of the groups involved are associated more with Democrats than Republicans, Callahan said the group was nonpartisan. We see populism on the rise on both sides of the spectrum. Americans are sick and tired of their politicians being bought and paid for, Callahan said. ",politicsNews,"April 11, 2016 ",1
California or bust: Bernie Sanders charts a White House path,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Defying opinion polls and expert predictions, Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders aims to seize the partys White House nomination from Hillary Clintons grasp with a last-ditch come-from-behind triumph in California. By far the most populous U.S. state, California is the largest prize of the state-by-state nominating contests, and the vote on June 7 is one of the last before Democrats convene in July to select a nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election. An aggressive schedule of large rallies is planned along with heavy purchases of TV, radio and online advertising in three languages and a far, far more expensive campaign effort than in any other state, Sanders campaign sources disclosed. I think theyre still riding rainbow unicorns if they think theres a path, said Steve Schale, a Florida-based strategist, of Sanders bid for the White House. California has been a reliable source of campaign funds for Clinton, and opinion polls show her ahead there by as many as 14 percentage points. The statistical analysis media site FiveThirtyEight gives her a 91 percent chance of winning the state primary.         The Sanders campaign push aims to net as much as a 10-point win in California, helping him deny the front-running Clinton the 2,383 convention delegates she needs to clinch the nomination and give him the momentum to force a contested convention where he can try to win over the superdelegates, those not decided by a state nominating contest and free to support anyone, the campaign sources said. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has eroded Clintons lead in California, according to a Field Poll released on Friday. Clinton led Sanders by only 6 points in that survey, down from a double-digit lead earlier this year. With California what were going to do is something that (Sanders) really likes to do: Barnstorm the place, said Tad Devine, Sanders senior adviser, acknowledging Sanders underdog status against Clinton, the former secretary of state. That means two or three large-scale rallies a day for weeks, possibly starting in late April to target early voters, he said. Such rallies are a sweet spot for the 74-year-old New York-born democratic socialists firebrand speaking style championing the working class and vowing to erase economic inequality. At a late March event in The Bronx, he drew 18,500 people. Clinton leads in pledged convention delegates - those allocated to candidates on the basis of the state primaries and caucuses - with 1,287 to 1,037 for Sanders.  A candidate needs 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination. California has 475 delegates, to be divided proportionally according to the June 7 primary vote. The Clinton campaign plans to put up a fight. Local and national surrogates will speak out in English and Spanish and staff will beef up offices up and down the West Coast as the California vote nears, her campaign said. Werefighting for every vote by talking to Californians about why Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in this race who will break down the barriers that hold people back and deliver real results, Amanda Renteria, Hillary for America national political director, said in a statement to Reuters.  Headed into theJune 7primary, our volunteers and supporters are knocking on doors and hitting the phones to share with friends, family and neighbors Hillary Clintons plans to create more good-paying jobs in California, keep our streets safe from gun violence, protect our environment, reform our immigration system and ensure all Californians have access to a good education and quality affordable health care. Sanders has won seven of the last eight state nominating battles but faces a potentially rougher road in big states like New York, where Clinton was a U.S. senator and which holds an April 19 primary. Sanders aims to overcome the edge that Clinton, wife of former President Bill Clinton, has enjoyed with minorities. Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to the campaign, said the campaign aims to match or outdo the 10,000 volunteers it enlisted in New York by drawing on the Labor for Bernie volunteer group, local and national unions and other groups. Well certainly do Spanish-language advertising, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said. Devine said that Vietnamese was also part of the plan. The languages are nods to Californias large populations of Latino and Asian voters. Weaver compared California to Michigan, where Sanders notched a surprise win in early March after advertising in Arabic to woo the states heavy concentration of Muslims. The campaign has yet to set a budget for California, but given the states size, the effort will be hugely expensive - far, far more expensive than any other state that weve done, Weaver said.  In California so far, the campaign has raised about $9.8 million from more than 26,000 donors, the most Sanders has received from any one state, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance disclosures. Clinton has raked in significant sums also in California.  An analysis of campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission indicate her campaign raised $26,687,011.37 from donors in California from the time she entered the race in 2015 until the end of February.

Senate committee to take up bill on CFTC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee will soon consider legislation on the countrys commodities and derivatives regulator that is intended to keep financial-sector restrictions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law from applying to farmers and ranchers because their derivatives trading helps them manage operational risks. On Thursday, the Agriculture Committee will mark up legislation reauthorizing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the $400 trillion U.S. swaps market as well as trading in agriculture, metals and energy.  Republicans, who are the majority in Congress and lead the committee, unveiled the bill late on Monday. A congressional source familiar with the legislation said lawmakers were open to negotiation and the bill could change before Thursday. The central aim of the Senate committees bill is to allow farmers, ranchers and energy providers to hedge their operational risks with derivatives, while maintaining regulation of financial swaps trading. The source said it was not an attempt to affect position limits that the CFTC sets on contracts or options.   The 2010 Dodd-Frank law strengthened oversight of swaps in order to prevent a repeat of the risky bets that contributed to the financial crisis. Republicans have said that rules the CFTC  put in place to carry out the law have spread regulation into areas outside of finance, which Congress did not intend. Nonetheless, the Senate bill would address some financial elements such as requiring electronic confirmation of customers account balances at banks and preventing firms from moving funds among accounts without notifying regulators. It would also strengthen protection for proprietary information submitted to the CFTC as part of required disclosures and create a judicial review process for the commissions rulemaking. The bill unveiled on Monday would also require the commission to review and take action on the London Metal Exchanges application to register as a foreign board of trade.  The CFTC has had to operate on year-by-year funding since the end of 2013 because Congress has not passed a new authorization for it. Lawmakers say this has created uncertainty in many markets. The House of Representatives passed its version of the CFTC authorization in June. Parts of that legislation that stirred controversy, such as a cost-benefit analysis requirement, were not included in this bill. ",politicsNews,"April 11, 2016 ",1
New York City to pursue sweeping homelessness reforms: mayor,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City will implement a raft of reforms to combat its high level of homelessness, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday, following a three-month review of the problem. In New York, the United States largest city, around 58,000 people sleep in shelters each night, representing the largest homeless population for any U.S. metropolitan area, according to the National Alliance to end Homelessness. Nearly half of those homeless are children. The changes announced on Monday are intended to address the issue in four key areas: preventing at-risk residents from losing their homes, moving homeless out of shelters and into permanent housing, improving conditions at shelters and reducing the number of homeless who sleep in the streets. We know the status quo has not been working, de Blasio said at Bronxworks, a nonprofit that helps impoverished families. We dont accept that status quo. Today begins a new approach. The number of homeless has more than doubled from around 23,000 two decades ago and has remained stubbornly high, leaving de Blasios administration open to criticism. New Yorks large shelter population is in part due to a landmark court case that established a right to shelter mandate requiring city authorities to provide housing for those without it. In response, the mayor has proposed spending an additional $66 million dollars to fight the problem, though he said the organizational changes announced on Monday would lead to savings of $38 million to help offset those new costs. The citys Human Resources Administration and Department of Homeless Services will report to a single commissioner and share administrative duties, de Blasio said, eliminating some bureaucratic redundancies. The city will use data analytics to identify at-risk families and increase its use of legal assistance and rental aid to avoid evictions. De Blasio also said the city would conduct more inspections of shelters and crack down on not-for-profit agencies that fail to provide safe and adequate shelters. The New York City police department is already in the process of retraining so-called peace officers who share security responsibility with private guards at the citys more than 250 shelters. The city is also reinstating a dormant program that provided domestic violence services in shelters, after the review found 60 percent of violent episodes in family shelters were due to domestic violence. The issue gained more attention in February, when a homeless woman and two of her young children were stabbed to death at a hotel used by the city to house homeless families. The womans boyfriend was charged with murder. ",politicsNews,"April 11, 2016 ",1

Antitrust head Baer to serve as No. 3 at Justice Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced on Monday that Bill Baer will serve as acting associate attorney general, leaving his position as head of the departments Antitrust Division to take the No. 3 post at the department.  Baer was considered most likely to replace Stuart Delery, the acting associate attorney general, who announced last week that he will leave on April 17. From his work at the Federal Trade Commission to his leadership of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division, he has demonstrated keen intelligence, strong judgment and consummate skill, Lynch said of Baer in a statement.  Lynch did not say whether the Obama administration would seek to confirm Baer through a Senate nomination process.  As head of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division, Baer oversaw such cases as the scheme by Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and others to rig the foreign currency exchange spot market as well as the case against Apple for price-fixing e-books, Lynch said.  The Justice Department declined to comment on who would replace Baer in the Antitrust division.  ",politicsNews,"April 11, 2016 ",1
Chicago finance committee approves payouts for police custody deaths,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Chicago City Councils Finance Committee on Monday approved payments totaling $6.45 million to settle cases involving two  black men who died while in police custody. The settlements come as the third-biggest U.S. citys police department faces a federal investigation and racism accusations over the death of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired his police commissioner in 2015 after protests following the release of a video showing a Chicago police officer shooting 17-year-old McDonald 16 times. Under the settlements, the family of Philip Coleman, who was tasered by police officers while handcuffed in a jail cell in 2012 and later died after being taken to a hospital, will receive $4.95 million. Coleman was dragged motionless out of his cell by the handcuffs. The tasering and dragging were caught on video cameras. The committee also approved $1.5 million for the family of Justin Cook, who died of an asthma attack after being arrested in 2014. The suit claimed that police did not provide appropriate medical attention. The full city council will vote on the settlements on Wednesday. High-profile killings of black men by mainly white police officers in U.S. cities have prompted a national debate and protests about the use of excessive force by police.

Two Trump kids won't be voting for Dad in New York primary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump says two of his children feel guilty about missing a voter registration deadline, meaning they will not be able to vote for him next week in New Yorks Republican primary. Eric Trump, 32, and Ivanka Trump, 34, the Republican front-runners second and third children, have campaigned extensively with their father, but both missed the deadline for registering as Republicans to vote in the New York primary on April 19. In a telephone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump joked that he would have to find some way to punish Eric and Ivanka for their mistake. No more allowance! the New York billionaire said with a laugh. For already registered voters, any request to switch party affiliation must have been made by early October. The deadline for new voter registrations was March 25. They were unaware of the rules, Trump said Monday on Fox News. They feel very, very guilty. But its fine. I mean, I understand that. Records from the New York State Board of Elections show both Eric and Ivanka are registered voters who are not enrolled in a party, ABC News reported. Like their father, they have made political contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, Federal Election Commission records show. Trumps oldest child, Donald Jr., 38, already was registered Republican. The registration status of his other voting-age child, Tiffany, was not immediately known. Trumps comments on Monday brought swift rebukes on Twitter from critics who said the Trump childrens lapse bolsters doubts about whether Trump is a true Republican. Trump previously supported abortion rights and has donated to Democrats, including his now-rival Hillary Clinton. I for one am shocked as the whole family really seem like lifelong conservatives, user Awen Lake (@AwenLake) posted on Twitter, adding the hashtag #reallydemocrat. This is so funny.

"Sanders wins Wyoming, prepares to take on Clinton in New York","WASHINGTON - Bernie Sanders won the U.S. presidential Democratic nominating contest in Wyoming on Saturday, besting rival Hillary Clinton and adding to a string of recent victories as the two candidates gear up for a crucial matchup in New York. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has won seven out of the last eight state-level Democratic nominating contests, trying to chip away at Clintons big lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the partys nomination. Wyomings 14 Democratic delegates - fewer than any other state - are awarded proportionally based on support from individuals participating in the nominating contest.  Early estimates showed that while Sanders won the contest, both he and Clinton would likely receive seven delegates each in the close race, maintaining Clintons lead overall. Going into Wyoming, Clinton had more than half of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination. Sanders trailed her by 250 pledged delegates, those awarded based on the results of the state nominating contests.   Clintons lead widens when superdelegates, Democratic leaders who can decide whom to support at the partys July convention, are included in the tallies. Clinton and Sanders both spent Saturday campaigning in New York, which holds its contest on April 19 and where a total of 291 delegates are up for grabs, more than 10 percent of the tally needed to win the partys nomination. Sanders wife, Jane Sanders, went onstage where he was speaking at a community college in Queens, a borough of New York City, to alert him to Saturdays victory. News bulletin - we just won Wyoming! Sanders said to cheers. Speaking to reporters after the event, Sanders said he believed he had enough momentum to secure the nomination. We are closing very fast, Sanders said.   Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, campaigned in the nearby borough of Brooklyn, where her campaign is based. Clinton represented New York as a U.S. senator and considers the state her home turf. Recent polls have shown Clinton more than 10 points ahead in the state. Tension between the two candidates flared earlier this week in a party race that has typically focused on policies and not personal attacks. The candidates dialed back their criticism of one another on Friday. In Wyomings Republican contest last month, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas beat New York billionaire Donald Trump, the partys front-runner. Cruz is trying to block Trump from receiving enough delegates to win the nomination outright, which would lead to a contested convention in July. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that a third of Trumps Republican supporters could consider abandoning the partys candidate if Trump is denied the nomination at a contested convention.

Obama says Clinton never jeopardized national security in email case: Fox,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton never jeopardized national security in the handling of her emails as his secretary of state. Obama, in an interview broadcast on Fox News Sunday, said Clinton has recognized a carelessness on the email issue in which she used a private server for government business.  But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective, Obama said. This is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state, and did an outstanding job. Clinton, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, has said her email arrangement broke no rules and that she will be vindicated in investigations of whether any laws were broken. The government forbids sending or storing classified information outside secure, government-controlled channels.  The FBI has taken the server and is investigating the case with U.S. Justice Department attorneys. At least two Republican-led congressional committees are also investigating. The Democratic president was asked if the Justice Department investigation would treat the Clinton case impartially. I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department, or the FBI, not just in this case, but in any case, said Obama, who leaves office next year. Guaranteed. Full stop. Nobody gets treated differently when it comes to the Justice Department. Because nobody is above the law, he said. The State Department said this month it has suspended plans for an internal review of whether classified information was properly handled in Clintons emails at the request of the FBI. The department, complying with a judges order, has released more than 52,000 emails from Clintons private server. Republican rivals in the battle for the Nov. 8 presidential election have cited the email controversy in saying Clinton is unfit for the presidency. ",politicsNews,"April 10, 2016 ",1
U.S. plans to curb tax 'inversions' could hit foreign companies,"LONDON (Reuters) - Planned changes that President Barack Obama says are aimed at ensuring American companies do not avoid tax by shifting their headquarters overseas could also force foreign companies to adopt more conservative U.S. tax-planning strategies. One of the measures restricts the ability of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies to deduct the interest they pay on loans from their parent firms from their taxable income. It aims to stop a redomiciled American firm from reducing its U.S. tax bill by piling inter-group debt on its U.S. operations, and effectively shifting profits overseas.  But it could also affect European companies that use similar strategies to reduce their tax bills in the United States after buying U.S. firms. The new rules announced by the Treasury department this week aim to curb so-called inversions - where a U.S. group acquires a smaller overseas company and shifts its domicile to a lower-tax jurisdiction.  Drugmaker Pfizers plan to buy rival Allergan and move to Ireland was one of the planned inversions that prompted the Obama administration to act. The $160 billion deal fell apart last week as a result of other aspects of the Treasury reforms. Under the new rule regarding debt, if a U.S. subsidiary transfers money to its overseas parent within three years before or after borrowing money from it, by paying a dividend or buying shares in the parent, then U.S. tax authorities could potentially treat the loan as if it was equity. This means the interest on the debt would not be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.  Experts said that European companies would still be able to shift profits via inter-group debt, but may have to do so gradually over a longer period of time. It, without doubt, significantly changes the rules of the game, said Stephen Shay, professor of law at Harvard University.  In the old days you bought and then you levered up as much as you can and that is not going to happen in the same way, but how much of a constraint that becomes is unclear, he added. Nancy McLernon, president of the Organization for International Investment, a trade group for the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, denied non-U.S. groups were routinely shifting profit overseas through debt.  Wheres the problem they (U.S. authorities) are trying to fix? It feels more like a tax grab, she said.  She said the complexity of the issue and uncertainty over how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. tax authority, would seek to use their new powers would make investing in new U.S. projects less attractive.  It will have a chilling effect on foreign direct investment in the United States, McLernon added. The Treasury says it is targeting situations where large debts are incurred to fund dividends shortly after an inversion or foreign acquisition, rather than the most common way U.S. subsidiaries accumulate inter-group debt. That is by having the subsidiary gradually pay all its profit to its parent as dividends and then borrow money from its parent for new investment.  The proposed regulations generally do not apply to related-party debt that is incurred to fund actual business investment, such as building or equipping a factory, a Treasury factsheet released last week said. Providing the money a foreign company takes out of its U.S. subsidiary is in line with the U.S. companys profits, the transactions should escape IRS scrutiny, Shay said. Companies dont usually publish details of their inter-group financing so its impossible to put a figure on how much profit foreign companies shelter from U.S. tax through inter-group loans. Richard Murphy, professor of practice in international political economy at City University London, estimates the IRS could lose tens of billions of dollars in taxes each year in this way. Companies that have reduced their U.S. tax bills via inter-group lending include drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, education group Pearson, utility Scottish Power and telecoms group Vodafone.  All said their lending to U.S. subsidiaries had been unwound and that they complied with all tax rules. Details of their lending arrangements came to public attention following data leaks or legal action with tax authorities. A 2013 Reuters examination of tax planning by Europes largest software group, SAP AG, showed how the German company shifted profits from the United States, which has a corporate tax rate of at least 35 percent, to Ireland whose headline rate is 12.5 percent. here HIGH-INTEREST LOANS According to Reuters calculations based on 2015 corporate filings, SAP America Inc reduces its U.S. tax bill by around $200 million a year by borrowing $7.4 billion from SAP Ireland US Financial Services Ltd at an interest rate of at least 7 percent. The debt, which helped fund the acquisition of U.S. software groups, cuts its taxable income by around $600 million a year. A spokesman for SAP group declined to comment on the Reuters calculations but said the company followed all tax rules and that its funding structure was driven by business rather than tax reasons. Some measures previously proposed by Obama and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which advises developed nations on tax policy, would have limited interest deductions to the extent that they reflected an operating units share of total group interest costs. Since SAP groups total net interest expense was just 5 million euros last year, most of its U.S. subsidiarys deduction may have been disallowed under such proposals.  But the Treasury plan is far more limited than these proposals. SAP filings suggest that it has not taken large amounts of cash from its acquired U.S. subsidiaries and recapitalized them with debt.  Debts accumulated as SAP has done  by acquiring and expanding U.S. companies - should not be captured by the new measures, even if that debt is out of proportion to the parents overall debt burden.  But its hard to be certain. Inter-group debts usually run for a period of a few years, and each time they extend them, there is an opportunity for the IRS to re-examine the arrangement.  There is certainly is a risk when they roll over that instrument, that it is going to be recharacterised as equity, said Victor Fleischer, professor of law at the University of San Diego, said of the SAP loans.

U.S. Democrat Clinton downplays chance of contested convention,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton on Sunday dismissed the notion of a contested nominating convention and said she was not preparing for such a scenario, after her rival for her partys presidential nomination racked up another victory.  Bernie Sanders won the Wyoming caucuses on Saturday, his seventh victory over Clinton in the last eight Democratic nominating contests as the two gear up for a crucial matchup on April 19 in New York state. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is trying to chip away at Clintons big lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. He said on Sunday he believed he could close the gap, and left the door open for a so-called floor flight at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July if neither has won an outright majority of delegates.  In that case, a system of multiple ballots takes place, governed by complex rules, with candidates hoping to persuade delegates to vote for them. Asked on CNN if she were preparing for such a scenario, Clinton said, No, I intend to have the number of delegates that are required to be nominated.    The former U.S. secretary of state said she was leading Sanders by 2.5 million popular votes and in pledged delegates. I feel good about the upcoming contests, and I expect to be the nominee, she said. The specter of a contested convention, a relatively rare event in recent U.S. politics, looms much larger in the Republican race. While front-runner Donald Trump has amassed a delegate lead by winning many state contests, rival Ted Cruz has proved tenacious in pursuit of every last delegate available by other means. Cruzs campaign has worked hard in states where the delegate allocation process is more complex, such as Colorado, where the U.S. senator from Texas garnered 34 delegates on Saturday. The Trump campaign has complained about the nominating process, including in Louisiana, where the New York billionaire Trump won the vote but split the delegates equally with Cruz. Its a crooked system, Trump said at a large rally in Rochester, New York, on Sunday before saying the process was broken in both major parties and expressing sympathy for Sanders. Look at Bernie: He wins and wins and wins.  Trump said he had warned the Republican National Committee there would be a big problem if he does not become the nominee. Were supposed to be a democracy. Were supposed to be: You vote and it means something. Paul Manafort, the veteran political strategist Trump hired to oversee his delegate operation, accused the Cruz campaign of bullying delegates into backing the senator, something the Trump campaign planned to protest. Well, hes threatening, you go to these county conventions, and you see the tactics, Gestapo tactics, the scorched-earth tactics, Manafort said on NBCs Meet the Press. Clinton was campaigning in Baltimore on Sunday, where she received the endorsement of U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings ahead of Marylands nominating contest on April 25, where another 95 delegates are at stake. The Wyoming results did not change the delegate math for the Democratic contenders. Each won seven, since delegates are awarded proportionally based on caucus-goers support. Going into Wyoming, Clinton had more than half of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination. Sanders trailed her by 250 pledged delegates, those awarded based on the results of the state nominating contests.  But Sanders said future contests in the West and on the East Coast looked favorable to him, including New York, Pennsylvania, California and Oregon. We believe that we have the momentum. We believe that the polling is showing that were closing the gap, Sanders said on Sunday on ABCs This Week. Sanders sidestepped questions on whether he was prepared to take the nomination to a floor fight if Clinton did not win the magic number of pledged delegates, but he left the possibility open. If neither candidate ends up, you know, having the kind of votes they need, yes, I think there will be some discussion, Sanders said on CNNs State of the Union. An inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Clintons use of a private email server in her Chappaqua, New York, home for her work as secretary of state continues to cast legal uncertainty over her campaign. On Sunday, her former boss, President Barack Obama, said he did not believe the arrangement harmed national security, despite more than 2,000 of her emails containing classified information, which the government bans from being handled outside secure, government-controlled channels. Theres classified and then theres classified, Obama said in an interview with Fox News. He also emphasized that the U.S. Justice Department would investigate impartially, without heed to politics.

Boston Globe denounces Trump candidacy in 'front page' satire ,"(Reuters) - Headlines screaming Deportations to begin and Markets sink as trade war looms top a parody newspaper front page the Boston Globe posted on Saturday, with a scathing editorial denouncing Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trumps candidacy. The mock-up, offering the Globes satirical view of America under a Trump presidency, was set to run as the front page of the newspapers Ideas section, followed on page 2 of that section by the anti-Trump editorial. The novel front-page spoof, says the editorial, is designed to take Trumps rhetoric and his policy positions to their logical conclusion.  It is an exercise in taking a man at his word, the editorial says.  And his vision of America promises to be as appalling in real life as it is in black and white on the page. There was no immediate comment from Trump or his campaign. The editorial brands the billionaire businessman as a demagogue whose own political vision is profoundly un-American.  It casts his closest rival for the 2016 Republican nomination, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, as equally extreme and urges Republicans, if possible at the partys nominating convention in July, to draft a plausible, honorable alternative, suggesting U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan or former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. The mock Trump page was conceived and executed by the Globes editorial writers, columnists and commentary editors, who make up the newspapers editorial board, said Ellen Clegg, the newspapers editorial page editor. Noting that she reports to John Henry, the Globes publisher, Clegg stressed to Reuters in a telephone interview that the front-page parody does not involve our newsroom. Clegg said she knew of no other such expression of political satire ever published by the Globe or any other major metropolitan daily in the United States during her 30 years at the newspaper. But it was reminiscent of the kind of parody regularly featured by the farcical online news outlet, The Onion. The mock front page envisions a host of political, financial and international scenarios ranging from disturbingly surreal to darkly humorous, all playing on Trumps real pronouncements about illegal immigration, Muslims, national security and the First Amendment. A color photograph of Trump making a speech is centered near the top of the page under a banner headline reading: Deportations to begin, with a subhead reporting that Trump was calling for a tripling of immigration enforcement personnel as riots continue. A top story on the page opens with the paragraph: Worldwide stocks plunged again Friday, completing the worst month on record as trade wars with both China and Mexico seem imminent. Other mock entries include a story about unrest in the ranks of the U.S. military as soldiers refuse orders to kill family members of Islamic State militants, and the headline: New libel law targets absolute scum in press. In a more tongue-in-cheek vein, a brief item reports Trump on the short list for the Nobel Peace Prize. His feat? Healing a 1,385-year-old schism between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, which has fueled bloody conflicts across the globe for centuries. Clegg said it was not the first time the Globe, which tends to lean Democratic on its opinion pages, has editorialized against Trump, but it marked its most resolute opposition to his candidacy.

Lawyers evasive about ex-U.S. House speaker's alleged sex abuse,"(Reuters) - Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hasterts lawyers declined on Saturday to directly address sexual abuse allegations from federal prosecutors, who asserted that he molested at least four boys decades ago when he served as a high school wrestling coach. Hastert, 74, faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced later this month for his guilty plea in October to a federal charge of illegally structuring large bank withdrawals in small increments to evade currency-reporting rules. As part of that plea, the former Republican speaker of the House of Representatives admitted paying $1.7 million in cash to someone he had known for decades as hush money and compensation for unspecified wrongdoing toward that individual. Until this week, neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors had stepped forward to publicly reveal the underlying misconduct at issue. That changed on Friday, when prosecutors alleged in a court filing that Hastert had sexually abused at least four boys on the wrestling team he coached during his time as a teacher at Yorkville High School in the 1960s and 70s. Providing details of the alleged abuse, some of them quite graphic,  the prosecutors said Hastert offered massages to students in a locker room, where he had set up an easy chair in view of the boys shower, and inappropriately touched some of the students. They also cited an alleged incident that occurred during a wrestling trip in a motel room. Although statutes of limitations bar sexual abuse charges against Hastert, with this case the government seeks to hold defendant accountable for the crimes he committed that can still be prosecuted, the court filing said. Asked by Reuters if Hastert or his lawyers would comment on the court filing, a pre-sentencing memorandum, Hastert attorney Thomas Green issued a statement that neither confirmed nor denied the allegations. Hastert acknowledges that as a young man he committed transgressions for which he is profoundly sorry, the statement said. He earnestly apologizes to his former students, family, friends, previous constituents and all others affected by the harm his actions have caused. The wording closely mirrored a similar expression of remorse contained in a pre-sentencing memo filed by the defense earlier this week. It differed, however, in expressly mentioning former students. The defense has asked the federal judge in the case to spare Hastert prison time, citing his deteriorating health, his remorse and years he dedicated to public service. Prosecutors have recommended a prison term of no more than six months.  Sentencing is scheduled for April 27. ",politicsNews,"April 9, 2016 ",1
