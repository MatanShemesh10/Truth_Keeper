Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House, a White House official said in a statement. The official did not elaborate, but the statement suggested that Gorka had been fired. Gorka had reportedly feuded with national security adviser General H.R. McMaster and was unhappy with the decision Trump announced this week - backed by McMaster and the U.S. military - to reorient U.S. policy in Afghanistan. Gorka, who frequently appeared on cable news shows to tout Trumps policies, was a divisive figure within the  administration, seen by veteran intelligence professionals and diplomats as an ideologue with little real-world experience. He is the latest in a string of hawkish or nationalist advisers to leave the National Security Council and other parts of the White House in recent weeks, suggesting that in the battle among Trumps foreign policy advisers, internationalist voices such as those of McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are prevailing. Earlier, the conservative Federalist news outlet, citing multiple sources familiar with the situation, said Gorka, a counterterrorism expert, had quit. In a letter of resignation, Gorka expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the Trump administration, the Federalist said. As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the Peoples House, Gorka was quoted as saying in the letter.  Trump fired Bannon a week ago in the latest White House shake-up, removing a far-right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti-globalization agenda. Regrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will Make America Great Again, have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week, he said in the letter. A U.S. citizen born in Britain with Hungarian parents, Gorka worked as national security editor at Bannons Breitbart news website, where he often warned of Islamic terrorism.

Trumps decision on whether to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy could be announced as early as next week, reported ABC News, citing multiple sources. Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed the program with senior White House officials on Thursday, according to an administration official. Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan denied reports that the department had made any recommendations on DACA to the White House. There have been continuing discussions about DACA but nothing has been determined, Lapan told Reuters. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday that the program continues to be under review. A White House spokesperson told Reuters that only Congress can legislate a permanent solution for the plight of children who are currently protected from deportation by DACA. Trump had pledged on the election campaign trail to scrap all of former President Barack Obamas executive orders on immigration, including DACA. Immigrant advocates reacted to the news with a flurry of statements, promising to defend the program with protest and legal action. Immigrant youth fought to create the DACA program and we will fight like hell to defend it, said Greisa Martinez Rosas, Advocacy Director and DACA-beneficiary of United We Dream said in a statement. Civil rights groups said ending the program could increase racial divisions in the country in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville. Ten Republican state attorneys general in June urged the Trump administration to rescind the DACA program, while noting that the government did not have to revoke permits that had already been issued. If the federal government did not withdraw DACA by Sept. 5, the attorneys general said they would file a legal challenge to the program in a Texas federal court. The 10 who signed the letter represent Alabama, Arkansas,  Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. A larger coalition of 26 Republican attorneys general had challenged the Obama-era policy covering illegal immigrant parents, known as DAPA, that had been blocked by the courts before it took effect.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CARACAS/WASHINGTON/ (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that prohibits dealings in new debt from the Venezuelan government or its state oil company on Friday in an effort to halt financing that the White House said fuels President Nicolas Maduros dictatorship. Maduro, who has frequently blamed the United States for waging an economic war on Venezuela, said the United States was seeking to force Venezuela to default  but he said it would not succeed. The order is Washingtons biggest sanctions blow to date against Maduro and is intended to punish his leftist government for what Trump has called an erosion of democracy in the oil-rich country, which is already reeling from an economic crisis. It suggests a weakening in already strained relations between the two countries. Just three days ago, Maduro said the relations between Caracas and Washington were at their lowest point ever. All theyre trying to do to attack Venezuela is crazy, said Maduro on a TV broadcast on Friday. With the efforts of our people, it will fail and Venezuela will be stronger, more free, and more independent. Venezuela faces a severe recession with millions suffering food and medicine shortages and soaring inflation. The South American nation relies on oil for some 95 percent of export revenue. Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL], the U.S. refiner of Venezuelas ailing state-run oil company PDVSA, is practically being forced to close by the order, warned Maduro, adding that a preliminary analysis showed the sanctions would impede Venezuelan crude exports to the United States. He said he was calling urgent meetings with U.S. clients of Venezuelan oil. The new sanctions ban trade in any new issues of U.S.-dollar-denominated debt of the Venezuelan government and PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] because the ban applies to use of the U.S. financial system.  As a result, it will be it tricky for PDVSA to refinance its heavy debt burden. Investors had expected that PDVSA would seek to ease upcoming payments through such an operation, as it did last year, which usually requires that new bonds be issued. Additional financial pressure on PDVSA could push the cash-strapped company closer to a possible default, or bolster its reliance on key allies China and Russia, which have already lent Caracas billions of dollars.  They want us to fall into default, said Maduro, adding that just under two-thirds of Venezuelan bond holders are in the United States. Maduro insisted that Venezuela would continue paying its debts. The decision also blocks Citgo Petroleum from sending dividends back to the South American nation, a senior official said, in a further blow to PDVSAs coffers. However, the order stops short of a major ban on crude trading that could have disrupted Venezuelas oil industry and worsened the countrys faltering economy. It also protects holders of most existing Venezuelan government and PDVSA bonds, who were relieved the sanctions did not go further. Venezuelan and PDVSA bonds were trading broadly higher on Friday afternoon. Maduro may no longer take advantage of the American financial system to facilitate the wholesale looting of the Venezuelan economy at the expense of the Venezuelan people, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday. Venezuelas Oil Ministry and PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  PDVSA, the financial engine of Maduros government, is already struggling due to low global oil prices, mismanagement, allegations of corruption and a brain drain. Washington last month sanctioned PDVSAs finance vice president, Simon Zerpa, complicating some of the companys operations as Americans are now banned from doing business with him. Trump has so far spared Venezuela from broader sanctions against its vital oil industry, but officials have said such actions are under consideration. The Republican president has also warned of a military option for Venezuela, although White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said on Friday that no such actions are anticipated in the near future. Venezuela has for months struggled to find financing because of PDVSAs cash flow problems and corruption scandals have led institutions to tread cautiously, regardless of sanctions. Russia and its state oil company Rosneft have emerged as an increasingly important source of financing for PDVSA, according to a Reuters report.   On at least two occasions, the Venezuelan government has used Russian cash to avoid imminent defaults on payments to bondholders, a high-level PDVSA official told Reuters. At this point our view is that the country can scrape by without defaulting this year, largely with the help of Chinese and Russian backing and by further squeezing imports. Next year is a tossup, said Raul Gallegos, an analyst with the consultancy Control Risks. However, China has grown reticent to extend further loans because of payment delays and corruption. Russia has been negotiating financing in exchange for oil assets in Venezuela, sources have told Reuters, but going forward it would be difficult for the OPEC member to provide enough assets to keep up loans destined for bond payments. Venezuelas government has around $2 billion in available cash to make $1.3 billion in bond payments by the end of the year and to cover the import of food and medicine, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress wield little clout nowadays, but they will likely have plenty of influence on the looming issue of the U.S. debt ceiling and party leaders are considering whether they should try to convert that advantage into bargaining power on tax reform. Even though they control the White House and both chambers of Congress, Republicans are again divided among themselves as pressing fiscal issues rattle financial markets and test President Donald Trumps ability to keep the countrys accounts in order. The debt ceiling is a legal cap on how much money the federal government can borrow to fund its budget deficits and meet debt obligations. Failure to meet payments could lead to a default and a downgrade in Americas credit rating, with the potential to trigger global financial shockwaves. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was 100 percent confident that the debt ceiling would be raised in September. There is no scenario where the government wont be paying its bills, Mnuchin said. Action is needed to raise the debt ceiling by Sept. 29, the administration has warned, although some fiscal experts say the deadline may actually be mid-October. The Trump administration wants Congress to pass a clean increase, without extraneous political measures attached. But, reflecting long divisions in the party over fiscal policy, many conservative Republicans have said they will not  vote for a debt-limit bill that does not also contain promises of federal spending cuts. So, analysts say, Trump and Republican leaders will need the votes of Democrats, who generally favor a clean bill, to raise the debt limit and avoid a default. Armed with this edge, Democrats are considering using the debt debate to press Republicans for bipartisan tax reform, said Democratic Senate aides, which would inject new uncertainty into the debt limit issue. Overhauling the tax code is a top priority for Trump and his fellow Republicans, but they have made little progress since the president took office in January. Their behind-closed-doors planning process so far on tax reform has ignored the Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi are skeptical about supporting a debt ceiling increase while Republicans pursue tax cuts that Democrats say would cause the federal deficit to balloon. Were telling Republicans that if it is their intention to use that debt limit increase to allow for tax cuts for the wealthy, that they are going to have a harder time getting Democratic votes, said a Senate Democratic aide. Senate Democrats offered earlier this month to move forward with bipartisan legislation on taxes, on condition that changes do not add to the deficit or benefit the wealthy. For now, Senate and House Democrats are watching  Republicans and the Trump administration wrangle over the debt ceiling, with no clear plan yet in sight. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have not said if they want a clean bill. Ryan said on Thursday that Congress will pass legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling, noting that lawmakers have several options. McConnell has said the debt ceiling will be raised, a spokesman said on Thursday. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in an email: Leader Pelosi has expressed support for a clean debt ceiling hike, but has also echoed the concerns that many House Democrats have about supporting such a move while Republicans simultaneously blow a multi-trillion dollar hole in the deficit with tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. Given the stakes, Schumer and Pelosi would face a daunting task in holding their parties lawmakers together if they want to squeeze concessions out of Republicans with the country on the brink of a potential default. Some Democrats are skeptical such a strategy could work. We ought to get the debt ceiling done. Its a bad precedent to try to use the debt ceiling for leverage for other political objectives, said Representative John Yarmuth, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell expressed concern on Friday about the possibility of the debt ceiling not being raised.  If the debt ceiling were not to be raised, the United States would not be able to pay all of its bills. Thats never happened before; it would be unprecedented and that could be a major shock to the economy, Powell said in an interview with CNBC during a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Democrats have been talking about using the debt ceiling as a lever against Republican tax reform since June and laid out their conditions for working together on tax legislation in an Aug. 1 letter to Trump and Republican leaders. McConnell flatly rejected the idea of broad bipartisanship. But it could be the only way forward on taxes if Republicans cannot agree on a budget resolution for fiscal 2018. That is needed to unlock a legislative provision that would allow them to pass a tax bill in the Senate, where Republicans have only a slim majority, without Democratic support.

U.S. District Judge William Walls on Tuesday had rejected Menendezs request, saying the Democrat was free to absent himself from testimony but did not deserve special treatment, being no worse and no better than any other defendant. In a filing on Thursday, Menendez said his constitutional obligations to his constituents justified altering the trial schedule so he could vote on raising the debt ceiling to avoid a government shutdown, rewriting the tax code and renewing the soon-to-expire National Flood Insurance Program. Republicans have a narrow Senate majority, and Menendez said Julys failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act showed his absence from any vote could be potentially determinative. The trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 6. Prosecutors on Friday said the scheduling conflicts resulted from Menendezs lengthy, failed pursuit of a meritless argument that the Constitution immunized him from prosecution. No defendant should receive special treatment based on power or privilege, prosecutors said. This court should reject defendant Menendezs effort to let politics in Washington dictate the trial schedule in Newark. Menendez later countered that U.S. Supreme Court precedents and common sense justified an accommodation. It is unclear when the judge will rule on Menendezs request. The senator was charged with accepting campaign donations and gifts, including a stay at a Caribbean villa and private jet flights, from co-defendant Salomon Melgen in exchange for lobbying on the Florida eye doctors behalf. Both men have pleaded not guilty to fraud and bribery. Jury selection was completed on Wednesday.

The memo, released by the White House, laid out in more detail a ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. armed forces that Trump announced via Twitter last month, reversing a policy shift started under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. In it, Trump directed the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to stop using government funds for sex-reassignment procedures unless it is necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex, the memo said. The order requires Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis to determine in the coming months how to handle transgender individuals currently serving in the military using criteria including military effectiveness and lethality, budget constraints and law. A White House official who briefed reporters about the memo declined to specify whether transgender service men and women who are currently active in the military could continue to serve based on such criteria. The official said Trump decided the Obama administration had not identified a sufficient basis for changing what was then long-standing policy on transgender troops. The memo called on Mattis to submit a plan to Trump by February 21, 2018, on how to implement the changes. Trumps decision appealed to some in his conservative political base while creating uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the Pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly. The change drew swift criticism from advocates of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. The Presidents order to remove transgender service members from the United States armed forces and deny them healthcare is nothing less than a purge, Matt Thorn, executive director of OutServe-SLDN, a group dedicated to LGBT equality in the military, said in a statement. Our military is strongest when all people who are fit to serve have the opportunity to do so. This unprecedented policy amounts to a purge of qualified, contributing troops, and will serve only to undermine unit cohesion and weaken military readiness, said Jennifer Levi, an official at the gay rights group GLAD (GLBTQ Legal Advocates& Defenders) in a statement. Asked how the policy squared with Trumps pledge to stand up for gay rights, the White House official said the president would ensure that such rights were protected but had been critical previously of the transgender changes under the Obama administration.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Financial markets are fretting about the fiscal situation in Washington, with deadlines looming in late September and early October on the U.S. budget and the federal debt ceiling. Republican President Donald Trump stoked anxieties by threatening on Aug. 22 to shut down the government if Congress does not fund his U.S.-Mexico border wall. Here is what you need to know about the budget and the debt ceiling, separate issues but ones that are politically connected: Congress is supposed to pass annual spending bills around the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30 to fund most of the U.S. government, but disagreements often prevent this. When that happens, lawmakers usually pass a temporary bill extending current spending levels with no changes for days, weeks or months, while they work on a long-term agreement. When even a short-term budget patch cannot be agreed in Congress, or if the president decides to veto either a long-term or short-term budget measure, the government shuts down.  This year, when Congress returns on Sept. 5 from its long summer recess, lawmakers will have only about 12 working days to pass a budget measure, probably a short-term patch, known as a continuing resolution, to keep the government open. If a budget measure is not passed before Oct. 1, or if Trump vetoes a budget deal over his Mexican border wall demand, portions of the government will begin to shut down and non-essential employees will go without pay until an agreement is reached. The last time the government shut down, in October 2013 for about two weeks, was because of a dispute over funding for former Democratic President Barack Obamas healthcare law. There were three shutdowns in the 1990s, the longest lasting 21 days. In the 1970s and 1980s there were 14 shutdowns, most brief and some only partial. Shutdowns hurt federal workers, rattle financial markets and shake confidence in the U.S. government abroad, but to date they have done little lasting economic damage, according to analysts. The debt ceiling is a legal cap on how much money the U.S. government can borrow through bonds and other debt issued by the U.S. Treasury. It now stands at about $19.8 trillion, very close to the actual national debt.  Since March, the Treasury has been using financial extraordinary measures to stave off hitting the ceiling. Once the ceiling is hit, Congress must raise it. If it does not, the government cannot keep borrowing. This matters because the government spends more than it collects in taxes. That accounts for the federal budget deficit. So Washington continually borrows money to cover its bills. The Treasury has said that Congress must increase the debt ceiling by Sept. 29. However, default likely could be staved off a few more weeks by extraordinary measures, analysts said.  In any case, legislation to raise the debt limit will need to be adopted, at the very latest, by mid-October, they said. If the debt ceiling is not raised and the government can no longer pay its bills, default results, along with a likely downgrade in the U.S. credit rating. Political gridlock has never led to the United States reaching its debt ceiling and its bills going unpaid, but there have been some close calls. A standoff in August 2011 cost the country its top-notch bond rating from the credit ratings agency Standard & Poors and caused the most jarring two weeks in financial markets since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The two move on separate tracks, but are likely to get tangled, with Republican opponents of increasing the debt ceiling probably demanding federal spending cuts. Some analysts said Congress may try to tackle both issues at the same time, perhaps in a single piece of legislation. Both the spending and debt ceiling bills can pass the Republican-led House of Representatives by a simple majority vote. But in the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats, 60 votes are needed to pass, meaning the bills will need some Democratic support.  Trump made his U.S.-Mexico border wall a central promise of his 2016 presidential campaign. He also promised that Mexico would pay for it, but Mexico has steadfastly refused to do so and Trump has largely stopped talking about that pledge. Conservative House Republicans agree with the president on the need for a wall and say border-wall funding should be a priority in any spending legislation. Some have already indicated they are willing to shut down the government to get it. Moderate Republicans have called a shutdown unwise, and Republican leaders are determined to prevent one, fearing it would worsen doubts about the partys ability to govern. Democrats are uniformly opposed to Trumps wall and say any blame for a shutdown would rest solely with Republicans. The Trump administration reversed course earlier this month and said it would back a clean raising of the debt ceiling, meaning it would not be tied to other policy measures. Democrats and moderate Republicans also support a clean debt-ceiling increase. But conservative Republicans, especially in the House, often use debt-ceiling legislation to insist on changes to spending, making them opposed to a clean bill.

The lack of information-sharing on the election breaches reflects the difficulty state and federal officials have had in working together to protect U.S. voting from cyber threats. All U.S. elections are run by state and local governments, which have varying degrees of technical competence. DHS told Congress in June that 21 states were targeted during the 2016 presidential race, and that while a small number were breached, there was no evidence any votes were manipulated.  Other reports have said 39 states were targeted. Choate said he had heard both numbers mentioned. Several lawmakers, including Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration at DHS refusal to identify which states had been targeted. Arizona and Illinois confirmed last year that hackers had targeted their voter registration systems. In a statement, the DHS did not refute that states had not been notified if they were targeted, adding the agency informed the owners or operators of systems potentially victimized who may not necessarily be state election officials.  DHS was working with senior state election officials to determine how best to share this information while protecting the integrity of investigations and the confidentiality of system owners, the agency said. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin orchestrated an operation that included hacking and online propaganda intended to tilt the November election in Trumps favor. Several congressional committees are investigating and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter, including whether Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign. Russia has denied election meddling and Trump has denied any collusion. The four-day conference of election directors was originally supposed to be about issues like voter registration, but took a sharp turn following the election hacking. After the 2000 election, we all had to be lawyers, Choate said. And now after the 2016 election, we all have to be cyber security experts. DHS representatives at the event fended off questions about whether the federal government would be prepared to mobilize sufficient support for the states in the event of a catastrophic cyber attack near or during the 2018 elections.  We want to make sure we learn from the missteps that may have happened in 2016 and we want to make sure we continue building on the things we did that were right, Robert Gatlin, a DHS cyber official, said during a panel discussion. Gatlin said the agency was working with U.S. intelligence agencies to downgrade more classified information so it could be shared with the states. Information about cyber attacks is typically guarded by a high classification because it may involve nation-state involvement or contain sensitive sources and methods, he said. Legislation recently approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee would require the director of national intelligence to sponsor top-secret security clearance for eligible election officials in each state, something the National Association of Secretaries of State has advocated. The bill would also require DHS to submit a report to Congress detailing cyber attacks and attempted cyber attacks by foreign governments on U.S. election infrastructure during the 2016 election. Choate said communication about cyber threats had improved with federal agencies since the election and the decision by the outgoing Obama administration in January to elevate voting systems to a critical infrastructure designation.  Prior to the election, some state officials worried that closer oversight of election systems represented a dangerous federal intrusion into local affairs.

Citing an unidentified source, CNN said the discussions were not at an organizational level for a bid, which would challenge Republican President Donald Trumps expected re-election campaign and complicate Democratic efforts to regain the White House. What they are trying to show the country is that honorable people can disagree, but you can still problem solve together, it quoted the source as saying. Kasich, who was among more than a dozen Republican candidates to be defeated by Trump in last years presidential primary campaign, would top the ticket, according to CNN and Axios online news outlet. Kasich adviser John Weaver told Reuters the two governors have an outstanding working relationship and had done a great job showing how two people from different parties can work together. That model can work on other issues, said Weaver, who did not say the reports were inaccurate. Trump, a real estate developer and former reality television star who has an approval rating below 40 percent after seven months in office, has held a series of re-election campaign events. Earlier this month Vice President Mike Pence denied a New York Times report that he is preparing for a 2020 presidential run, saying the suggestion was disgraceful and offensive. A spokeswoman for Hickenlooper did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hickenlooper and Kasich are working on a proposal to stabilize the health insurance markets, and Axios said they plan to extend their joint platform to include immigration and job creation. Kasich, whose state opted to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, has criticized some of the so-far unsuccessful Republican efforts to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act,  passed under Democratic President Barack Obama. He said in an interview with National Public Radio aired this week that the possibility of national single-payer health coverage is not part of his discussions with Hickenlooper.

Cohn spoke publicly about the controversy for the first time in an interview with the Financial Times newspaper, saying the administration needed to clearly reject hate groups. He said  there was no equivalence between white supremacists or neo-Nazis and those who protest inequality. I believe this administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities, the former Goldman Sachs president told the newspaper. Citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK, he added. Cohns criticism came nearly two weeks after white supremacist and neo-Nazi activists clashed with anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, over a plan to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, a Confederate general in the U.S. Civil War. A man thought to have neo-Nazi sympathies drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one woman and injuring more than a dozen others. Following the clashes, Trump said there had been violence on both sides, remarks that spurred condemnation by both Republican and Democratic politicians.  Cohn stood nearby during an impromptu Trump Tower news conference as the president insisted there were very fine people on both sides in Charlottesville. Cohn considered resigning over Trumps response, both newspapers reported, citing sources.  Cohn went so far as to draft a resignation letter, the New York Times reported, citing two people familiar with the document. Cohn said he felt compelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks and came under intense pressure to quit over Trumps reaction to the incident but decided against it. As a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting Jews will not replace us to cause this Jew to leave his job, he said, referring to chants by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will begin a major push next week to convince the public of the need for tax reform, shifting his focus to fiscal policy in an effort to win a big legislative victory by the end of the year, The Financial Times reported on Friday. Trump would begin the effort next Wednesday with a speech in Missouri, the first in a series of addresses to generate public support on the issue, Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, told the newspaper.  We are completely engaged in tax reform, Cohn told the FT in an interview. Starting next week the presidents agenda and calendar is going to revolve around tax reform. He will start being on the road making major addresses justifying the reasoning for tax reform. Although Cohn stressed that tax reform would be front and center of Trumps agenda, the Republican-controlled Congress faces two other pressing issues when it returns from its August recess on Sept. 5.  Lawmakers need to approve an increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to allow the federal government to keep borrowing money and paying its bills, including its debt obliterations. Separately they need to pass at least stop-gap spending measures to keep the government operating. Deadlines on both issues will loom within weeks after lawmakers return from their break. Asked by the FT whether the debate over the debt ceiling could derail the tax reform drive, Cohn said that at the end of the day, Congress has to increase the debt ceiling - that is just the reality. He added that this would be in September, before tax reform legislation. The key point is this: tax reform is the White Houses number one focus right now, he added. Cohn said White House officials had been working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and other leading congressional Republicans on an outline and skeleton for the tax reform proposal, and we have a good skeleton that we have agreed to. The details Cohn discussed were similar to those mentioned by Ryan at a meeting with Boeing employees on Thursday. Asked whether the focus on tax reform had been complicated by Twitter attacks by the Republican president on McConnell and Ryan, Cohn said the White House officials worked well with the two and we have made a massive amount of progress on taxes. Cohn said the House Ways and Means Committee would put more flesh and bone on the tax reform plan when lawmakers return from the recess. He said he believed a bill could pass tax committees in both chambers and be passed by both the House and Senate by the end of 2017. In the case of individual taxpayers, Cohn said the presidents reform plan would protect the three big deductions that people can claim on taxes: for home mortgages, charitable giving and retirement savings. Beyond that, it would increase the caps for the standard deduction while eliminating most other personal deductions, Cohn said. The plan also aims to get rid of taxes on estates left when people die. Cohn said for businesses, the administration is proposing to lower corporate tax rates, while eliminating many of the deductions that businesses use to reduce the amount of tax they must pay. Asked whether the corporate tax rate could be cut to 15 percent as previously suggested by Trump, Cohn said, I would like to get the tax rate as low as possible so that businesses want to create jobs here. He said the administration would propose going to a system where American companies would not have to pay additional tax when they bring profits earned overseas back to the United States. Today, they often have to pay extra taxes for bringing profits back to the U.S., Cohn said. Our current system basically creates a penalty for headquartering in the U.S. He said the administration did envision a one-time low tax rate on all overseas profits.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Affordable housing advocates are closely watching a package of bills currently under consideration by California lawmakers that would invest billions of dollars in helping to alleviate the states severe housing crisis. For years, California residents have struggled to afford surging real estate and rental prices in many of the countrys most expensive housing markets. Nearly one-third of California renters pay more than 50 percent of their income toward rent. If passed, the bills would create a permanent $300 million-a-year fund for affordable housing, streamline the approval process for housing construction in cities and authorize a $3 billion bond for the 2018 ballot, the first housing bond in California for over a decade. The states Senate has approved the package, but the Assembly, which is expected to vote next week, has shown more reticence over costs. Lawmakers worked closely with Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who in July announced his support for a general obligation bond, a permanent funding source for affordable housing and regulatory reform.  This comprehensive approach does whats long been needed in California, Brown said in July. Astronomical housing costs are straining family budgets and stressing employees who cant afford to live where they work. Thats unacceptable. On Thursday, California Treasurer John Chiang urged state lawmakers to quickly pass the package as well as to increase the general obligation bond to between $6 billion and $9 billion to kick-start construction. We have the opportunity now to move decisively toease a 1.5 million-unit shortfall in affordablehousing. Butwe must think big and act boldly, Chiang in a statement. Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Len and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon have also expressed support for a housing deal. Homeownership rates in California are at their lowest since the 1940s and the lack of supply is seen as a major contributor to the problem. Production of new homes across the state averaged less than 80,000 annually over the last decade, far below the projected need of 180,000 additional homes annually, according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump picked a new fight on Thursday with his fellow Republicans, saying congressional leaders could have avoided a mess over raising the U.S. debt ceiling if they had taken his advice. In the latest in a stream of criticisms that could undermine his aims to cut taxes, pass a budget and rebuild infrastructure, Trump sought to blame party leaders if Congress fails to agree to raise the cap on how much the federal government may borrow. The Treasury Department has said the ceiling must be raised by Sept. 29. If not, the government would be unable to borrow more money or pay its bills, including its debt payments. That could hurt the United States credit rating, cause financial turmoil, harm the U.S. economy and possibly trigger a recession. Trump said he had advised Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan to link passage of legislation raising the debt ceiling to a bill on veterans affairs that he signed into law on Aug. 12.  They ... didnt do it so now we have a big deal with Dems holding them up (as usual) on Debt Ceiling approval. Could have been so easy-now a mess! Trump said in Twitter posts. Recent media reports suggest that Trumps relationship with McConnell has deteriorated amid repeated attacks by Trump on the Republican Senate majority leader for, among other things, failing to get a healthcare bill passed. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that McConnell and Trump were locked in a political cold war, especially after an Aug. 9 phone call that it said devolved into a shouting match. On the 9th and the 10th Trump assailed McConnell via Twitter, angered by a speech in which McConnell said Trump had excessive expectations of Congress. Trumps salvo ran counter to efforts this week by the White House and McConnells office to play down reports of discord. A spokesman for McConnell noted the Senate majority leader had said earlier this week, in an appearance with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that the debt ceiling would be raised.  McConnell was unequivocal about it, said spokesman Don Stewart. He said McConnell mentioned it again on Wednesday in a statement the Senate leader issued about his shared goals with Trump. Ryan, speaking at a town hall meeting on tax reform at a Boeing plant in Washington state, also said Congress would pass legislation to raise the ceiling in time to ensure debt payment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denied there was any need to repair ties between Trump and top Republican lawmakers. I think the relationships are fine, she told reporters. Certainly there are going to be some policy differences, but there are also a lot of shared goals and thats what were focused on. Raising the debt ceiling is one of the must-pass measures Congress will take up when it returns on Sept. 5. Congress will have about 12 working days from its return to approve spending measures to keep the government open. While the budget and debt cap are separate, they are likely to become entangled, with Republican opponents of a debt ceiling increase expected to demand federal spending cuts. Trump threatened on Tuesday to shut down the government if Congress failed to secure funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. His threat added a new wrinkle to the Republicans months-long struggle to reach a budget deal, rattling markets and drawing rebukes from some Republicans. Democrats, solidly opposed to funding the wall, have slammed Trump over his comments. Both the spending and debt ceiling bills could pass the Republican-led House by a simple majority vote, but will need 60 votes to pass the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats, meaning they will need some Democratic support. A respected think tank said in a report on Thursday the  government might not have enough money to pay all its bills on Oct. 2 if Washington does not raise the debt cap. The Treasury  might not have enough money on that day to make a roughly $80 billion payment that will be due to a military retirement fund, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Moodys Investors Service said it would consider stripping the United States of its top-notch rating in the event of a default but not over late or skipped payments on non-debt obligations if the government ran short of funds. The warning about a possible U.S. downgrade seemed less dire and narrower in scope than one issued on Wednesday by Fitch Ratings. Trump has often expressed frustration that Congress has not passed significant legislation since he took office in January, particularly its failure to pass a bill to replace Democratic former President Barack Obamas healthcare law - something that Trump had promised to accomplish. The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed! That should NEVER have happened! Trump said in a tweet on Thursday, echoing criticisms he made earlier this month. McConnell offered muted criticism of Trump on Thursday, saying he was a little concerned about some of the trade rhetoric by the president, who has repeatedly condemned trade deals he believes are bad for the United States, and by others. Trade is a winner for America, McConnell told Kentucky farmers and lawmakers. The assumption that every free-trade agreement is a loser for America is largely untrue.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Thursday he has sent recommendations from his review of more than two dozen national monuments to President Donald Trump, indicating that some could be scaled back to allow for more hunting and fishing and economic development. The recommendations follow a 120-day study of 27 national monuments across the country, created by presidents since 1996, that Trump ordered in April as part of his broader effort to increase development on federal lands. The review has cheered energy, mining, ranching and timber advocates but has drawn widespread criticism and threats of lawsuits from conservation groups and the outdoor recreation industry. There were fears that Zinke would recommend the outright elimination of some of the monuments on the list, but on Thursday, speaking to the Associated Press in Billings, Montana, he said he will not recommend eliminating any. Zinke said in a statement that the recommendations would provide a much needed change for the local communities who border and rely on these lands for hunting and fishing, economic development, traditional uses, and recreation. He did not specify which monuments he plans to recommend be scaled back. The Associated Press reported that Zinke said he would recommend changing the boundaries for a handful of sites. Zinke has already announced a recommendation to shrink the size of one site under review, the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument in Utah created by former President Barack Obama late last year. In the last few weeks, Zinke has said that six monuments, including the Upper Missouri River Breaks in his home state of Montana, would be left intact. The report is a draft, so we are continuing to work with Interior on getting the best information on which to base recommendations for Trump, a White House official said. Once we have a final report, in the coming weeks, we will make it public.  Timing for the public release of the recommendations has not been set. Trump has argued that previous administrations abused their right to create monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906 by putting huge areas, mainly in Western states, off limits to drilling, mining, logging, ranching and other activities without adequate input from locals.  The law enables a president to declare certain areas of historic or scientific interest a national monument if confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.  (Graphic on review of monuments:  tmsnrt.rs/2itKQFD) A designation as a national monument is permanent, and prohibits mining and sets stringent protections for ecosystems on the site. The designation offers more permanent protection than other federal designations like national wilderness or conservation areas. No president has ever revoked a previous designation but a few have reduced the size of some monuments. Conservation groups and the growing outdoor retail industry launched public campaigns over the last few weeks to urge Zinke to leave the monuments intact, and they vowed to challenge him in court.  Any recommendation from Secretary Zinke to shrink national monuments is hypocritical at best and ruinous at worst, said Michael Brune, director of the Sierra Club. One Republican congressman from Utah, Rob Bishop, chairman of the House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, said he had not yet seen the full report but was briefed on some aspects of it by Zinke. He said his committee would eventually take up legislation to carry out some of Zinkes recommendations and may attempt to reform the Antiquities Act. If we dont do reform of the Antiquities Act, we will have failures in the future, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi received a phone call tonight from U.S. President Donald Trump who affirmed the strength of the friendship between Egypt and the United States and expressed his keenness on continuing to develop the relationship and overcome any obstacles that might affect it, Sisis office said in a statement late on Thursday. On Tuesday, two U.S. sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Washington had decided to deny Egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay a further $195 million because it had failed to make progress on respecting human rights and democracy. Egypt, an important regional partner for the United States because of its control of the Suez Canal and its border with Israel, receives $1.3 billion in aid annually and was critical of the U.S. decision. Its foreign ministry said on Wednesday that the decision to withhold aid reflected poor judgment and that it could have negative implications on achieving common goals and interests between the two countries. The decision reflects a U.S. desire to continue security cooperation as well as its frustration with Cairos stance on civil liberties. In particular, a new law regulating non-governmental organizations is widely seen as part a growing crackdown on dissent, said the U.S. sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Egyptian rights activists have said they face the worst crackdown in their history under Sisi, accusing him of erasing freedoms won in the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that ended Hosni Mubaraks 30-year rule. Egyptian lawmakers have said the NGO law was needed for national security. The Egyptian government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos, and several are facing investigation regarding their funding.

The three-judge panel sitting in Baltimore, divided 2-1, also put any further action in the case on hold pending the U.S. Supreme Courts upcoming decision in a similar case from Wisconsin that could set a new test for how courts nationwide handle such claims. At the heart of the Maryland case was the decision to redraw the states sixth congressional district, previously held by a Republican and now held by a Democrat. The challengers say the move was a partisan gerrymander in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it intentionally diluted the Republican vote. Gerrymandering is the manipulation of electoral boundaries to gain a political advantage.  After the new map was introduced, Republican Representative Roscoe Bartlett lost in the 2012 election to Democrat John Delaney. Democrats now hold seven of the states eight congressional seats. The states governor, Larry Hogan, is a Republican. The widespread nature of gerrymandering in modern politics is matched by the almost universal absence of those who will defend its negative effect on our democracy, Judge Paul Niemeyer, a Republican appointee, wrote in his dissenting opinion. Indeed, both Democrats and Republicans have decried it when wielded by their opponents but nonetheless continue to gerrymander in their own self interest when given the opportunity, he added. The other two judges are Democratic appointees. On Oct. 2, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over Republican line-drawing in Wisconsin, which Democrats say diluted their votes. The case gives the court an opportunity to issue a ruling saying whether or not challenges to gerrymandering can be brought over maps drawn solely on partisan grounds. The court has previously thrown out maps when there is evidence the state had sought to dilute the vote of a racial minority. The high courts decision could dictate whether the Maryland case can move forward. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A U.S. Energy Department report calls for incentives to boost coal-fired and nuclear power plants following a slew of closures that it said undermined reliable sources of electricity.  The findings of the study, released late on Wednesday, drew praise from the coal and nuclear industries and a mixed reaction from renewable energy groups - some of which said the reports recommendations could help them too.  President Donald Trump has promised to revive the ailing coal mining sector but has also said he welcomes all forms of energy development to shore up domestic production. Energy Secretary Rick Perry commissioned the grid study in April to evaluate whether regulatory burdens imposed by past administrations, including that of former President Barack Obama, had hurt the grid by forcing shutdowns of baseload plants, which provide nonstop power, like those fired by coal and nuclear fuel. Obama introduced regulations intended to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, which are blamed for climate change. This accelerated the retirement of coal-fired power plants and bolstered the nascent solar and wind sectors, which depend heavily on weather conditions for their power output.     It is apparent that in todays competitive markets certain regulations and subsidies are having a large impact on the functioning of markets, and thereby challenging our power generation mix, Perry said in a letter introducing the study. It is important for policy makers to consider their intended and unintended effects. The study, conducted by thedepartmentsstaff,said cheapnatural gas was the main driver of the closure of baseload coal and nuclear plants, a trend thatwas putting areas of the country at greater risk of power outages.  The department recommended giving baseload plants pricing advantages for their power, as well as making it easier and cheaper to get permits to build more such projects. The report differed from an earlier draft, which had said big increases in renewable power generation remained possible without undermining grid reliability, and which did not propose added support for baseload producers.  The administration had not yet reviewed the earlier draft, which was written by department staff.  Some coal and nuclear energy groups welcomed the final reports findings. This is a much-needed, pragmatic look at U.S. electricity reliability and resilience, including the priority of maintaining critical clean baseload power as electricity markets change, said Rich Powell, director of ClearPath, which advocates for nuclear and hydropower. Renewable fuels supporters had a wide range of reactions. The Center for Biological Diversity called the reports recommendations dangerously misguided, and the Sierra Club also bashed the study. But Americas biggest solar and wind power associations said they felt the study contained elements that were positive such as not singling out renewable energy as a big problem. The report did not... lay the demise of coal at the feet of renewable energy, and that is an important finding, Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, wrote in an email to the trade groups members on Thursday. SEIA and other groups, including the American Wind Energy Association, said wind and solar could benefit from some of the reports recommendations, such as a call for infrastructure development and market reforms. AWEA said in a blog post that technological advances could allow wind energy to provide reliability services, such as fast ramping to regulate the grids frequency signal.

Well do this before the debt ceiling, Ryan said during a tax reform event at a Boeing plant in Washington state. There are many different options in front of us on how we achieve that, he added. We pay our debts in this country. We will continue to do so. Later, in an interview with CNBC, Ryan said he had considered the option of attaching legislation raising the debt ceiling to a measure Congress passed recently extending money to veterans programs. The comments came after President Donald Trump said on Twitter that Congress could have avoided a mess if Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had taken his advice to link the debt ceiling and veterans funding measure. Thats an option we were looking at but the VA deadline came up and we werent able to do that then, Ryan told CNBC. Congress passed the veterans measure in early August and Trump signed it August 12. Im really not that worried about this, we have plenty of options ahead of us to raise the debt ceiling, Ryan said, adding that he did not interpret Trumps tweets as going after me. The speaker sidestepped a question as to whether the options included a clean hike of the debt ceiling, saying he did not want to negotiate to the media. House conservative Republicans have been pushing for a variety of add-ons to a debt limit bill, such as deep spending cuts or the sale of government assets. The government bumped up against its statutory limit on borrowing at just under $20 trillion in March. Since then, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has had to take extraordinary measures to stave off a default until Congress agrees to raise the Treasurys borrowing capability.    The Trump administration had been hoping Congress would pass a debt limit bill before embarking on a long summer recess. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

There are other things you can do that can have time dates on it, to make sure that the numbers work.

Ryan also said Republicans intend to keep a popular homeowner deduction for mortgage interest payments that some have talked about capping to help pay for tax cuts. But he indicated the deduction could change. We recognize, acknowledge and believe you need to maintain the mortgage interest deduction. Whether it can be improved and how it works, thats a discussion well have on an ongoing basis, Ryan said. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have vowed to slash business tax rates and overhaul the U.S. tax code before year end, with a Republican-only strategy that requires a special parliamentary procedure to get legislation through the Senate on a simple majority. Republicans control the Senate by only a 52-48 margin. But they have struggled to find ways to pay for lower rates without violating Senate rules by expanding the federal deficit outside a 10-year budget window. Lobbyists say closed-door discussions between Congress and the Trump administration have considered an approach that would make tax cuts sunset after a decade, avoiding a Senate rule violation. But without permanent tax rates, Ryan said that businesses would be less likely to make the multi-year, multibillion-dollar investments necessary for driving economic growth, which Republicans say is their ultimate goal.

But there was little to suggest any breakthrough or significant progress toward ending a decades-old conflict is imminent as Kushner met separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Palestinians were still seeking a pledge of support from the Trump administration for the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - the foundation of U.S. Middle East policy for the past two decades. The last round of peace talks between the two sides collapsed in 2014. For his part, Netanyahu faces pressure from right-wing coalition partners not to give ground on Jewish settlement building in occupied territory that Palestinians seek for a independent state. The settlement issue contributed to the breakdown of negotiations three years ago. We have things to talk about - how to advance peace, stability and security in our region, prosperity too. And I think that all of them are within our reach, Netanyahu, welcoming Kushner to his Tel Aviv office, said in a video clip released by the U.S. Embassy. Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation,  arrived in Israel with U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt on Wednesday after meeting Arab leaders in the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan.     The president is very committed to achieving a solution here that will be able to bring prosperity and peace to all people in this area, Kushner, who was tasked by Trump to help broker a peace deal, said in his response to Netanyahu. Meeting Abbas later in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Kushner said Trump sought peaceful relations between the countries in the whole region and was very optimistic and hopeful for a better future for all Palestinian people and Israeli people, according to a statement from Abbass office.   Trump has described peace between Israelis and Palestinians as the ultimate deal - and added a new wrinkle last February by saying he was not fixed on two states co-existing side by side as a solution to their dispute. Kushner last traveled to Israel and the Palestnian territories in June. A month later, he was involved in telephone diplomacy to stem Palestinian and Jordanian unrest over Israels handling of a contested Jerusalem holy site. Four Palestinians, three Israelis and two Jordanians were killed during the crisis.  Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said Kushners visit could prove significant, particularly because of the envoys consultations with regional allies this week: This may create a new chance to reach a settlement based on the two-state solution and the Arab initiative and stop the current deterioration of the peace process. Abu Rdainah was referring to a 2002 Arab League initiative that offers Israel diplomatic recognition from Arab countries in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and a full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in a 1967 war. Netanyahu has expressed tentative support for parts of the blueprint, but there are many caveats on the Israeli side, including how to resolve the complex Palestinian refugee issue. The statement from Abbass office quoted the Palestinian president as telling Kushner: We know things are difficult and complicated but nothing is impossible when efforts are sincere.

The Treasury might not have enough money on that day to make a roughly $80 billion payment that will be due to a military retirement fund, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Coming up short on cash on Oct. 2 could also lead the government to delay payments due that day on social security benefits and military pay, the BPC said. The report highlights the urgency facing the Trump administration to work with Congress to raise the federal governments $19.8 trillion cap on borrowing. Missing payments could trigger financial turmoil and hit the U.S. economy, possibly triggering a recession. A credit agency has warned that Americas credit rating is at risk. October 2 is a particularly difficult day for federal finances, said the Bipartisan Policy Center, which is considered an expert in projecting fiscal deadlines. Losing the ability to borrow any more on Oct. 2 would mean approximately 23 percent of funds owed by the government that month would go unpaid, dealing an immediate blow to the U.S. economy, the BPC said. Washington has been scraping against its debt ceiling since March, putting off payments into a few government funds so it can keep borrowing from investors and making debt payments.  The BPC noted there was substantial uncertainty in knowing just when Washington could stop being able to pay all its bills. It projects that date could fall between Oct. 2 and the middle of the month. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told lawmakers in July they needed to raise the debt limit by Sept 29. President Donald Trump on Thursday described efforts to raise the limit as a mess. Republicans control the White House and both houses of the U.S. Congress. Washington has put itself through debt-limit crises several times in recent decades. In the run-up to a 2011 crisis, the Treasury looked at a range of options, including prioritizing payments, which would mean making debt securities payments at the expense of other obligations.  Former Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in 2013 that attempting to prioritize might trigger chaos. Mnuchin told lawmakers on July 27 he had no intent to prioritize payments and that doing so doesnt make sense. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a criminal probe into 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB),a state fund founded by Najib that has lost billions of dollars.  The Justice Department has also launched civil lawsuits to seize some $1.7 billion in assets it says were bought with misappropriated 1MDB funds, making it the largest action by the department under its kleptocracy asset recovery initiative. Najib, who is expected to seek re-election in a poll due by 2018, has consistently denied any wrongdoing related to 1MDB since the scandal first erupted in 2015. Filings in the civil cases identified several individuals close to Malaysian Official 1, a term Malaysian and U.S. government officials have previously confirmed refers to Najib. Aside from the United States, 1MDB is the focus of money-laundering investigations in at least five other countries, including Switzerland and Singapore. The White House said in a statement that Trump looks forward to discussing ways to strengthen and broaden our bilateral relationship and expand regional cooperation with one of Americas closest partners in Southeast Asia. Relations between Malaysia and the United Stated soured in the last months of the Obama administration after the Justice Department filed the lawsuits.  The Malaysian leader has tried rebuilding ties with the  Trump administration, and he was among the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on his election victory. A U.S. Justice Department filing in May showed that Najib had hired a former campaign aide to Trump to lobby with the U.S. government, but Najib has denied this. Najib has talked to the local media about playing golf with Trump in the past, and claimed he has a picture of the two, with Trump signing off on it saying To my favorite Prime Minister. A meeting with Trump could help Najib bolster support within his party ahead of an upcoming election, and refute claims that he would be arrested if he travels to the United States. Najibs critics fear he could use the meeting to try to derail further investigations into 1MDB. Najib had sought to strengthen ties with China as relations with the United States became strained last year, and Malaysian media has reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping is  expected to visit the Southeast Asian country in the coming months, though this has not been officially confirmed. The United States sees Malaysia as an important regional partner in standing up to Beijings territorial claims in the South China Sea. The United States has long valued Malaysias support in its fight against the spread of Islamist militancy, and Washington has also sought Kuala Lumpurs backing for its policy toward North Korea. The two leaders are expected to discuss areas of mutually beneficial cooperation, including national security, the global fight against terrorism and extremism, and trade and investment that will benefit our nations and our peoples, Malaysias foreign ministry said in a statement. Malaysia had backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the trade agreement that Trump withdrew from earlier this year, dismaying the United States Asian partners.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps fellow Republicans rebuked him on Wednesday after his threat to shut down the U.S. government over funding for a border wall rattled markets and cast a shadow over congressional efforts to raise the countrys debt ceiling and pass spending bills. I dont think anyones interested in having a shutdown, the top Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, told reporters on Wednesday in Hillsboro, Oregon, where he visited an Intel factory.  Ryan said building a wall along the countrys border with Mexico to deter illegal immigration was necessary, but added that the government did not have to choose between border security and shuttering operations. Trump in a speech on Tuesday evening threatened a shutdown if Congress does not agree to fund constructing the wall, a signature promise of his presidential campaign, which added a new complication to Republicans months-long struggle to reach a budget deal. After Mexico rejected a chief part of Trumps promise - that it would pay for the wall - the president said the United States would fund it initially and be repaid by its southern neighbor. Lawmakers, including many Republicans, have not made that funding a top priority, as some question if a wall is necessary. Congress will have about 12 working days when it returns on Sept. 5 from its summer break to approve spending measures to keep the government open, while also facing a looming deadline to raise the cap on the amount the government may borrow. Both are must-approve measures.  U.S. stocks and the dollar weakened and investors pivoted to the safety of U.S. Treasury securities on Wednesday after Trump's threat. The S&P 500 Index .SPX closed about 0.3 percent lower, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down by 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC slid 0.3 percent.  Ryan suggested Congress would need to approve a short-term extension, or continuing resolution, of current funding levels so that the Senate could have more time to pass a full spending bill. That would push the budget battle to later in the year and could in turn delay attempts at tax reform, another signature Trump campaign issue. Friction between Republicans and Trump has grown in recent months, with the president publicly castigating some party leaders, notably Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and expressing infuriation that Congress has not passed any significant legislation since his January inauguration. McConnell did not take a stand on the border wall issue on Wednesday. He said in a statement he and Trump were in regular contact and working together on a list of goals that included preventing a government default and funding government priorities in the short and long terms. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we are committed to advancing our shared agenda together and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation, he said. A White House statement said Trump would hold previously scheduled meetings with McConnell once Congress returns to Washington and that Trump and McConnell remain united on many shared priorities, including middle class tax relief, strengthening the military, constructing a southern border wall, and other important issues. Congress frequently has to pass funding extensions for a few weeks or months while it hammers out a full budget. Occasionally lawmakers have enter a standoff over a single issue, delaying agreement and forcing a shutdown. The most recent closure, which spanned 15 days in October 2013, was over funding for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. In opinion polls during and after that shutdown, voters loudly disapproved of the Republican Party, which controlled the House of Representatives at the time. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the Republican chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee, said Trumps threatened move could backfire on the party. When you control the presidency, the Senate and the House, youre shutting down the government that youre running. I dont think its smart politically and I dont think it would succeed practically, he told Reuters in an interview.    The White House stressed on Wednesday that Trump would work with Congress to get funding for the wall.  The president ran on it, won on it and plans to build it, said White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom. The partys conservative wing backed the presidents call for wall funding, with Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, telling Reuters any government shutdown would be caused by Senate Democrats. Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, however, the threat was  dangerous for our role in the world as were talking to nations like Afghanistan to say: Heres how you govern yourself. He added it could also hurt financial markets confidence in the United States. Trump saying he would be willing to shut down the government over the wall obviously doesnt really inspire much confidence in anyone, said Michael ORourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.  The House passed a spending bill late last month that included funding for the wall. Republicans slim majority in the Senate means Democrats are needed to pass most legislation and they have opposed including border wall funding in any fiscal 2018 spending bill. Congress also must periodically raise the debt limit to keep the U.S. government borrowing and operating. Politicians sometimes take advantage of that need to push through policy or spending changes. The Treasury Department, already using extraordinary measures to remain current on its obligations, has said the debt limit must be raised by Sept. 29. Trump has asked Congress to extend the limit with a clean bill that excludes any other provisions. Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Wednesday it would review the U.S. sovereign debt rating, with potentially negative implications, if the debt limit is not raised in a timely manner.

The two-and-a-half-page White House document gives Defense Secretary Jim Mattis six months to fully implement the ban, according to a story first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by the official. It also directs the Defense Department to deny admittance to transgender individuals and to stop spending on medical treatment regimens for those currently serving, the Journal reported, citing U.S. officials. Mattis is expected to consider deployability - meaning the ability to serve in a war zone, participate in exercises or live for months on a ship - as the main legal reason to decide whether to separate service members from the military, the Journal reported. President Donald Trump said on Twitter on July 26 that the U.S. government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the military, a reversal of Pentagon policy. The surprise announcement, citing healthcare costs and unit disruption, appealed to some in Trumps conservative political base but created uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the Pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly. Five transgender members of the U.S. military including Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans sued Trump earlier this month, saying that the ban was made without consulting senior military commanders. It named as defendants Trump, Mattis and other military leaders including Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford said in a memo a day after Trumps tweets that there would be no change in policy until Mattis received an official order from the president. Stephen Peters at the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for LGBTQ rights, responded in a tweet: This proves @realdonaldtrump knows nothing about what it means to be #transgender or to serve in the military. Trans service members already do deploy, proving repeatedly what matters is their ability to accomplish the mission, not gender identity. The Obama administration, which ended the transgender ban in 2016, allowed currently serving transgender personnel to immediately begin serving openly but set July 1, 2017, as the start of new enlistments by openly transgender people.

The judges ruling said changes to the law passed earlier this year by the states Republican-controlled legislature that were meant to be less discriminatory than an earlier one did not accomplish that. U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of the Southern District of Texas said the state did not allow enough types of photo IDs for voters, even though the (5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals) was clearly critical of Texas having the most restrictive list in the country. President Donald Trump campaigned on cutting voter fraud, picking up a theme of fellow Republicans across the country. Critics have said the Texas law and similar statutes enacted in other Republican-governed states are an effort to suppress voting, including among blacks and Hispanics who tend to favor Democrats. Trump has made unsubstantiated allegations that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in last Novembers election, in which Clinton won the  popular vote but lost the decisive Electoral College count. Todays ruling is outrageous, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. Paxton, a Republican, added that changes to the law passed by the legislature included all those asked for by the 5th Circuit. The Justice Department filed a brief last month asking the court to halt action against the Texas voter ID law, saying the states new law fixed discriminatory issues of the states 2011 voter ID law.

From discriminatory gerrymandering to discriminatory voter ID laws, it has become entirely clear that Texas Republicans are rigging our election system. Ramos wrote in a 27-page ruling that voters with little education, or simply a lack of confidence, may forfeit their legitimate right to vote because of fear of being charged with perjury. She said Texas was overreaching by threatening severe penalties for perjury, and noted that the states history of voter intimidation led her not to accept the new voter ID law as a solution for the purposeful discrimination in the one it attempted to improve upon.

Although the award for the new Long Range Standoff weapon (LRSO) comes amid rising tensions with North Korea, the Air Force had asked the defense industry last summer for proposals to replace the aging nuclear cruise missiles and intercontinental ballistic missile system as the military moved ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad, said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement. LRSO, which is a plane launched weapon, will be capable of penetrating and surviving advanced integrated air defense systems from significant standoff range Lockheed Martin said in its statement about the award. The relatively small contract award is a milestone that allows Lockheed and Raytheon to continue parallel detailed development and prototyping for the cruise missile replacement. For the next four and a half years, the companies will perform the technology maturation and risk reduction of the weapon. Once complete, the Air Force will choose a single contractor for engineering, manufacturing and deployment. The Air Force plans to procure approximately 1,000 LRSO flight bodies, with development and procurement costs estimated at about $10 billion, according to an Air Force spokesperson. Only some of the bodies will be armed with nuclear weapons, the others will be used for testing or spares. The Air Force has said it plans to start fielding LRSO by 2030. The current cruise missile was first fielded in the early 1980s with a 10-year life. On Monday, the Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III ICBM system. Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force was expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade. The United States plans to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimated the cost at $1 trillion over 30 years.

Here is what you need to know about both, and the potential for a shutdown of the U.S. government: Congress must pass annual spending bills around the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30 to fund much of the U.S. government. When disagreements prevent that, which is frequent, lawmakers often pass a temporary bill extending existing spending levels with no changes for days, weeks or months, while they work on a longer-lasting deal. When they cannot agree on either a new spending plan or a short-term extension, the government shuts down. That has happened many times since the 1970s, usually for a few days, and can rattle markets. Congress will return from its long summer recess on Sept. 5. At the time, it will have only about 12 working days to approve spending measures to keep the government open. If spending measures are not passed before Oct. 1, portions of the government will begin to shut down and non-essential employees will go without pay until an agreement is reached. The government most recently shut down for about two weeks in October 2013 over funding for former President Barack Obamas healthcare law. There were three shutdowns in the 1990s, the longest lasting 21 days. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were 14 shutdowns, some partial and most lasting only a few days. The debt ceiling is a legislative limit on how much money the federal government can borrow through debt issued by the U.S. Treasury. Once the limit is reached, Congress must raise it or the government cannot continue borrowing money and would default, or be unable to pay its bills. The Treasury has said it wants Congress to increase the debt ceiling by Sept. 29, although default likely could be staved off until mid-October, thanks to extraordinary measures the Treasury put in place in March to delay a debt reckoning.   Legislation to raise the debt limit will need to be adopted, at the very latest, by early to mid-October. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the government would not be able to borrow more money or pay its bills, including payments on its debts, which could hurt the U.S. credit rating. Political gridlock has never led to the United States reaching its debt ceiling and its bills going unpaid, but there have been close calls. An August 2011 standoff cost the country its top-notch bond rating from the credit rating agency Standard & Poors and caused the most jarring two weeks in financial markets since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The two move on separate tracks, but are likely to get tangled together, with Republican opponents of a debt ceiling increase likely demanding federal spending cuts. Some analysts say Congress may try to tackle both issues at the same time. Both the spending and debt ceiling bills can pass the Republican-led House of Representatives by a simple majority vote, but will need 60 votes to pass the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats, meaning they will need some Democratic support.  Trump made his U.S.-Mexico border wall a central promise of his 2016 presidential campaign. He also promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico has steadfastly refused and Trump has largely stopped talking about that pledge. Conservative House Republicans agree with the Republican president on the need for a wall and say border-wall funding should be a priority in any spending legislation. Some of them have already indicated they are willing to shut down the government to get it. Moderate Republicans have called a shutdown unwise and Republican leaders are determined to prevent one, fearing it would worsen doubts about the partys ability to govern. Democrats are uniformly opposed to Trumps wall and say the responsibility for a shutdown would rest solely with Republicans. The Trump administration reversed course earlier this month and said it would back a clean raising of the debt ceiling, meaning it would not be tied to other policy measures. Democrats and moderate Republicans also support a clean debt-ceiling increase. But conservative Republicans, especially in the House, often use debt-ceiling legislation to insist on changes to spending, making them opposed to a clean bill.

In the excerpts, Clinton described the Oct. 9 debate in St. Louis in which Trump followed her closely about the stage, lurking behind her as she fielded questions from a live television audience.

It was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching: Well, what would you do?

Nearly two months without a budget, Connecticut is getting crushed by a burdensome debt load that has squeezed spending and amplified legislative discord. State lawmakers must agree on a biennial budget soon or else Governor Dannel Malloys executive order to slash state aid to municipalities and eliminate school funding for some districts will go into effect in October. The state faces a $3.5 billion deficit over the next two years.      Among the wealthiest in the United States, Connecticut has been strained by already high taxes, outmigration, falling revenues and $50 billion of unfunded pension liabilities.   Some $23 billion of outstanding municipal debt has also constrained spending. Bondholders must be paid ahead of most other expenses like non-essential services and payments to vendors.     The $2.85 billion of principal and interest the state paid on its bonds in fiscal 2017 was the highest in six years, according to preliminary unaudited information from State Treasurer Denise Nappiers office that has not yet been published. The state invested in the wrong things for a period of time. It allowed its higher educational institutions to suffer while it sought to placate communities with respect to other forms of local reimbursement, Malloy told Reuters during an interview in his office on Thursday. We built too many prisons, which were still paying off even while were closing them, he said. The Democrat took office in 2011 and is not seeking a third term.  Further, the states budget crunch is threatening its cities including the state capital of Hartford, which is considering bankruptcy due, in part, to its dependence on state aid. Connecticut has borrowed for decades to fund school construction, whereas nearly all other states typically borrow at the local level for those projects. Lack of county governments means some other local costs are picked up by the state, including for all of its detention facilities.  Connecticut has piled on debt to bolster its public pensions, selling $2.3 billion of bonds in April 2008. And again in December 2009, the state sold $916 million of economic recovery notes to close a budget deficit after depleting its rainy day fund during the Great Recession.   By many measures, Connecticuts debt levels are the worst of the 50 U.S. states. It has the most net tax-supported state debt per capita in the nation at $6,505, versus a median of $1,006, according to Moodys Investors Service.     It has the highest debt service costs as a portion of state revenues, as well as debt relative to gross domestic product, Moodys said.  Connecticut was downgraded by all three major Wall Street credit rating agencies in May. Both Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature have proposed solutions, including a hard cap on annual bond sales. Democratic legislators met with Millstein & Co., the same restructuring firm that advised Puerto Rico over its suffocating debt burden, according to The Connecticut Mirror newspaper. Nappier proposed a new tax-secured revenue bond program in lieu of general obligation debt, which she says will lower borrowing costs and boost reserves. But until lawmakers craft a budget, the states fiscal uncertainty is causing havoc among municipalities. Some are considering whether to delay the start of school or dip into reserves. And for Hartford, the longer the state goes without a budget, the closer the city comes to a possible bankruptcy filing, said Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, a 38-year-old former U.S. Treasury official. The lack of a state budget... makes a liquidity challenge come that much faster, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Now, the state faces a fiscal crisis. A budget is nearly two months late, with debt and big pension liabilities - fixed costs that constrain spending - hampering lawmakers attempts to reach an agreement. Governor Dannel Malloy, a second-term Democrat who is not seeking reelection, discussed with Reuters tough decisions he has wrestled with to address a fiscal calamity decades in the making. Malloy and Ben Barnes, secretary of the State Office of Policy and Management, talked about the states debt burden and whether Connecticut would approve a possible bankruptcy filing for Hartford.  Below are excerpts from the interview. Q: Describe the fiscal health of the state, and whether a budget would be passed soon.  MALLOY: There has been an ongoing process of making hard decisions. I think theres some legislative fatigue over that, but well get a budget. Im pretty proud that Connecticuts government is over 12 percent smaller today than when I took office. Im proud that were the first administration to truly actuarially fund pensions. Im proud that were the administration that has now restructured our arrangement with labor and have restructured the funding formula for our long-term obligations.  Q: Could you characterize the states relationship with debt? BARNES: There was a lot of school construction approved in the period running up to 2008 and the financial meltdown. Weve been bonding for large projects which were approved before the bottom fell out. What weve added into the mix has been significant expansion of what we provide for higher education. And weve also put money into economic development initiatives, which we think are extremely important. Q: If revenues are not coming in as expected, are tougher decisions needed regarding state borrowing?  MALLOY: You make investments in growing the economy, (like) the University of Connecticut campus.  BARNES: The fiscal problems that we have today are entirely driven by the overhang of unfunded pension liability. The increases that weve made in payments for retiree health and unfunded pension liability since 2010 are equivalent to all the taxes weve raised and then some.  Q: Should the school construction program be reevaluated? BARNES: We have made some significant changes... The number of school construction projects that are going forward is down. Weve definitely tightened the screws there, but the state of Connecticut has built a lot of schools over the last 20 years. Q: Would you approve a bankruptcy filing for Hartford? MALLOY: I would approve it if its the best way to handle their difficulties. Connecticut has not treated its cities very well, something which Ive tried to change.

Trump, who had already held out the possibility of a pardon for Arpaio, decided against announcing it at a major rally in Arizona on Tuesday night but suggested that he would step in at some point. Ill make a prediction. I think hes going to be just fine, okay? But I wont do it tonight because I dont want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe can feel good, he said.  Arpaio, an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, was the sheriff of Maricopa County in Phoenix before he lost a re-election bid in 2016. Last month a judge found him guilty of contempt for intentionally defying a 2011 court order that barred his officers from stopping and detaining Latino motorists solely on suspicion that they were in the United States illegally. The judge in the underlying lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and others in 2007, held that such traffic stops were a violation of the motorists constitutional rights. Arpaio, who was in office for 24 years, gained national prominence for his treatment of jail inmates and crackdown on undocumented immigrants.  Arpaios situation resonated with the crowd of Trump supporters. Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe? Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of Pardon Joe!  Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? Trump said. His mention of Arpaio seemed to contradict comments by White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, who told reporters earlier in the day that the subject would not come up.

Under fire for saying both sides were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and left-wing counter protesters in Virginia on Aug. 12, Trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath. I didnt say I love you because youre black, or I love you because youre white, Trump said. I love all the people of our country. Police used pepper spray to disperse crowds after protesters threw rocks and bottles outside the convention center where Trump spoke, police said. Trump, who often uses news organizations as a foil, repeatedly singled out the media for criticism of how it covered the violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville and the resulting political fallout. These are truly dishonest people. Theyre bad people. I really think they dont like our country, Trump said. The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media. Adopting a glib tone, Trump said many reporters ignored his condemnation of white supremacists, including the Ku Klux Klan.  I hit em with neo-Nazi, I hit em with everything ... KKK? We have KKK. I got em all, he said. James Clapper, a former director of U.S. national intelligence, expressed concern at Trumps performance, calling it downright scary and disturbing. I question his fitness to be in office, Clapper told CNN. Funding for the border wall has flagged in the U.S. Congress as many lawmakers question whether Trumps main promise during the 2016 presidential election campaign is really necessary. But with a budget battle looming, Trump said he would be willing to risk a politically damaging government shutdown in order to secure funding for the wall.  He visited the border region in Yuma, Arizona, earlier on Tuesday. If we have to close down our government, were building that wall, Trump said. Were going to have our wall. The American people voted for immigration control. Were going to get that wall. With thousands of supporters cheering him on, Trump also weighed in on another racially charged issue, hinting he would pardon former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio, 85, who battled illegal immigration in the Phoenix area, was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. Trump covered the gamut of issues, from NAFTA trade talks to the U.S. showdown with North Korea, during a raucous, rambling and defiant political speech lasting an hour and 15 minutes.  He said he might terminate the NAFTA treaty with Mexico and Canada to jumpstart negotiations, and said the standoff with North Korea over its weapons programs might have taken a positive turn. However, it was unclear whether the speech would help lay the foundation for a comeback from the deep political crisis Trump finds himself in after only seven months in office and an approval rating below 40 percent. He expressed frustration that the Republican-controlled Congress was unable to approve healthcare legislation that failed to pass the Senate by one vote last month. One of the votes against the legislation was cast by  Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was recently  diagnosed with brain cancer. Without mentioning their names, Trump criticized both McCain and his fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake. Neither McCain nor Flake attended the event. Trump complained repeatedly about the one vote that stopped the Senate from repealing and replacing Obamacare, the signature domestic policy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. One vote away. I will not mention any names - very presidential. And nobody wants me to mention your other senator, whos weak on border, weak on crime. Nobody knows who the hell he is! See, I havent mentioned any names, so now everybodys happy, he said. The White House had said earlier when asked about Arpaio that there will be no discussion of that today.  That did not stop Trump from raising the subject. Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe? Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of Pardon Joe! Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? Trump asked, before predicting that Arpaio would be just fine. I wont do it tonight because I dont want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe can feel good, he said. Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at the Charlottesville rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed. He mocked left-wing protesters in his speech. Protesters outside Tuesdays rally yelled: Shame, shame, shame and No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA as the Trump supporters began filing into the Phoenix Convention Center. Supporters, who lined up for hours in the Arizona heat ahead of the event, chanted: Build the wall. Many wore red hats with Trumps campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.  Trump has held a series of 2020 re-election campaign stops despite only having taken office in January.  Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesdays event while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in Charlottesville. A heavy police presence was deployed around the Phoenix venue for Trumps first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump would be required to notify U.S. lawmakers before creating a joint U.S.-Russia cyber security unit - an idea that has drawn criticism across the political spectrum - under legislation advancing in Congress.  The proposal, if it became law, would be the latest in a series of maneuvers by Congress that either limit the presidents authority on Russia matters or rebuke his desire to warm relations with Moscow. A provision contained within the annual Intelligence Authorization Act and passed by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee 14-1 would require the Trump administration to provide Congress with a report describing what intelligence would be shared with Russia, any counterintelligence concerns and how those concerns would be addressed. The bill, which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, passed the Senate Intelligence Committee in July, but its text was only recently made public because it involves sensitive intelligence operations.     Trump last month said on Twitter that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed establishing an impenetrable Cyber Security unit to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. Trump quickly backpedaled on the idea, which was criticized by Democrats, senior Republicans and the National Security Agency director. The White House and Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the intelligence panel, were not immediately available for comment on the bill. Trump wants to improve relations with Russia, a desire that has been hamstrung by the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Republican Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton.  U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating the interference and possible collusion between Russia and members of Trumps campaign. Moscow has denied any meddling and Trump has denied any collusion. Previously, Congress tied the presidents hands on Russia by passing a bill that Trump cannot ease the sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. In August, the Senate blocked Trump from being able to make recess appointments while lawmakers were on break, fearing the president would fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his handling of the Russian probe. Lawmakers have also introduced legislation to stop Trump from having the ability to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to determine whether there was collusion between Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow. The annual Intelligence Authorization Act requires approval by the full Senate and House and the presidents signature before it can become law. No vote has been scheduled and the last act was passed by Congress in March.  The legislations provision requiring notification of any U.S.-Russia cybersecurity unit was pushed by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, his office said on Tuesday. Wyden also helped secure provisions in the bill that call for an intelligence report assessing the threat posed to the United States by Russian money laundering and another report examining whether cyber vulnerabilities in U.S. cell networks, including a known bug in the global mobile network Signaling System No. 7, or SS7, are being exploited by foreign governments to conduct surveillance on Americans. Wyden was the lone committee vote against the bill, however.  He said in a statement on Tuesday that he objected to language that identified the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks as a non-state hostile intelligence service because doing so could have implications for journalists.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""ON BOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force may intensify its strikes in Afghanistan and expand training of the Afghan air force following President Donald Trumps decision to forge ahead with the 16-year-old war, its top general told Reuters on Tuesday. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said, however, he was still examining the matter, as the U.S. militarys top brass had only begun the process of translating Trumps war strategy into action. Asked whether the Air Force would dedicate more assets to Afghanistan, where the United States has been engaged in its longest military conflict, Goldfein said only: Possibly.  Its actually too early to tell what this will mean in terms of plus-ups and reductions, he said in a joint interview with Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson. Still, he acknowledged that the Air Force was absolutely examining the possibility of increasing air power, including to support U.S. ground forces, following Trumps promise of a stepped-up campaign against Taliban insurgents, who have gained ground against U.S.-backed Afghan government forces.  Goldfein said the same about providing training to Afghan pilots. Wilson, who assumed the Air Forces top civilian job three months ago, noted the Afghan military had made strides thanks to U.S. training and equipment, but added: I think there is a long way to go there, very honestly.  In a speech on Monday night, Trump appeared to answer a call from the top U.S. commander on the ground for thousands of more troops to break a stalemate with Taliban insurgents, on top of the roughly 8,400 now deployed in Afghanistan. Trump said the United States would not disclose troop numbers, but one U.S. official told Reuters they could start moving quickly. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday he would set troop levels following the review by military chiefs. During the administration of Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama, U.S. military officials privately expressed frustration about their inability to strike at many Taliban targets - including training camps -  unless they could show a direct threat to U.S. forces or major impact on the Afghan state. Wilson said Trump appeared to be giving greater flexibility to strike insurgents.    Obviously the Joint Chiefs will work through their plans and make proposals, but I think the guidance was pretty clear from the president last night, and were going to go on the offensive and destroy these terrorist networks, Wilson said.  Goldfein said: I thought that came out very loud and clear in the speech that thats his priority. Wilson and Goldfein spoke to Reuters while flying back to the United States after a nine-day trip that included a visit to Afghanistan, where the U.S. military has ramped up its firepower against Islamic State in recent months even as it helps Afghan forces battle the Taliban.   Particularly for the U.S. Air Force, the size of the American commitment to Afghanistan far outweighs the number of airmen deployed there. A network of U.S. installations throughout the Middle East supports the Afghan campaign, including in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.  Still, any substantial increase in U.S. targeting of the Taliban and Islamic State militants would likely require dedicating more U.S. military assets to build intelligence, strike insurgent targets and provide support to U.S. forces in the field. Although the U.S. military is stretched, a string of U.S. coalition-backed victories by Iraqi forces against Islamic State might free up some firepower and intelligence assets for Afghanistan, experts say. Air Force spokesman Brigadier General Edward Thomas declined to speculate on operational planning. But he noted that U.S. air power from the region could be deployed, if needed, including fighter aircraft, bombers and spy planes.    With the detailed planning that will follow the presidents announcement, the Air Force will be ready to swing any additional airmen and aircraft to the fight as required,  Thomas said.  Trump ran for the presidency calling for a swift U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which the United States invaded in October 2001, and he acknowledged on Monday that he was going against his instincts in approving the new campaign plan sought by his military advisers. Wilson said Trumps remarks represented a strategic correction in the war effort along with a significant shift in policy on Pakistan. In his speech, Trump delivered a sharp rebuke to Islamabad for allowing Taliban insurgents a safe haven from which launch attacks in Afghanistan, and said it had much to lose unless it changed course. Pakistan denies that it harbors militants fighting U.S. and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan. Reuters has reported that the United States has been considering a range of actions, including withholding aid to Pakistan and, perhaps, ramping up drone strikes. Successive U.S. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear-armed Pakistan, and the U.S. military has been dependent in the past on overflight or land routes through Pakistan to resupply its forces in landlocked Afghanistan.   Wilson did not rule out a future U.S. military role against militants in Pakistan should Islamabad fail to act, but she said Trumps focus appeared to be on diplomatic efforts for now.  My assumption is that there will be some intense diplomatic pressure, she said. Goldfein said he was not aware of any changes to U.S.-Pakistani military ties, but acknowledged the military would take its cues from the State Department. I can tell you that I have a fairly robust dialogue with the Pakistani air chief. Ive hosted him. Hes hosted me, Goldfein said. But that dialogue is always supportive of the diplomatic dialogue.

We are going to be conditioning our support for Pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area, Tillerson told reporters.  U.S. officials are frustrated by what they see as Pakistans reluctance to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on Pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan denies it harbors militants fighting U.S. and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan. Tillerson said the United States could consider withdrawing Pakistans status as a major non-NATO ally, which provides limited benefits such as giving Pakistan faster access to surplus U.S. military hardware, if cooperation did not improve. We have some leverage thats been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as non-NATO alliance partner - all of that can be put on the table, he said. In a televised speech on Monday offering few specifics, Trump promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the U.S.-backed Afghan government and he singled out Pakistan for harboring militants. U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Talibans hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year.  U.S. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 U.S. troops have died there in Americas longest military conflict.   (For a graphic on U.S. troops and contractors in Afghanistan click tmsnrt.rs/2xm6CxQ)  The Afghan government welcomed Trumps speech, but the Taliban said it would make the country a graveyard for the American empire.     Successive U.S. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear-armed Pakistan, which has a porous border with Afghanistan. Washington fumes about inaction against the Taliban, but Pakistan has cooperated on other U.S. counterterrorism efforts, including against al Qaeda and Islamic State militants. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said it was disappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation in fighting terrorism.  As a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country, it said.      A senior U.S. official said on Tuesday significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning Pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations. Trump also called for Pakistans great rival India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, a prospect that will ring alarm bells for Pakistans generals.     Trumps policy of engaging India and threatening action may actually constrain Pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants, said Zahid Hussain, a Pakistani security analyst. The United States has little choice but to use Pakistani roads and air corridors to resupply its troops in landlocked Afghanistan, giving Islamabad considerable leverage. U.S. officials fret that if Pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize Afghanistan and endanger U.S. soldiers.     Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday he was awaiting a plan from the U.S. militarys chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, before deciding how many more troops to send to Afghanistan. When he brings that to me, I will determine how many more we need to send in, Mattis told reporters in Baghdad. It may or may not be the number that is bandied about. U.S. officials have said Trump has given Mattis authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in Afghanistan. The U.S. Air Force may intensify its strikes in Afghanistan and expand training of the Afghan air force following Trumps decision, its top general told Reuters on Tuesday. Most U.S. troops in Afghanistan work with a NATO-led training and advising mission, with the rest part of a counterterrorism force that mostly targets pockets of al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rolling back territorial gains by the Taliban and strengthening the Afghanistan armys ability to fight will be two key objectives of President Donald Trumps new strategy for the country, a senior administration official said on Tuesday. Trump, in a televised speech on Monday, promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the U.S.-backed Afghan government. In outlining his strategy to give the U.S. military more authority to make battlefield decisions, Trump did not provide a timetable for determining whether the mission is a success or how commanders would be able to judge progress. The senior administration official said, however, that one general measure of progress was assessing how much and what territory is controlled by the Afghan government or by the Taliban and other extremist groups such as Islamic States Afghan affiliate. Its also the estimated number of fighters, the presence of al Qaeda and ISIS, how strong are they, how many fighters do they have, how are their training camps, what are their finance networks like, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Also key will be the effectiveness of the Afghan army and whether U.S.-led armed forces can help it seize control of some territory held by the Taliban, the official added.  Trump, who was reluctant to approve a deeper engagement in Afghanistan after 16 years of war, wanted to keep a close eye on whether progress is being made, the official said. I think were going to be taking the temperature continuously, the official said. I dont think we expect to see any real gains materialize for at least six months. But from that point on, its going to be something that we essentially never stop evaluating. U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Talibans hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year.  U.S. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 U.S. troops have died there in Americas longest military conflict.    Three U.S. officials said on Tuesday the administration had yet to settle on specific metrics to measure progress in Afghanistan and assess the contributions of the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and Americas NATO allies. One of the officials said there was no point in setting specific targets, much less making them public, because that would risk making our partners think that once they had met those marks, they didnt have to do more. What were after is a progressive process, the official said, so for example the Afghan security forces keep improving their capabilities until they dont need us anymore, the government in Kabul keeps improving its record on eliminating corruption and improving local, regional and national governance. But Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, struck a critical tone on Tuesday. While a conditions based approach is appealing to military leaders because it gives the Taliban less certainty about how long it will take to wait us out, it also diminishes pressure on the Afghan government to reform itself and give the Afghan people something worth fighting for, since it indicates a willingness to bail them out indefinitely, Schiff said in a statement.

Disruptj20 is home to a coalition of political activists who organized disruptive protests during President Donald Trumps inauguration.  The Justice Department said it sought the records connected to the site amid concerns that it helped facilitate the planning of violent riots on Inauguration Day in which more than 200 people were arrested for rioting and vandalizing businesses in downtown Washington. DreamHost resisted the request, saying the scope of the warrant was too broad and trampled on the rights of 1.3 million visitors to the site, many of whom were simply exercising their First Amendment rights to express their political views. The Justice Department on Tuesday proposed amending the scope of its warrant in a filing with the Superior Court of the District of Columbia Criminal Division, which is slated to hold a hearing over the dispute on Thursday morning. The warrant - like the criminal investigation - is singularly focused on criminal activity. It will not be used for any other purpose, it wrote.

The flap erupted after Mnuchins wife, Scottish-born actress Louise Linton, posted a photo of herself emerging from the aircraft wearing a white outfit and sunglasses, using the hashtags #tomford, #hermesscarf and #valentino, according to images of the Monday evening post on social media. In her initially vitriolic response to the deplorable criticism, Linton had lashed out about how much she and her husband contribute to the economy and pay in taxes.  On Tuesday, she scrolled back. I apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response. It was inappropriate and highly insensitive, Linton said in a statement released through a publicist. Linton has since made her Instagram account private. Jenni Miller, who identified herself as a mother of three from Portland, Oregon, had said of Lintons original post on Instagram: Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable.  Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during her unsuccessful presidential run that some of U.S. President Donald Trumps supporters were a basket of deplorables. Linton shot back at Miller. Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol, she said, according to images of the response posted online. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? Im pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day trip than you did. The U.S. Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.

Last year she withdrew a self-published book in which she claimed to have been caught up in violence in Zambia. African leaders and aid workers said the book was filled with factual errors. Trump ran on a populist campaign platform, vowing to improve the lives of working Americans and has surrounded himself with a cabinet heavy on corporate titans, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), and financier Wilbur Ross, now the commerce secretary.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans, seeking to address the complaints of small businesses, are floating changes to their controversial proposal to eliminate business tax deductions for debt interest payments, business lobbyists said on Tuesday.  A top U.S. Republican on tax policy acknowledged that modifications are in the works, but did not provide details. The debt interest proposal, long seen by Republican policymakers as necessary to help drive economic growth, is backed by large companies with ready access to equity financing that they could substitute for debt if eliminating the interest deduction made issuing debt too costly. Debt-dependent small business owners, farmers and ranchers dont have that luxury. As Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration slog ahead with a push to overhaul the U.S. tax code, a key task is figuring out how to resolve conflicting groups priorities, with business debt interest a clear example. The tax code has not been overhauled since 1986, partly because reconciling these conflicts can be so difficult. Weve asked businesses large and small to look at that, test drive it and give us back their feedback, House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said in remarks at an event in Louisville, Kentucky on Tuesday, without offering specifics about the modified proposal. His staff at the committee had no comment. Businesses lobbyists said the panels lawmakers have quietly agreed to focus on exemptions for small businesses, including farmers and ranchers, and an exemption for land. Lawmakers have also discussed a possible partial elimination of the interest deduction, with an exemption for existing debt, or eliminating the deduction only for businesses deemed to have an excessive amount of debt, according to lobbyists.    Brady is one of the Big Six negotiators from Congress and the Trump administration who are guiding the tax reform debate. At the Louisville event, he described rolling back the business interest deduction as a trade-off for another proposal to accelerate expensing, which would allow businesses to write off investments in plants and equipment more quickly. He said net interest deduction is one of a number of tax breaks that lawmakers are looking to eliminate to help pay for lower business tax rates. Republicans say tax cuts will help drive annual U.S. economic growth above the 3 percent mark.  Independent analysts say that eliminating the interest deduction would raise more than $1 trillion in federal revenues.  Republicans want to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20-25 percent from 35 percent. But they have been hard-pressed to pay for such a cut since jettisoning a border adjusted import tax that would have raised more than $1 trillion.

Trumps call for India to play a greater role in Afghanistan, in particular, will ring alarm bells for Pakistans generals, analysts said. Trumps policy of engaging India and threatening action may actually constrain Pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants, said Zahid Hussain, a Pakistani security analyst. Trump criticised Pakistan for providing safe havens to terrorist organisations and warned Islamabad it had much to lose by supporting insurgents battling the U.S.-backed Kabul government. It is kind of putting Pakistan on notice, said Rustam Shah Mohman, Pakistans former ambassador to Kabul, predicting a bumpy road ahead for relations. Trump did resist some advisers calls to threaten to declare Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism unless Islamabad pursued senior leaders of the Afghan Taliban and the allied Haqqani network. Pakistan should not be reassured by this speech, but it could have gone a lot worse for them, said Joshua White, a National Security Council director under former President Barack Obama.  There were voices within the administration who wanted to move more quickly and aggressively to declare Pakistan not just a problem, but effectively an enemy. In Washington, a senior administration official said on Tuesday that significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning Pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Pakistans powerful military has not commented on Trumps speech, but the day before it denied any militants had havens in the country.     The Pakistani government said Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif met with the U.S. ambassador on Tuesday and would speak in coming days with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the state of play in the bilateral relationship as well as the new U.S. policy on South Asia.  Successive U.S. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear-armed Pakistan. Washington fumes about inaction against the Taliban, but Pakistan has been helpful on other counterterrorism efforts, including against al Qaeda and Islamic State militants. The United States also has no choice but to use Pakistani roads to resupply its troops in landlocked Afghanistan. U.S. officials worry that if Pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilise Afghanistan and endanger U.S. soldiers. Daniel Feldman, a special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan under Obama, said the Obama administration found it more effective to pressure Islamabad over safe havens in private than in public, and to keep the long-standing Indo-Pak rivalry from playing out in Afghanistan. Hussain, the security analyst, said Trump on Monday crossed a red line as far as Pakistan was concerned when he implored India to deepen its involvement in Afghanistan. Relations between Pakistan and the United States have endured strain during the 16-year war in Afghanistan, especially after al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. special forces inside Pakistan in 2011.   The Obama administration had already begun trimming military aid to Pakistan. Last year, the Pentagon decided not to pay $300 million in pledged military funding, and Congress effectively blocked a subsidised sale of F-16 jets to Pakistan. Analysts say Trump is likely to further curtail military aid  to pressure Pakistan. But any effort to isolate Pakistan would face problems from China, which has deepened political and military ties to Islamabad as it invested nearly $60 billion in infrastructure in Pakistan. China on Tuesday defended Pakistan after Trumps remarks, saying its neighbour was on the front line in the struggle against terrorism and had made great sacrifices and important contributions in the fight. Mohman, the former ambassador, said if the United States kept putting pressure on Pakistan, then Islamabad would drift farther from the American sphere of influence. We have options, he said. We can go to China and Russia, and I think the U.S. cant afford that.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Government forces breached the city limits of Tal Afar in northwestern Iraq on Tuesday on the third day of a U.S.-backed offensive to seize it back from Islamic State militants. Tal Afar, a longtime Islamic State stronghold, is the latest objective in the war following the recapture of Mosul after a nine-month campaign that left much of that city in ruins. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, speaking just before arriving in Iraq on Tuesday, said the fight against IS was far from over despite recent successes by the Western-backed government. The Sunni Muslim jihadists remain in control of territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria. On Tuesday, however, army and counter-terrorism units broke into Tal Afar from the eastern and southern sides, the Iraqi joint operations command said. About three quarters of the city remain under militant control, including the Ottoman-era citadel in its center, according to an operational map published by the Iraqi military.    The main forces involved are the Iraqi army, air force, Federal Police, the U.S.-trained Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), as well as units from the Shiite Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), who began encircling the city on Sunday.  Located 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul, Tal Afar is strategic as it lies along the supply route between Mosul and Syria. It has produced some of ISs most senior commanders and was cut off from the rest of IS-held territory in June.    Up to 2,000 battle-hardened militants remain in Tal Afar, according to U.S. and Iraqi military commanders. ISIS days are certainly numbered, but it is not over yet and it is not going to be over anytime soon, Mattis told reporters in Amman.  As was the case with the battle for Mosul, aid organizations groups are concerned about the plight of civilians in Tal Afar. U.S. Brigadier General Andrew Croft, chief of coalition air operations over Iraq, said between 10,000 and 20,000 civilians remained in Tal Afar. Up to 20,000 are thought to remain in the surrounding areas, but aid agencies say these are just estimates as they have been without access to Tal Afar since 2014.  Waves of civilians have fled the city and villages under cover of darkness over the past few weeks. Those remaining are threatened with death by the militants, who have held a tight grip there since 2014. About 30,000 have fled Tal Afar since April, according to the United Nations. In Geneva, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said those fleeing this week were suffering from dehydration and exhaustion, having lived off unclean water and bread for the past three to four months.  Many talk of seeing dead bodies along the way, and there are reports that some were killed by extremist groups, UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic said. Others appear to have died due to dehydration or illnesses.  People were also arriving at camps with wounds from sniper fire and exploding mines, he said. Several thousand civilians are believed to have been killed in the battle for Mosul, where Islamic State tried to keep them in areas it controlled to act as human shields against air strikes and artillery bombardments. Defense Secretary Mattis met Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Defence Minister Arfan al-Hayali in Baghdad to discuss the role of U.S. forces in Iraq after the recapture of the remaining cities under Islamic State. There are plans under consideration... that will look at residual presence in the future, Lt. General Steve Townsend, the U.S.-led coalitions commanding general, told reporters in a joint press briefing with Mattis. Croft said that over the past two or three months, he had seen a fracturing in the Islamic State leadership. It just seems less coordinated. It appears more fractured, less robust, and sort of flimsy, is the word I would use... it is sporadic, Croft told reporters.  Islamic State leaders fled Mosul during the fighting there and the whereabouts of its chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are unknown. Unconfirmed reports in the past few months have said he  is dead.   U.S. officials said that while big cities like Mosul have largely been cleared of Islamic State militants, there were concerns about the ability of Iraqi forces to hold territory. Pockets of resistance remained in west Mosul, including sleeper cells, Mattis said. Islamic State is also on the back foot in Syria, where Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the U.S.-led coalition have captured swathes of its territory in the north and are assaulting its main Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. McGurk said about 2,000 Islamic State fighters remained in Raqqa and as much as 60 percent of the city had been retaken. The jihadist group is now falling back deeper into the Euphrates valley region of eastern Syria. Mattis said the next step for forces fighting Islamic State in Syria would be a move against the middle Euphrates valley, a reference to the militants stronghold in Deir al-Zor province southeast of Raqqa. A U.S. official also said Mattis would press Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government, to call off a planned referendum on independence. Iraqs Kurds have said they will hold the referendum on Sept. 25 despite concerns from Iraqs neighbors who have Kurdish minorities within their borders and a U.S. request to postpone it. However, a senior Kurdish official said the Kurds may consider the possibility of a delay in return for financial and political concessions from the central government in Baghdad. The United States and other Western nations fear the vote could ignite a new conflict with Baghdad and possibly neighboring countries, diverting attention from the ongoing war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

That comment signaled he would further increase pressure on U.S. partners who have already been jolted by his repeated demands to step up their contributions to NATO and his description of the alliance as obsolete - even though, since taking office, he has said this is no longer the case. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: NATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with (Defense) Secretary (James) Mattis and our Allies and international partners.

Trump on Monday committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan, signaling he would dispatch more troops to Americas longest war and vowing a fight to win. Trump insisted that others - the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and NATO allies - step up their own commitment to resolving the 16-year conflict, but he saved his sharpest words for Pakistan. Senior U.S. officials warned security assistance for Pakistan could be reduced unless the nuclear-armed nation cooperated more in preventing militants from using safe havens on its soil. Critics say Pakistan sees militants such as the Taliban as useful tools to limit the influence of old rival India. Pakistan denies allowing militants refuge on its territory, saying it takes action against all groups. Asked about Trumps speech, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Pakistan was on the front line in the struggle against terrorism and had made great sacrifices and important contributions in the fight. We believe that the international community should fully recognize Pakistans anti-terrorism, she told a daily news briefing. We are happy to see Pakistan and the United States carry out anti-terror cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, and work together for security and stability in the region and world.  China and Pakistan consider each other all-weather friends and have close diplomatic, economic and security ties. China has its own security concerns in the region, in particular any links between militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Islamist groups China blames for violence in its far western region of Xinjiang.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While President Donald Trump opened the door on Monday to beefing up U.S. forces in Afghanistan, he provided few details on how sending more troops will hasten a conclusion to Americas longest war. There is no quick fix to this problem, said Bill Roggio, an insurgency expert with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based policy institute, speaking before Trumps speech. Things will continue looking bleak for some time. In his approximately 30-minute nationally televised address, Trump said he would expand authority for U.S. commanders to target militant networks that sow violence and chaos throughout Afghanistan.   That paves the way to an increase in the 8,400 U.S. troop level in Afghanistan and broader rules of engagement as part of his plan to end a military conflict that began in 2001, U.S. officials said. But he declined to say how many more U.S. soldiers will be deployed or how long the U.S. force will be there. Conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables would guide the duration of U.S. military involvement, he said. His effective embrace of an open-ended U.S. deployment contrasts with the expectations of his political base that he would extract the United States from a war estimated to have cost more than $700 billion and claimed the lives of more than 2,400 U.S. service members. But Trump, who has railed against the war for years, finds himself boxed in. Taliban advances are raising the specter of a repeat of 1996, when Islamist militants seized power and provided al Qaeda with a sanctuary in which to plot the Sept. 11, 2011, attacks in New York and Washington. Moreover, the Afghan government is plagued by ethnic and political rifts and corruption and controls less than 60 percent of the country, similar circumstances that paved the way for the  Talibans 1996 takeover. The choice is between losing and not losing. Winning really isnt an option, said James Dobbins, who served as the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan during the presidency of Barack Obama and is now a senior fellow at the RAND Corporation. He (Trump) can lose quickly by withdrawing, he can lose slowly by standing pat Dobbins said, adding that Trump could not lose by marginally increasing the U.S. force.  The ostensible goal of Trumps strategy is to help Afghan security forces reverse Taliban advances and create a military stalemate that eventually would compel rebel leaders to agree to a diplomatic resolution of the conflict. Yet Trump indicated that diplomacy would take a back seat to military operations, saying that, Some day, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban. Sending more U.S. troops could buy time for the Afghan government to increase its legitimacy and gain support for the Afghans, which will help them negotiate an end of the conflict, said Scott Worden, an expert with the U.S. Institute for Peace. But Worden, also speaking before Trumps speech, said more U.S. troops alone are not going to outright defeat the Taliban. The military components of the strategy have to be coupled with an equal - if not greater - emphasis on managing the politics of Afghanistan and the politics of the region. Obama tried and failed with what basically was the same approach. He presided over a far larger effort that at one point involved some 100,000 U.S. troops, considerable airpower, scores of CIA drone strikes on extremist sanctuaries in Pakistan, and billions of dollars for reconstruction and democratization programs. Obama also dedicated enormous diplomatic energy to ending the war, appointing a special envoy to coordinate negotiations. Not only has Trump eliminated that post, but the administration has proposed slashing the State Department budget by about 30 percent and has left scores of senior posts vacant. Obama freed five Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay and allowed the rebels to open an office in Doha. The Taliban freed captured U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl, but they refused to be drawn into talks. Trump signaled a tougher U.S. approach to Pakistan, warning that while it had much to gain by cooperating on Afghanistan, it would have to immediately stop harboring Islamist militants who target U.S. troops and officials. But again, he provided no details of how he planned to convince Pakistan to do so. U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of failing to pursue top leaders of the Taliban and the allied Haqqani network and to end sanctuaries and support for the extremists from elements of the powerful military and army-run intelligence agency, an allegation Islamabad denies.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump came around to the decision to allow for more troops to be sent to Afghanistan only after a prolonged internal debate in which he frequently tangled with his top national security advisers. Trump had repeatedly argued on the campaign trail last year that the long-running wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were a waste of lives and billions of dollars that could be better spent at home. An emotional visit in April to Walter Reed Hospital, where many grievously wounded soldiers are taken for treatment, only served to harden the presidents reluctance to send more troops.  Trump said he did not want to send more young Americans to battle only to see them lose limbs. What are we doing there? he asked his national security aides, according to a senior administration official. In a series of interviews, senior administration officials said Trump was hard to persuade but finally - and begrudgingly - agreed to allow for a modest increase in troop numbers, from the current 8,400 to more than 12,000. He first had to be convinced that the approach he was approving was markedly different from the strategies employed by his two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, since he considered them to have failed, the officials said. In his prime-time speech to the nation on Afghanistan policy on Monday night, Trump conceded that his original instinct on taking office had been to pull out but he was then persuaded of the dangers of a hasty withdrawal. Putting new emphasis on anti-terrorism goals, he said U.S. troops were needed to prevent the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan and again making it a breeding ground for Islamic militants. This is not about nation-building again. We are killing terrorists, he said.  In the White House discussions, some of Trumps advisers appealed to his pride in his negotiating skills by saying he could succeed with the Taliban where Obama had failed, in part because Obama made the mistake of announcing that a surge of additional troops to Afghanistan he approved in late 2009 was temporary. The president knows that in order to get the Taliban to the table, he knows that he first has to prove that hes willing to keep pressure on them for as long as it takes, which Obama failed to do, said one of the officials. That doesnt mean he expects to sit down with them in Qatar tomorrow. Trump challenged his advisers to provide clear measurements of how progress can be gauged, with the goal of turning the tide in a battle in which the Taliban appears to have gained the upper hand in recent months. He wants to be shown that were winning, said one official. They had to develop the metrics for that in advance before he would agree to it. He doesnt want to be told in two years that its just as bad as it was 2017, but not worse. If that happens then were really talking about a withdrawal. He made that clear. While Trump was joined in his skepticism by his chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was fired on Friday after months of power struggles inside the White House, multiple officials said the debate was less about Bannon and more about Trump himself. The argument that White House chief of staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster made was that previous efforts faltered because the Afghan and Pakistani governments did not step up and do what is required of them to help defeat the Taliban and deny terrorists a haven in Afghanistan. The three - who have all had distinguished military careers - also raised the specter of Irans involvement in Afghanistan, an argument that helped given Trumps desire to block Tehrans expansionism in the Middle East, officials said. It was hard to put together for him all the pieces of a complicated puzzle that includes not just the three major regional players, but also India, China, Russia, and Iran, said one official. But the idea that he could succeed where his predecessors had failed had a certain appeal. So did the idea of emphasizing this is part of the war against Islamic terrorism, not an effort to rebuild Afghanistan, something he had consistently opposed, the official added. The new Trump strategy puts greater emphasis on the responsibilities of the Pakistani and Afghan governments. Another important factor, the officials said, was convincing Trump that the withdrawal he had advocated for years would force him to shoulder some of the blame for the Taliban victory that surely would follow.

Trump, who has struggled to persuade the Republican-led Congress to approve funding for a project many see as unnecessary, is to visit the facility in Yuma, Arizona. The border area at Yuma is considered a success story for the U.S. Border Patrol because illegal crossings have slowed as a result of the border installation. Trump will not go to the border wall at Yuma as officials had said earlier in the day. Instead, he will tour a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol hangar and see some of the equipment used to monitor the border, including a Predator drone, a patrol boat and a surveillance truck, the officials said. During his visit, Trump will be briefed on border patrol efforts in the region and the need for more funding for immigration and border officials to carry out the Republican presidents desire for sharp limits on illegal immigration, the officials said. The proposed border wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the United States, was one of Trumps major 2016 campaign promises. His vow that Mexico would pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do, has strained relations between the two neighbors.

Though the award for the new Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) comes amid rising tensions with North Korea, the Air Force had asked the defense industry last summer for proposals to replace the aging ICBM system and its nuclear cruise missiles as the military moved ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. The Minuteman III is 45 years old. It is time to upgrade, Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said in a statement on Monday. Northrop Grumman was awarded $328 million, and Boeing $349 million over the three-year contract. The relatively small award is a milestone that would allow Boeing and Northrop to continue parallel detailed development and prototyping for the Minuteman replacement. The Pentagons office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) has said the total could cost the United States $85 billion. The Air Force has estimated $62 billion. Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop and Boeing were all competing for the contract which is needed to perform the three-year technology maturation and risk reduction (TMRR) phase of Minuteman replacement. A Lockheed representative said the company was disappointed and looked forward to a debrief about the selection. Boeings Strategic Deterrence Systems Director, Frank McCall, said in a statement, Since the first Minuteman launch in 1961, the U.S. Air Force has relied on our technologies for a safe, secure and reliable ICBM force. Boeing provided the Minuteman III missile for the current ground-based nuclear ICBM system.  Northrop Grummans chief Wes Bush said in a statement, We look forward to the opportunity to provide the nation with a modern strategic deterrent system that is secure, resilient and affordable.  Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said, We are moving forward with modernization of the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad.  Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force was expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade. The United States plans to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimated the cost at $1 trillion over 30 years.

Evangelical Christian Jerry Falwell Jr said Trump could be more polished and politically correct but is not racist. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who last week criticized the white nationalists evil, sinful, disgusting behavior, said unequivocally on Sunday that the faith community stood by Trump. The responses reflect a balancing act by conservative Christians as they try to square the images that emerged from the Virginia city of Charlottesville last weekend - torch-carrying white supremacists and neo-Nazis toting swastika flags - with support for a president that failed to condemn them roundly and immediately. Trump alienated fellow Republicans, corporate leaders and U.S. allies with his comments about the violence that broke out at a white nationalist protest against the removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville. He said many sides were to blame and that there were very fine people on both sides. Trump also decried the removal of Civil War monuments to the Confederacy that several cities have deemed offensive for their connection to slavery.  But the remarks, including those at a fiery Trump news  conference on Tuesday, may not dent support from his political base, where white evangelical Christian voters are a major component.  Many in the evangelical Christian community condemned the neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacists who marched in the University of Virginia town before one of them plowed through a crowd of counter-protesters and killed a 32-year-old woman. Fewer criticized Trump directly.  Falwell, president of the Christian-based Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, said Trump likely had more detailed information on protesters when he described fine people on both sides.  One of the reasons I supported him is because he doesnt say whats politicallycorrect, he says what is in his heart, Falwell told ABCs This Week program. But he does not have a racist bone in his body. National Public Radio reported on Sunday that a number of Liberty University graduates were preparing to return their diplomas to protest his support for Trump. Falwell said they misunderstood that support. Huckabee, a conservative Baptist minister before entering politics, said Trump has the faith community. This is an attempt to discredit and ultimately dislodge Donald Trump from the White House, Huckabee told Fox Business Network. Huckabee noted that only one person on a faith council that advises Trump had stepped down since the controversy.  New York City megachurch pastor A.R. Bernard said he left Trumps unofficial evangelical advisory board on Tuesday after having distanced himself for several months as it became obvious that there was a deepening conflict in values between myself and the administration. Johnnie Moore, an evangelical adviser to the White House, said in a statement he deeply respects Bernard. We have every intention to continue to extend invitations to him to contribute his perspective on issues important to all of us, he said. Pastor Mark Burns, an African-American televangelist who leads a small congregation in South Carolina and serves on the board, said in an interview on MSNBC on Saturday that he stood by Trump.  I dont believe he supported neo-Nazis, I dont believe hes supporting white supremacists at all, Burns said in an interview with MSNBC on Saturday. I would have personally said stronger (things) in reference to the KKK, neo-Nazis, but I dont have all the information. Franklin Graham, the president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, denounced bigotry and racism on his Facebook page a day after the Charlottesville violence, but at the same time, he also took aim at politicians who tried to connect Trump to that turmoil. One member of the evangelical community, biblical studies professor Denny Burk of Boyce College in Kentucky, condemned the presidents remarks at Tuesdays news conference as more than disappointing. They were morally bankrupt and completely unacceptable. People who protest while chanting Nazi slogans are not very fine people, Burk wrote in an article posted on his Facebook page.

Schiff told Jake Tapper on CNNs State of the Union program that it did not make sense for Trumps opponents to focus on the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which two Democratic lawmakers invoked against the president after his controversial comments about a white nationalist rally in Virginia. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice president takes over as acting president if he and a majority of either Cabinet officials or such other body as Congress may by law provide declare in writing that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. I think were still far from concluding that thats the case, Schiff said, even though we find, many of us, his conduct anathema and there to be a serious problem here.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. California Representative Zoe Lofgren on Friday introduced a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence and Trumps Cabinet to have medical and psychiatric professionals examine the president to help determine whether he can do his job. Many Americans, including many Republicans, have observed the Presidents increasingly disturbing pattern of actions and public statements that suggest he may be mentally unfit to execute the duties required of him, Lofgren said in a statement. Representative Jackie Speier, also of California, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that Trump was showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger. Time to invoke the 25th Amendment.  Speier wrote the post after Trumps explosive news conference on Tuesday, when he blamed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, not just on white nationalist rally organizers but also on counter-protesters. Trump said there were very fine people in both groups. Those comments also provoked criticism from Republican Senator Bob Corker, who told reporters on Thursday that Trump has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful, according to a Tennessee local news website. Corker did not refer to the 25th Amendment in his remarks. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will recommend on Aug. 24 whether to eliminate or shrink nearly two dozen national monuments, creating the first major test for a 111-year-old law that gives presidents the power to protect swaths of public land. Zinke is expected to recommend that at least some of the national monuments under review - which were all created since 1996 - be rescinded or shrunk in size, responding to an order by President Donald Trump, who believes there should be greater opportunity to increase local resource development and economic opportunities.  Any recommendation of reductions could herald a move into unchartered territory. Under the Antiquities Act, a president can declare certain areas of historic or scientific interest a national monument. However, no president has ever revoked a previous designation. Previous presidents, including Woodrow Wilson and William Howard Taft did reduce the size of some existing monuments. But this time, environmental groups are prepared to challenge any changes in court - something that has not happened before. Trump has argued that previous administrations abused their right to designate federally protected monuments under the 1906 Antiquities Act and put millions of acres of land - mainly in western states - off limits to drilling, mining, logging and other activity without adequate input from locals. Under the Antiquities Act, a president can declare certain areas of historic or scientific interest a national monument. Conservation groups, state attorneys general and Native American tribes, including the five tribes which lobbied to create one of the sites under review - Bears Ears National Monument in Utah - have already said they plan to challenge any changes in court. We told Zinke that all the tribes are willing to go into battle in terms of litigation and we are here to fight for our monument, said Davis Filfred, a council delegate for the Navajo Nation council. While Zinke has said so far that six monuments of the 27 on the review list should be left intact, he is expected to recommend downsizing some through presidential decree or Congressional action, which could change how future presidents use the 1906 law. Zinke has already said he intends to scale down Bears Ears, which covers 1.35 million acres and was created last December by former President Barack Obama, who said it would protect the cultural legacy of Native American tribes and preserve scenic and historic landscapes. Zinke said he believes previous presidents took too many liberties with the Antiquities act. Clearly the Antiquities Act was designed to protect the smallest area compatible with protection of the object, Zinke told Reuters in June in Boston, where he met with stakeholders to discuss the Atlantic coast Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine monument. Zinke said that Congress needs to step to the plate, too, to take up legislation that could change some monument sizes and create other designations like national recreation and conservation areas.   Molly Block, a spokeswoman for Utah Republican Representative Rob Bishop, chair of the House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, said while the House may be able to pass legislation regarding monuments, enactment of a measure would be an uphill battle. You can get something through the House, but anything we do will face a tough time in the Senate, she said. Meanwhile, public support for monuments has grown in visibility. Zinke has said Interior has received over 1.2 million public comments on the Regulations.gov website and thousands more via traditional mail. Environmental groups have said more than 2.7 million comments were submitted, mostly in favor of keeping the monuments intact. The debate has galvanized a lot of different interests beyond traditional environmental groups, including outdoor retailers and hunters and fishers, who are out there mobilizing during this review, said Sharon Buccino of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Outdoor retailer Patagonia aired its first-ever TV ads on Sunday, featuring a direct appeal to Zinke to leave the monuments intact. The ads will air in Zinkes home state of Montana, as well as Utah and Nevada, where several monuments are under review. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In interviews in multiple cities this weekend, Americans who voted for Trump said Bannons departure on Friday was the removal of an unnecessary distraction for the Trump presidency, while others saw his role as largely inconsequential and possibly overblown. Many expected Trump to stay the course without him. Bannon was becoming too big of a story and taking the spotlight from President Trump, Bob Janda, a 67-year-old small business owner, said in a bar in Chicago. When that happens, your days are numbered. I think Trump will be fine. At the same bar, Frank Cardone, 67, pointed out that Bannon had a brief tenure in Trumps inner circle, having joined the Republican businessmans presidential campaign as its chief executive less than three months before the Nov. 8 election. Bannon wasnt with Trump for too long so its no big loss, said Cardone, a retired electrician.  Before hitching himself to Trump, Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a hard-right site. He immediately returned to that role after his exit from the White House, vowing to use it as a platform to defend Trump.   Bannon, 63, has touted Breitbart as a conservative counterpoint to what he views as the liberal bias of U.S. news outlets and a platform for the so-called alt-right, a loose confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. He played a key role in some of Trumps most contentious policy moves including the travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations, departure from the Paris climate accord and rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Bannons exit gives Trump a chance to distance himself from fringe politics, said Mike Corbitt, a machinist from Floridas West Palm Beach. He (Trump) needs to be more center-right because the far right and the far left is not where America is, Corbitt, 48, said at a Fort Lauderdale bar. Steve Bannon was great for getting Trump elected, but now the president needs someone who can get his policies enacted. Bannon joined a string of senior officials who have left the Trump administration in the past five weeks, leading to the appointment of retired Marine general John Kelly as the new White House chief of staff. While some observers have characterized the moves as a sign of chaos in the White House, others see it as a sign that Trump is running his administration like a well-oiled corporation. All these shakeups mean is that Trump is doing his job, Liz Lingafelter, a 60-year-old nurse, said in Fort Lauderdale. Hes a businessman and is doing whats best for the organization. That view was echoed by Rick Weatherly, a 61-year-old Denver maintenance technician. I voted for Trump, not Bannon, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Mnuchin, along with other members of the cabinet, stood beside the president at a Tuesday news conference as Trump blamed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend on not just white nationalist rally organizers but also counter-protesters, and said there were very fine people among both groups. A letter, dated Aug. 18 and signed by more than 350 members of the Yale class of 1985, argued it was Mnuchins moral obligation to resign immediately because, it said, Trump had declared himself a sympathizer with groups whose values are antithetical to those values we consider fundamental to our sacred honor as Americans. We know you are better than this, and we are counting on you to do the right thing, the letter said. Mnuchin issued a statement on Saturday responding to his classmates and what he said were many other comments urging him to speak out.

Mnuchin, who is Jewish, added: While I find it hard to believe I should have to defend myself on this, or the president, I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form, believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways. Ultimately, he said, his classmates should be comforted by his remaining in the administration. I dont believe the allegations against the president are accurate, and I believe that having highly talented men and women in our country surrounding the president in his administration should be reassuring to you and all the American people, he said.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trumps ouster of chief strategist Steve Bannon is unlikely to mark the abandonment of the administrations America First agenda that has unnerved investors and trade partners and split the White House into nationalist and globalist camps. Within hours of leaving Trumps administration on Friday, Bannon was back at the helm of Breitbart News, the hard-right news site he ran before becoming the main architect of Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Bannon can now do more to further conservative causes because he can speak his mind without the constraints of working in the White House, Rick Weatherly, 61, a maintenance technician from the Denver suburb of Lakewood, said on Saturday. Trump appeared to agree, tweeting: Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at @BreitbartNews ... maybe even better than ever before. Fake News needs the competition! Bannon, 63, was instrumental in some of Trumps most contentious policies including the travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations, departure from the Paris climate accord and rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He was no friend to the Republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals, but became a darling of some of the presidents hard-line conservative supporters.  Trump will now have a great external ally, a source close to Bannon said on condition of anonymity. He will use his big hammer against the congressional leadership in support of the presidents agenda. Trump supporters in south Florida, Chicago and Colorado told Reuters that they were not concerned that Bannons departure meant the president was distancing himself from policies he supported during last years campaign. I think Trump will be fine, said Bob Janda, a 67-year-old small business owner in Chicago.             Nor is Bannon likely to be distanced from Trumps ear, a White House official said on condition of anonymity. Bannon joined a string of senior officials who have left the Trump administration in the past five weeks, leading to the appointment of retired Marine general John Kelly as the new White House chief of staff. Kelly has succeeded in imposing some order on what had been a haphazard operation, but Bannon will still have a direct pipeline into the Oval Office with Breitbart, Twitter and the TV, the same White House official added.  My guess is hell (Bannon) probably be more effective goading the presidentfrom outside, especially if the president feels boxed in by John Kellys clean lines of authority and (national security adviser H.R.) McMasters orderly processes, said Kori Schake, a research fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution who previously served in the White House. Seems to me thatBannon was symptom not cause: The president seems to share his dark vision, revel in thesupport of people Bannon represents, Schake added. Prior to joining the Trump campaign, Bannon had spearheaded Breitbarts shift into a forum for the alt-right, a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His departure capped a tumultuous week in which Trump was widely criticized for saying both sides were responsible for last weekends violence at a Charlottesville, Virginia rally organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Bannon told the conservative Weekly Standard on Friday that he would use Breitbart to attack opponents of the populist and nationalist agenda he championed, including establishment Republicans.  At the same time he appeared to suggest that his departure signaled a major shift for the Trump agenda. The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over, Bannon said. Defense policy is one area where Bannon could play a role from the outside.   While many of Trumps national security aides favor sending several thousand more troops to Afghanistan, where the Taliban insurgents have been regaining ground, Bannon argued for withdrawing the 8,400 U.S. personnel still there. He also had advocated restraint in dealing with North Korea, rejecting the use of military force to solve the recent crisis. There is a danger that if he continues to bang away on issues that appeal to Breitbarts audience but arent going anywhere, Bannon risks splitting the administrations loose coalition of hard-right ideologues, traditional conservatives, and middle-of-the-road voters who didnt like Hillary Clinton, another Trump administration official said, also on condition of anonymity.

The Kennedy Center also said in a statement the White House reception will no longer take place. The White House said the president and first lady would not take part in the Kennedy Center Honors to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction. The announcement came after television producer Norman Lear, singer Lionel Richie and dancer Carmen de Lavallade said they would not attend the White House reception that was set to take place prior to the Dec. 3 annual gala event. The other honorees are singer Gloria Estefan and rapper LL Cool J.  The awards are presented each year in December to recognize honorees for their lifetime contributions to the arts.  All five honorees are expected to attend a Dec. 2 dinner and awards ceremony at the State Department, the Kennedy Centers chairman, David Rubenstein, and its president, Deborah Rutter, in a statement. The Kennedy Center respects the decision made by the Trumps, they said. In choosing not to participate in this years Honors activities, the administration graciously signaled its respect for the Kennedy Center and ensures the Honors gala remains a deservingly special moment for the honorees, Rubenstein and Rutter said. De Lavallade, an African-American actress, dancer and choreographer, said in a statement on her website that she was honored to receive the award and would attend the show. But, she said that she would not go to the White House in light of the socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our existing leadership is choosing to engage in. Her comments come after the president blamed both sides for violence that erupted last week between counter-demonstrators and neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and white nationalists holding a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. Trumps comments prompted a slew of resignations from presidential councils, including all 17 members of the Presidents Committee on the Arts and Humanities. In a New York Times article on Aug. 3, Lear was quoted as saying that he would forgo the White House reception because, This is a presidency that has chosen to neglect totally the arts and humanities  deliberately defund them  and that doesnt rest pleasantly with me.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With Stephen Bannon, the worry always was that he could be even more disruptive to President Donald Trumps White House from outside than he was within. In the hours following his firing on Friday, those fears seemed warranted, as the conservative voices who viewed Bannon as one of their own howled in rage over Trumps decision to fire his chief strategist. The reaction was most notable from Breitbart News, the hard-right news site that Bannon ran before he joined Trumps presidential campaign last year. WAR, tweeted one of the sites editors, Joel Pollak, who published a piece questioning whether Trump would now move in a more moderate direction with Bannon out of the White House.  Steve Bannon personified the Trump agenda, Pollak wrote. Bannon rejoined Breitbart as executive chairman only hours after his firing was announced. He is now expected to use it as a platform to blast those within the White House - and perhaps Trump himself - when they dont hew to the fiercely nationalist policies Bannon advocated as an inside adviser. As Trumps chief strategist, Bannon fought numerous battles with senior Trump aides and top Republicans in Congress over the administrations policy agenda. Breitbart frequently backed him up, ripping establishment Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, blaming them for obstructing Trumps agenda. More recently, the site trained its fire on Trumps national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, after he removed officials who espoused Bannons foreign-policy world view. In recent days, Bannon had told friends he is worth tens of millions of dollars, is a worldwide leader in the populist-nationalist movement that propelled Trump to power, and could go back to Breitbart, which he refers to as a killing machine, or perhaps other endeavors financed by the family of hedge-fund tycoon Robert Mercer, his longtime ally. Steve has a powerful voice, and hes going to keep that voice up, said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser and Bannon friend. Hes going to continue to promote policies that got Donald Trump in the White House. Bannon had clashed with the likes of Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Jared Kushner, a Trump adviser and the presidents son-in-law, both of whom favored more business-friendly, mainstream economic policies on trade, taxes, and other matters. While Bannons ouster may mean a short-term win for the relative moderates in the West Wing, those he dubbed the globalists, it does not mean that policy battles on national security, immigration and the economy will dissipate. Trump has a shown a proclivity for seeking counsel from former advisers such as Corey Lewandowski and Newt Gingrich and from conservative pundits such as Sean Hannity. The outspoken and provocative Bannon could join their number. And there remain other White House officials sympathetic to Bannons world view, such as domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller. Even so, Bannons absence will be felt. Trump is always going to be Trump on immigration, trade, and foreign policy. But Steve was the highest-ranking adviser who shared Trumps world view. With him gone, theres not a replacement for that voice in internal debates, one administration official said. I think people have always overestimated how influential anyone can be on Trump. But without Steve constantly pushing back on every policy idea coming from the so-called globalists, its easy to see how they could have a chance to start winning more policy battles. Mike Cernovich, an alt-right activist and personality, suggested to his more than 300,000 followers on Twitter that Bannon was sacked to ensure that the White House raises troop levels in Afghanistan, which Bannon opposed. This is a full-on coup now, guys, Cernovich said in a posted video. Beyond Breitbart and the alt-right, some more traditional conservative groups were also concerned about the implications of Bannons departure. Twenty Republican grassroots leaders, including longtime activists Richard Viguerie, Jenny Beth Martin, and Ginni Thomas, wrote to Trump earlier in the week urging him to keep Bannon on. We will miss Steve Bannon in the White House because he helped President Trump keep many of the promises he made on the campaign trail, Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said in a statement after Bannons ouster. But she also reiterated her support for the president, saying he is his own man. If Bannon has anything to do with it, he will push to make sure that Trump stays that way.  But some supporters still worried that the radical agenda  Bannon fought for could be at risk. Its a sad day for the movement, Nunberg said. I think it will end up being a mistake.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Jim Mattis travels to the Middle East and eastern Europe next week to play the increasingly familiar role of reassuring allies that the United States is committed to them despite mixed messages from President Donald Trump.      Mattis will visit Jordan, Turkey, and Ukraine to address concerns about the fight against Islamic State and give a message that Washington will not tolerate Russias annexation of eastern Ukraine.      The informal portfolio of soothing traditional U.S. friends upset by Trumps often sharp comments and tweets on foreign policy is one that the retired Marine general is becoming used to.  There is no-one in the administration, maybe with the exception of Vice President Mike Pence, that has to shoulder the responsibility of Trumps rhetoric more than Mattis, said Joshua Walker, a former U.S. diplomat and current fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank.  Earlier this month, Trump said that a U.S. military option was being considered for Venezuela as the country is torn by political and economic upheaval. Within a few hours, the Pentagon publicly announced that it had not received any orders on Venezuela, lowering the temperature slightly.  Mattis, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, sent a conciliatory message to North Korea last weekend in an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal after Trump had threatened fire and fury if Pyongyang tried to attack the United States.     The two officials wrote that the United States has no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea, addressing some of North Koreas fears that Washington ultimately intends to replace its leadership.  It is certainly true that to some extent if you look at both Mattis and Tillerson, who travel a lot, they are both explainers and people who both manage to moderate and reassure, said Anthony Cordesman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Mattis served as the head of U.S. militarys Central Command from 2010 to 2013, and foreign leaders, especially in the Middle East, trust him, said Cordesman. On a trip to Iraq earlier this year, Mattis grabbed headlines when he said the U.S. military was not there to seize anybodys oil.  That was an attempt to calm Iraqi worries after Trump had told CIA staff in January, when referring to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003: We should have kept the oil. But okay. Maybe youll have another chance. Trump has also upset NATO allies by demanding they increase their defense spending and by seeking better relations with Russia.  I do think that Secretary Mattis finds himself spending time, putting President Trumps statements into a broader context... in some cases that does mean defining them more narrowly, or more precisely as to what they mean, Christine Wormuth, a former number three at the Pentagon, said. On the trip that starts this weekend, Mattis will make the first visit to Ukraine by a U.S. secretary of defense since 2007. He will try to reassure Kiev that the United States remains committed to restoring Ukraines sovereignty after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Questions were raised when Tillerson said in June that the Trump administration did not wish to be handcuffed by the 2015 Minsk accord to end fighting in Ukraine. That agreement, signed by Russia and Ukraine, calls for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy. While it is not a close U.S. ally, Ukraine has counted on American support against Russia since a pro-Western government took power following street protests in 2014 that ousted a Kremlin-backed president. Trumps comments during the election campaign last year, from praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin to appearing to recognize Crimea as part of Russia and contemplating an end to U.S. sanctions on Moscow, stoked fears in Kiev that Trump would mend ties with Russia at Ukraines expense. The Pentagon is awaiting White House approval for a proposal to send defensive weapons to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles, a U.S. official said. Michael Carpenter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the region, said the trip would be important because it would send a signal to Kiev that the United States remained committed and the approval of the lethal weapons would be a tangible sign of that. Mattis believes that this is a security issue that goes beyond Europe, that this is about international norms, sovereignty and territorial integrity, Carpenter said.     The Pentagon says Mattis will also emphasize the commitment of the United States to Turkey and help Ankara address its legitimate security concerns- including the fight against the (Kurdistan Workers Party). However, Mattis will have to address a number of differences, including the Pentagons decision to arm Kurdish YPG fighters to support an operation to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islamic State.  Ankara views the YPG, fighting within a larger U.S.-backed coalition, as the Syrian extension of the Kurdish PKK militant group, which it is fighting in southeastern Turkey.

Trump blamed both sides for clashes in the southern college town of Charlottesville in Virginia last weekend, where white nationalists were protesting the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. A woman was killed when a suspected white nationalist plowed his car into a crowd.  Those who march spewing hate are few, but loud. We must denounce them at every turn, and make them feel like they are on an island and isolate them the same way they wish to isolate others, wrote Haley, a member of Trumps cabinet, in the email sent Thursday to staff at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, said the horrible acts seen in Charlottesville took me back to sad days dealing with the Charleston tragedy in 2015.  Haley attracted national attention when she secured the removal of the Confederate battle flag from South Carolinas capitol grounds after a white supremacist killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston. People arent born with hate. We all have a responsibility to stand up and condemn it, Haley wrote in the email to staff, which did not refer to Trump.  While we should respect diversity of viewpoints, it is incumbent on us to challenge hate with the values we cherish.  And it is incumbent on us to never, ever countenance violence as we do so, she said.  Trump has alienated Republicans, corporate leaders and U.S. allies, rattled markets and prompted speculation about possible White House resignations with his comments since the violence in Charlottesville.   On Monday, Trump bowed to political pressure and denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan by name, but on Tuesday he again inflamed tensions by insisting counter-protesters were also to blame and that there were very fine people among both groups. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and several top U.S. military officers have since broadly condemned racism.

Bannons firing, a year and a day after Trump hired him as his campaign chief, put an abrupt end to the rabble-rousing political provocateurs tumultuous tenure in a White House riven with rivalries and back-stabbing during which he clashed with more-moderate factions. He was instrumental in some of Trumps most contentious policy moves including the ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries, abandoning the Paris climate accord, tearing up international trade agreements and cracking down on illegal immigration. He was no friend of the Republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals but was a darling of some of the presidents hard-line conservative supporters. White House officials said Trump had told new Chief of Staff John Kelly to crack down on the bickering and infighting, and that Bannons fate was sealed by comments published on  Wednesday in the American Prospect liberal magazine in which he spoke of targeting his adversaries within the administration. Trump, seven months into his presidency, has become increasingly isolated over his comments following white supremacist violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville last Saturday and his attacks on fellow Republicans. Some Republicans had even begun questioning Trumps capacity to govern. As Trump came under fire from Republicans including two former presidents, and from business leaders and U.S. allies abroad, he faced mounting calls for Bannons ouster. Critics had accused Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steves last day, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. Bannon returned to his post as executive chairman of right-wing Breitbart News on Friday afternoon, the website said. Prior to joining the Trump campaign, he had spearheaded Breitbarts shift into a forum for the alt-right, a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Bannon said his departure from the White House signals a major shift for the Trump agenda. The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over, Bannon told the conservative Weekly Standard.  I just think his ability to get anything done - particularly the bigger things, like the wall, the bigger, broader things that we fought for, its just gonna be that much harder, Bannon said. He said he would use Breitbart to attack opponents of the  populist and nationalist agenda he championed, including establishment Republicans. I am definitely going to crush the opposition, Bannon said. He became the latest key figure to abruptly depart a Trump White House that has been chaotic from its first days and already has lost a chief of staff, a national security adviser, two communications directors and a chief spokesman. Trumps presidency also has been dogged by ongoing investigations in Congress and a special counsel named by the Justice Department into potential collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia, something both Trump and Moscow deny. Bannon, 63, is a former U.S. Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker and Hollywood movie producer. He had been in a precarious position before but Trump opted to keep him, in part because he had played a major role in Trumps November 2016 election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton and was backed by many of the presidents most loyal rank-and-file supporters. Democrats cheered Bannons departure. Steve Bannons firing is welcome news, said Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat. The Trump Administration must not only purge itself of the remaining white supremacists on staff, but abandon the bigoted ideology that clearly governs its decisions. Wall Street indexes and the U.S. dollar ended a volatile session lower after a week of drama in Washington intensified doubts about Trumps ability to deliver on policy objectives such as tax cuts. After a late-morning boost following reports of Bannons ouster, the dollar and U.S. equities lost ground. Bannon felt a close ideological connection to Trumps populist tendencies and America First message. Like Trump, he has also expressed deep skepticism concerning ongoing American military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The decision to fire Bannon could undermine Trumps support among far-right voters but might ease tensions within the White House and with party leaders. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress but have been unable to pass major legislative goals including a healthcare overhaul. Trump ran into trouble after saying anti-racism demonstrators in Charlottesville were as responsible for the violence as the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests, and that there were very fine people among both groups. Those remarks sparked rebukes from fellow Republicans, top corporate executives and some close allies. Bannons departure removes a large source of friction on the White House staff, but does not herald a significant shift by Trump toward the center on major policy issues, three administration officials said. A good deal of what was attributed to Bannon, for example on China trade and restricting immigration, and the border wall, all came before Bannon joined the campaign and would have happened without him, said one White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Bannon has been a hawk on China, urging a tougher line on trade to correct a huge trade imbalance and dismissive of recent efforts to try to elicit Beijings help to rein in North Korea. In his comments to American Prospect, Bannon said the United States was in an economic war with China.     A second official said the biggest winners from Bannons departure are national security adviser H.R. McMaster; Gary Cohn, Trumps chief economic adviser; and Trumps daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Bannons departure cast a cloud over the future of the group of allies he had brought into the White House, such as Sebastian Gorka. Some conservative activists expressed disappointment in Bannons ouster. Republicans were largely quiet, though moderate Republican congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said she was glad Bannon was out but that the administration must work to build bridges, not destroy them. By the time Trump had hired Bannon as campaign manager, the real estate magnate had already vanquished his Republican opponents for the partys presidential nomination. Asked about Bannon on Tuesday, Trump called him a friend of mine but downplayed his contribution to his election victory. Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. And I like him. He is a good man. He is not a racist, Trump said.

Trump has alienated Republicans, corporate leaders and U.S. allies, rattled markets and prompted speculation about possible White House resignations with his comments since Saturdays violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, which came in the aftermath of a white nationalist protest against the removal of a Confederate statue. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned Trumps capacity to govern. The president ... has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful, said Corker, who Trump had considered for the job of secretary of state. Corker said Trump needed to make radical changes. Trump unleashed attacks on two Republican U.S. senators, Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, in a series of Twitter posts on Thursday, raising fresh doubts about his ability to work with lawmakers in his own party to win passage of his legislative agenda, which includes tax cuts and infrastructure spending. He took aim at the removal or consideration for removal of Confederate statues and monuments in a long list of cities in California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee, Virginia, and Texas, as well as Washington, D.C. Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You cant change history, but you can learn from it, Trump wrote on Twitter, refusing to move past the controversy.  Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - whos next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Trump said. He was referring to two Confederate generals in the Civil War that ended in 1865, and to early U.S. presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who owned slaves but whose legacies are overwhelmingly honored. Opponents call the statues a festering symbol of racism, while supporters say they honor American history. Some of the monuments have become rallying points for white nationalists but also have the support of some people interested in historical preservation. Trump also denied he had spoken of moral equivalency between white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members who clashed with anti-racism activists in Charlottesville. U.S. stocks suffered their biggest drop in three months on Thursday as the turmoil surrounding the White House sapped investor confidence that Trumps ambitious economic agenda would become reality. Equity index futures fell a bit further after the close of regular trading, with S&P 500 emini futures heading into the overnight trading session about 2 points lower. The U.S. stock market has not followed a 1 percent-down day with a second straight day of losses since Trump was elected in November, so Fridays session is being watched as a significant test of the markets resilience. Amid the controversy, the White House knocked down rumors that Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn might resign. An official said Cohn intends to remain in his position as National Economic Council director at the White House. Trump announced the disbanding of two high-profile business advisory councils on Wednesday after the resignation of several corporate executives over his Charlottesville remarks. On Thursday, a White House official said Trump had dropped plans for an advisory council on infrastructure. In another indication of businesses not wanting to be associated with the president, the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic canceled a planned 2018 Florida fundraiser at Trumps Mar-a-Lago Florida resort, where it had held such events for seven straight years. Spokeswoman Eileen Sheil said the Cleveland Clinic considered a variety of factors in deciding to cancel an event that typically generates $1 million a year. The clinics chief executive, Toby Cosgrove, was a member of a one of the two councils that disbanded on Wednesday. James Murdoch, chairman of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, slammed Trumps response to Charlottesville in an email to friends and pledged to donate $1 million to the Anti-Defamation League, the New York Times reported. James Murdoch wrote that Trumps comments should concern all of us as Americans and free people, the Times said. Twenty-First Century Fox owns Fox News Channel, a favorite with Trump and his conservative supporters. HATE-FILLED INDIVIDUALS  The Charlottesville violence erupted when white nationalists marched to protest against the planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. A 32-year-old woman, Heather Heyer, was killed when a man described as a white nationalist crashed his car into the counter-protesters. Trump has blamed the Charlottesville violence on not just the white nationalist rally organizers but also the counter-protesters, and said there were very fine people among both groups. He also expressed distaste for removing Confederate statues in a heated news conference on Tuesday. After Trump blasted Graham on Twitter, the senator who was one of Trumps rivals for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination fired back. Because of the manner in which you have handled the Charlottesville tragedy you are now receiving praise from some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country. For the sake of our Nation - as our President - please fix this, Graham said. History is watching us all. Another Republican senator, Dan Sullivan, also said on Twitter: Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK by (Trump) is unacceptable. Period. Graham had said on Wednesday Trumps remarks at his news conference the day before had suggested moral equivalency between the white nationalists and anti-racism demonstrators and called on the president to use his words to heal Americans. Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just cant forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember! Trump wrote. In a separate tweet, Trump called Flake WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. Hes toxic! and appeared to endorse Kelli Ward, Flakes Republican challenger in his 2018 re-election race.  Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, called for the immediate removal of Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol. U.S. Senator Cory Booker, also a Democrat, said he would introduce legislation so that could be done. There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country, Pelosi said in a statement. A spokesman for Republican U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said it was up to U.S. states to determine which statues were displayed on their behalf in the Capitol building.

Cobb told Reuters this week that he talks to Trump on an almost daily basis and has been in contact with the team of Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.   Mueller is investigating possible collusion between Trumps  campaign team and Russia, as well as possible money laundering by at least one former aide.  But Cobb, who resigned from law firm Hogan Lovells to take the White House job on July 31, said in interviews on Tuesday and Wednesday he believed Muellers probe was narrow and that by the end of the year Trump should no longer be threatened by it. Id be embarrassed if this is still haunting the White House by Thanksgiving and worse if its still haunting him by year end, Cobb told Reuters, adding: I think the relevant areas of inquiry by the special counsel are narrow. He declined to provide specifics backing his projected timeline, which suggests a speedier end to Muellers probe than several outside experts believe is likely. The White House would be lucky if sometime in the spring of 2018 this started to wrap up, but even that I think is pretty optimistic, said Andy Wright, former associate counsel in former President Barack Obamas White House. Its a very complicated investigation.  Wright said Muellers team would have to track down many leads in the United States and overseas, and gather evidence from email accounts, intelligence reports and other sources. Russias government has denied interfering in the election and the president has denied collusion took place. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on any timeline for the probe, the scope of the investigation or any interactions with the White House. Like all senior White House staff, Cobb, 66, reports to retired general John Kelly, Trumps chief of staff. As a White House lawyer, he is in a different position than the presidents outside lawyers John Dowd and Jay Sekulow. Cobb would not be able to assert attorney-client privilege to protect his conversations with Trump from a grand jury subpoena. Trump has said he believes any investigations of his and his familys finances would be beyond the scope of Muellers probe.  Cobb said he believed Muellers 16-lawyer team was appropriately focused and understood the urgency to the country and to the presidency of finishing the probe quickly.   We have one objective, which is to bring this to a conclusion as quickly as possible, Cobb said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""HAGERSTOWN, Md./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump reviewed an array of options for a strategy on Afghanistan with his top national security aides, but made no decision on whether he would commit more troops to Americas longest war. Fridays meeting was the latest in a series of high-level discussions on Afghanistan and a broader security strategy for the South Asia region that has been bogged down by internal differences. Trump was briefed extensively on a new strategy to protect Americas interests in South Asia, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters, after the meeting at the Camp David Maryland retreat. The president is studying and considering his options and will make an announcement to the American people, to our allies and partners, and to the world at the appropriate time, Sanders said.      National security adviser H.R. McMaster and other top national security officials went into the meeting backing a modest increase in troops. At a mid-July meeting, they had thrown their weight behind 3,000 to 5,000 additional U.S. and coalition soldiers. Anti-globalists, who were led by Steve Bannon before he was fired on Friday as Trumps chief strategist, backed withdrawing U.S. forces, U.S. officials said. Other options which were to be discussed included keeping the status quo of some 8,400 U.S. troops, a modest hike, or a small reduction that would focus on counter-terrorism operations enhanced by drone strikes and intelligence-gathering, they said. A U.S. official said that during a trip to Afghanistan earlier this year, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that the United States would have a sustained commitment to Afghanistan. More than 15 years since the United States invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Islamist Taliban government for giving al Qaeda a sanctuary where it plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, there is no sign to an end in fighting. U.S. intelligence agencies assessed in May that the conditions in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year, even with a modest increase in military assistance from America and its allies.  Senator Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican and advocate of a stronger U.S. role in Afghanistan, urged Trump in a statement to listen to his generals. At the end of the day, Afghanistan is about American homeland security - not building empires. The Camp David discussions have also been complicated by differences over taking a harder line on Pakistan for failing to close Afghan Taliban sanctuaries and arrest Afghan extremist leaders. U.S. officials say the Afghan Taliban are supported by elements of Pakistans military and top intelligence agency, a charge Islamabad denies. Under one proposal, the United States would begin a review of whether to designate Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism unless it pursues senior leaders of the Afghan Taliban and the allied Haqqani network, considered the most lethal Afghan extremist group, U.S. officials said. Such a designation would trigger harsh U.S. sanctions, including a ban on arms sales and an end to U.S. economic assistance. Finalizing a regional security strategy has been held up by Trumps frustration with a lack of options for defeating the Taliban and ending the longest foreign conflict in U.S. history. At the meeting in mid-July, Trump said Mattis and Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, should consider firing Army General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, for not winning the war.   The delay for a decision left an opening for Erik Prince, the founder of the former Blackwater military contracting firm and the brother of Trumps education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to propose replacing U.S. forces in Afghanistan with mercenaries. The plan made its way into the White House, according to a senior administration official. There is no indication, however, that the proposal  promoted by Prince in media interviews  garnered serious attention and it was not among the options prepared for consideration at Camp David, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. McMaster, Mattis, Dunford and retired Marine General John Kelly, the presidents chief of staff, are opposed to this plan, according to U.S. officials. It was not known whether Princes proposal was brought up at the meeting. With Afghan security forces struggling to prevent Taliban advances and the countrys political leadership all but paralyzed by infighting, Nicholson in February requested thousands of additional U.S. troops to bolster U.S. military trainers, advisers and special forces. U.S. military and intelligence officials are concerned that a Taliban victory would allow al Qaeda and Islamic States regional affiliate to establish bases in Afghanistan from which to plot attacks against the United States and its allies.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn ended his role as a special adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday after facing criticism that policy recommendations he offered could help his own investments. Some Democratic lawmakers and biofuels advocates argued that Icahns guidance to the Republican administration created a conflict of interest with his businesses, including oil refining company CVR Energy Inc. Icahn has denied any conflict of interest. Icahns departure followed a flurry of changes at the White House. Trump on Friday fired his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, two days after disbanding two high-profile business advisory groups. I chose to end this arrangement (with your blessing) because I did not want partisan bickering about my role to in any way cloud your administration, Icahn wrote in a letter to Trump released on his website. The White House declined to comment. A call to Icahns office was not immediately returned. The activist investor, who leads Icahn Enterprises LP, was an early and close ally of Trump who was often praised by the Republican for his business acumen. One of Icahns first tasks was to vet the future Securities and Exchange Commission chairman and a number of candidates met with the octogenarian investor in his Fifth Avenue office just a few blocks north of Trump Tower in Manhattan. While Icahn stopped managing money for clients years ago, he still has large stakes in companies like Herbalife Ltd , CVR and American International Group Inc , which have faced regulatory issues.     Icahn was so sure Trumps election last year would give a boost to stocks that he left the campaigns victory party to make a $1 billion bet on the market, he told Reuters last year. The day after the election, stocks leapt. In his letter to Trump, Icahn downplayed his role as an adviser on regulatory matters, saying I never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position. Trump, who came to office promising to roll back regulation, reform the tax code and boost infrastructure spending, never put Icahn on the payroll. But Icahns involvement was considerable. He interviewed Scott Pruitt, now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the very agency that would determine regulations about requiring refiners to blend biofuels. His web of financial interests became a lightning rod. If he was not willing to admit he was a de facto special government employee, and follow the rules, then he had no place serving in government, said Norman Eisen, co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former President Barack Obama. His short tenure, marred by serious conflicts allegations, was yet another black eye for an administration that has become notorious for violations of ethics and the rule of law. Icahn has been one of the loudest critics of the federal biofuels program, and he was working at price-crushing reforms of the program at the same time he was betting that credits at the center of the program would fall. Biofuels regulations require refiners either to blend biofuels into gasoline or - in the case of companies like CVR that have no blending facilities - to buy credits from competitors. The regulation, the Renewable Fuel Standard, also allows companies to delay those credit purchases by a year. As an adviser to Trump, Icahn urged the president in February to alter the policy to lift the blending burden from refiners. Yet environmental regulators are preparing to formally reject that proposal, sources told Reuters. Investors have built up a large short position in CVR in the past three months, according to Reuters data, as evidence mounts that the companys gamble on the biofuels market is going sour.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday fired his chief strategist Stephen Bannon, a right-wing political activist credited with driving parts of the Trump policy agenda, with mixed results. Bannon was a top Trump administration critic of the international Paris Climate Agreement, along with Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. They helped persuade Trump to announce in June that the United States would withdraw from the pact struck in 2015 by nearly 200 countries. Trumps daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who were not fans of Bannon, wanted Washington to stay in the pact. Bannon also opposed government support of green energy, which he called madness and a carbon tax on fossil fuels. Bannon was a driving force behind Trumps travel ban. It   barred U.S. entry by people from several Muslim-majority countries. The ban was announced by Trump, but poorly implemented. It immediately caused nationwide protests and confusion and was challenged in the courts, where it is still tied up, making it so far a partial win for Bannon. Bannon opposed an April military strike ordered by Trump against a Syrian air base in response to what the Trump administration and U.S. allies say was a poison gas attack by Syrias military in which scores of civilians, including many children, died. Trump has since touted his decision to carry out the strike as a bold one in contrast to former President Barack Obama. In line with Bannons position, Trump initially threatened to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement. But then the president backtracked and said he was willing to renegotiate the trade pact with Canada and Mexico. Bannon has long been skeptical of international alliances. Trump alarmed U.S. allies on the campaign trail by calling the NATO security alliance obsolete and berating Washingtons western allies for not paying enough for their defense. After massive pressure from the pragmatist wing of Trumps National Security Council, Trump eventually underscored U.S. commitment to Article 5, a crucial part of the NATO treaty, the mutual defense doctrine. The White House has been mired in a months-long debate over a strategy for South Asia, including Afghanistan. One of the divisions was between Bannon, who favored a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Washingtons longest foreign conflict, versus national security adviser H.R. McMaster and most of the military brass who support a modest troop increase. Trump met with his National Security Team on Friday to try to reach agreement on a strategy for Afghanistan, but made no decision on whether he would commit more troops. Bannon has been a China hawk, urging a tougher line on trade toward Beijing and dismissive of efforts to get Chinas help in reining in North Korea. In an interview with The American Prospect magazine published on Wednesday, Bannon said the United States was in an economic war with China and ridiculed suggestions of a military solution to the North Korea issue. Bannon supported a border adjustment tax, part of a tax reform package drawn up by senior Republicans in the House of Representatives. The BAT was meant to encourage exports, discourage imports and raise tax revenue. But it divided the business community because it would have raised consumer prices. House Republicans recently dropped the BAT from their proposal, a defeat for Bannon, although he was not a central player in tax policy. Bannon also pushed for tax cuts for the middle class, still not yet delivered.  A major 2016 Trump campaign promise was to build a wall on the Mexican border, a position supported by Bannon. Trumps vow that Mexico would pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do, has strained relations between the two neighbors. Work on the wall has not begun.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The departure on Friday of Steve Bannon, the White Houses top economic nationalist, will likely tip the trade policy scales in favor of the Trump administrations globalist faction, which could soften the stance toward two of Trumps favorite targets: China and the North American Free Trade Agreement. But after news that Trump had fired Bannon from his post as chief strategist, trade experts said it may take some time for National Economic Council Chairman Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to start winning more debates on trade policy. Bannon and White House Trade and Manufacturing Office director Peter Navarro were often allied in taking hardline anti-China stances over currency manipulation, steel tariffs and other trade issues, often opposed to Cohn, Mnuchin and Perdue, according to lobbyists who been involved in the debates. The Cohn-led group proved more influential in the administrations decisions in April not to label China a currency manipulator and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement instead of terminating it.  More recently, they have pushed for a delay in a decision on the imposition of broad steel tariffs.     With Bannon gone, theres not a replacement for that voice in internal debates, said a senior administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. Without Steve constantly pushing back on every policy idea coming from the so called globalists, its easy to see how they could have a chance to start winning more policy battles, the official said. In the short term, the trade policy trajectory wont change much, said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business conservative think tank in Washington. Many of Trumps views on trade pre-dated Bannons arrival on his campaign in any case. The U.S. Trade Representatives office announced on Friday that it will proceed with a planned investigation into whether China is misappropriating U.S. technology and intellectual property through unreasonable investment rules. Scissors said Bannons departure will show in what decisions the administration makes following a year-long study of the issue.   Its about the final choices on do we go forward with these very difficult sanctions on the Chinese or do we look to make a tradeoff on a security issue, and Bannon would have been in the first camp, Scissors said. The struggle for influence in Trumps White House has been something of a battle between the finance guys and the economic nationalists, and the most important economic nationalist just left, Scissors added. The offices of USTR Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who have been pushing for stronger trade policies to reduce U.S. trade deficits with China, Mexico and other countries, declined to comment on Bannons departure, referring policy questions to the White House. But industry lobbyists, who have been whipsawed by economic policy twists over trade and an ill-fated border tax proposal, were skeptical that much would change.  Two lobbyists on the sidelines of NAFTA talks in Washington said that even without Bannon, they will assume the status quo on trade policy as long as fierce China critic Navarro is in the White House. Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the administrations efforts to develop an effective strategy to retaliate against Chinas unfair trade practices will survive, largely because there is a widely held view in the administration and the corporate sector that Chinas trade practices are a problem. I doubt this effort will evaporate, though it may evolve, she said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump fired White House chief strategist and former campaign manager Steve Bannon on Friday, it was almost like bidding goodbye to a part of himself. Trumps most polarizing stances on matters such as immigration and national security closely tracked Bannons America First anti-globalist worldview. Despite their close alignment, Trump was always reluctant to credit Bannon with the stunning electoral victory of November 2016, often noting Bannon, 63, came late to the campaign, joining only after Trump had secured the Republican nomination. He rewarded Bannon, nonetheless, giving him a top job in the administration. But as the White House grew increasingly chaotic in the early months of Trumps presidency, Bannon clashed with more mainstream advisers, including, most crucially, the presidents son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump.  Trump was reportedly unhappy with the attention that Bannon got early on as the architect of Trumps campaign, and with Bannons tendency to promote himself, as he operated an almost independent power center within the West Wing.  Ultimately, Bannon wore out his welcome. Trump fired him at the urging of his new chief of staff, John Kelly, who has been working to reorganize the White House and limit access to Trump. The dismissal could have political repercussions. Bannon was viewed as the administrations conduit to Trumps rabid political base. Bannons departure may antagonize some of Trumps most passionate supporters, who fear that without Bannon, Trump will move closer to the Republican political establishment. We are extremely disappointed, Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, a conservative advocacy group, said in a statement. On specific policies, Bannon was credited with helping craft the administrations travel ban, which restricted emigration to the United States from some mostly Muslim countries, as well as Trumps opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and the Paris global climate accord. Bannon has been seen as wary of U.S. intervention abroad, arguing against sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. In recent months, Bannon has battled for influence inside the White House with Trumps national security adviser, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, a tension that was destabilizing Trumps team of top advisers, senior officials have told Reuters. Trump himself has suggested Bannons influence was overstated. While Bannon was viewed as perhaps responsible for Trumps initial response to the violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, when he blamed both sides for the confrontation, Trump said this week that he never spoke to Bannon about the matter. Bannon may return to the provocateur role he played at the right-wing Breitbart News website, where he spearheaded its shift into a forum for the alt-right, a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Under Bannons leadership, the Breitbart site presented a number of conspiracy theories about former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as Republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides. Whether he returns to Breitbart and uses it to challenge the so-called cucks and globalists he disdains - and perhaps Trump himself - will be closely watched in coming weeks. Bannon is a former U.S. Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker and Hollywood producer. Almost immediately after Bannons departure became public, Breitbart published a piece calling him the conservative spine of the administration and questioning whether Trump would now move in a more moderate direction. Another Breitbart editor, Raheem Kassam, posted a picture of Bannon on Twitter with the caption Bannon 2020, seemingly suggesting that Bannon, not Trump, should be president.

In a statement, Trump said the unit would be ranked at the level of Unified Combatant Command focused on cyberspace operations. Cyber Commands elevation reflects a push to strengthen U.S. capabilities to interfere with the military programs of adversaries such as North Koreas nuclear and missile development and Islamic States ability to recruit, inspire and direct attacks, three U.S. intelligence officials said this month, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Cyber Command had been subordinate to the U.S. Strategic Command, which is also responsible for military space operations, nuclear weapons and missile defense. Once elevated, Cyber Command would have the same status as U.S. Strategic Command and eight other unified commands that control U.s. military forces and are composed of personnel from multiple branches of the armed services.  The Pentagon did not specify how long the elevation process would take. Current and former officials said a leading candidate to head U.S. Cyber Command was Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, currently director of the Pentagons Joint Staff. Trump also said the defense secretary was also considering separating the U.S. Cyber Command from the National Security Agency (NSA). Cyber Commands mission is to shut down and, when ordered, counter cyber attacks. The NSAs role is to gather intelligence and generally favors monitoring enemies cyber activities. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both strong voices on security matters, praised the move and said it would boost the commands abilities.  Still, McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said more steps were needed to meet the nations cyber security challenges. We must develop a clear policy and strategy for deterring and responding to cyber threats. We must also develop an integrated, whole-of-government approach to protect and defend the United States from cyberattacks, he said in a statement. The new combatant command will improve U.S. capabilities to punish foreign cyberattacks and discourage attempts to disrupt critical U.S. infrastructure such as financial networks, electric grids, and medical systems. It will establish a cyber version of the nuclear doctrine of mutual assured destruction between the United States and the former Soviet Union, the three U.S. officials said The U.S. is more vulnerable to cyber intrusions than its most capable adversaries, including China, Russia, and North Korea, because its economy is more dependent on the internet, two of the officials said.

More than half of the 11 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would be central to any proceeding to remove Trump from office, have tangled with the Republican president, including on Thursday when he fired off early-morning tweets. In one Twitter series, Trump called Senator Lindsey Graham publicity seeking and said he just cant forget his election trouncing in the 2016 presidential race. Trump also assailed Senator Jeff Flake, another Republican critic, as a non-factor in the Senate, adding, Hes toxic. Flake and Graham are members of the Judiciary Committee, whose Chairman Chuck Grassley has urged Trump to tone it down. He should be 100 percent sticking to ideas and forget about personalities, Grassley said on Friday when pressed on whether Trump might find himself without the friends in Congress he would need to defend himself in an impeachment proceeding. For his part, Grassley said his views would not be colored by past presidential sniping. Lets say the House of Representatives impeached the president of the United States. Then Im a juror, Grassley said. The Senate is the jury that decides whether he should be impeached. The jury is supposed to be impartial. There is little serious talk being heard in Congress about removing Trump from office. Two House Democrats have introduced an article of impeachment alleging obstruction of justice by the president in connection with an ongoing investigation of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Moscow. But Republicans control the House, as well as the Senate, and the article of impeachment has gained little traction.  Under the U.S. Constitution, the House of Representatives can vote to approve an impeachment measure. If that happens, it goes to the Senate, which acts as a jury and weighs the charges in the House measure. A two-thirds Senate vote is needed for conviction. Approval leads to removal from office. Two presidents have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was convicted by the Senate. President Richard Nixon, facing almost certain impeachment over the Watergate scandal, resigned in 1974. In the Clinton impeachment fight, the committee was a resource for the full Senate and could play a similar role in any future trial. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Having friends would help any president facing impeachment, said Charles Brain, a White House liaison to Congress during Clintons impeachment. Without such friendships, Brain said, lawmakers can just be quiet, refusing to share information with the White House and letting attacks on the president gain momentum. Besides Flake and Graham, Trump has had run-ins over various issues before and after his election with Republican Senator Ted Cruz, and other Judiciary Committee members, including Grassley, John Cornyn, Orrin Hatch, Thom Tillis and Ben Sasse. The president has also at times attacked Republican senators not on the committee, including Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski. Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trumps campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. Grassleys committee also is looking into the matter, as are other congressional panels. The Kremlin denies any election interference. Trump has dismissed the Mueller probe as a witch hunt and denies any collusion. In the end, Mueller could end up clearing Trump and his aides of any wrongdoing.  If not, at least two questions will loom large in a possible impeachment inquiry, said senior fellow Elaine Kamarck of the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution think tank.  One would be about the severity of any possible charges. Another, she said, would be do you have friends, do you have people who believe in you and want to save your presidency?

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - President Donald Trump has faced strong criticism for his actions regarding investigations into Russias role in the 2016 U.S. election and contacts between his campaign and Moscow. Trump has denied any collusion by the campaign and has frequently expressed frustration over the investigations, in particular a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller. Critics have accused Trump of seeking to hinder the investigation. The Kremlin has denied any election interference. There is little serious talk being heard in Congress, where both the Senate and House of Representatives are controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans, of removing the president from office. However, some Democratic lawmakers have spoken of impeachment, a historically rare process in the United States that can lead to a presidents removal. The Constitutions 25th Amendment offers an alternative path to stripping a president of power but has never been used for this. Under the Constitution, the president, the vice president and other U.S. officials can be removed following impeachment and conviction for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The process starts in the House. Individual members can introduce impeachment resolutions like ordinary bills, or the House can initiate proceedings by passing a resolution authorizing an inquiry.  In modern history, the House Judiciary Committee has  overseen impeachment proceedings. A simple majority vote is needed to move an impeachment resolution, like other legislation, out of the committee. At that point, it is up to the House majority leader, currently Republican Kevin McCarthy, whether to put the measure to a vote by the full chamber, and when to hold such a vote. The full House can approve the articles of impeachment by a simple majority vote.  Impeachment is like an indictment and the Senate then tries the official. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required for conviction, which results in removal from office.  If a president is impeached and removed, the vice president takes over until the next scheduled presidential election picks the next occupant of the White House. Only two American presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was convicted by the Senate. President Richard Nixon, facing almost certain impeachment over the Watergate scandal, resigned in 1974. The 25th Amendment to the Constitution was adopted in 1967, following the 1963 assassination of President John Kennedy, to clarify various issues involving presidential and vice presidential succession and incapacity.  Under the amendments Section 4, the vice president and a majority of either Cabinet officials or such other body as Congress may by law provide may declare in writing that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.  If such a declaration is received by the Senate president pro tempore - who presides over the Senate in the absence of the vice president - and the speaker of the House, the vice president takes over as acting president. The president can resume office after informing the same two congressional leaders that no inability exists - unless the vice president and a majority of Cabinet officials or another body established by Congress tell those congressional leaders within four days of the declaration that the chief executive is unable to carry out his or her duties.  Congress then must assemble within 48 hours to decide the issue. If two-thirds of the members of the House and of the Senate vote in their respective chambers that the president is unable to discharge his or her duties, the vice president  continues as acting president until the next scheduled presidential election decides the next White House occupant. Otherwise, the president resumes office. Other sections of the 25th Amendment have come into play, such as Section 3 enabling a president to temporarily hand over power to a vice president while, for example, undergoing a medical procedure. Section 4 has never been invoked. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Presidents Advisory Council on Infrastructure, which was still being formed, will not move forward, a White House official said. The decision to drop the planned council was first reported by Bloomberg. Trump signed an executive order last month establishing the council, with members to be drawn from real estate, construction, transportation and other sectors of the economy. Trump has proposed spending $1 trillion to fix aging U.S. roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure, a major part of his legislative agenda along with healthcare and tax reform. On Wednesday, Trump disbanded two high-profile advisory groups after several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists. Trump said he dissolved the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum rather than putting pressure on its members, although both groups were preparing to disband on their own when Trump made his announcement on Twitter. The snubs from chief executives raised questions about Trumps ability to marshal the business community behind his policy goals. A Wall Street analyst, Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said that because the infrastructure panel had yet to get off the ground, its demise was less important than the scrapping of the other two groups.

The finance committee and Senate are also controlled by Republicans.  Foxconn, an electronics manufacturer formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), hopes to open a $10 billion plant in 2020 at a 1,000-acre site in southeastern Wisconsin. Foxconn is a major supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for its iPhones. We are ready to take advantage of this historic opportunity ... and build a long-lasting relationship with Foxconn, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a Republican who helped negotiate the deal, said in a statement. Walker ordered the legislature into special session on Aug. 1 to consider the incentives package, which would award Foxconn $3 billion over 15 years in mostly cash incentives. Foxconn, Walker, President Donald Trump and other leaders announced the deal on the incentives last month in a White House ceremony. The 20-million-square-foot LCD plant would initially employ 3,000 people, but Walker and Foxconn said the company could ultimately employ 13,000 at the site.

(Reuters) - Puerto Ricos bankruptcy, aimed at restructuring $72 billion of debt, violates the U.S. Constitution and should be dismissed, the Aurelius Capital Management hedge fund said in a court filing on Monday. The U.S. commonwealths federally appointed oversight board initiated its debt-cutting proceeding in May under a law known as PROMESA. Puerto Rico is barred from traditional municipal bankruptcy protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. code. Affiliates of Aurelius argued in court papers that the creation of the oversight board violated the U.S. Constitutions Appointments Clause. Aurelius said board members answer only to the U.S. president, yet their appointments were never confirmed by the Senate. Six of seven members were essentially hand-picked by Congress, violating the principle of the separation of powers, the hedge fund said. The fund, known for its years-long battle with Argentina over its defaulted debt, seeks to bar the oversight board from operating until it has been validly constituted.  Aurelius holds roughly $468 million worth of debt guaranteed by Puerto Ricos constitution. The hedge fund, run by Mark Brodsky, is known for buying distressed debt and pursuing aggressive litigation tactics to boost recoveries. In the Argentina case, the fund participated in numerous legal actions, including an unsuccessful attempt to attach Argentine pension and retirement funds located in U.S. banks. The firm was one of many parties that settled with Argentina in 2016. Creditors were among those who lobbied most aggressively for the appointment of a board in Puerto Rico, believing it would support investor-friendly policies. But the board has lost allies in the creditor community after it sought to impose severe losses on creditors even as it has also pushed Puerto Rico to impose austerity measures. Puerto Rico, with $72 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and near-insolvent public health and pension systems, filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history in May. It was the board that technically filed the bankruptcy, under the 2016 Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA.

U.S. Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch sent the letters to Bayer AG, Biogen Inc, Merck KGaAs EMD Serono unit, Novartis AG, Roche Holding AG, Sanofi SA, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. The lawmakers on the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said in the letters that they were looking to determine whether drug companies were raising prices for MS drugs in lockstep with their competitors. The average annual cost of MS therapy rose to $78,000 in 2016 from $16,000 in 2004, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Drugmakers have faced a global pushback from regulators and lawmakers about high prices.  President Donald Trump has said the companies are getting away with murder and has pledged to lower the cost of prescription drugs. He met with Representative Cummings to discuss the issue in March. Previous congressional investigations and hearings into drug pricing practices have had far-reaching effects. Mylan NV sharply reduced the cost of EpiPen after the Oversight Committee began looking into the increases that drove the list price of the life saving allergy treatment to around $600 a pair.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and Turing Pharmaceuticals have also faced congressional pressure over high prices. Roche said it plans to work with the lawmakers to address their questions, and said the industry needs to reverse the trend of sharp increases in MS drug prices. It said its treatment Ocrevus is priced around 20 percent below the current average cost of treatment and does not plan to aggressively raise its price. A Bayer spokeswoman said the company had received the letter and planned to reply directly to the congress members. Novartis said it was reviewing the letter to determine how to address the request.

Gary intends to remain in his position as NEC (National Economic Council) director at the White House. Nothings changed, a White House official said. Wall Street investors were also concerned that U.S. President Donald Trumps refusal to back down from his initial reaction to the demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, would damage the prospects for his economic agenda, including tax reform.  Key U.S. equity indexes were down between 0.6 percent and 1 percent, while the dollar was a touch higher but well off the days peaks before the Cohn speculation. Gary is focused on his responsibilities, the White House official said, declining to comment on whether the president and Cohn had spoken about Cohns reaction to what happened this week.     Cohns decision to remain comes amid mounting speculation that some top officials may be looking for an exit strategy in the wake of growing backlash to Trumps response to Saturdays violence in Charlottesville.  Trump said on Tuesday the anti-racist demonstrators were as responsible for the violence as the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests. Those remarks sparked rebukes from fellow Republicans, top corporate executives and some close allies even as some supporters, including the vice president, stood by the president.  The fallout also led to the disbanding of two CEO advisory panels as a growing number of chief executives from some of the nations largest companies resigned this week in protest of the presidents response. Other corporate executives not on the presidential councils also issued strong statements denouncing racism and bigotry. Cohn, who left his top job at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to take on the White House position, has served as the administrations point man on tax reform, infrastructure and other priorities. His departure would be seen as a setback to those plans.  Trumps increasingly combative relationship with Congress, exacerbated by his latest tweets targeting senators in his own party, could further restrain any progress on those reforms even as Republicans control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. One Wall Street executive, who asked not to be named, noted that Cohn serves as a moderating influence, in a White House often seen as divided among various camps. Steve Bannon, a White House senior adviser with close ties to far-right groups, said in an interview published Wednesday that he constantly butts heads with Cohn over issues such as trade with China. Thats a fight I fight every day here, Bannon told the American Prospect, a liberal-leaning political magazine. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

A current U.S. official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump could make a decision as early as Friday. The official added that the timeline could be pushed back if the White House was dealing with more pressing issues.  The Pentagon and White House declined to comment.  Two former senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the plan said that the proposal awaiting Trumps approval would elevate Cyber Command and lead to a 60-day study to determine whether Cyber Command would be separated from the National Security Agency, a spy agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping. That would lead to Cyber Command becoming what the military called a unified command, equal to combat branches of the military such as the Central and Pacific Commands. It would give Cyber Command leaders a larger voice in arguing for the use of both offensive and defensive cyber tools in future conflicts. Currently, the NSA and Cyber Command organizations are based at Fort Meade, Maryland, about 30 miles north of Washington, and led by the same officer, Navy Admiral Michael Rogers. NSAs focus is gathering intelligence, officials said, often favoring the monitoring of an enemys cyber activities. Cyber Commands mission is geared more to shutting down cyber attacks and, if ordered, counter attacking. The NSA director has been a senior military officer since the agencys founding in 1952. Under the plan, future directors would be civilians, an arrangement meant to underscore that NSA is not subordinate to Cyber Command. Established in 2010, Cyber Command is now subordinate to the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees military space operations, nuclear weapons and missile defense.

I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans, Cook wrote in a note late on Wednesday to employees, according to technology news website Recode.   Cook also said in the letter that Apple will donate $1 million a piece to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League and will match two-for-one their donations to the organizations and other human rights groups until Sept. 30.  Regardless of your political views, we must all stand together on this one point  that we are all equal. As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect, Cook wrote. Cooks letter came hours after Trump disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils as several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists that left a 32-year-old woman dead.      The events of the past several days have been deeply troubling for me, and Ive heard from many people at Apple who are saddened, outraged or confused, Cook said.  What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country. Hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. Its scars last generations. History has taught us this time and time again, both in the United States and countries around the world, Cook added.          Earlier on Wednesday, the company was disabling Apple Pay on several websites that sell attire and items in support of white nationalists and hate groups, several tech news websites reported.

A parade of prominent Republicans also rebuked Trump, as well as U.S. ally Britain, leaving him increasingly isolated after his comments on Tuesday about the bloodshed in the college town of Charlottesville further enveloped his seven-month-old presidency in controversy.  The mayor of Phoenix asked Trump to delay a rally planned for next Tuesday, an appeal the president appeared to reject. A memorial service was held on Wednesday in Charlottesville for 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed when a car plowed into anti-racism protesters on Saturday. A 20-year-old Ohio man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies has been charged with her murder. Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, was elected president in November touting his experience in the business world and ability to strike deals. However, some of the Republican presidents actions and words have alienated many corporate leaders. He said he would dissolve the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum after eight executives, including Campbell Soup Co CEO Denise Morrison and 3M Co CEO Inge Thulin, quit the panels.  Both councils were moving to disband on their own when Trump made his announcement on Twitter. Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both, he wrote. The Strategic and Policy Forum was headed by Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, a close ally of Trump in the business world. Schwarzman organized a call on Wednesday for member executives to voice concerns after Trumps comments, and an overwhelming majority backed disbanding the council, two sources said. Schwarzman then called Trump to tell him about the decision to disband. Campbell Soup Cos Morrison said: Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville. JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon, a member of one of the panels, said in a statement that fanning divisiveness is not the answer. Dow Chemical Co Chief Executive Andrew Liveris, who headed the manufacturing council, said he told the White House on Wednesday that in the current environment it was no longer possible to conduct productive discussions. The Strategic and Policy Forum was intended to advise Trump on how government policy impacts economic growth, job creation and productivity. The manufacturing council was designed to promote U.S. job growth. Along with the snubs from business leaders, Trump was rebuked by a string of Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Ohio Governor John Kasich, Senator Lindsey Graham and former U.S. Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Trump needs the support of fellow Republicans as he tries to push his policy agenda, including tax cuts, through a Congress that is controlled by the Republicans. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, said Trump would enflame emotions and further divide our nation if he used next weeks rally to pardon Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff who was found guilty last month of criminal contempt of court. Arpaio gained a national profile due to his harsh treatment of inmates and outspoken opposition to illegal immigration. Shortly after Stantons statement, Trump urged supporters on Twitter to attend the Phoenix rally. Few public figures have voiced support for Trump over his response to the violence. Vice President Mike Pence, who is cutting short a trip to Latin America, told reporters in Chile that I stand with the president and I stand by those words. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke praised Trumps honesty and courage, while Richard Spencer, head of a white nationalist group, lauded the president for speaking the truth. U.S. stocks ended slightly firmer but off the days highs as investors worried that the backlash to Trumps remarks could stunt his ability to deliver on pro-business promises. A former senior Trump administration official raised the prospect that some White House officials could quit because of Trumps comments. The demise of the councils raised Wall Street speculation that senior administration figures, such as White House economic adviser Gary Cohn or U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, might step down to avoid being tarnished by association with Trump. Cohn, Mnuchin and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao stood awkwardly by Trump during his remarks at Trump Tower on Tuesday. Hes worried about his reputation being trashed, which is much more valuable to him than anything else, the former administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of Cohn. McConnell, who drew Trumps ire last week over the Senates failure to pass healthcare legislation, issued a statement saying messages of hate and bigotry from white supremacists should not be welcome in the United States. McConnells statement did not mention Trump by name. The Republican Jewish Coalition, a group whose board includes big party donors including casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, called on Trump to provide greater moral clarity in rejecting racism, bigotry and antisemitism. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there is simply no place in American public discourse for the hate and violence displayed in Charlottesville. He spoke before a meeting with Canadas foreign minister. Trumps remarks on Tuesday were a more vehement reprisal of his initial response to the bloodshed. He said at a heated news conference in New York there is blame on both sides for the violence, and that there were very fine people on both sides. In London, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered a rare rebuke of a U.S. president from so close an ally. I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them and I think it is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far-right views wherever we hear them, May told reporters.  Politicians in Germany, which has tough laws against hate speech and any symbols linked to the Nazis, who murdered six million Jews in the Holocaust during World War Two, expressed shock at the images of people in Charlottesville carrying swastikas and chanting anti-Jewish slurs. Germanys justice minister accused Trump of trivializing anti-Semitism and racism. Senior American military officers usually stay clear of politics but three more of the U.S. militarys top officers weighed in on Wednesday, without explicitly mentioning Trump. Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Beijing: I can absolutely and unambiguously say that there is no place, no place, for racism and bigotry in the U.S. military or in the United States as a whole. U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley wrote on Twitter: The Army doesnt tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks. Its against our Values and everything weve stood for since 1775. Air Force Chief of Staff General Dave Goldfein said on Twitter that I stand with my fellow service chiefs in saying were always stronger together.  Their comments followed similar ones from the top officers of the Navy and Marine Corps. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The move came after more corporate chief executives who had been members of the panels said they would no longer serve on them. JOHN DOYLE, DIRECTOR OF MARKETS, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: This calls into question the ability of the Trump administration to get anything done in terms of tax and infrastructure reforms. Its another piece of evidence of the administrations mounting problems. BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: Guys have been resigning from that council for a couple of days now. It doesnt appear to me thats the cause. Disbanding the CEO council wont diminish the Presidents ability to find out what the CEOs think.  He said the move was all about anticipation of the Fed minutes: Theres tension. Janet Yellen says theres inflation. Its just that we cant see it right now because transitory causes are keeping it down. That has been her public commentary. What the minutes are going to reveal is if theres consensus in the committee thats true. We have to watch the minutes to see if theres inflation and if they have to start heading it off. ANDREW FRANKEL, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York The market should definitely care about Trump and these industry defections, and yet every day I come to trade, the overall tape appears averse to what goes on in DC and all its negativity. STEVEN CHIAVARONE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FEDERATED INVESTORS, NEW YORK: Our view is that the market rally has been driven by earnings and nothing to do with Washington, which is why the market has been as patient as it has. The question becomes does any of this impact earnings. In of itself, no. You are still going to have a Congress that doesnt want to walk into the 2018 midterms with nothing to show or else they will get slaughtered, so there is still a chance for fiscal reform. But whether we get to policy discussion is now a fair question.  As an American you can have all kinds of feelings about what the president has and has not said, but as a market participant we arent pulling in the horns here. If you get to the point where we see Republican members of Congress actively talking about impeachment, then that changes. Were not there yet but we could be. DAVID SCHIEGOLEIT, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENTS, U.S. BANK PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: The market movement seemed to be dovetailing with things hitting the wire out of Washington. It looks like CEOs are resigning from these councils, and the White House is trying to do some damage control. That throws a little bit more doubt into the presidents abilities to push his policies through. WALTER TODD, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT GREENWOOD CAPITAL ASSOCIATES IN GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA: I dont see any other news that would account for what were seeing. Theres no denying that the policy risk has increased with the last 24 to 48 hours. You have got tax reform, we need to pass the budget and debt ceiling increase in next 45 days or so. This was already a very difficult environment to get stuff done; this has made it more so. Its a distraction from pursuing meaningful legislation and things that could help the economy. MARY ANN HURLEY, VICE PRESIDENT IN FIXED INCOME TRADING, D.A. DAVIDSON, SEATTLE: I think its due to all of this turmoil going on in the White House. The manufacturing council has been disbanded, or everybody has quit, depending on whose version you want to believe.  Mike Pence is coming back from an overseas trip early. The White House just seems to be in chaos and Trump is losing support right and left from Republicans and Democrats alike and his one core area, the business community, are all abandoning him, too, which certainly calls into question the ability to get anything accomplished whatsoever in this term unless he takes actions to right the ship. I think its (the rise in Treasury prices) a flight-to- quality bid.  ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, WUNDERLICH SECURITIES, NEW YORK It is not corporate CEOs distancing themselves (from the President) what will have economic impact, it will be Congress distancing itself. We should tie this to the difficulty to get legislation passed. Im surprised the (stock) market is up at all, on a combination of terrible communication and an administration that is working us into a constitutional crisis at the very worst, and, at the very least, one that is going to be ineffective in legislating anything in the near term that would be beneficial to the economy. Were not going to have stimulative. Pro-business legislation getting passed with a President who continues to distance himself from his party. BLAKE GWINN, U.S. RATES STRATEGIST, NATWEST MARKETS, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: He was election partly because he is a business-friendly president. This is the flip side. Its a move away from that. The disbanding of these groups doesnt mean all that much, but the market is looking at it as not a business-friendly move. KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: Right now it seems like (the dollars slide) is coinciding with Trumps announcement that hes disbanding the council, another hit to administration, weighing on market sentiment and leading investors to sell more dollars because dollar has had a very difficult time extending gains ahead of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee). The timing seems to indicate this is the primary driver.

A 20-year-old Ohio man said to have harboured Nazi sympathies has been charged with her murder. Trumps remarks were praised by white supremacists like David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, who applauded the presidents honesty and courage.

Social media networks Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and LinkedIn, music service Spotify Ltd and security firm Cloudflare Inc were among the companies cutting off services to hate groups or removing material that they said spread hate.  Earlier in the week, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) also took steps to block hate groups. The wave of internet crackdowns against white nationalists and neo-Nazis reflected a rapidly changing mindset among Silicon Valley firms on how far they are willing to go to police hate speech. Tech companies have taken down violent propaganda from Islamic State and other militant groups, in part in response to government pressure. But most internet companies have traditionally tried to steer clear of making judgments about content except in cases of illegal activity.  Cloudflare, which protects some 6 million websites from denial-of-service attacks and hacking, on Wednesday afternoon dropped coverage of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer. I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the internet, Cloudflare founder and Chief Executive Matthew Prince said in an email to employees. Cloudflare is well-known for defending even the most distasteful websites, and services like it are essential to the functioning of websites. Daily Stormer helped organize the weekend rally in Charlottesville where a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 people were injured when a man plowed a car into a crowd protesting the white nationalist gathering.  Daily Stormer has been accessible only intermittently the past few days after domain providers GoDaddy and Google Domains, a unit of Alphabet, said they would not serve the website.  By Wednesday, Daily Stormer had moved to a Russia-based internet domain, with an address ending in .ru. Later in the day, though, the site was no longer accessible at that address.  Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin said on a social network used by many of his supporters, Gab, that his site would be back soon.  The Cloudflare betrayal adds another layer of super complexity. But we got this, he said. He could not immediately be reached for further comment.  Prince, the Cloudflare chief executive, said in an interview that despite his decision he was conflicted, because it could become harder to resist pressure from governments to censor. You dont have to play this game too many moves out to see how risky this is going to be, Prince said. What about this site? What about this site? Only the biggest companies will be able to navigate the varying laws in different countries, he added. Weve lost a lot of the fight for a free and open internet. Twitter on Wednesday suspended accounts linked to Daily Stormer. The company said it would not discuss individual accounts, but at least three affiliated with the Daily Stormer led to pages saying account suspended.  The social network prohibits violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct and will take action on accounts violating those policies, the company said in a statement.  Larger rival Facebook Inc (FB.O), which unlike Twitter explicitly prohibits hate speech, has taken down several pages from Facebook and Instagram in recent days that it said were associated with hate speech or hate organizations. It also took down the event page that was used to promote and organize the Unite the Right rally. With the potential for more rallies, were watching the situation closely and will take down threats of physical harm, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday.      Facebook also said it had removed accounts belonging to Chris Cantwell, a web commentator who has described himself as a white nationalist and said on his site that he had attended the Charlottesville rally. Cantwells YouTube account also appeared to have been terminated. Cantwell could not immediately be reached for comment. LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft Corp MSFT.N, suspended a page devoted to Daily Stormer and another page belonging to a man associated with the site, Andrew Auernheimer. LinkedIn declined to comment.  Reddit this week eliminated one of its discussion communities that supported the Unite the Right rally, saying that the company would ban users who incite violence. The company says it has more than 250 million users.  Spotify, based in Sweden, said it was in the process of removing musical acts from its streaming service that had been flagged as racist hate bands by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us, the company said in a statement, adding that record companies should also be held responsible.

Trump disbanded two high-profile advisory groups on Wednesday, after the head of his Strategic and Policy Forum advised the White House the group was breaking up, and a trickle of departures from his American Manufacturing Council threatened to become a mass exodus. He was at 95 percent already, a source close to Larry Fink, head of investment firm BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), said of Finks leaning toward resigning from the Strategic and Policy Forum.  I think that (Trumps latest comments) just made it 120 percent.  A number of CEOs started to consider more seriously whether to disband after Trumps initial remarks blaming violence at Saturdays white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on many sides, which was taken to include not only white nationalists but also anti-racism activists who opposed them. Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) CEO Kenneth Frazier, an African-American, was the first to leave the manufacturing council on Monday over Trumps weekend reaction.   Trump then attacked Frazier on Twitter, prompting other CEOs to consider quitting also. Fraziers resignation was followed by the CEOs of Under Armour Inc (UAA.N) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) later on Monday. Trumps fiery comments on Tuesday, doubling down on his initial response to the Virginia rally, unnerved CEOs already doubting the utility and public relations value of remaining on Trumps councils, sources close to several of the CEOs told Reuters.  Soon after Trumps comments on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon, who serves on the Strategic and Policy Forum, started pushing for the forum to take some kind of action, a person close to him said. Dimon had previously expressed exasperation with politics in Washington, saying in July that it is almost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world. Sensing a breakdown in the group, Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of money manager Blackstone Group (BX.N) and chairman of the Strategic and Policy Forum, convened a call on Wednesday for its members. After some debate, the momentum was such that there wasnt much room for dissent, said one source familiar with the discussion.  The decision to disband was agreed and Schwarzman called the White House to inform the president, the source said. Shortly after, Trump tweeted that he was disbanding the two groups.  The leader of the manufacturing council, Dow Chemical Co DOW.N CEO Andrew Liveris, had planned a call with remaining members to try to salvage the group on Wednesday, according to an email seen by Reuters. The call never took place, superseded by Trumps dissolution of the group.     Sources familiar with the discussions of the boards of Merck and Intel said that they backed their CEOs decisions to leave because they did not believe stepping down from Trumps councils would have a negative impact on their businesses.  I dont think these are personal decisions, said Blain Rethmeier, a Republican strategist who worked on the Trump transition and consults with companies in California. I think these are made through the eyes of whats in the best interest of the company, and the brand risks of what it means to be involved with the council became too much.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps turnabout on the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia has rocked his administration, leading to rising speculation that some top officials may be looking for a way out.  A parade of business executives broke ties with Trump on Wednesday, a day after he blamed white nationalists and counter-protesters in equal measure for the weekend clashes that left one woman dead. Now, frustrated aides could be next. Trumps remarks have left some wondering if sticking by the president comes at too high a cost to their reputations.  A lot of us joined this administration thinking we could bring to it the experience and expertise that the president didnt have an opportunity to gain in his business career, and to encourage some restraint in what he says publicly and to our allies, said one senior official who is contemplating whether to resign.  After yesterday, its clear that there is no way for anyone, even a Marine general, to restrain his (Trumps) impulses or counter what he sees on TV and reads on the web. It was hoped that retired General John Kelly, Trumps new chief of staff, could impose some form of discipline on Trump that his predecessor, Reince Priebus, could not.  But Kelly stood with his eyes fixed on the floor when Trump veered off-script at his Manhattan office tower on Tuesday. The president accused the protesters, who rallied against neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, of being very, very violent.  In the uproar that followed, chief executives at companies such as Merck & Co Inc , Under Armour Inc , Intel Corp , Campbell Soup Co  and 3M Co  quit advisory councils to the White House. Trump then dissolved the councils.  The exodus of executives sparked talk that Gary Cohn, Trumps top White House economic adviser and a key liaison to the U.S. business community, might resign in protest as well.  Cohn, who is Jewish, was upset by Trumps remarks, though he is remaining with the administration for now, sources said. Cohn, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, stood by Trump during his remarks at Trump Tower on Tuesday. Cohn in particular looked self-conscious and uncomfortable. He just did not want to be in that position ... and he was not good at hiding his body language for that, said a former administration official who knows Cohn.  Cohn did not comment on the presidents language.  David Shulkin, U.S. secretary of Veterans Affairs, told reporters on Wednesday that as a Jewish American, he was outraged by neo-Nazis and other white supremacist groups and felt obligated to speak out against them.  I am not going to condone in any way the behavior of Nazis. I believe this clearly cannot be tolerated, Shulkin said when asked about whether it was appropriate to compare the actions of the white nationalists to the protesters opposing them. Shulkin, however, defended Trumps approach. I think hes been clear that this is totally unacceptable, Shulkin said.  Cohn, who came to the White House from a successful career  at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, is mindful the effect his Trump tenure could have on his professional reputation. Hes worried about his reputation being trashed, which is much more valuable to him than anything else, the former administration official said. Cohn has served as a point man on top White House priorities such as tax reform and rebuilding the nations infrastructure, but both of those efforts have been muddled by Trumps increasingly combative relationship with Congress, one that was strained even further by his comments on Charlottesville. Cohns departure would further set back those efforts and perhaps give the upper hand in the White House to a group of advisers seeking to scale back foreign trade, said a Wall Street executive who asked not to be named.  Gary knows hes a moderating influence, the executive said. It may give you short-term satisfaction to see Gary go, but it may be bad for the country in the long term. The calculation is: What do you think is best for the country versus whats best for Gary? Steve Bannon, a White House senior adviser with close ties to far-right groups, told the American Prospect in an interview published Wednesday that he constantly butts heads with Cohn over issues such as trade with China. Thats a fight I fight every day here, Bannon said.  Cowan and Company, a financial services firm, said on Wednesday that the departure of the pragmatic and business-friendly Cohn could adversely affect markets.  For us, the biggest question is what is the tipping point that would cause National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to quit? the firm wrote.  Trump thinks highly of Cohn and has spoken often of the financial sacrifices he made to leave Goldman to join the administration. He is widely considered to be a leading candidate to chair the U.S. Federal Reserve should Trump choose not to retain Janet Yellen. That decision would insulate Cohn from the day-to-day drama of the Trump White House, but likely is months away.  In the meantime, Cohn has to decide whether he can stick it out. Another Wall Street executive told Reuters that Trumps remarks may prove to be too much for him.  Until yesterday, Cohn did a great job insulating himself from Trump and staying in the economic lane. But all of a sudden he was standing behind him when he goes off on a rampage and the true price of working for him comes home, the executive said. What can you do?

Were at economic war with China, Steve Bannon told U.S. news site prospect.org in an interview published in Wednesday. Its in all their literature. Theyre not shy about saying what theyre doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years and its gonna be them if we go down this path, he was quoted as saying. If we continue to lose it, were five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which well never be able to recover. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had seen the report, and reiterated the essence of the China-U.S. trade relationship is mutually beneficial.  In reality, China and the United States long term cooperation has brought about real benefits for both countries peoples, any unbiased person will clearly see this fact, she told a daily news briefing in Beijing.  We have also said before, a trade war has no future. A trade war does not serve the interests of any party, as fighting a trade war will not produce a winner. We hope that relevant parties can stop viewing issues of the 21st century with a 19th- or 20th-century mentality. Bannon said the United States would use Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from U.S. corporations doing business in China and follow up with complaints against steel and aluminum dumping, according to prospect.org. On Monday, Trump authorized an inquiry into Chinas alleged theft of intellectual property in the first direct trade measure by his administration against Beijing. Were going to run the tables on these guys. Weve come to the conclusion that theyre in an economic war and theyre crushing us, said Bannon, who acknowledged he was battling trade doves within the U.S. administration. He said there was no reason to go soft on China in order to get Beijings support over North Korea because he believed China would do little more to rein in Pyongyang. Bannon said he might consider a deal in which China got North Korea to freeze its nuclear build-up with verifiable inspections and the United States removed its troops from the Korean peninsula, but such a deal seemed remote, prospect.org reported. In contrast to Trumps threat of fire and fury against North Korea, Bannon said: Theres no military solution, forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul dont die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I dont know what youre talking about ... Asked about any connection between his economic nationalism and white nationalism in the United States, and in particular the racist violence in Charlottesville, Bannon said: Ethno-nationalism  its losers. Its a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more. These guys are a collection of clowns. However, Bannon, who formerly led the right-wing website Breitbart, said focusing on race would help the Republicans politically. The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In a combative news conference, Trump backed off from his Monday statements explicitly denouncing the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists for the violence that erupted at a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, and reverted to his weekend contention that many sides were to blame. You had a group on one side that was bad, Trump said on Tuesday. And you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that. But Ill say it right now.  Trump later said, I think there is blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it, adding that there were very fine people on both sides. At the weekend rally against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the U.S. Civil War, many participants were seen carrying firearms, sticks, shields, and lit torches. Some wore helmets. Counter-protesters came equipped with sticks, helmets and shields. James Fields, a 20-year-old Ohio man who is said to have harbored Nazi sympathies, was charged with murder after the car he was driving plowed into a crowd of counter protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer on Saturday and injuring 19. A memorial service for Heyer is planned in Charlottesville on Wednesday. Trumps remarks drew swift criticism from many Republican leaders. No, not the same, former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney wrote on Twitter. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes.  U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who vied with Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, also responded in a series of Twitter posts. The organizers of events which inspired and led to #charlottesvilleterroristattack are 100 percent to blame for a number of reasons, Rubio began. Mr. President, you cant allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of the blame. They support idea which cost nation and world so much pain  the #WhiteSupremacy groups will see being assigned only 50 percent of the blame as a win, Rubio added. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke applauded Trump for his honesty & courage on Twitter. Richard Spencer, the head of a white nationalist group, wrote on Twitter that he was proud of him for speaking the truth. Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO labor federation representing 12.5 million workers, resigned from Trumps American Manufacturing Council, joining a series of chief executives in doing so. White House officials hoping to put the controversy behind them, worried the conference would revive and intensify the controversy. Asked about next steps, one official said: I think next steps are just to stop talking. Hours later, the White House sent its regular evening communications briefing of talking points on the news of the day to Republican lawmakers, copies obtained by multiple news organizations, including CNN and the Atlantic, showed. The first summary point read: The President was entirely correct  both sides of the violence in Charlottesville acted inappropriately, and bear some responsibility.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States drew a hard line for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday, demanding major concessions aimed at slashing trade deficits with Mexico and Canada and boosting U.S. content for autos. At the start of talks in Washington, U.S. President Donald Trumps top trade adviser, Robert Lighthizer, said Trump was not interested in a mere tweaking of the 23-year-old pact, which Trump has threatened to scrap without major changes. We feel that NAFTA has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement, Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, said at the start of the talks, which reflected Trumps relentless criticism that NAFTA has caused  massive U.S. manufacturing job losses.  Lighthizer put Mexico and Canada on notice that the United States would use its clout as their biggest export customer to wring concessions, saying the United States wanted substantially tougher rules of origin, including a requirement of substantial U.S. content for autos.  He also signaled a fight over NAFTAs trade dispute settlement system for changes that would allow more anti-dumping duties against Canada and Mexico, saying this provision should respect our national sovereignty. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland suggested earlier this week that her country could walk away if the United States insisted on scrapping the Chapter 19 trade dispute settlement system that requires the use of binational panels. In her opening statement, Freeland took a swipe at the U.S. fixation on cutting its trade deficits, saying: Canada does not view trade surpluses or deficits as a primary measure of whether a trading relationship works. U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade has quadrupled since NAFTA took effect in 1994, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. Lighthizer blamed NAFTA for a direct loss of 700,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs since the pact took effect in 1994, a period that coincides with increasing automation across all industries that has allowed more output with fewer workers. Auto industry groups have warned against changing the pacts rules of origin, which govern how much of a products components must originate from NAFTA countries. They said the pact has allowed them to build a competitive North American supply base that has helped boost exports of U.S.-assembled vehicles globally. The pact also has massively boosted U.S. farm income by increasing agricultural exports to both Mexico and Canada.  We do not want them to use us as a trading tool and to do harm to the agricultural sector in all three countries, the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall, told a news conference on Wednesday. Corporate chief executives have been sounding do no harm warnings on NAFTA for months.  Trumps relationship with business executives became a high-profile issue this week as he disbanded two business advisory councils after several CEOs quit in protest over his remarks blaming weekend violence at a rally in Virginia on the protesters who opposed white nationalists as well as the white nationalists themselves. Canadian and Mexican officials at the NAFTA talks on Wednesday declined to weigh in.  Asked if there was concern that the political upheaval around Trump could impact the NAFTA talks, Mexicos finance ministry undersecretary, Vanessa Rubio, said: These are internal issues of the United States. Freeland refused to be drawn into the U.S. political furor during a news conference before she returned to Ottawa.  The first round of NAFTA talks, which will last until Sunday, are expected to focus on consolidating the proposals and demands from all three countries. The long list of U.S. demands could make it difficult for negotiators to reach agreement on modernization plans that also are expected to include new chapters on digital and energy trade, and environmental, labor and currency standards. Both Freeland and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo pushed back at the U.S. demands and defended NAFTA.   Guajardo said NAFTA should be modernized to produce more trade among its participants, not less, and needed more than one winner. For a deal to be successful, it has to work for all parties involved. Otherwise, it is not a deal, Guajardo said. Guajardo later told a news conference that it was too soon for the three countries to begin narrowing their differences. He said it was not a good idea to add country-specific content requirements to the agreement. Mexico is keen to maintain preferential access for its goods and services to the United States and Canada, where nearly 85 percent of its exports are shipped. Its NAFTA priorities also include greater integration of the continents labor markets and energy sectors. Weighing heavily over the talks is the 2018 Mexico presidential election. Mexico has urged all sides to complete the negotiations before the campaign ramps up in February to avoid having them become a political punching bag.

The September 12 hearing to cover worldwide threats is an annual hearing that was already scheduled prior to the domestic attacks this weekend, Thompson said.

(Reuters) - Republican tax writers from the U.S. House of Representatives promoted their legislative goals at a special gathering in California on Wednesday, but offered few new details about provisions that may end up in their long-sought overhaul plan. As Wall Street analysts warned that President Donald Trumps controversial statements about Virginia protests on Saturday that turned deadly were hurting Republicans prospects for progress on domestic policy, the lawmakers assembled in Santa Barbara to say their tax reform agenda is moving forward. Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, spoke in broad brushstrokes about the effort at Rancho del Cielo, the country home of former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican who oversaw the last major tax code overhaul in 1986. If you look at todays tax code you cant even recognize the principles that made the Reagan reforms such a triumph for the American people, Brady said. Asked whether the plan would have specific provisions, Brady said: Were working through the details of the overall tax plan with the White House, President Trump, and Senate tax writers as well. We have more work to do. I anticipate continuing to work through August with the White House and Senate, bring forward a tax reform plan at the Ways and Means Committee after we return, Brady said, adding he wanted to get legislation to Trump before the end of the year. Brady was joined by Representatives Peter Roskam, David Schweikert and Carlos Curbelo, all Republican committee members. Market expectations for tax reform have declined in recent weeks, analysts said, and dimmed further after Trumps Tuesday press conference, where he said both sides were to blame for a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, between neo-Nazis, white supremacists and counter-protestors. Before the event, Curbelo, the son of Cuban exiles who emigrated to the United States, told reporters that Trumps remarks marked the lowest point yet in his presidency. In a way weve become accustomed to working in a very distracting environment. Thats not new. Now this is on a whole different scale, he said. While you have all of these other headlines, the public isnt going to be paying very much attention to the legislative agenda. Still searching for his first major legislative achievement after 208 days in office, Trump has refocused on overhauling the tax code, but he has been constantly distracted by controversies involving North Korea, race relations and investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Moscow. Trump was forced to disband two high-profile business advisory councils on Wednesday after corporate CEOs quit the committees in protest over his remarks about the violence in Charlottesville. Brady has remained bullish on the chances for a tax overhaul even after a Republican push to dismantle Obamacare collapsed in July. At Wednesdays event he told reporters the differences between a healthcare and tax overhaul are just about everything. As they did with Obamacare, the party has launched a nationwide publicity campaign for tax reform without first hammering out the final details of their proposal. The 1986 tax overhaul under Reagan was the result of a multi-year, bipartisan negotiation. Republicans are seeking to do key portions of tax reform within months, without Democratic support. Republicans have not yet introduced tax legislation and party leaders have already discarded key pieces of their initial, ambitious plan. No revenue-raising provisions have been agreed upon to replace those that were discarded. Corporate lobbyists and independent experts have said Congress and Trump are far apart on critical issues, such as how to slash rates without ballooning the federal deficit. Brady downplayed those differences on Wednesday, saying they planned to unify behind one bold plan. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis reversed a ruling forbidding Arkansas from carrying through with Republican Governor Asa Hutchinsons directive to suspend Medicaid reimbursements to a Planned Parenthood affiliate. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker in Little Rock had ruled in favor of three women who claimed Arkansas violated their rights under the federal Medicaid law to choose any qualified provider offering services they were seeking. But by a 2-1 vote, a 8th Circuit said the provision of the Medicaid law the women relied on does not unambiguously create a federal right for individual patients that they could enforce in court. U.S. Circuit Judge Steven Colloton wrote that the lack of such a right does not mean state officials have unlimited authority to terminate Medicaid providers. We conclude only that Congress did not unambiguously confer the particular right asserted by the patients in this case, he wrote. U.S. Circuit Judge Michael Melloy dissented, saying four other appeals courts have reached the opposite conclusion and found a private right of enforcement existed. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement said the fight is not over. We will do everything in our power to protect our patients access to birth control cancer screenings, and other lifesaving care, McDonald-Mosley said. Arkansas cut off funds for Planned Parenthood after the anti-abortion activist group Center for Medical Progress released videos in 2015 it claimed showed the groups officials negotiating the sale of fetal body parts for profit.  Planned Parenthood has denied the allegation and says 13 states that investigated those claims have cleared it of wrongdoing. Hutchinson, who was among Republican governors nationally who targeted the organization following those videos, welcomed Wednesdays ruling. This is a substantial legal victory for the right of the state to determine whether Medicaid providers are acting in accordance with best practices and affirms the prerogative of the state to make reasoned judgments on the Medicaid program, he said in a statement. Planned Parenthood does not perform surgical abortions in Arkansas, which forbids public funding of abortions except in cases of rape or incest.

Sessions has begun imposing new restrictions on some law enforcement grants to cities that decline to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Chicago, along with the state of California and city of San Francisco, sued this month over those conditions. President Donald Trump frequently criticizes Chicago and its high murder rate, and cracking down on illegal immigration was a theme of his 2016 presidential campaign. Democratic city and state leaders argue that sanctuary policies build trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement, which helps deter crime. In a speech in Miami, Sessions praised leaders of Miami-Dade County for complying with requirements that allow federal immigration authorities access to detainees in local jails. Chicagos refusal to do the same has made it a haven for predators and drug dealers, Sessions said. Respect for the rule of law has broken down, Sessions said. In Chicago, I suggest, the so-called sanctuary policies are just one sad example. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement the city will not cave to federal officials.   In a week in which the Trump administration is being forced to answer questions about neo-Nazis,white supremacists,and the KKK, Emanuel said, they could not have picked a worse time to resume their attack on the immigrants who see America as a beacon of hope. Sessions said Miami-Dade Countys homicide count is barely a third of what it was in the 1980s, and this year Chicago has more than three times as many as Miami-Dade does. The county includes the city of Miami and surrounding areas, and is  similar in population size to Chicago. Immigration advocates say there is no correlation between immigration and violent crime. Los Angeles, which also has embraced sanctuary city policies, has seen a sharp drop in homicides since they reached a high in the early 1990s.  In 1992, 1,094 people were killed in the city, according to the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting statistics. In 2016, the Los Angeles Police Department reported 294 homicides. Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a statement that shootings are down 16 percent this year, and that undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in the city.

In a notice published in the Federal Register that goes into effect Aug. 16, the government said it was ending the practice of granting parole under the Central American Minors (CAM) Program, which was offered to children even if they had been denied refugee status. The program started at the end of 2014 under the administration of former President Barack Obama as a response to tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors and families from Central America who arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking entry into the United States.   An executive order on border security signed by U.S. President Donald Trump days after he took office in January triggered a review of the program, putting on hold applications of more than 2,700 children who had been conditionally approved for entry into the United States. Now those applications will be canceled. The bulk of the children approved for the program were from El Salvador. Immigration advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense (KIND) said that cancelling the program would lead to more children to try to find other means to enter the United States.  These children have been repeatedly told by the U.S. government, including the Trump Administration, not to migrate to the United States due to safety concerns, the organization said in a statement. Now this Administration is cutting off the only authorized channel and leaving children no choice but to make the perilous journey to the United States. The program allowed children under 21 years old with parents lawfully living in the United States to apply for a refugee resettlement interview before making the journey to the United States.  As of August 4, more than 1,500 children and eligible family members had arrived in the United States as refugees under the CAM program, according to the State Department.  Children who did not qualify for refugee status and had no other means of reuniting with their parents in the United States  could also apply for entry under the program. They would be approved for parole for two years, allowing them to travel and stay in the United States and apply for work permits.   Since its inception, more than 1,400 children were granted parole and allowed to travel to the United States. They included  1,110 from El Salvador, 324 from Honduras and 31 from Guatemala, according to a spokesman from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  Now, they will have to re-apply for parole once their two-year term expires but will only be able to have it renewed if they can demonstrate an urgent humanitarian or a significant public benefit reason for them to stay, the federal register said. Parole decisions would be determined on a case-by-case basis. More than 13,000 people have applied for the program since it began, the State Department said. Around 1 percent of applicants were denied both for refugee status and parole, according to the USCIS spokesman. The refugee portion of the program will not be affected by Wednesdays termination and children stranded abroad can still apply as refugees.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly threatened to stop the payments, which are made directly to insurance companies to help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans enrolled in individual healthcare plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The payments are estimated to amount to $7 billion in 2017.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also said on Wednesday that two counties were projected to have no insurer in 2018 selling plans on the individual market created under former Democratic President Barack Obamas healthcare policy, down from 40 earlier this year.  Both announcements could bring some short-term stability to insurance markets, but the long-term outlook is uncertain, said Cynthia Cox, policy researcher and associate director at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Over the past several months, Trump and Republicans lawmakers who control both chambers of Congress, regularly pointed to the number of expected so-called bare counties in 2018 to argue for a bill repealing and replacing Obamacare. Insurers are still unsure whether Republicans will again try to repeal or replace the law when they return in September from a recess and whether the Trump administration will permanently make the insurer payments. They also do not know whether the administration will enforce a requirement of the ACA that all Americans buy health insurance or else pay a fine. It is unclear whether the federal government played a role in providing incentives to insurers to offer plans in bare counties, many of which were at risk because Anthem Inc, one of the largest remaining Obamacare insurers, pared back its offerings in several states, said Cox. State officials and insurance commissioners have worked to provide incentives and Centene Corp has filled in many of the gaps. Health plans have been working hard with insurance commissioners and state leaders to ensure that Americans who buy their own coverage have options that are as affordable as possible, said Kristine Grow, spokeswoman for insurer lobbying group, Americas Health Insurance Plans. This is a demonstration of that commitment. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday estimated that health insurance premiums for many customers on the Obamacare individual insurance markets would be 20 percent higher in 2018 if Trump stopped the insurer payments.

Other senior FBI officials praised Comey and said they were proud to have worked with him, but the workplace surveys were the first broad measure of employee sentiment toward him.

In the election for the seat vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions when he became U.S. attorney general, Luther Strange, who was appointed to the seat and was backed by Trump, will move to the Republican primary along with former Alabama Supreme Court Chief justice Roy Moore, the projections said. Neither candidate captured more than 50 percent of the vote required for an outright victory. With 60 of the states 67 counties reporting, Moore had 43.8 percent of the vote while Strange had 31.7 percent, official results showed. Strange, a former Alabama attorney general, has close ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been feuding with Trump lately over stalled effort to pass health care reform. Strange scored the presidents surprise endorsement last week and Trump reiterated his support for Strange in an automated phone call to voters on Monday. Hes helping me in the Senate, Trump said.

Moore was effectively ousted as Alabamas chief justice in 2016 for defying the U.S. Supreme Courts ruling legalizing gay marriage. It was the second time that he was suspended from the bench.

Governments could only win the fight against hatred, racism and anti-Semitism by rejecting such ideology and the willingness to use violence, said Martin Schulz, the center-left candidate for chancellor, adding that this applies to Germany and the United States. The trivialization of Nazi violence by the confused utterances of Donald Trump is highly dangerous, said Schulz, leader of the Social Democrats (SPD). We should not tolerate the monstrosities coming out of the presidents mouth, he told the RND newspaper group in an interview. Republican leaders criticized Trump for saying leftist counter-protesters were also to blame for violence last Saturday in Charlottesville that left one person dead and several injured. His comments won praise from white far-right groups. Schulz is the main challenger to Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Sept. 24 election. The SPD, junior partner in Merkels grand coalition, trails Merkels conservatives in polls. Schulzs comments were echoed by Justice Minister Heiko Maas, another senior member of the SPD. It is unbearable how Trump is now glossing over the violence of the right-wing hordes from Charlottesville, Maas said in a statement, reflecting concern across the German political spectrum about the Trump presidency. No one should trivialize anti-Semitism and racism by neo-Nazis, said Maas, senior member of the co-governing SPD. Schulz and Maas are the highest-ranking German politicians to criticize Trumps rhetoric about the violence. The country has tough laws against hate speech and any symbols linked to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, who ruled from 1933 until their defeat in 1945.  Merkel told broadcaster Phoenix on Monday that clear and forceful action was required to combat right-wing extremism, noting that Germans had also seen a rise in anti-Semitism and had quite a lot to do at home ourselves. Trump has come under increasing pressure over his stance on the violence, with many members of his own Republican party and U.S. business executives distancing themselves from him. Trump on Tuesday said his original reaction was based on facts he had at the time and said both sides were to blame. The violence erupted during a protest by white nationalists against plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the American Civil War.

Following are significant moments in the history of the deal: * June 10, 1990: U.S. President George H.W. Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari issue a statement endorsing a new, comprehensive free trade pact between the two neighbors, ordering talks to begin. Canada would join the talks in 1991, paving the way for three-way negotiations. The United States and Canada inked a bilateral free trade deal in 1988. * Nov. 3, 1992: Running as an independent for president in the United States, Ross Perot claims the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), would lead to a giant sucking sound of jobs rushing to Mexico. Bill Clinton wins the election, defeating incumbent Bush. Perot wins 19 percent of vote to place a strong third.  * Dec. 17, 1992: NAFTA is signed by outgoing Bush, Mexicos Salinas de Gortari and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, creating the worlds largest free trade area. The timing was, in part, aimed at making it harder for President-elect Clinton to pursue major changes; Clinton had endorsed the deal but insisted on environmental and labor side agreements. * Jan. 1, 1994: NAFTA comes into effect, and a Mayan Indian guerrilla army in southern Mexico launches an armed rebellion against neo-liberalism and explicitly against the free trade deal. The declaration of war against the Mexican government leads to days of fighting and dozens of deaths before the rebels retreat into the jungle. * Nov. 30, 1999: Tens of thousands of anti-globalization protesters converge on the U.S. city of Seattle, leading to widespread rioting coinciding with a ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization, which was seeking to launch new international trade talks. The protests underscore growing, if scattered, opposition to free trade deals like NAFTA. * July 16, 2004: Senior trade officials from Canada, the United States and Mexico issue a joint statement touting a decades worth of expanded trade in North America. Three-way-trade more than doubled to reach $623 billion while cumulative foreign direct investment increases by over $1.7 trillion compared to pre-NAFTA levels. * Dec. 11, 2001: China formally joins the World Trade Organization, integrating the Asian giant more deeply into the global economy. Easing trade with China intensifies a trend that had been seen since NAFTA came into effect as the U.S. trade deficit soared to more than $800 billion by 2006. * Jan. 1, 2008: NAFTA is fully implemented as the last of its polices come into effect. In many sectors, NAFTA stipulates that trade barriers would only gradually be phased out, which was designed to smooth economic shocks in vulnerable industries. By this time, trade within the three North American nations has more than tripled since NAFTA began.  * July 19, 2016: Billionaire businessman and political outsider Donald Trump formally clinches the Republican presidential nomination, winning the traditionally pro-free-trade partys nod in part by denouncing NAFTA, calling it the worst trade deal ever.  * Aug. 16, 2017: High-stakes talks aimed at modernizing NAFTA kick off in Washington, with both U.S. and Mexican officials aiming to conclude a new pact in early 2018 before elections later in the year in both nations might derail negotiations.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama nominated Landon as a Fed governor in early 2015. With the community-banking experience sought by the Republicans who controlled Congress and a non-partisan background, he should have avoided any political pitfalls on the way to Senate confirmation.  Landon, a former Bank of Hawaii chief executive, began preparing for the job immediately after the White Houses initial phone call in mid-2014. He sold assets, stepped back from university lecturing and corporate boards, met Fed Chair Janet Yellen and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and even attended a Senate confirmation hearing to study for his own.       But his confirmation hearing never came.  Neither the Republican Senator who chaired the key committee, Richard Shelby, nor his staff met with Landon, he said in an interview.  While not bitter, he was left disillusioned by an increasingly political nomination system that can block promising candidates from public service, leaving top jobs unfilled at agencies and departments across Washington.  Along the way you run into some things that are hard to understand if you are outside the system, Landon, 69, told Reuters from his home in Park City, Utah. It requires a level of trust and confidence, and when you wait two years you conclude that maybe that really never existed.    Republican party control of both the White House and the congressional committees that approve nominees has not solved these problems during the Trump administration.  A dearth of nominations by Trump, hearings delayed by Democrats, and disinterest by prospective candidates has left  most of the 577 key federal government positions requiring Senate confirmation unfilled.  According to the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service,  an organization whose mission is to inspire a new generation of civil servants, Trump had nominated 277 people to these top government positions by Wednesday, compared to 433 nominees at this point in Obamas first presidential term, and 414 in that of President George W. Bush.  Obama and Bush each had more than twice as many nominees confirmed at this point than does Trump, who has 124. Big staffing vacancies remain at the U.S. departments of State, Justice and Defense, and some high-profile names have backed down after having been nominated. Three vacancies remain at the Federal Reserve, which has not had a full slate of seven board governors for more than a decade. Its a brutal, long road and it seems to be getting worse, former Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said of the nomination process.  As part of his vetting in late 2014, in which he and his wife almost leased a home in the trendy Penn Quarter neighborhood of Washington D.C., Landon said he felt an obligation to help when he realized the sitting Fed governors were doing the jobs of two or three people.

The key issues facing negotiators include: RULES OF ORIGIN: NAFTA says in order for a good to be traded duty-free within the three countries, it must contain a certain percentage of North American content, which differs for various products. The rule of origin is most contentious in the auto industry; cars must contain at least 62.5 percent American, Canadian or Mexican content. The United States wants to increase the content threshold for NAFTA goods in a bid to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, and the auto industry has conceded that the rules should be updated to account for auto components that did not exist when the original deal was signed. Canada has said it is prepared to discuss some strengthening of rule of origin in the auto sector, but that any change must apply equally to all three countries. Mexico is willing to look at strengthening rules, but warns that going to far will make the region less competitive. DISPUTE RESOLUTION: The United States has sought to ditch the so-called Chapter 19 tool, under which binational panels hear complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping and then issue binding decisions. The United States has frequently lost such cases since NAFTA came into effect in 1994, and the mechanism has hindered it from pursing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Canadian and Mexican companies. Washington also argues that Chapter 19 infringes on the sovereignty of its domestic laws. Canada has said Chapter 19 can be updated, but said a dispute settlement mechanism is its red line and must be part of any updated NAFTA. Mexico also says dispute settlement mechanisms are a vital part of the deal to give investors security. SUPPLY MANAGEMENT: Quotas are a feature of NAFTA in several agricultural commodities including dairy and sugar, but Washington is seeking to eliminate non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. Most notably, U.S. President Donald Trump has called Canadas restrictions on dairy imports a disgrace. Although dairy was excluded from the original 1994 deal, the United States is seeking to eliminate non-tariff barriers to its agricultural exports.  CURRENCY MANIPULATION: The United States is seeking a provision to deter currency manipulation. While Washington wants a mechanism to ensure the NAFTA countries avoid tinkering with exchange rates to gain a competitive advantage, neither Canada nor Mexico is on the U.S. Treasurys currency manipulation watch list. Critics say the U.S. demand is an attempt to get currency manipulation into a global trade agreement to establish a precedent with other trading partners, including China. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT: The United States is pushing for national, state and local governments in Canada and Mexico to open up their tender processes to U.S.-made products but at the same time is defending existing Buy American procurement laws. The Buy American provisions have blocked the use of Canadian steel to build U.S. bridges, and Canada is pushing for a freer market for government procurement. Mexico says it expects government procurement, already included in NAFTA, to be part of the renegotiation. INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT: The United States has proposed minor tweaking of the NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions, which are designed to ensure firms that invest abroad receive fair and equitable treatment by foreign governments. As with Chapter 19, opponents of the provisions argue they infringe on sovereignty which benefits multinational corporations. Canada wants to update the mechanism to allow governments to regulate in the interest of the environment or labor, as in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement that Canada recently negotiated with the European Union.

Business leaders and civil rights groups had battled to defeat the bills, saying they advanced bigotry, would tarnish the states image and damage its economy. The measures were blocked by moderate House Republicans.  Adoption by Texas, the most populous Republican-dominated state, could have fed momentum in other socially conservative states on the issue, a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars. Finally, Texans can breathe a temporary sigh of relief, said JoDee Winterhof, an official of the Human Rights Campaign that lobbied against the bills. Texans dont want harmful, anti-transgender legislation, Winterhof, the campaigns senior vice president for policy and political affairs, said in a statement. Momentum for so-called bathroom bills stalled this year when  North Carolina partially repealed a similar law in March. The original law prompted boycotts by athletic bodies and businesses that are estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Texas could have lost about $5.6 billion through 2026 if it had enacted such a measure, said the Texas Association of Business, the states leading employer grouping. The House wound up its duties without taking action on any of the bills and adjourned sine die, a day ahead of the official end of the 30-day special session. House Speaker Joe Straus, a pro-business Republican who controls the agenda in the chamber, said the issue was not a priority. Straus position was reinforced by a well-financed campaign by major corporations, including Texas-based energy companies Halliburton and ExxonMobil Global Services, which have said the bills would make it hard for them to recruit top talent. The measure that advanced the farthest was Senate Bill 3, which passed easily on a party-line vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and then died in the House. It would have required people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. Supporters, including Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a staunch social conservative, say the proposed curbs promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children.

The National Association of Home Builders also praised the Trump administrations move, saying the flood rules had raised the cost of housing. But the environmental group Oil Change International said the order would silence local communities that have safety and environmental concerns about major projects like pipelines. If Trump has his way, well be facing a fossil fuel buildout that locks America into climate catastrophe, said Janet Redman, U.S. Policy Director at Oil Change International. The order would set a two-year goal for completing permits needed on major infrastructure plans, and create a one Federal decision protocol that would appoint a lead federal agency to work with other agencies to complete the environmental reviews and permitting for infrastructure projects. The Trump administration has issued dozens of rules and orders to reverse Obama-era regulations addressing climate change and its consequences such as rising sea levels and more severe storms. The administration proposes $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending. The Obama-era standard required that builders factor in scientific projections for increased flooding and ensure projects can withstand rising sea levels and stronger downpours. It required all federal agencies apply the standard to public infrastructure projects from housing to highways. Rafael Lemaitre, former director of public affairs at FEMA who worked on the Obama-era order, said Trump is undoing the most significant action taken in a generation to safeguard U.S. infrastructure. Eliminating this requirement is self-defeating; we can either build smarter now, or put taxpayers on the hook to pay exponentially more when it floods. And it will, he said.

In the case that has been contested in federal courts for about six years, a three-judge panel at U.S. District Court in San Antonio ruled lawmakers drew up the districts to undermine the influence of racial minority voters, who plaintiffs argued typically show more support for Democrats than Republicans.  The court also said that the maps laying them out must either be fixed by the state or the courts. The court said the 27th and 35th congressional districts were drawn in violation of the U.S. Voting Rights Act. Texas has 36 districts, with Republicans holding 25 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Democrats 11. The court also faulted the states legislature for not heeding previous judicial plans and for making inadequate fixes to the maps drawn in 2011. The discriminatory taint was not removed by the Legislatures enactment of the Courts interim plans, the judges said in their decision. Texas Democrats saw the decision as a victory. Republicans initiated a deceitful legal strategy to deliberately silence Texans from having a voice in their own government. Today, the Court unanimously agreed, Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the court did rule in Texas favor in finding that one contested district, District 23, was lawful. However, Paxton said in a statement the state has been abiding by the law and prior court guidance and he intended to ask the U.S. Supreme Court whether Texas had discriminatory intent when relying on the district court. In court, lawyers for Texas argued that the boundaries were drawn for Republican partisan advantage, which they said is legal. They dismissed claims the districts were drawn illegally with the intention to disenfranchise racial and ethnic groups. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - For months, U.S. President Donald Trumps national security adviser and his chief strategist have battled for influence behind the scenes, and their feud may force another shake-up at the White House. The dispute between Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster and political strategist Stephen Bannon has reached a level of animosity that is destabilizing Trumps team of top advisers just as the administration tries to regain lost momentum, three senior officials said.  Under pressure from moderate Republicans to fire Bannon, Trump declined to publicly back him on Tuesday, although he left his options open. Well see what happens with Mr. Bannon, he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. Whatever Trump decides could chart the fate of a nuclear-weapons deal with Iran, U.S. troop deployments to Afghanistan and White House staffing decisions - all issues over which Bannon and McMaster have sparred. Bannon has been in a precarious position before but Trump has opted to keep him, in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his election victory and is backed by many of the presidents most loyal rank-and-file supporters. The president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him, a source close to the White House told Reuters. The source floated the possibility that Bannon could be demoted instead of fired, noting that he might turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he is forced out of the inner circle.  Two other senior officials, both supporters of McMaster who asked not to be identified, said he blames Bannon for a series of attacks against him by right-wing website Breitbart News, which Bannon used to lead, and other far-right conservative groups.  In recent weeks, Breitbart has published a series of articles making a case for McMasters ouster on the basis that he is not a strong ally of Israel and that he has staffed the National Security Council with holdovers from the Obama administration. One of the senior officials said McMasters anger over the campaign is known to the president but declined to say whether the national security adviser had told Trump directly or through General John Kelly, an ally and the presidents new chief of staff. McMaster isnt saying Bannon is the mastermind behind the campaign, but he does think Bannon could stop it if he wanted to, said one of McMasters defenders. In a television interview on Sunday, McMaster repeatedly declined to answer when asked if he could work with Bannon. About their feud, Bannon declined to comment and McMaster was unavailable for comment. Instead of firing Bannon, Trump could move McMaster into a position outside the White House, possibly back to an active military command role, or keep both men where they are and insist on some form of truce. Bannon has survived other White House power struggles this year and established a detente with Trumps son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner after a scolding from the president. The two senior officials who support McMaster said Kelly is angry that the anti-McMaster campaign has made the White House appear chaotic, reflecting badly on him as he was brought in as chief of staff two weeks ago to restore order and discipline. Bannon sees himself as the defender of Trumps nationalist base and has advocated for both an end or renegotiation of trade deals and a more isolationist approach to foreign affairs than McMaster.  He has pushed to scrap the 2015 nuclear-weapons agreement with Iran, which McMaster argues should remain in place, and has also proposed using contractors to fight the war in Afghanistan rather than expanding U.S. forces there, as McMaster has advocated.  McMaster is part of a more pragmatic group that Bannon likes to label globalists. He drew the fury of Bannons supporters by recently overhauling the White Houses National Security Council, pushing out four staffers who were seen as close to Bannon. Conservative commentator Mike Cernovich is a Bannon ally and has been a vocal critic of McMaster, even leveling personal attacks against him. Cernovich says he does not talk directly to Bannon but praises him as an important counterweight to McMaster.  He also warns that the president would alienate his most loyal supporters if he fires Bannon. I dont think that people who like Trump are suddenly going to say, Were going to fight Trump. Instead theyll say, Whats the point of supporting him? Cernovich told Reuters. The conservative Jewish-American and pro-Israel group Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), which also has close ties to Bannon, has been one of McMasters sharpest critics, urging Trump to reassign him away from policy areas dealing with Israel and Iran.  Trump has himself backed McMaster, saying he was a good man and very pro-Israel. A source close to the ZOA bristled at the suggestion that Bannon was influencing its approach and said it would not tone down the campaign against McMaster, despite entreaties by Bannon  to do so. We find it remarkably offensive that anyone would suggest that Steve Bannon or anyone else tells us what to say or what not to say, the source said. It makes me feel awful that hes getting blamed for this, but theres nothing I can do about it. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - When white supremacists began rallying in downtown Charlottesville this weekend, Liz Licht kept the TV off, trying  to shield her three kids from the hate spewed on the streets of this normally quiet college town. But after learning that a 32-year-old woman who joined a counter-protest was killed by a man described as having neo-Nazi sympathies, Licht could no longer keep news of the violence from her nine-year-old son and seven-year-old twins. Our son went to bed scared that night, Licht said. He said he never really knew evil existed until that day. Licht joined other parents to call on the local school district to help Charlottesville children exposed to the hate and violence, especially as they leave the safe haven of home to start the school year.  We want to work with them to develop buddy systems to pair them up with someone who is an immigrant or refugee, Licht, 41, said on Tuesday as she stood near a pile of flowers marking the street where Heather Heyer was killed. Make it hands-on, not just talking about it. Charlottesville Public Schools officials said they are preparing specific plans on how to address the issue when students return to classes next week. School leaders are tweaking their plans for the new year and preparing teachers to handle students questions about the violence and hate speech, schools Superintendent Rosa Atkins said in an e-mail. If we miss these steps, we will miss an opportunity for healing and growth, Atkins said. Saturdays rally was the latest in a series of demonstrations by white supremacists in Charlottesville in recent months. It deteriorated into street fighting that culminated in Heyers killing, allegedly by 20-year-old James Alex Field, who injured 19 other people by crashing his car into a counter-protest.  Psychologists often warn that young children can be traumatized by images of violence and urge parents to limit their exposure to news accounts of events like Saturdays rally. But given the white nationalist ideology that drove the Unite the Right event, experts said parents and schools should talk directly with their children about their beliefs. This is a really important teaching moment, said Gail Saltz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the Cornell School of Medicine. Schools in particular could use the incident as a way to teach students to cope with bullying, by stepping up to object to bullies, rather than being passive bystanders. Any way that one can be helpful always relieves anxiety, said Saltz. You might say to a child that in your microcosm of school, its really important to make everyone feel respected. Corey Eicher, 42, stopped with his daughters, aged seven and four, to leave flowers at the memorial for Heyer. He said he had tried to soothe his childrens fears by talking about the police and race. We showed them that a lot of the police working that day were black, of every color, Eicher said. My older daughter is seven, so she kind of understands what is happening.

AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka became the latest to resign on Tuesday after Trump blamed both sides for the violence that left one woman dead and several others injured.  Merck & Co Incs Kenneth Frazier, who is African-American, was the first CEO to leave one of Trumps presidential advisory councils and was followed by the chief executives of Intel Corp and Under Armour Inc.     Trump on Monday denounced white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, as criminals and thugs, bowing to days of mounting political pressure to condemn such groups explicitly. However, on Tuesday he reverted to his earlier comments blaming many sides for the violence. The following are responses from companies and CEOs on Trumps manufacturing council to the violence in Virginia:  * Dow Chemical Co I condemn the violence this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in a statement.  * Dell Inc [DI.UL] Theres no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our customers and our employees, a Dell Inc spokeswoman said in a statement. CEO Michael Dell plans to remain on the manufacturing council. * General Electric Co  Jeff Immelt will remain on the council while he is the chairman of the company. GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend, a company spokesperson said.  * Intel Corp  There should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or white supremacy by name. #Intel asks all our countries leadership to do the same, CEO Brian Krzanich said in a tweet. He later said in a blog post on Intel website that he was exiting the council to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues.   * Under Armour Inc  We are saddened by #Charlottesville. There is no place for racism or discrimination in this world. We choose love & unity, CEO Kevin Plank, who also left the council, said in a tweet from the companys Twitter account.  * Whirlpool Corp  Whirlpool will stay on the council. Whirlpool Corp believes strongly in an open and inclusive culture that respects people of all races and backgrounds. Our company has long fostered an environment of acceptance and tolerance in the workplace, a company spokeswoman said. * Campbell Soup Co  Chief Executive Denise Morrison will remain on the council. The reprehensible scenes of bigotry and hatred on display in Charlottesville over the weekend have no place in our society. Not simply because of the violence, but because the racist ideology at the center of the protests is wrong and must be condemned in no uncertain terms, a company spokesman said in a statement. * American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka will resign from President Trumps Council on Manufacturing, effective immediately I cannot sit on a council for a president that tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism, Trumka said.  * Wal-Mart Stores Inc Representing a company with the largest and one of the most diverse groups of associates in the U.S., and an even more diverse customer base of tens of millions of customers, we believe we should stay engaged to try to influence decisions in a positive way and help bring people together, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said.  * Johnson & Johnson  In the end, I have concluded that Johnson & Johnson has a responsibility to remain engaged, not as a way to support any specific political agenda, but as a way to represent the values of Our Credo as crucial public policy is discussed and developed, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said in a statement. * International Paper Co  International Paper strongly condemns the violence that took place in Charlottesville over the weekend - there is no place for hatred, bigotry and racism in our society, a company spokesman said in a statement. * Boeing Co  Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will stay on the manufacturing council. * U.S. Steel Corp  A spokesperson referred queries related to the American Manufacturing Council back to the White House.

President Donald Trump is still seeking his first major legislative achievement and has focused on tax reform. But he has done little to advance it recently, amid constant distractions over Russia, North Korea and race relations. In Congress, as they did for their failed push to dismantle Obamacare, Republicans are ramping up a nationwide publicity campaign in favor of tax law changes without first deciding on exactly what changes they want to make. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texan, is scheduled to deliver a speech on the issue on Wednesday at former President Ronald Reagans ranch in Santa Barbara, California. Other committee members will also attend. Ahead of his remarks, Brady told CNBC on Tuesday that the House, Senate and White House are united around a common tax plan, with details being hammered out. No legislation has been introduced. House Republican leaders had an ambitious plan earlier this year, but key pieces of it have been discarded. No replacement revenue-raising provisions have been agreed upon. Nevertheless, Brady said, We are on track to deliver transformational, bold tax reform this year. At the same time, he acknowledged that details have yet to be finalized: We have a lot of work left to do.    Corporate lobbyists and independent experts said Congress and the administration are far apart on critical issues such as how to slash rates without ballooning the federal deficit. The Republicans all agree on lower tax rates, just not on how to pay for them, said Stephen Shay, a Harvard Law School lecturer who advised on tax policy at the U.S. Treasury under former Democratic President Barack Obama. Shay put the odds of tax reform occurring before the November 2018 midterm congressional elections at 50-50.  Expectations for tax reform have fallen off sharply among investors on Wall Street, where many now believe congressional gridlock is more likely than an overhaul. Economically, it (tax reform) is a no-brainer. But from here to there, its a long and winding road. And were finding more land mines on that road pretty much every week, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at broker-dealer Commonwealth Financial Network.  Major tax reform last occurred in 1986 as the result of a broadly bipartisan effort that took several years. Under Trump, tax reform is a highly partisan venture.  Republicans have only a few months to overcome internal divisions and other obstacles to get tax reform done by Jan. 1. The push will collide next month with efforts to prevent a government shutdown and a default on U.S. debt.  Still, some experts said tax legislation might still fly. Theres still an expectation that there will be some sort of tax bill that gets to the presidents desk that he can sign before the midterm elections, said Rohit Kumar, a tax policy expert at accounting and consulting group PwC and a former senior Senate tax aide.  I think theres a lot of uncertainty about whether we can call that tax reform or whether thats something more like tax relief. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Texas, the most-populous Republican-controlled state, has been at the forefront in enacting abortion restrictions, with many of its measures followed by other socially conservative states.

Frazier cited the need to take a stand against intolerance and extremism. The AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions that represent 12.5 million workers, said it was considering pulling its representative on the committee.  After the white nationalist rally turned deadly on Saturday, Trump initially said that many sides were to blame. On Monday, in a statement, Trump denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan as criminals and thugs, bowing to mounting political pressure as critics assailed him for not singling out white supremacists. The CEO of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, announced his resignation from the council in a Twitter posting. We remain resolute in our potential and ability to improve American manufacturing, said Plank. However, Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics. Plank was criticized last winter by some of Under Armours biggest stars over his support of Trump, comments that basketball star Stephen Curry echoed. The demonstration in Charlottesville by hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter protesters and killed one person. \""America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\"" Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation. (bit.ly/2fFnITM) As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism, he said. Trump responded shortly later in a tweet, saying, Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from Presidents Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! Trump doubled down on his attack later in the day, tweeting that Merck is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES! The son of a janitor, Frazier joined Merck as general counsel of one of the drugmakers subsidiaries in 1992, working his way up to CEO of the company in 2011.  He made his name as the companys top lawyer, steering it through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks.  Many observers thought Merck would eventually have to shell out $10 billion or more to thousands of plaintiffs over the drugs withdrawal. But Fraziers legal strategy led to a $4.85 billion settlement in 2007, allowing Merck to refocus on its pipeline of experimental medicines. Merck shares closed up 0.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market. Frazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but making no donations to a presidential candidate during the year.  The political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over $1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign - but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission.  The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trumps reaction.  The industrys silence comes as Trump is finalizing an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them.  Individually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, tweeted his support, saying he was proud to stand with leaders like Ken Frazier. Other top business leaders also spoke out in response to the violence in Charlottesville. I support Ken Fraziers decision. Im thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels, said Hewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: Lincoln: A house divided against itself cannot stand. Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together. Richard Trumka, president of the largest federation of U.S. labor unions, the AFL-CIO, questioned the councils effectiveness and said the group was mulling leaving. The AFL-CIO has unequivocally denounced the actions of bigoted domestic terrorists in Charlottesville and called on the president to do the same, Trumka said in a statement.  Several executives from top U.S. companies have previously stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies. Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger left the Presidents Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council. Former Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administrations immigration policies. The White House said Sunday that Trumps remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups. Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump for waiting too long to address the violence - his first major domestic crisis as president - and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee.  Trump on Saturday initially denounced what he called this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides. On Sunday, however, the White House added: The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups.

The United States should respect objective facts, act prudently, abide by its World Trade Organization pledges, and not destroy principles of multilateralism, an unidentified spokesman of Chinas Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. If the U.S. side ignores the facts, and disrespects multilateral trade principles in taking actions that harms both sides trade interests, China will absolutely not sit by and watch, will inevitably adopt all appropriate measures, and resolutely safeguard Chinas lawful rights.  The ministry said the United States should treasure the cooperation and favorable state of China-U.S. trade relations, and warned that any U.S. action to damage ties would harm both sides trade relations and companies. China was continuously strengthening its administrative and judicial protections for intellectual property, the ministry added. Chinas policy of forcing foreign companies to turn over technology to Chinese joint venture partners and failure to crack down on intellectual property theft have been longstanding problems for several U.S. administrations. Trump administration officials have estimated that theft of intellectual property by China could be worth as much as $600 billion. Experts on China trade policy said the long lead time could allow Beijing to discuss some of the issues raised by Washington without being seen to cave to pressure under the threat of reprisals. China repeatedly rebuffed attempts by previous U.S. administrations to take action on its IP practices, and has insisted it rigorously protects intellectual property. State news agency Xinhua said the U.S. investigation is a unilateralist baring of fangs that will hurt both sides. Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council said Trumps memo is only the beginning of the process, but that he expected a decision on how to move forward from the administration in 60-90 days.  I think it will be much faster than a year, Parker said. Coming to terms on a bilateral investment treaty would be a better way to get China to address the IP issues, he added. This isnt a surprise. Our companies have been honing their crisis communications and internal planning processes since the election. The rhetoric that came up during the campaign led them to take proactive action then. They are prepared, aware and ready for these types of actions going forward. The investigation is likely to cast a shadow over U.S. relations with China, its largest trading partner, just as Trump is asking it to put more pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear programm. Trump has suggested he would be more amenable to going easy on China over trade if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea. China has said the issues of trade with the United States should not be linked to the North Korea problem. Ken Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in a statement on Tuesday that trade and North Korea should not be linked, but that the investigation was a  measured and necessary step. The presidents executive order reflects building frustration with Chinese trade and market entry policies, particularly those that pressure American companies to part with technologies and intellectual property in exchange for market access, he said.  Chinese companies operating in the United States do not face this pressure.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The city of San Francisco also filed its own lawsuit against the Justice Department late last week, saying the federal government has improperly sought to force local jurisdictions to enforce national immigration law by imposing funding conditions. President Donald Trump issued a broad executive order in January targeting wide swaths of federal funding for cities that generally offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws.  However, a San Francisco judge drastically limited the scope of that policy in a previous lawsuit filed by the city. The Justice Department then sought to impose conditions on a national grant for local law enforcement that mandates access to local jails for federal immigration officials, as well as 48 hours notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations.  Californias lawsuit opposing those conditions, as well as San Franciscos case, is similar to a legal challenge filed last week by the city of Chicago. In a statement on Monday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the state, not the federal government, is best suited to determine how best to allocate its law enforcement resources. When President Trump threatened to defund our local law enforcements ability to do its job and protect our people, he picked the wrong fight, Becerra said.  A Justice Department spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. California receives about $28 million a year in federal law enforcement funding that would be subject to the new conditions, the state said in its lawsuit.  San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera on Monday said San Francisco receives about $1.4 million in such funds. Immigration enforcement is the federal governments job, he said. Were not stopping them, Herrera said. But our police and deputies are focused on fighting crime, not breaking up hard-working families. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will have a year to look into whether to launch a formal investigation of Chinas trade policies on intellectual property, which the White House and U.S. industry lobby groups say are harming U.S. businesses and jobs.

Experts on China trade policy said the long lead time could allow Beijing to discuss some of the issues raised by Washington without being seen to cave to pressure under the threat of reprisals. Although Trump repeatedly criticized Chinas trade practices on the campaign trail, his administration has not taken any significant action. Despite threats to do so, it has declined to name China a currency manipulator and delayed broader national security probes into imports of foreign steel and aluminum that could indirectly affect China. China repeatedly rebuffed attempts by previous U.S. administrations to take action on its IP practices.  Im sure they will formally reject this if an investigation is launched and there is an implication this is going to require negotiation to resolve it, said Matthew Goodman, a senior adviser for Asian economics at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Jonathan Fenby, an analyst at the TS Lombard consultancy, said China was not interested in a short-term trade fix with the United States and will resist attempts to tie it down.  Chinas policy of forcing foreign companies to turn over technology to Chinese joint venture partners and failure to crack down on intellectual property theft have been longstanding problems for several U.S. administrations. The Information Technology Industry Council, the main trade group for U.S. technology giants, such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O), said it hoped China would take the administrations announcement seriously. Both the United States and China should use the coming months to address the issues causing friction in the bilateral trade relationship before Presidents Trump and Xi have their anticipated meeting ahead of the November APEC leaders meeting, ITI President Dean Garfield said in a statement. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobbying group, said China needed to end forced technology transfers and to protect foreign intellectual property rights.  In an editorial on Monday, the state-run China Daily newspaper said the investigation will poison relations and warned the Trump administration not to make a rash decision it could regret. Trump had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressed for Chinas cooperation on North Korea. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from unfair trade practices of foreign countries.

The so-called bathroom bills have caused rifts among Republicans who control the states legislature, leaving no likely path to passage before a 30-day special session wraps on Wednesday, analysts and lawmakers said on Monday. The bathroom bill in this session is dead and buried with dirt over its coffin, said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston. Enactment in Texas, the most populous Republican-dominated state, could give momentum to other socially conservative states for additional action on an issue that has become a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars. But House Speaker Joe Straus, a pro-business Republican who controls the agenda in the body, has shown little interest in passing a bathroom bill, which he said was not a priority. On Monday, opponents of the bills delivered a list with signatures from 50,000 people who opposed a bathroom bill to Straus and other prominent Republicans, including Governor Greg Abbott. Straus position was reinforced by a well-financed campaign from major corporations including Texas-based energy companies Halliburton (HAL.N) and ExxonMobil Global Services (XOM.N), which have said the bills were discriminatory and would make it hard for them to recruit top talent. Supporters of the legislation, who say it can help protect women and children from sexual assaults, have not given up.  But they acknowledge there is only a slim chance of success, with lawmakers still trying to reach deals on almost all of the 20 priority items set by Abbott for the session. Opponents are still worried bathroom bill language could be attached as an amendment to another bill, but as of Monday afternoon, no such action had been taken. Senate Bill 3, which made it through the Senate and stalled in the House, requires people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. A push for bathroom bills nationally sputtered after North Carolina partially repealed such a measure in March after boycotts by athletic organizations and businesses that have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Opponents of the Texas measures include global tech giants IBM (IBM.N) and Apple (AAPL.O), major Texas city police chiefs, who contested claims the bills would protect public safety, and the National Hockey Leagues Dallas Stars team. Republican Representative Ron Simmons, who sponsored a version of the bathroom legislation in the Texas House, said the privacy issue at the heart of the bills is supported by a wide majority of Republican primary voters.

Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, giving the most substantive outline yet of Canadas goals, said she was very optimistic the negotiations would be a success.  North American Free Trade Agreement members Canada, Mexico and the United States hold their first session in Washington on Wednesday. Canada, heavily reliant on exports to the United States, opposes Washingtons push to scrap the so-called Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism, under which binational panels make binding decisions on complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping. The United States has frequently lost such cases. Canada will uphold and preserve the elements in NAFTA that Canadians deem key to our national interest  including a process to ensure anti-dumping and countervailing duties are only applied fairly when truly warranted, Freeland said in a speech at the University of Ottawa. Noting that Canada had withdrawn its chief negotiator from 1987 talks on a bilateral trade treaty with the United States over the same issue, Freeland said our government will be equally resolute. Freeland later sidestepped reporters questions about whether maintaining Chapter 19 was a make-or-break issue for Canada, saying she would let her U.S. counterparts know how important the matter was to Ottawa. Trade among the three nations has quadrupled since NAFTA came into effect in 1994, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. But U.S. President Donald Trump regularly calls the treaty a disaster and has threatened to walk away from it unless major changes are made, citing U.S. job losses and a trade deficit with Mexico. Toronto trade lawyer Mark Warner said there few surprises in Freelands announcement, given Ottawa had already signaled its stance on major issues. Its the beginning of a negotiation. Everybody expects posturing, he said by phone, noting Washington had reacted calmly to previous Canadian statements about the importance of dispute settlement. Freeland, who predicted there would be moments of drama during the talks, said Canada wanted a progressive trade deal featuring stricter environmental and labor standards as well as a focus on climate change, a concept Trump has little time for. Canada, like Mexico, sends the majority of its exports to the United States and would be hurt by U.S. protectionist moves. The United States runs a slight surplus in trade of goods and services with Canada, which has mounted a major outreach campaign to persuade U.S. business leaders and politicians that NAFTA is a success. American partners have been listening, Freeland said. They understand ... our relationship, the greatest economic partnership in the world, is balanced and mutually beneficial. Freeland stressed that Canada would protect tariffs and quotas that keep domestic dairy prices high and imports low. U.S. dairy farmers strongly dislike the system. A modernized NAFTA should take into account technological advances and make it easier for professionals to move from one member nation to another, she added.

It was the latest push-back on the departments study from backers of renewable energy such as wind and solar power who fear it could be used by the Trump administration to form policies that could slow growth in the industry.    Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who commissioned the 60-day study in April, ordered his department to see whether regulatory burdens by other administrations including former president Barack Obamas had forced the premature retirements of so-called baseload power plants, fired by nuclear and coal. Perry said those policies potentially put at risk the reliability and security of the national power grid. The Sierra Club, in the suit filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said the department had ignored a Freedom of Information Act request it filed in May. That request sought the release of communications between staff and outside groups it had consulted, in the belief that the Energy Department had mostly relied on fossil fuel backers. We want to make sure that when this study is finally released, that the public and policy makers fully understand how it went about doing it, who they were influenced by, and whose views they did not take into consideration, said Casey Roberts, a Sierra Club lawyer. The Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It had initially said the report would be released in July, but the release has been delayed. A draft of the study, conducted by a contractor who included contributions from staff across the department, said that intermittent renewable power has not harmed the grid, was leaked to the media last month.  But an energy department spokeswoman said then that the draft was outdated and had not been reviewed by political or career staff, leading Sierra Club and others to believe the final draft could favor coal and nuclear. Several lawmakers with strong renewable power output in their states have said that the Energy Department had already completed long-term studies of renewable powers impact on the grid that concluded there has been no harm. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, raised concerns in a letter sent to Perry in May that the secretary had commissioned a study that appeared geared to undermine the wind energy industry.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has set a collision course with the auto industry as it launches renegotiations of the 23-year-old NAFTA trade pact this week, aiming to shrink a growing trade deficit with Mexico and tighten the rules of origin for cars and parts. More than any other industry, autos have been the focus of U.S. President Donald Trumps anger over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blames for taking car factories and jobs away from America to low-wage Mexico. The United States had a $74 billion trade deficit with Mexico in autos and auto parts last year, the dominant component of an overall $64 billion U.S. deficit, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The Trump administration has framed their NAFTA negotiating objectives around reducing the trade deficit with Mexico, said Caroline Freund, a senior trade fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. If they dont touch autos, theres no way of getting at what they want. Among tools that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer may seek to boost auto employment in the U.S. is strengthening the rules of origin to shut out more parts from Asia, and possibly an unprecedented U.S.-specific content requirement for Mexican vehicles. Lighthizers negotiating objectives for NAFTA seek to ensure the rules of origin incentivize the sourcing of goods and materials from the United States and North America, which has raised concerns among auto industry executives and trade groups that he will seek a deal that guarantees a certain percentage of production for the United States. The industry is opposed to such a carve-out or to increasing the percentage of a vehicles value that must come from the region above the current 62.5 percent - already the highest of any global trade bloc. They say this would raise costs and disrupt a complex supply chain that sees parts crisscrossing NAFTA borders and has made North American car production competitive with Asia and Europe. Our members feel very strongly that rules of origin are not the tools to use to reshore jobs into the U.S., said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs for the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing auto parts makers. Wilson and other industry advocates say a better way to boost U.S. manufacturing jobs is through policies aimed at expanding vehicle exports. But if U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gets his way, it would be harder to reach the 62.5 percent content threshold because the tracing list of parts that count towards that goal would be modernized. He argues the current rules are too loose and allow a tariff-free back door for Chinese auto parts. Parts that did not exist when the 300-plus page list was devised in the early 1990s, largely electronics sourced from Asia such as console touch screens or hybrid-drive controllers, do not count against reaching the threshold. If they are put on the list, companies would have to source them from North America or pay tariffs on them. If the content requirements become too onerous, automakers will simply skip compliance and theyll just end up paying the duty, said Charles Uthus, vice president for international policy at the American Automotive Policy Council, a lobbying group for Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Fiat Chrysler. Foregoing all NAFTA tariff-free access benefits - something that could happen if Trump is dissatisfied with the negotiations and decides to scrap the trade pact - would raise costs by about $4 billion-5 billion a year, Ulthus added. Ford plans about $7 billion in total capital spending this year.    Among the other contentious NAFTA issues that U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators will tackle starting on Wednesday in Washington is the future of a mechanism for resolving trade disputes. The United States wants to eliminate a so-called Chapter 19 provision, arguing that it fails to combat unfair subsidies of some Mexican and Canadian goods. Mexico and Canada have vowed to keep the provision. Negotiators are expected to pursue new NAFTA chapters governing digital trade, and tightening environmental and labor standards, changes previously agreed by the three countries as part of the now-defunct 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership. U.S. negotiators will also seek a provision to deter currency manipulation, aiming to set a precedent for future trade negotiations, such as a revised U.S.-North Korean deal or a bilateral pact with Japan.  The negotiations face an extremely tight timeline, with officials saying they want to complete negotiations by early next year to avoid ratification difficulties posed by elections in Mexico in July 2018 and in the U.S. in November 2018. Freund, a trade economist for more than a decade at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, said the negotiators should focus on a few key areas.   If you really want to do a full-blown modernization of NAFTA, its going to take a lot more than six months, she said. Ultimately I think theyre going to get bogged down in all these details and pick two to three things and have a smaller agenda. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With U.S. Congress members focused during their August recess on finding ways to lower the corporate tax rate, industry groups and other sectors of society are gearing up to fight proposed changes to the personal income tax. While tax cuts for business have garnered the most headlines, lobbyists and lawmakers have conceded that rewriting the corporate tax code will be a long slog. Tackling personal tax rates will be easier, many argue. Looking for an easier legislative win ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, most lawmakers in the Republican majority want to cut individual incomes taxes. President Donald Trump has been pushing hard for tax changes this year.     Still, proposed changes to the personal tax code have already stirred opposition from realtors, home builders, mortgage lenders and charities. These groups say proposed changes will hurt home sales and cut charitable contributions. The National Association of Realtors issued an August Recess Talking Points circular imploring members to remind lawmakers that Homeowners must be treated fairly in tax reform to avoid another housing crash. The group cited a report it commissioned from PwC that estimated home values could quickly dive more than 10 percent if the tax plan becomes law.  To simplify the tax code, Republicans have proposed eliminating nearly all tax write-offs including those for state and local taxes, then doubling the standard deduction. This would eliminate the incentive to itemize and should drastically reduce the number of taxpayers who do so. Currently, many taxpayers use itemized deductions, claiming write-offs for things like charitable contributions, interest paid on a mortgage and state and local taxes. If the standard deduction becomes larger, fewer taxpayers will need to itemize, reducing the incentive to hold a mortgage or contribute to charity. Currently, about 30 million taxpayers claim the mortgage interest deduction, with about $70 billion in total claims, according to Robert Dietz, an economist with the National Association of Homebuilders.  Estimates suggest more than half of taxpayers would stop itemizing under the proposed plan, Dietz said, warning that this would create a large ripple effect through the economy. He said people in early years of a mortgage would suffer most, along with prospective home buyers. Home builders are also fighting the proposed tax code changes. I dont think I would call that a cakewalk, said Jerry Howard, the head of the National Home Builders Association, saying the proposal will face fierce resistance from his group, which represents 130,000 builders. He noted that members operate in every congressional district and employ more than 7 million people.  Charitable organizations are not arguing against increasing the standard deduction. But they are asking members of Congress to consider creating a universal deduction, so taxpayers taking the standard deduction can get additional credit for donations without itemizing.  Taxpayers claim an estimated $13 billion each year in charitable deductions. Charities fear giving would plummet if the standard deduction were doubled without creating a universal deduction. Gail McGovern, president and CEO of the American Red Cross,  said reducing charitable deductions would be devastating.     If lobbyists defeat the reform effort, Congress could try to cut rates without structural tax code changes, said Charles Boustany, a former Republican member of the tax-code writing House Ways and Means Committee who left Congress in January.  The path of least resistance becomes an old-fashioned tax cut on the individual side, said Boustany. The pressure is just going to be relentless as we get later in the fall.

In a first meeting with Trump back in January, Green made his pitch to the then president-elect, drawing from his experience in Central America to explain how U.S.-funded programs there could help slow the number of immigrants trying to enter the United States illegally. I said Mr. President-elect, I believe our development tools can help us achieve just about every one of your strategic priorities, Green told Reuters in his first interview since starting last week as head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Green had previously worked on U.S-supported projects with indigenous mayors in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to improve living conditions so kids hopefully dont go 1,000 miles through the worst conditions imaginable and jump the border. It works and is a great way to use development, he said, sitting in a still bare office at USAID headquarters blocks from the White House. Green brings a unique resume to the job: a former four-term Republican congressman from Wisconsin who served as U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania under President George W. Bush. In his last job as head of the International Republican Institute, he helped promote governance and democracy overseas. His time on Capitol Hill will be key to his new job. In a sign of his good standing there, Greens nomination had support across the political spectrum, as well as among aid groups.   Trump staked out his position on foreign aid on the campaign trail, casting it as a waste of U.S. tax dollars. And now his administration has proposed slashing the budget for foreign aid by a third, which could gut programs across a range of issues including health, governance, gender and education. But U.S. foreign assistance has traditionally garnered bipartisan support in Congress, which controls the aid purse strings. Green has stronger relations with lawmakers than his  predecessors, who battled Congress on funding and objectives. Whats very different for Mark Green is that his strongest allies are on the Hill, said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington. Where he faces headwinds are with both the White House and the State Department.  There is a real potential for conflicts in basic philosophy about what USAID does, added Morris. Green is nevertheless sanguine about prospects for a downsized, budget-constrained USAID.  We cant do everything, he said. The resources are limited, so we have to prioritize. Green takes over an agency that has already been through waves of reform in the last decade, adapting to shifting global development patterns featuring deep-pocket philanthropic groups, more private-sector investment in emerging economies, and the rise of China as a financier in the developing world. New demands have emerged with an unprecedented refugee crisis from wars in Syria and Iraq, along with famine in Africa, and growing violent extremism. USAIDs humanitarian work is unrivaled, it is mobilization of American generosity, and it will continue, Green said, adding that U.S. assistance should both help in times of crisis and prevent crises from occurring. He wants U.S. foreign assistance to focus on results to show Americans that their tax-dollars are being put to good use. I am going to ask every program to show me how it is moving us closer to the day when people can lead themselves, said Green. If it is not helping, theyre going to have to tell me why.

The ads release comes amid intense criticism of Trumps response to the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a planned rally by white supremacists led to violence that killed a counter-protester. Speaking on Saturday from his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump stopped short of calling the demonstrators white supremacists and instead criticized groups on many sides. Even members of his own party said he had failed to adequately condemn those behind the violence. The new advertisement uses the same video clips, still images and font as one released earlier this year by America First Policies, a political group that is able to secretly raise and spend unlimited sums of money.  Trumps campaign and America First Policies are prohibited by law from coordinating with each other.  Trump filed for reelection the day he took office, an unusual move that has allowed him to begin campaigning long before the November 2020 election. Historically, incumbent presidents have waited two years, until after the midterm elections, to file formally. Trumps campaign did not respond to a request for comment about how much money it was spending on the ad, where it was running or why it decided to release it this weekend.     The ad says Trump has created jobs and helped the stock market since taking office. The presidents enemies dont want him to succeed, but Americans are saying, Let President Trump do his job, the advertisement states.  Trump continues to struggle with low approval numbers, and the television ad could be an attempt to bolster his support.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - At first glance, U.S. Representative Mo Brooks seems exactly the kind of candidate President Donald Trump would love to see win Tuesdays Republican primary election for Alabamas open U.S. Senate seat. The 63-year-old Republican is a Freedom Caucus member and an immigration hardliner who calls opponent Luther Strange Lying Luther, echoing Trumps penchant for bestowing insulting nicknames on his political foes. Strange, 64, is the former state attorney general who was appointed to fill the Senate seat left vacant after Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general. Trump would like to drain the swamp; Brooks would like to blow it up, said Larry Powell, a professor of communication at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. But their goals are the same. Yet it was Strange, not Brooks, who earned a coveted prize last week in a race that could measure Trumps influence in a state he carried easily in last years election, despite recent indications that his support among Republicans may be softening.  Trump took to Twitter to offer Strange his complete and total endorsement. The tweet came as something of a surprise. Known as Big Luther thanks to his 6-foot-9-inch (2.1-meter) frame, Strange has a close alliance with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is under fire from Trump for failing to push his agenda through Congress and refusing to eliminate a filibuster that gives Democrats veto power over many key bills. Strange agrees the filibuster should remain in place.     In a telephone interview, Brooks noted that Trump followed his endorsement of Strange with a barrage of Twitter criticisms aimed at McConnell, which Brooks called extraordinarily baffling. Any Alabama voter who wants to see President Trumps legislative agenda pass the United States Senate would be much better served to vote for Mo Brooks than Luther Strange, Brooks said. President Trumps entire legislative agenda is dead so long as the Senates 60-percent rule requires President Trump to get the consent of Democrat leader Chuck Schumer to pass it.     Both Brooks and Strange may be losing to the third viable candidate in the nine-way race. Former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, 70, has led in several voter surveys, though polling in the race has been limited. The Moore and Strange campaigns did not respond to requests for comment. Assuming no candidate reaches 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers will go head-to-head in late September, with the winner a heavy favorite against whoever emerges from the Democratic primary. For weeks, Strange and Brooks have lobbed attacks at one another as insufficiently committed to Trump. Advertisements from supporters of Strange highlighted Brooks endorsement of Texas Senator Ted Cruz for president last year, as well as criticism Brooks made of Trump at the time. Brooks, a founder of the House of Representatives far-right Freedom Caucus who survived the shooting attack on Congress members at a softball practice in June, has fired back by attacking Strange for his close ties to Senate leadership. Strange and Brooks have largely ignored Moore, though Strange backers have run some anti-Moore ads in recent days. I think both assume that Moore is going to make the runoff, and whoever gets to the runoff will likely beat him, Powell said.     Moore made his name in 2003 by refusing a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state Supreme Court building and losing his position. After winning another term in 2013, he was suspended in 2016 and later resigned after directing state judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court and continue to enforce a ban on same-sex marriage. The former judge is popular among religious conservatives but had trouble expanding his base in previous campaigns for governor. Each contender would likely serve as a reliable Republican vote in the Senate, with little daylight between their policy positions. All three of these candidates are different intensities of the same flavor, said Steven Taylor, a political science professor at Troy University in Alabama.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BEDMINSTER, N.J. (Reuters) - For President Donald Trump, this was the week when the real world began to intrude upon his presidency.  The violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white nationalists and counter-protesters confronted Trump with perhaps the first true domestic crisis of his young administration. And to some, even within his own Republican Party, he came up short.  It followed days of blustery threats toward North Korea that rattled some Americans and unnerved allies. Both are the kinds of white-knuckle challenges that define presidents - and which Trump largely has avoided during the first months of his tenure.  As images of rising tensions and a deadly car rampage in Charlottesville filled TV screens nationwide, the president was criticized first for waiting too long to address the violence and then, when he did so, failing to explicitly condemn the white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee. [nL2N1KY033] Marco Rubio, a Republican senator who was Trumps rival for the presidential nomination, quickly suggested Trumps initial response was inadequate. On Twitter, Rubio wrote that it was, Very important for the nation to hear [Trump] describe events in Charlottesville for what they are: a terror attack by #whitesupremacists. While Trump has had to deal with the pressures of the federal probe into Russian meddling in last years election, disarray in his White House, and conflicts with Congress over his stalled agenda, there are have been few external crises that have tested his presidential mettle.  By contrast, his predecessor, Barack Obama, inherited a severe economic downturn during his first year in office, and would go on to face, among other tests, a catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Middle East upheaval, terror attacks in Boston, Orlando, and elsewhere, and civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri and Baltimore, Maryland.  Trump has spent this week at his tony golf club in New Jersey, attempting to show the American public that he is indeed working and not vacationing. He held one event after the other, while answering media questions with an approachability he hasnt shown for months. Yet, when news of the situation in Charlottesville first started filtering out on Friday, Trump was silent. He first addressed the matter  through a tweet  on Saturday afternoon, after a planned white-supremacist rally had been dispersed, fights had broken out, and a state of emergency declared.  By the time Trump finally appeared before reporters at a staged bill-signing event at his club, footage of a car speeding up and slamming into a crowd of protesters had swamped social media and cable networks, raising the specter of domestic terrorism. At least one woman in the cars path died and several people suffered critical injuries. At a podium, Trump read a statement rebuking the violence, but without specifically mentioning or faulting the role of white nationalists.   We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides - on many sides, Trump said.  He also took the occasion to boast about declining unemployment and new corporate investment in the United States. Afterwards, he ignored shouted questions from reporters as to whether he would denounce white supremacism and whether the car incident constituted terrorism.  Beyond Rubio, Trumps response apparently also was not enough for Senator Cory Gardner, who chairs the Republican Partys Senate-election effort. Mr. President, we must call evil by its name, he tweeted. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism. Republican Orrin Hatch, who has served as a senator for 40 years, referenced his brother, who was killed in World War II. We should call evil by its name. My brother didnt give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home, he said on Twitter.  Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said that Trump had not demonstrated moral leadership. There are NOT many sides to this, he wrote.  Trump tweeted several more times after the press event, offering support to the city of Charlottesville and the police but still declining to critique the violence in more explicit terms. Both as a candidate and as president, Trump has met with charges that he has courted the support of white supremacists and nationalists, the so-called alt-right, as a key part of his passionate voter base. He was forced at one point last year to publicly denounce the Ku Klux Klan and one of its leaders, David Duke. After Trump was elected, he installed Steve Bannon, a trusted figure in nationalist circles and former chairman of the hard-right outlet Breitbart News, as a top adviser in the White House.

Xis comments came hours after Trump warned North Korea that the U.S. military was locked and loaded as Pyongyang accused the U.S. leader of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war. The Pentagon said the United States and South Korea would proceed as planned with a joint military exercise in 10 days, an action sure to further antagonize North Korea. Chinas foreign ministry said in a statement that Xi told Trump a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue was essential, and urged calm. Concerned parties must exercise restraint and avoid remarks and actions that escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula, it cited Xi as saying. In their phone call, Trump and Xi agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior, the White House said in a statement, and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. It added the relationship between Trump and Xi was extremely close and will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem. Trump, vacationing at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf resort, earlier took to Twitter to warn North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that U.S. military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Again referring to Kim, Trump added, If he utters one threat ... or if he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else thats an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it, and he will regret it fast. In remarks to reporters on Friday after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Trump said the situation with North Korea was very dangerous and it will not continue. He added, We will see what happens. We think that lots of good things could happen, and we could also have a bad solution. Despite the tough rhetoric, Trump insisted that nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump. South Koreas presidential Blue House said in a statement on Saturday the United States and China were working to resolve the North Korea crisis, and it hoped the two leaders phone call will be able to resolve the peak of tension and act as a catalyst for the situation to move on to a new dimension. Guam, the Pacific island that is a U.S. territory and home to a U.S. air base, a Navy installation, a Coast Guard group and around 6,000 U.S. military personnel, posted emergency guidelines on Friday to help residents prepare for any potential nuclear attack. North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday the North Korean army would complete plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land in the sea 18 to 25 miles (30 to 40 km) from Guam. Japans government decided to deploy its Patriot missile defensesystem to four locations in the west of the country, media reported. No one at Japans defense ministry was available to comment on Saturday. The governor of Guam, Eddie Baza Calvo, posted a video on Facebook of himself speaking with Trump. We are with you a thousand percent. You are safe, Trump told Calvo. Washington wants to stop Pyongyang from developing nuclear missiles that could hit the United States. North Korea sees its nuclear arsenal as protection against the United States and its partners in Asia. Trump said he was considering additional sanctions on North Korea, adding these would be very strong. He gave no details and did not make clear whether he meant unilateral or multilateral sanctions. U.S. officials have said new U.S. steps targeting Chinese banks and firms doing business with Pyongyang are in the works, but these have appeared to be put on hold to give Beijing time to show it is serious about enforcing new U.N. sanctions. Trump said he did not want to talk about diplomatic back channels with North Korea after U.S. media reports that Joseph Yun, the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy, had engaged in diplomacy for several months with Pak Song Il, a senior diplomat at Pyongyangs U.N. mission, on the deteriorating ties and the issue of Americans imprisoned in North Korea. But Daniel Russel, until April the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, said this so-called New York channel had been a relatively commonplace means of communication with North Korea over the years, and was not a forum for negotiation. Its never been a vehicle for negotiations and this doesnt constitute substantive U.S.-DPRK dialogue, he said, using the acronym for North Koreas formal name, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. Both Moscow and Berlin expressed alarm over the rise in rhetoric over North Korea, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged Pyongyang and Washington to sign up to a joint Russian-Chinese plan by which North Korea would freeze missile tests and the United States and South Korea would impose a moratorium on large-scale military exercises. Neither the United States nor North Korea has embraced the plan. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there is no military solution, adding that an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer. The French presidency said North Korea was engaged in a dangerous escalation of tensions.  President Emmanuel Macron calls for all parties to act responsibly and prevent any further escalation in tensions, the Elysee palace said in a statement. Trump and Macron spoke on Saturday. The White House said Trump reiterated the U.S. commitment to stop the North Korean nuclear menace and said Washington was ready with diplomatic, economic and military measures. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said blame for problems lay with North Korea, and that the international community was shoulder to shoulder in efforts to stop North Korean aggression. We are working with the US and our partners in the region to bring this crisis to a diplomatic end, he tweeted. As the rhetoric has ratcheted up, South Koreans are buying more ready-to-eat meals for emergency use, and the government aims to expand nationwide civil defense drills planned for Aug. 23. Hundreds of thousands of troops and huge arsenals are arrayed on both sides of the tense demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - After trying for years to stymie the growth of charter schools in Chicago, leaders of its public school teachers union are seeking to enlist staff from charter schools in a bid to strengthen the unions bargaining power and tap a new source of members fees. Union officials in the third-largest U.S. city say their push for a tie-up took on added urgency after U.S. President Donald Trump chose Betsy DeVos, a backer of charter and private schools, as his education secretary. In cities and suburbs across the country, charters and traditional public schools have been in fierce competition for students and financing. But many are united in their rejection of private schools and voucher programs. Unions fear Trump and DeVos will slash funding for traditional public schools, and the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) wants charter members to boost their ranks in order to help them fight back. A more unified approach has long been the answer, said Jesse Sharkey, vice president of the CTU.  I dont think were going to get to keep public education the way we currently think of it unless people organize and prepare to defend it, he said. Charter schools are free and open to the public but are run independently of local school districts by private companies that compete for state funds. They often boast small class sizes, innovative teaching styles or a particular academic focus. Their numbers in the United States have shot up to more than 6,000, from 2,500 a decade ago. An estimated 6 percent of U.S. public school students, or more than 3 million pupils, attend charter schools. The possibility of a merger has many eyes on Chicago, where the proportion of charter school teachers who are unionized on their own is much higher than in other cities. While only about 10 percent of U.S. charter schools had collective bargaining agreements last year, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, 25 percent of Chicagos 130 charter schools are organized. Leaders of the citys unionized charter school educators say they see the benefits in joining forces with the CTU. We face an existential crisis, said Chris Baehrend, president of Chicagos union for charter teachers. The answer to every crisis is more solidarity. Its better for us to be a small part of a larger voice that wins things. Leaders of his 1,000-member organization had been mulling a merger with the CTU for years, Baehrend said, but Trumps election propelled them into action from fear of his and DeVos conservative agenda. DeVos office did not respond to requests for comment.  In June, the education secretary faced hostile questions from a U.S. Senate committee about her support for school vouchers, to which DeVos responded that she was only exploring the possibility of a program.  Vouchers are state-funded payments families can use to send children to private schools.  Supporters say they could give those children in neighborhoods with weak public schools the chance of a better education at private institutions. Critics say they are intended to boost private-sector profits with public money. A majority of Baehrends organization voted in June to merge with the CTU.  The CTUs leadership favors the merger, and its 23,500 members will vote on it in the fall. Baehrend said he is confident the measure will pass.  Not everyone supports the closer links. Some supporters of charter schools say the attributes that attract many parents, including their flexibility and autonomy, could be put at risk in Chicago if the CTU introduces new terms for contracts, such as limits on the time an instructor can teach each day.  Theyre now trying to find ways to undermine the existing schools via organizing, Andrew Broy, president of the Illinois Network of Charter Schools, said of the CTUs leaders.

Breaking nearly two weeks of silence on Putins July 30 order cutting U.S. embassy and consulate staff by nearly two thirds, Trump said on Thursday: Im very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll, adding theres no real reason for them to go back. Trumps remarks rekindled criticism of his kid-glove handling of Putin, especially as he has not shied away from being highly critical of members of his own party, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Putin, reacting to new sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress and reluctantly signed into law by Trump, ordered Washington to cut its diplomatic and technical staff by 755 people by Sept. 1. Many of those affected likely will be local Russian staffers. It was also a reaction to former President Barack Obama expelling 35 Russian diplomats from the United States last December over the intelligence agency reports. I was just speaking to the Secretary (of State Rex Tillerson) and were talking about coming up with an answer ... by September 1st well have a response, Trump said. Congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign by hacking and other methods to help Trump, a Republican. They are also looking into possible collusion between the campaign and Russian officials. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. During his campaign and since becoming president, Trump has consistently called for better ties with Russia, declined to criticize Putin and refused to unequivocally embrace the conclusions of the intelligence agencies. Trumps remarks were immediately denounced by current and former U.S. officials who have served both Republican and Democratic administrations. The remarks also raised some eyebrows in Europe. I would have to say in my experience (it is) one of the most bizarre things I have ever heard from any government official, not just the U.S., Ojars Kalnins, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the Latvian parliament, told Reuters earlier on Friday.

He encouraged Pyongyang and Washington to sign up to a joint Russian-Chinese plan, under which North Korea would freeze its missile tests and the United States and South Korea would impose a moratorium on large-scale military exercises. If this double freezing finally takes place, then we can sit down and start from the very beginning - to sign a paper which will stress respect for the sovereignty of all those parties involved, including North Korea, Lavrov said.

U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman said Illinois, which just ended an unprecedented budget impasse, failed to provide resources of sufficient quality, scope, and variety to the residents, who as a result suffered substantially from a reduction in services in violation of a federal consent decree. In the ruling, Johnson said she lacked the authority to order a funding increase, noted the states dire financial condition, and directed Illinois to devise a plan to address issues affecting the services and comply with the decree. The state had argued that advocates for the disabled living outside of institutions were seeking as much as an additional $1 billion annually - an amount Illinois could not afford. A two-year budget impasse that ballooned the states unpaid bill backlog to more than $15 billion ended in July when lawmakers enacted a fiscal 2018 budget over the governors vetoes. That budget allocates $53.4 million for the first rate increase for developmentally disabled services since 2008. But the advocates said the funding boost was insufficient to retain workers and services. What (the state) comes up with will be the next step, said Barry Taylor, vice president at Equip for Equality, one of the advocates, in a phone call. The judge set a status hearing for Oct. 27. Meghan Powers, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Human Services, said in an email that the state was committed to providing quality services to the developmentally disabled.  The state will continue to meet all its legal obligations and will review the courts rulings to determine appropriate next steps, she said. Another U.S. judge ordered Illinois in June to substantially boost its monthly payments to Medicaid providers to ensure continued health care for poor and disabled residents covered under a separate federal consent decree. The state had owed those providers more than $3 billion. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Pyongyangs state-run KCNA news agency said on Thursday its army would complete plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near Guam as North Korea and the United States engaged in increasingly heated rhetoric this week over the Norths nuclear weapons program.  North Korea did not threaten Guam with a nuclear attack, but the crisis between Pyongyang and the United States has stirred fears that a nuclear conflict could break out in the region. While the governor of Guam shrugged off the Norths missile warning and said there was no heightened threat, the government has issued a preparedness fact sheet. In language that evoked the specter of nuclear conflict during the Cold War, the guidelines cover what to do before, during and after a nuclear attack.  Do not look at the flash or fireball  It can blind you, it said. Take cover behind anything that might offer protection.  Remove your clothing to keep radioactive material from spreading. Removing the outer layer of clothing can remove up to 90% of radioactive material, read the guidelines of what to do if caught outside.  They suggest having an emergency plan and supply kit and making a list of potential concrete structures near home, work and school to serve as fallout shelters. Fallout shelters do not need to be specifically constructed for protecting against fallout, it said. They can be protected space, provided that the walls and roof are thick and dense enough (i.e. concrete) to absorb radiation given off by fallout particles. The fact sheet advises people on how to wash: do not scrub or scratch the skin, use soap, shampoo and water but do not put not conditioner on your hair because it binds radioactive material. It offers advice for parents who are away from their children during a strike.  Stay where you are, even if you are separated from your family, it said. Listen to the news. Do not call the school. Be patient. Wait for instructions to pick up your child. The information on the fact sheet was gathered from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website www.ready.gov, a Guam Homeland Security spokeswoman told the Pacific Daily News. Guam is home to about 163,000 people and a U.S. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an air base and a Coast Guard group. (For a graphic on North Korean missile trajectories, ranges click tmsnrt.rs/2hIzZHG)  U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday warned North Korea against threatening Guam and said on Friday that the U.S. military was locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.

Defense company officials, speaking on conference calls after their just-reported quarterly earnings, did not blame Trump directly, but said the lack of appointments to key positions at the Pentagon had slowed contract awards and created uncertainty. The still-high number of unfilled leadership appointments and the approaching government physical year-end continue to serve as headwinds, said Roger Krone, chief executive of Leidos Holdings Inc (LDOS.N), on an Aug. 3 call with analysts. Krone, whose company is one of the largest providers of services to U.S. armed forces, said those open posts have slowed the awarding of government contracts. The Department of Defense said it has 42 unfilled top-level posts that require Senate confirmation, including general counsel, inspector general and other important roles like secretary of the Army and undersecretary of the Navy. The Pentagon referred a request for comment on its unfilled posts to the White House. A White House official said: Democrat obstruction has played a key role in jamming up the presidents agenda.  Of the 42 open positions that require Senate confirmation, 29 have no nominee identified, while 13 have nominees awaiting confirmation. For two of the largest U.S. defense companies, General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and L3 Technologies Inc (LLL.N), thin staffing at their largest customer was a talking point with investors. The Defense Department is working on filling several positions in the Pentagon and that has definitely resulted ina slowdown, said Ralph DAmbrosio, chief financial officer of L3, a prime contractor for surveillance, security and detection systems. Because of the slowdown, the quarter just ended was the lowest second-quarter spending level on record at $62.5 billion, according to a report by data analysis firm Govini, seen by Reuters. The report said federal procurement resources are stretched thinner than they ever have been.  Leidos Krone pointed to the expected one-year delay of the Navys $3.5 billion NMCI NextGen program to update the intranet used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps as an example of a big contract delay. Defense spending for the 2018 fiscal year and beyond was unclear, said Byron Callan, a defense analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, noting that few companies have changed their long-term profit expectations, suggesting that uncertainty has made forecasting more difficult.  The fact that we didnt have an enacted (fiscal year) 2017 budget until the early part of May, which was seven months into the fiscal year, has definitely slowed down the contracting activity and the obligation activity within the Department of Defense, said DAmbrosio. Some of the positions have been difficult to fill. Two of Trumps nominees for Army secretary, its top professional civilian position, withdrew their names from consideration. The White House then nominated Raytheon Co (RTN.N) lobbyist Mark Esper, and he is awaiting a vote on his confirmation. General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic said during her companys conference call that without these appointments, it is difficult to processcontracts and to make progress on defense-related projects.  Novakovics information systems and technology business unit has thousands of shorter sales-cycle service contracts which can reflect delays quickly.

The $5.7 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that began July 1 includes $300 million the state of Illinois would send the district under education funding legislation. But Republican Governor Bruce Rauner used an amendatory veto to substantially rewrite the bill to remove what he called a CPS bailout. It was unclear how much the district would receive under Rauners revisions.  The Democratic-controlled legislature, which passed the funding formula bill in May without a veto-proof majority, is scheduled to meet next week. A failure by the Illinois House and Senate to muster a required three-fifths majority vote to override or accept changes Rauner made to the bill would kill the measure.  The budget we released today is more of an outline than a traditional budget as we wait for the resolution of the education funding stalemate in Springfield, CPS CEO Forrest Claypool told reporters, referring to the state capital. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for the nations third-largest public school system. The CPS budget also assumes a $269 million boost in local funding that the district said it is working with the city to identify. Matt McGrath, a spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who controls the school system, said there is no answer yet on a local source. What I can tell you is that any local solution will not come at the expense of the citys long-term financial stability, he said, adding that the mayor promises CPS students will have a full school year. Moodys Investors Service put Chicagos Ba1 junk credit rating under review last month for a possible downgrade, citing the potential the city could extend financial help to its cash-strapped schools. The amount of CPS cash-flow borrowing in fiscal 2018 would be about the same as fiscal 2017s $1.55 billion, according to budget documents. Claypool said the district has no immediate plans for selling bonds for capital needs. CPS, which projects an 8,000 enrollment drop this school year, has set an Aug. 28 budget vote by its board. The district said the spending plan can be revised once the state puts a school funding formula in place.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Senate committee that handles Supreme Court nominees said on Friday he no longer expected an imminent court vacancy, bolstering assumptions that Justice Anthony Kennedy would not retire this year. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said expectations earlier this year of a vacancy on the nine-member bench had evaporated. Evidently thats not going to happen, Grassley said in a telephone interview from his home state of Iowa during the Senates summer break. I dont have any expectation we will have a vacancy as I thought there would be earlier this year. There had been speculation in the spring that Kennedy, a conservative justice who turned 81 last month and has served on the court since 1988, was considering retirement. Kennedy is the regular swing vote on the high court, sometimes siding with the four liberal justices in major rulings. A court vacancy would give Republican President Donald Trump a chance to appoint a second conservative justice to the high court since taking office in January. But court watchers expect Trump to nominate a jurist who is more likely to consistently decide cases with the conservative wing of the court, unlike Kennedy. In the interview on Friday, Grassley noted that every year there is speculation that a justice might retire during the summer at the end of the courts session. He declined to give details on the rumors he had heard earlier this year about an impending vacancy. Grassley added that such talk is often stoked when there are justices in their 70s and 80s serving on the court. Besides Kennedy, 81, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84 and Stephen Breyer will turn 79 next week. Rumors that Kennedy was set to retire reached a fever pitch several months ago after some of his former judicial clerks said he was considering it.  But Kennedy did not announce his retirement at a weekend reunion in June with many of the former clerks. He also did not make an announcement after the courts rulings marking the end of its term on June 26.  His silence on the matter tamped down the rumors and led to a broad assumption that he would remain on the court, at least for the coming term, which begins in October. Kennedy, like all the other justices, was also assigned responsibility on June 27 to handle applications from a specific regional appeals court, further reducing speculation over his retirement. Earlier this year, Trump won Senate confirmation of conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch. Gorsuch arrived on the high court more than a year after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, who had been a leading conservative voice. The Republican-led Senate in 2016 refused to consider then-President Barack Obamas nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy created by Scalias death. Garland would have tipped the court in a more liberal direction. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""LONDON (Reuters) - Once seen as an opportunity for investors to position themselves for a future North Korean turnaround, the countrys rarely traded defaulted debt may move further into the twilight zone after new sanctions were imposed this week on Pyongyang. Debt from North Korea - probably the most isolated of the frontier markets - has already been frozen for years as the secretive nation faces the most stringent sanctions regime in the world.  It is part of a highly opaque market in the legacy debts of countries isolated from the rest of the international community, such as pre-Castro Cuban debt. North Korea has syndicated loans with a face value of around $1 billion, tied to loans in default since the 1980s. It has not undertaken any restructuring with its creditors.  The debt was repackaged in 1997 into a special vehicle  called NK Debt Corporation by French bank BNP, making it into transferable securities.   Total debt accumulated by borrowing heavily from Western banks back in the 1970s - including principal and accumulated interest - amounted to about $3 billion, Washington DC-based think-tank Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated in 2013.  The securities had been regularly traded since around 2000, according to Stuart Culverhouse, head of research at Exotix Capital.  Prices spurted higher after the death of President Kim Jong-il in 2011 on hopes that his son Kim Jong-un, North Koreas new Swiss-educated leader, would make progress with the international community and open up the economy.  That pushed prices to 14-18 cents on the dollar, up from 13-15 but investors hopes were soon dashed. Culverhouse was unable to say what price the securities could now trade at.   There was a market, but it essentially got frozen at the beginning of 2013 after the United Nations and other sanctions were imposed, which people felt restricted trading in the notes, he said. Exotix, a specialist in emerging and frontier debt, has not seen the loans trade in the past three to four years, Culverhouse said. This weeks developments will further dishearten holders of the debt. A war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Koreas Kim has raised fears of a nuclear standoff, while the U.N. Security Council imposed fresh sanctions on Saturday after Pyongyangs intercontinental ballistic missile tests.  These curbs ban North Korean exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, and seafood, and could slash the Asian states $3 billion annual export revenue by a third. A lot of people have taken a view that it is just not worth it, they wont trade, Culverhouse said. It is not just the more specialized distressed debt traders who once took a shine to North Korean debt: One of the holders of NK Debt Corporations notes is the Franklin Emerging Markets Debt Opportunities Fund. According to the funds annual report in July 2016, it held NK Debt Corporations zero-coupon bonds with a principal amount of $15.5 million and maturing in March 2020. It did not ascribe a value to the position. But in its July 2013 annual report, the fund had valued the debt, which was denominated in German marks and Swiss francs, at $830,000. It said it had acquired the securities between 2007 and 2011 for more than $3.1 million. The asset manager declined to comment. North Korea is only the latest frontier market to be moving further out of reach of investors desperate to expand into new high-return markets. Excitement over investment in Cuba for instance has gone tepid after Trump ordered a clampdown on U.S. business dealings with the Caribbean islands military, saying he was cancelling his predecessor Barack Obamas terrible and misguided deal with Havana. Investing in Iran too has proven a long slog, despite optimism after Tehrans 2015 deal with six major powers to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of oil bans and most financial sanctions. Nothing is going to happen with these (North Korean) issues for a long, long time, said Charles Blitzer, a debt restructuring expert and former IMF staffer. Blitzer estimates that interest arrears on North Korean debt amount to around 4-5 times the outstanding $1 billion principal.   North Korea is like Cuba in spades - they have similar ratios of principal to arrears and have not yet indicated much interest in dealing with the London Club, said Blitzer, referring to debt owed to the private sector.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SEOUL (Reuters) - The escalating threat arising from nuclear-armed North Koreas recent series of missile tests is prompting South Korea to beef up its military muscle and experts warn it could spur an arms buildup elsewhere in Northeast Asia. South Korea and Japan are accustomed to the Norths frequent threats to attack. But the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang has raised fears of a sudden clash along the worlds most militarised border dividing the two Koreas, which might quickly escalate to all-out war. After North Koreas second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 28, South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered a speedy deployment of the controversial U.S. THAAD anti-missile defense system, reversing his earlier decision to postpone it pending an environmental review.  This week, the U.S. Defence Department said it was actively considering revising bilateral ballistic missile guidelines with South Korea to allow Seoul to build more powerful missiles  at the Souths request. Moon told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation on Monday South Korea also wants to build a nuclear-powered submarine, presidential officials said. All of this could lead to further militarization of South Korea, said Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum. South Korea, which spends around a tenth of its annual budget on defense, is already home to some 625,000 local soldiers and more than 28,000 U.S. troops. The country, still technically at war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce and not a peace treaty, has deployed the U.S.-built Patriot missile defense system, as well as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system. Trump warned the North and its leader Kim Jong Un against attacking Guam or U.S. allies on Friday, a day after the isolated country said it was finalizing by mid-August a plan to launch four intermediate range missiles toward waters off the U.S. Pacific territory. If North Korea actually launches Hwasong-12 missiles towards Guam, theyre going to do it with all their other missiles, artillery and tanks ready for action, said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam Universitys Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. And we should be prepared too. Even before the latest spike in tensions, South Korea was seeking to enhance its missile-defense capabilities in the face of the unprecedented pace of North Korean missile tests. Japan, worried its ballistic missile defenses could be overwhelmed by swarm attacks or circumvented by warheads launched on lofted trajectories, is likely to acquire a ground-based version of the Aegis missile defense system. It is also mulling the acquisition of munitions that would allow it to strike North Korea missile sites. The greatest threat to both states remains shorter range artillery, artillery rockets and stockpiles of short-to-medium range missiles. The focus will primarily remainupon bolstering defensiverather than offensive capabilities, said Reed Foster, a defense analyst for IHS Janes. I dont believe that there will be any significant altering of East Asianprocurement strategies, despite the rhetoric emanating from North Korea, principally because for them the threat hasnt altered drastically, Reed added. Conservative lawmakers in Seoul in recent days have even called for a nuclear balance on the peninsula, saying Seoul should ask Washington to redeploy U.S. nuclear weapons if South Korea is unable to develop its own. The United States withdrew nuclear weapons from South Korea in 1992, when the two Koreas agreed to make the peninsula nuclear free. In violation of that agreement as well as U.N. Security Council resolutions, North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests. Now is the right time to actively look at bringing back tactical nuclear weapons, Chung Woo-taik, floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, told Reuters. North Korea broke the denuclearisation agreement a long time ago. Reintroducing nuclear weapons remains an unlikely scenario, as that would undermine demands from Seoul and Washington for North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs. For now, officials are instead focused on changing the missile guidelines, which allow Seoul to have ballistic missiles with a flight range capped at 800 km (497 miles), topped with a maximum 500 kg (1,102 pounds) warhead. South Korea is less focused on increasing the flight range, as that could face opposition from neighbors including China, Russia and Japan, and the 800-km range limit covers all of North Korea in any case, senior government officials said. Rather, Seoul wants to double the maximum payload to 1,000 kg or greater, powerful enough to target underground bunkers or nuclear sites within the North, the officials said. Thats still a fraction of the size of the mother of all bombs, which the United States dropped on a suspected Islamic State target in Afghanistan in April. The 21,600-pound GBU-43 bomb is one of the largest non-nuclear devices used in combat.    ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

I am concerned by reports that detainees are not receiving due legal process and are being held in inhumane conditions, Ojea Quintana said in a statement issued in Geneva. North Korean authorities are obliged to provide foreign detainees with access to consular support and an interpreter, but these entitlements cannot be taken for granted, based on the information I have been receiving, he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which visits detainees worldwide, does not have access to political prison camps in North Korea, believed to hold some 100,000 people. U.S. President Donald Trump issued a new threat to North Korea on Friday, saying American weapons were locked and loaded as Pyongyang accused him of driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of nuclear war. These threats divert attention from the situation of ordinary North Koreans, whose subsistence and protection needs should be treated as an absolute priority, said Ojea Quintana, an Argentine lawyer who took up the independent U.N. post last year. A 2014 U.N. report catalogued massive violations in North Korea  including large prison camps, starvation and executions  that it said should be brought to the International Criminal Court (ICC).  The landmark report, strongly rejected by Pyongyang, said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be personally responsible for crimes against humanity.

The travel ban barring refugees and people from six Muslim-majority nations was signed as an executive order in March, after an earlier version had to be scrapped in the face of legal challenges. Two federal appeals courts blocked the revised order from taking effect until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June it could move forward on a limited basis. The nations highest court has agreed to hear oral arguments about the lawfulness of the ban on Oct. 10, and the brief laid out the legal position the government plans to make. The state of Hawaii and refugee organizations challenging the executive order claim it is discriminatory against Muslims, citing statements Trump made on the campaign trail calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. However, the government, hammering against a broad ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked the ban, said campaign statements made by the president when he was a private citizen should not be taken into account. The brief said it was a mistake to probe the presidents motives in decisions about national security, which would amount to inappropriate judicial psychoanalysis of the president. Trump said the order was necessary to review vetting procedures to help protect the country from terrorist attacks.  The Department of Justice argued the case would invite impermissible intrusion on privileged internal Executive Branch deliberations and that the plaintiffs in the case were calling for up to 30 depositions of White House staff and Cabinet-level officials. The government repeated its stance that Congress has granted the president wide authority to limit refugee admissions and bar the entry of any foreigner or group of foreigners if it would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  The Supreme Court ruled parts of the revised March executive order could go into effect on June 29, finding that anyone from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen with a bona fide relationship to a U.S. citizen or entity could not be barred. However, the government excluded grandparents and other family members from the definition of who would be allowed in, leading to another round of legal sparring. Eventually the Supreme Court said that, while litigation continues over enforcement of the ban in lower courts, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and siblings-in-law of people from the six countries would be let in but that refugees with relationships with U.S. resettlement agencies would not.  Attorney Neal Katyal, who is representing Hawaii in its challenge to the ban, said in an email on Thursday: We look forward to the Supreme Court hearing our case in October.

Breaking nearly two weeks of silence on Putins July 30 order cutting U.S. embassy and consulate staff by nearly two thirds, Trump said: Im very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll. Trump said theres no real reason for them to go back and were going to save a lot of money, in response to Putins Cold War-style move, differing from the reactions of other presidents in similar circumstances in the past. It also clashes with a State Department official having called Moscows order a regrettable and uncalled-for act. On Thursday, the State Department had no immediate reaction to the comments Trump made to reporters while on vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign by hacking and other methods to help Trump, a Republican. They are also looking into possible collusion between the campaign and Russian officials. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. Putin, reacting to new sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress and reluctantly signed into law by Trump, ordered Washington to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consulate staff by September. Many of those affected likely will be local Russian staffers. It was also a tit-for-tat reaction to former President Barack Obama expelling 35 Russian diplomats from the United States last December over the intelligence agency reports. During his campaign and since becoming president, Trump has consistently called for better ties with Russia, declined to criticize Putin and refused to unequivocally embrace the conclusions of the intelligence agencies.  Intended to be flippant or not, Trumps remarks on Thursday were immediately denounced by current and former U.S. officials who have served both Republican and Democratic administrations. Nicholas Burns, the State Departments third-ranking official under Republican President George W. Bush, called Trumps comments grotesque. If he was joking, he should know better, said Burns, now a professor at Harvard Universitys John F. Kennedy School of Government. If he wasnt, its unprecedented. A president has never defended the expulsion of our diplomats.  The State Department has horrified and rattled by Trumps remarks, said a veteran U.S. diplomat who has served in Russia, speaking on condition of anonymity. And Heather Conley, formerly a top State Department official dealing with European affairs, said the expulsions of hundreds of people from an important U.S. embassy is extraordinary and it is very difficult to see how the president could view these expulsions as a positive development in any form. In additional remarks on Thursday, Trump said he was surprised by the FBI raid last month on the home of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, adding that it sent a strong signal. Trump said he has not given any thought to the possibility of firing special counsel Robert Mueller. In May, Trump dismissed James Comey, who was Director of the FBI when Trump went into office seven months ago. As presidential candidate, Trump invited Russia to dig up thousands of missing emails from Democratic rival Hillary Clintons time as secretary of state, vexing intelligence experts and prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging a foreign country to spy on Americans. Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump said on the campaign. Clinton kept a private server from 2009 to 2013.

In a sign of the Trump administrations struggles to advance its domestic policy agenda, the three-to-five-page document would not be accompanied by tax legislation, as some had expected, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. But the framework would come from the Big Six congressional and administration leaders on tax reform, the same group that released a joint statement on taxes in July, after months of closed-door talks. It was unclear whether all of the Big Six members have agreed on the release. But two sources said the White House has told business representatives and lobbyists in recent days to expect a tax reform framework next month. The White House had no comment. White House legislative director Marc Short told a July forum he expected legislation to come before lawmakers for debate after the Sept. 4 U.S. Labor Day holiday and be voted on in the House of Representatives and the Senate in October and November. Sources said the framework document would not be accompanied by legislation. But it could provide a starting point for a tax bill. It would lay out areas of agreement between the Trump administration, the Senate and the House of Representatives, and could also include input from discussions with Democrats. Financial markets rallied in late 2016 and early this year on expectations that Trump would cut corporate taxes early in his presidency. But after more than six months in power, he has yet to score a major legislative victory or introduce significant legislation of any kind to Congress.  Corporate lobbyists and independent analysts say tax legislation, if it can move forward at all, is unlikely to be approved before early 2018. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch have said they plan to consider tax legislation later this year. But neither has set a deadline. The Big Six  Brady, Hatch, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn  said in their July statement that they were charging the two committees with developing and drafting legislation.

(Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday an Obama-era experimental defense outpost in Silicon Valley would grow in importance under the Trump administration and that the nations technology entrepreneurs were vital to national defense. Mattis paid his first official visit to the Pentagons Defense Innovation Experimental Unit, or DIUx, in Mountain View, California, as part of a two-day outreach tour to the U.S. technology industry intended to highlight the Pentagons commitment to technology innovation. There is no doubt in my mind that DIUx will not only continue to exist, it will actually grow in its influence and its impact on the Department of Defense, Mattis told reporters during brief remarks at the DIUx facility. DIUx was set up two years ago by Mattis predecessor, Ash Carter. It serves as a Pentagon hub for attracting private-sector innovation to solve complex and technical military challenges. But DIUx has faced criticism from some Republican lawmakers who have questioned its value and organization. The program underwent an overhaul in May 2016, less than a year after launching. Since June of last year DIUx has awarded $100 million in contracts for 45 pilot projects in areas including artificial intelligence, autonomous machines and space. The unit currently has 48 staff and is expected to grow to about 75 by the end of 2018, said Sean Singleton, DIUxs director of engagement. Mattis said DIUx would help the U.S. military become more lethal and more capable of defending our experiment that is called the United States of America. The units leadership was reporting directly to his senior staff, Mattis said, adding that he expected DIUx would help the military incorporate advances in artificial intelligence taking place in Silicon Valley. The defense secretarys visit came as the Trump administration has sparred with the technology industry on a host of issues, including immigration, climate change and privacy. Earlier on Thursday Mattis visited Amazons headquarters in Seattle. He was expected to visit Alphabets Google headquarters in Palo Alto, California, on Friday.

The United States sanctioned President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on widespread opposition. It has not placed sanctions on the OPEC members oil industry. Senators John Cornyn of Texas, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker of Mississippi said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters, that unilaterally blocking oil exports could harm the U.S. economy and Venezuelan people.  The United States imports about 740,000 barrels per day of oil from Venezuela.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the letter, which was addressed to President Donald Trump.    We believe it is critical to consider the role the U.S. energy industry and refining sector play in our economic and national security interest, the senators wrote. Blockading imports could inflict great harm on this industry and burden U.S. taxpayers with the cost. The senators said sanctions on shipments of Venezuelan oil to the United States could also increase the likelihood of a disorderly default by Venezuela, given the oil business is its  main source of revenue. Creditors could then seize Venezuelan oil assets and cut off the governments remaining sources of financing.  They also noted that such sanctions could expand the interests of China and Russia in Venezuelas oil business. Both countries have invested in Venezuela for years.     Sources have said the United States could use heavy crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve held in caverns along the Gulf Coast, to relieve any short-term supply pressure if Venezuelas shipments were blocked. Nearly 680 million barrels of oil are in reserve. A drilling boom in the United States has allowed the government to store more oil than it needs to meet international spare supply agreements.

During President Donald Trumps first six months in office, the Justice Department collected $12 million in civil penalties as part of 26 civil lawsuits. That compares to $36 million in 34 cases during the Obama administration; $30 million in 31 cases under the George W. Bush administration; and $25 million in 45 cases during the Clinton administrations first six months, the report by the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) found. If this drop-off in environmental enforcement continues, it will leave more people breathing more air pollution or swimming in waterways with more waste, said EIP Executive Director Eric Schaeffer, who served as the EPAs head of civil enforcement from 1997 to 2002. The report analyzed consent decrees lodged by the Justice Department from Trumps first day in office, Jan. 21, through July 31, evaluating penalties paid by companies, the amount those companies will spend on pollution controls and how much pollution these enforcement actions can reduce. Patrick Traylor, deputy assistant administrator at EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, reviewed a copy of the report and said the findings were unfair because it can take months for a consent decree to be lodged. This snapshot ... says much more about enforcement actions commenced in the later years of the Obama administration than it does about actions taken in the beginning of the Trump administration, he said in a statement. The report also found that value of injunctive relief, or the amount of money violators spend to install pollution controls and clean up, was also lowest in the Trump administration under EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Under Trump, injunctive relief required in 10 cases totaled $197 million, compared to $710 million in 16 cases under Bush and $1.2 billion in 22 under Obama, the report said. EPA did not collect this data until the later years of the Clinton administration, so results could not be compared. Environmental groups have raised concerns about Pruitts close ties to the energy industry, documented in public records of his meetings. When asked about his approach to enforcement and close industry ties in an interview with Reuters last month, Pruitt said the EPA is committed to enforcement and working with states to carry it out.

The Republican-backed law is the first of its kind since Republican Donald Trump became president in January, promising a crackdown on illegal immigrants and localities that protect them. Texas is the U.S. state with the longest border with Mexico.  U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks, appointed under Republican President George H.W. Bush, dismissed the case without prejudice late on Wednesday. The brief ruling did not give a reason. Senate Bill 4 calls for jailing police chiefs, sheriffs and possibly frontline officers who fail to cooperate with U.S. immigration officials. The measure also allows police to ask about immigration status during a lawful detention. After the law was approved in May, Texas sued major urban areas, including Austin, El Paso and Houston, as well as civil rights groups, saying they backed policies of non-cooperation with federal immigration officials. At a June hearing, Sparks asked why a court should declare the law constitutional before it took effect on Sept. 1. He also questioned why he should hear the case when most of the parties were part of a separate lawsuit over the same law being heard in a federal court in San Antonio. The defendants contended they had abided by federal law and the suit should be dismissed because Texas had no evidence showing it had been harmed by a law not yet in effect. Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Wednesday he was disappointed with the ruling on what he called an undoubtedly constitutional law. The American Civil Liberties Union, a civil rights group that has argued in court against the law, on Thursday said the Texas suit was a farce aimed at distracting attention from the harm that would come with SB 4.

I just want him to get repeal and replace done. Ive been hearing repeal and replace now for seven years ... Mitch, get to work and lets get it done, Trump told reporters at a briefing on his vacation. In the aftermath of last months collapse in the Senate of a years-long Republican campaign to gut the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, Trump has berated McConnell and other Republican senators, urging them to return to the divisive issue of reforming the U.S. healthcare insurance system. Many senators, including McConnell, have been making the case that it is time to move on to other policies, such as tax reform and improving infrastructure. Asked at the briefing in Bedminster, New Jersey, if McConnell should consider stepping down as Senate Republican leader, Trump said: If he doesnt get repeal and replace done, and he doesnt get taxes done ... and if he doesnt get a very easy one to get done - infrastructure - if he doesnt get them done, then you can ask me that question. But Trump also said, Where is repeal and replace? Now I want tax reform and tax cuts... so I say tax cuts, tax reform and I want a very big infrastructure bill. Trump had assailed McConnell on Twitter both Wednesday and Thursday, responding to a speech in which the Senate leader said Trump had excessive expectations of Congress on matters such as healthcare and did not understand how long it can take to pass major legislation. Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldnt get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare! Trump tweeted on Thursday. A spokesman for McConnell had no comment on Trumps tweets.   The Senates most senior Republican declared his support of McConnell. Senator Orrin Hatch, who is president pro tempore of the Senate, said on Twitter that McConnell has been the best leader weve had in my time in the Senate, through very tough challenges. I fully support him.   McConnells efforts to push through a healthcare bill collapsed last month when he failed to reconcile conflicting demands among conservatives and moderates in the party and get all of the Republicans in the Senate behind the legislation. The House passed its version of a healthcare bill in May.  Alienating the Senate majority leader could make it far more difficult for Trump to achieve his legislative goals. Trump has failed to notch a major legislative win since taking office in January, although Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives. The administration has also been mired in investigations into contacts between his presidential campaign and Russia, and distracted by infighting among high-level White House staff. McConnell, in a speech on Monday in his home state of Kentucky, said the administration had set too many artificial deadlines and was disappointed when lawmakers did not meet them. Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process, McConnell said. The blame game between the president, a real estate businessman who had never previously held public office, and McConnell coincides with opinion polls showing public approval rating for Congress and Trump dipping to new lows.

Most of the revenue created by the passage in May of the cessation fee - $1.50 per pack of cigarettes - was earmarked for health and human services agencies. These agencies and the people they serve cannot sustain the kind of cuts that will occur if we do not find a solution, Fallin said.

The court called the fee a revenue raising measure that was passed in violation of the states legislative process that requires that such measures cannot be passed in the last five days of a session. The measure also did not garner either a required supermajority vote in favor, or a vote by the people to pass. Lawmakers were attempting to fill an $878 million shortfall.

Businesses ranging in size from the corner Mom-and-Pop shop to accounting firms and industrial conglomerates are called pass-throughs because their profits flow to owners and are taxed as individual income, often at the top 39.6 percent rate.

Corporate profits are further taxed when they flow through to shareholders as dividends.

The Republican timeline is in doubt because of complexities posed by pass-throughs and other difficult issues that could roll the debate into 2018 and beyond, analysts and lobbyists said. Trump and Republicans, who control the House and Senate, want to give pass-throughs their own tax rate of 15-25 percent, saying such a low rate would help unleash economic growth by leaving owners with more money to hire and invest. The danger with this proposal is that high-income people who pay the top individual tax rate could reap enormous windfalls simply by reclassifying their wages and salaries as pass-through business income to qualify for the new low rate.       Tax avoidance schemes along these lines could erase up to $584 billion from government coffers over the next decade, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates that over 28 million businesses are organized as pass-throughs. Income from them has been taxed at the same rates as wages and salaries since the individual income tax was enacted in 1913. These are tough, tough questions. And politics aside, theyre what has held up tax reform for so long, said one corporate lobbyist, who asked not be identified. This is an area where theres still a lot of discussion and no solution. To address this, policymakers are looking at limiting how much of a business owners income should get pass-through treatment. But thats hard to define because pass-throughs range from sole proprietorships and partnerships to S-corporations. Rebecca Boenigk, chairman and chief executive of the pass-through manufacturer Neutral Posture, worries that Congress could choose solutions that inadvertently add complexity for small businesses and deny business owners the capital they need. Theres always a rule thats put into place to take care of the 1 percent of people who are bad, and that rule ends up affecting the 99 percent of people who are good, said Boenigk, who began making ergonomic furniture with her mother 28 years ago in their family garage.    One proposal under consideration would apply the pass-through rate to only 30 percent of a business owners income, while giving taxpayers the option of qualifying for more favorable treatment from the Internal Revenue Service, congressional sources and lobbyists said. The remaining 70 percent of income would be taxed at the higher individual rate.   The National Federation of Independent Business, a small business lobbying group in Washington, wants Congress and the Trump administration to apply the lower tax rate to 50 percent of a business owners income. Some lobbyists warn against the idea of allowing business owners to qualify for a higher percentage of income for the pass-through rate with the IRS, saying an additional layer of complicated procedures could backfire and encourage fraud.    Keith Hall, president of the National Association for the Self-Employed, would rather see business owners pay individual tax on a portion of their income set by living standards data for the geographical areas in which they live. But if lawmakers adopted the 70-30 approach, Hall said, higher earners should see the larger portions of their income qualify for the pass-through rate to maximize the amount of capital they can invest in their businesses.     Other proposals would limit the pass-through rate according to the business owners capital or stock value; exclude income from partnerships engaged in personal services such as law, accounting, medicine and engineering; or exclude passive income from royalties, rents, dividends and income. With Republicans pushing to overhaul the tax code before year-end, analysts say tax legislation could include a number of anti-abuse rules. Lawmakers arent going to know which anti-abuse measures work. If theyre risk-averse, they may throw in more than one, said Scott Greenberg, senior analyst at the Tax Foundation.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, fresh from their failed push to repeal Obamacare, are now tackling a project that has eluded Washington for 30 years - tax reform. Tax staffers are meeting in the House of Representatives and the Senate through the August break to work on legislation that is expected to be unveiled next month. Some analysts are skeptical that the fractious Republicans are up to comprehensive tax reform, even though the party controls both chambers, and say Republican may have to settle for a handful of tax cuts. Here are some of the key tax issues ahead. Americans pay a top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent. Trump wants to cut that top rate to 35 percent; House Republican leaders have proposed cutting it to 33 percent. In proposals to simplify taxes, Trump wants to shrink the number of tax brackets to three from seven and double the standard deduction, a set level of income exempt from tax. The latter move, analysts say, would sharply reduce the number of taxpayers who can claim certain narrower deductions, such as the ones for mortgage interest and charitable donations. Trump has also promised, without providing much detail, more help for families with child and dependent care expenses and to eliminate targeted tax breaks that benefit wealthy people. In two proposals that would help mainly high-income and wealthy taxpayers, Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. The estate tax, which Republicans call the death tax, is a tax on the assets left to heirs by people when they die. It is paid by very few Americans because it currently applies only to inheritances exceeding $5.49 million per person. The alternative minimum tax is a way to make sure that mostly high-earners who have many deductions pay some taxes. An effort by Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal former President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act and the taxes that support it failed in July. Those taxes, including a 3.8-percent surtax on investment income and a 0.9-percent payroll tax to support the Medicare healthcare program for the elderly, remain on the books for now.  Americans can deduct taxes paid to state and local governments from their federal tax bills. Trump and House Republican leaders want to end this. The proposal would most hurt states where Democrats dominate because those states tend to charge higher state and local taxes and provide more government services, with the result that their residents take larger federal deductions. But the proposal is opposed by at least 20 House Republicans, reducing its chances of enactment. Tax deductions for interest paid on mortgages and donations to charities are probably safe. Trump has promised to protect them. Yet, there has been discussion of lowering the cap on the mortgage interest deduction to $500,000 from $1 million. Analysts say that would generate enough revenue to cut the corporate tax rate by three percentage points, but such a move would pit upper-middle class and wealthy homeowners against multinational corporations.   Lobbyists for real estate businesses and philanthropies say  that, if the standard deduction doubled, fewer taxpayers would be able to claim the mortgage interest and charitable giving deductions. That could undermine home-buying and donations to philanthropies, they say. Corporations pay 35 percent of their profits in taxes, at least on paper. Trump wants to slash that to 15 percent; House Republicans want 20 percent; some lawmakers say 25 percent might be achievable. No consensus on the rate has been reached. PASS-THROUGH BUSINESSES Trump wants a special, low tax rate for pass-through businesses, which are private companies that pass their profits through to owners as income that is taxed at the individual rate. Most U.S. businesses are pass-throughs and range from family-run shops to large businesses. The idea of a special tax rate for them raises the prospect of a new wave of tax avoidance schemes with wage earners funneling income into pass-through structures. Under Republicans plans, about $2.6 trillion in corporate profits now parked abroad would be repatriated, or brought into the United States, and taxed at 3.5 percent to 8.75 percent payable over eight years. That rate would be way below the 35 percent tax that is owed now on those profits, but that is payable only if they enter the country. Republicans also want to change the corporate income tax so companies are no longer taxed on foreign profits by adopting a so-called territorial system, replacing the worldwide system in which U.S. companies are taxed on profits globally. The U.S. tax code allows corporations to defer tax payments on foreign profits held overseas. Corporations have been stockpiling profits abroad to avoid paying the 35 percent U.S. corporate rate, which under current law they would owe when the money is returned to U.S. soil. A House Republican border adjustment tax proposal meant to discourage imports and encourage exports has been dropped. Tax cuts generally reduce federal revenue and raise the budget deficit. The deficit is estimated in fiscal 2017 to hit $693 billion, or 3.6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), up from 3.1 percent in 2016. With that in mind, Republican deficit hawks could make it hard for Trump to push through any deficit-expanding tax measures. Some Republicans want Congresss nonpartisan, professional tax and budget analysts to make more use of dynamic scoring in estimating the impact of tax changes on the budget. The approach tends to assume an increased economic stimulus effect from tax cuts, resulting in smaller projected increases to the deficit. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Cuba has never, nor would it ever, allow that the Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic agents or their families, the foreign ministry said in a statement late on Wednesday. It reiterates its willingness to cooperate in the clarification of this situation. Havana said it had started a comprehensive, priority and urgent investigation into the alleged incidents after it had been informed of them by the embassy in February.  Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters that the exact nature of the incidents was unclear, but Americans serving in Cuba had returned to the United States for non life-threatening medical reasons. The United States first learned of the issues at the embassy in late 2016, she said. We dont have any definitive answers about the source or the cause of what we consider to be incidents, Nauert said. Its caused a variety of physical symptoms in these American citizens who work for the U.S. government. We take those incidents very seriously, and there is an investigation currently under way. As a result, the United States on May 23 asked two Cuban officials in Washington to leave the country and they have done so, Nauert said, an action that Cuba described as unjustified.  What this requires is providing medical examinations to these people, Nauert said. Initially, when theyd started reporting what I will just call symptoms, it took time to figure out what it was, and this is still ongoing. So were monitoring it. A U.S. government official said several colleagues at the U.S. embassy in Havana were evacuated back to the United States for hearing problems and other symptoms over the past six months. Some subsequently got hearing aids, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Washington and Havana re-established diplomatic relations in 2015 after more than five decades of hostilities, re-opening embassies in each others capitals and establishing a new chapter of engagement between the former Cold War foes. President Donald Trump rolled back part of his predecessor Barack Obamas policy toward Cuba, but has left in place many of the changes, including the re-opened U.S. Embassy in Havana.

Longtime political consultant and lobbyist Paul Manafort is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, said two people familiar with the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Manaforts spokesman Jason Maloni confirmed on Wednesday that the FBI executed a search warrant at one of Manaforts homes.  Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well, Maloni said in an email. Manaforts house in Alexandria, near Washington, was raided in the early morning of July 26, the Washington Post reported. The previous day Manafort had met with Senate Intelligence Committee staff, the Washington Post reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the probe. Tax documents and financial records were sought by agents for Mueller in the raid, the New York Times reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Muellers team is poring over Manaforts financial and real estate records in New York and his involvement in Ukrainian politics, the two sources told Reuters last month.   Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal called the raid a highly significant step and said it was typical of the most serious criminal investigations dealing with uncooperative or untrusted potential targets. The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment. Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for Muellers office, declined to confirm the raid. Trump has been attacking Blumenthal on Twitter this week after the senator urged Mueller to press his inquiry forward. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the presidential race, in part by hacking and releasing emails embarrassing to Trumps opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, to help him get elected in November. Trump has called Muellers investigation a witch hunt. Allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Moscow have hounded the Republican president since he took office in January, presenting a major distraction from his policy agenda. Russia has repeatedly denied meddling in the U.S. election. The Manhattan District Attorneys office has been trying to track money that Manafort used to buy properties in New York, and looking into millions of dollars of loans later taken out on the properties, according to a person familiar with the matter. The prosecutor issued a subpoena to Federal Savings Bank, a small Chicago bank founded by a former Trump campaign adviser,  and is interested in the loan paperwork, the person said. It is unclear when the subpoena went out, but the first subpoenas in the probe went out months ago, the person said. Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., declined to comment. Steve Calk, the banks chairman and CEO, who was named to Trumps economic advisory council during the campaign, declined to comment through a spokeswoman for the bank.  Mr. Manaforts real estate loans are all arms length transactions at or above market rates, said Maloni. There is nothing unusual about buying real estate through an LLC. The New York Attorney Generals office also is looking into Manaforts real estate transactions, another person said. One question for investigators was whether Manafort had knowledge of any Trump campaign dealings with Russia, including meetings with Russians with government ties, said one source familiar with Muellers work. The same question was relevant to investigators in regard to Trumps fired former national security adviser, retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the source said. Financial matters have paper trails that can be easy to pick up and follow, so thats a logical place to start, the source added. Congressional committees are looking at a June 2016 meeting in New York with a Russian lawyer organized by Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Trump Jr. released emails last month that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information about Clinton. Manafort attended the meeting. Legal experts noted that the FBI had enough evidence to get approval for a search warrant concerning Manafort.  Somewhere, there now exists under seal what is likely a very detailed affidavit laying out criminal allegations involving Paul Manafort, and specifically, there is probable cause to believe he has committed a crime or there is evidence of a crime at his home, said Alex Little, a former federal prosecutor now with the law firm Bone McAllester Norton.

President Trumps comment was unplanned and spontaneous, said a senior administration official who deals with the Korea issue and who requested anonymity. The comment was all Trump, said another administration official who, like the first, requested anonymity. Both officials said Trump, known for his off-the-cuff remarks, had not run that language by his senior aides beforehand. At an event on Tuesday on the topic of Americans over-using opioids, Trump said: North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. U.S. officials and analysts cautioned against engaging in rhetorical shouting matches with Pyongyang, which in turn said it was considering a strategy to fire missiles at the U.S.-held Pacific island of Guam, where there is a military air base. The White House pushed back on Wednesday, saying General John Kelly, Trumps chief of staff and others on the National Security Council team were well aware of the tone of the statement of the president prior to delivery. The words were his own. The tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in New Jersey, where Trump is at one of his golf courses on a working vacation. Sanders said that Kelly and others were clear the president was going to respond to North Koreas threats following the sanctions with a strong message in no uncertain terms. After two intercontinental ballistic missile tests by Pyongyang last month, the U.N. Security Council imposed new sanctions against North Korea, that could slash its annual export revenue by a third. Pyongyang warned it was ready to teach the United States a severe lesson. The senior administration official who deals with the Korea issue told Reuters:  There had not been any discussions about escalating the rhetoric in response to North Korean leader Kim (Jong Un)s statements or about the possible effects of doing that, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, it is important for the North Koreans to understand that this countrys strategic patience is exhausted and that our resolve to defend our allies, whatever is required to do that, is not. Privately two other U.S. officials, who also spoke on  condition of anonymity, said the presidents threat of fire and fury was not helpful and threatened to evoke an undesirable response from the North Korean leader. It also risked alienating U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, as well as adversaries China and Russia, all of whom Washington wants to help pressure Kim to abandon his pursuit of a robust nuclear arsenal capable of striking the continental United States. On Wednesday, Trump appeared to temper his comments by expressing hope that the U.S. nuclear arsenal would never need to be used. Senior administration officials found different ways to explain Trumps fire and fury remark. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to play down the tough talk, saying Trump was just trying to send a strong message in language North Koreas leader would understand because he doesnt seem to understand diplomatic language. Speaking to reporters before landing in Guam on a previously planned trip on Wednesday, he said there was no imminent threat from North Korea and Americans should sleep well at night. By contrast, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis used some of his strongest language yet on North Korea, warning Pyongyang it must stop any action that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people. He said North Koreas actions would continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates. The State Department said the White House, State Department and Department of Defense were all speaking with one voice. State Department Press Secretary Heather Nauert said Trump and Tillerson had spoken for an hour after the president made his fire and fury comment. We are all singing from the same hymn book, Nauert said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Mayor Rahm Emanuel unveiled the plan at the citys annual investors conference, saying it will be much more financially viable for Chicago. A chronic structural budget deficit and a huge unfunded pension liability that totaled $35.76 billion at the end of 2016 have pushed the citys general obligation (GO) credit ratings from the low end of investment grade to junk levels. As a result, investors have demanded higher interest rates for the citys debt. Illinois fiscal 2018 Illinois budget, which was enacted last month, included a provision allowing home-rule local governments like Chicago to assign their state revenue to an entity for the purpose of issuing debt. Carole Brown, Chicagos chief financial officer, said the state sales tax dollars would flow first through the new entity to meet debt service and other requirements before any of the revenue is released to the citys general fund. The state law also creates a statutory lien that would shield the bonds from a bankruptcy filing, which Illinois local governments are currently not allowed to pursue. Its one of the reasons that we expect the market will view (the new debt) favorably, why it will get higher ratings and why we think the cost differential with our (GO bonds) will be so great, Brown said.  An ordinance creating the program will be introduced in the city council this fall, according to Brown. If passed, Chicago would initially refund some of its more expensive GO debt and outstanding sales tax revenue bonds, she said, noting that New York, Philadelphia and Washington have similarly structured debt programs. From a credit standpoint, its a positive, said Richard Ciccarone, who heads Merritt Research Services, which provides research and data related to municipal bonds. He added that from a public policy standpoint, the move could tie up revenue the city may need for operations.  In a report last month, Fitch Ratings said debt issued under this new structure could attain a rating higher than the citys current GO rating.

Menendez had argued last month that his bribery and fraud charges should be dismissed because they were not criminal, under a June 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. That decision narrowed the definition of official acts, and said routine political activities such as arranging meetings and reaching out to public officials did not qualify.

Bloomberg News reported the leading choice of Simons earlier on Wednesday. The timing of a formal presidential nomination is not clear. Simons was head of the FTCs Bureau of Competition from June 2001 to August 2003 and has been involved in a number of major antitrust cases and acquisitions in private practice.

The FTC, which has five commission seats, now has only Ohlhausen and Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat. Two of the empty seats may go to Republicans, but the remaining seat must go either to a Democrat or an independent.

The Republican chairs of the committee and the subcommittee that would head any congressional investigations into insurance sales, Senators John Thune and Jerry Moran, along with those panels senior Democrats, Senators Bill Nelson and Richard Blumenthal, wrote to Wells CEO Timothy Sloan with questions about the scandal as basic as how many customers were affected. They also requested copies of the banks internal report that first identified the problem. The group sent similar questions to Barry Karfunkel, CEO of National General Holdings Corporation, which provided the insurance. Last week Moran said he was seeking additional information from Wells about reports the bank charged 800,000 borrowers for insurance without their knowledge or consent, but did not give specifics. Many borrowers already had cheaper insurance with other companies. The letter asks Sloan when the bank, which paid $190 million in fines and penalties last year over creating phantom bank accounts, first learned about the insurance sales practices and also what steps it is taking to prevent a recurrence and to refund the erroneous charges to customers. The letters do not mention possible hearings or subpoenas, but the senators have the authority launch an investigation using both if they are not satisfied with responses to their letters. Wells and National have until Aug. 23 to answer the questions. The Wells letter shows senators are concerned with reports that thousands of borrowers fell into delinquency because they could not afford the premiums on top of their monthly payments and the possibility bank management pushed employees to sign customers up for insurance with incentives or special benefits.  Incentives are at the heart of last years scandal, where employees said they created accounts in customers names or pushed account holders to buy additional products they did not need in order to meet high sales targets. The senators are also seeking information about possible commissions paid or revenues shared between Wells and National.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A Texas bill that would restrict insurance coverage for abortions was approved by the states Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Wednesday, a move critics called cruel and damaging to womens health. The House measure would ban insurance coverage for abortions and require women who wanted coverage to purchase a supplemental plan for an abortion, the latest effort by the most-populous Republican-controlled state to place restrictions on the procedure. If enacted, the bill would take effect on Dec. 1 and make Texas the 11th state to restrict abortion coverage in private insurance plans written in the state.  The Republican-dominated Senate has passed a similar bill, and Republican Governor Greg Abbott has shown support for the measures.  The bills backers say it would protect abortion opponents from subsidizing the procedure. A Democratic critic decried it as forcing people to buy rape insurance. Its a question of economic freedom and freedom in general, Republican Representative John Smithee, the bills sponsor, said in House debate on Tuesday ahead of the bill receiving preliminary approval. The Republican sponsor of the Senate bill, Brandon Creighton, has told local media supplemental coverage would cost $12 to $80 a year House Bill 214, which passed mostly on a party-line vote, does not offer exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Abortion rights groups are likely fight the measure in court if enacted. Women and parents will be faced with the horrific decision of having to purchase rape insurance to cover them if they are victimized, Democratic Representative Chris Turner said in a statement. This is not only ridiculous, but it is cruel.  Idaho, Kansas and Oklahoma are among the 10 other states that make abortion coverage a supplement on private plans. There are 25 states with restrictions on abortion coverage in plans set up by state exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act under former Democratic President Barack Obama, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks such legislation.  It is surprising that Texas has not done this before, said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager for Guttmacher.

Trump said on Twitter on July 26 that the U.S. government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the military, a reversal of Pentagon policy that the lawsuit said was made without consulting senior military commanders. The surprise announcement, citing healthcare costs and unit disruption, appealed to some in Trumps conservative political base but created uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the Pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly.  Trumps tweets appeared to dismiss findings from a RAND Corporation study commissioned by the Pentagon that found allowing transgender people to serve would cost little and have no significant impact on unit readiness. The White House and the Pentagon said they do not comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The service members suing the president are three U.S. Army soldiers, one U.S. Air Force airman and one member of the U.S. Coast Guard who are active duty. All have come out as transgender to their commanding officers but are anonymous in the lawsuit, named only as Jane Doe, for fear of retribution, said Jennifer Levi, a lawyer from GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders. The group filed the lawsuit along with the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was preparing its own lawsuit. The lawsuit said Trumps tweets violate the rights of the service members to due process and equal protection under the law. It asks the court to declare Trumps directive as unconstitutional and to issue injunctions to stop it. The defendants are listed as Trump, Defense Secretary James Mattis and other military leaders including Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford said in a memo a day after Trumps tweets that there would be no change in policy until Mattis received an official order from the president. That order has yet to be issued. In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect, Dunford said. Lawyer Levi said the plaintiffs, some of whom are near retirement, need not wait for an official policy because the tweets alone created uncertainty about their futures.

In a Tuesday letter seen by Reuters, U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy, who chairs the House Committee on Government and Oversight Reform (OGR), said he is concerned about the new revelations and is seeking more information about why the exculpatory results were not published by the NCI. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in Monsantos top-selling weedkiller Roundup. Gowdys letter to NIH Director Francis Collins follows a June report by Reuters which found that a senior scientist from the NCI knew that fresh data from a large research project known as the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) showed no links between glyphosate and cancer.  Draft scientific papers dating from 2013 containing the data were never published. Consequently, the information was not able to be taken into account during the March 2015 review of the pesticide by the World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). An NIH spokeswoman told Reuters the NIH had received Gowdys letter and will be responding directly to the committee. Aaron Blair, the senior scientist at the NCI who knew about the data and also chaired the IARC review, previously told Reuters the data was not published in time because there was too much to fit into one scientific paper. Blair is now retired from the NCI. An NCI spokeswoman told Reuters in June the institute was drafting a manuscript on this topic. It would explore the effects of glyphosate exposure in greater depth, she said, and would be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming months.     Gowdys letter asked for a briefing on these issues as soon as possible. It also asked for information and any documents relating to the unpublished AHS data on glyphosate.     No one at IARC, which is based in Lyon, France, was immediately available for comment late on Tuesday.     IARC concluded in 2015 that glyphosate, is a probable human carcinogen. It based its finding on limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient evidence in experimental animals.      The agencys assessment is at odds with other international regulators who have said the weedkiller is not a carcinogenic risk to humans.      The OGR has been looking into U.S. taxpayer funding of IARC. It began investigating IARCs operations in 2016 after several lawmakers raised questions about why U.S. taxpayers were funding an agency that often faces criticism for its work.  A letter by Jason Chaffetz, then chairman of the OGR, in September 2016, also addressed to the NIH director, described IARC as having a record of controversy, retractions, and inconsistencies and asked why the NIH continued to fund it.      In previous responses to questions about its assessments of glyphosate and many other substances, IARC has defended them as scientifically sound.  The agency says its monographs - the name it gives its classifications of carcinogens - are widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and ... freedom from conflicts of interest.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, formerly chief executive of Exxon Mobil and new to government, has initiated a top-to-bottom re-organization of the agency, saying it will improve diplomats experience and help the department better meet 21st-century challenges. Re-design is not a synonym for layoffs, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan was quoted as saying by two officials who listened to his remarks to around 450 employees at a town hall-style event that was closed to journalists. Diplomats have fretted over a hiring freeze that has hampered their ability to switch jobs, the slow pace of appointments to senior positions, and a proposed 28 percent cut in State Department funding. Sullivan acknowledged in remarks to a small group of reporters after the event that the pace of senior job hires had been frustrating. Tillerson is not directing any specific outcome from the re-design, which is being led by senior career officials, other than a better-running and more efficient department, Sullivan said. According to the Partnership for Public Service, which tracks political appointments, the Trump administration has not yet put forward a nominee for 86 of 131 Senate-confirmed positions at the department, including posts leading diplomacy on the Middle East and East Asia, where there are several potential crises. No one here would say that were pleased by the fact that we dont have more of our undersecretary and assistant secretary slots filled, but were working hard to do that, Sullivan told reporters. Sullivan said media portrayals of a listless bureaucracy and a hollowed-out State Department that is not effective were wrong. He said work was being done on major issues such as the North Korea nuclear and missile programs, a rift between Gulf nations and Qatar and Ukraine. State Department officials said the tone of the town hall event was professional, with pointed exchanges of views at times. One said that Sullivans public appreciation for career diplomats has been desperately needed. Sullivans uncle was William H. Sullivan, the last U.S. ambassador to Iran, who left in 1979 when Irans monarchy was overthrown and replaced with an Islamic theocracy. In response to a question from an employee about State Department efforts for gay and lesbian couples posted abroad, Sullivan told employees he would do everything he can to make sure everyone is treated fairly, a remark that drew strong applause, one of the officials said.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump promised to win the fight against a U.S. epidemic of opioid drug use, but offered no new steps to do so and did not act on a recommendation made by a presidential commission that he declare a national emergency. Trump spoke at an event he had billed as a major briefing on the opioid crisis during a two-week working vacation at his private golf club in New Jersey. He also used the appearance to unexpectedly issue a stern warning to North Korea over its threats to the United States. The Republican president said the United States has no alternative but to stem spreading opioid use, but more than six months into his presidency announced no new policies to combat a public health crisis that kills more than 100 Americans daily. Im confidant that by working with our healthcare and law enforcement experts we will fight this deadly epidemic and the United States will win, Trump told reporters. Were also very, very tough on the southern border where much of this comes in, and were talking to China, where certain forms of man-made drug comes in, and it is bad. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said the administration was still working to devise a comprehensive strategy to be presented to Trump in the near future. A commission created by Trump to study opioid abuse urged him last week to declare a national emergency to address what it called an opioids crisis, framing its death toll in the context of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. An emergency declaration could free up federal resources for the effort. The resources that we need or the focus that we need to bring to bear to the opioid crisis at this point can be addressed without the declaration of an emergency, although all things are on the table for the president, Price told a later news briefing. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in more than 33,000 U.S. deaths in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, and estimates show the death rate has continued rising. The commission, headed by Republican New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie, recommended steps such as waiving a federal rule that restricts the number of people who can get residential addiction treatment under the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and disabled. The commission cited government data showing that since 1999 U.S. opioid overdoses have quadrupled, adding that nearly two thirds of U.S. drug overdoses were linked to opioids such as heroin and the powerful painkillers Percocet, OxyContin and fentanyl. Speaking alongside Price, White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said, We are a nation that consumes legal and illegal drugs at a very high and alarming rate. The problem is very complicated, and currently we are on the losing side of this war. Conway said the crisis cannot be solved overnight, and that most of the great work is being done at the state and local levels. Conway called it a nonpartisan issue in search of bipartisan support and bipartisan solutions. Even before Trumps event, the Democratic National Committee slammed him, with spokesman Daniel Wessel saying in a statement: Trump promised hed come to the aid of communities ravaged by the opioid epidemic, but so far hes done nothing for them. Trumps initial federal budget called for a 2 percent increase in drug treatment programs and would provide funds to increase border security to stop the flow of drugs into the country.  Substance abuse treatment activists have criticized his proposed cuts to federal prevention and research programs as well as his calls to shrink Medicaid, which covers drug treatment for hundreds of thousands of Americans.  Officials from New Hampshire criticized Trump last week after a leaked transcript of a January conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto showed Trump had called the New England state, hard-hit by the opioid epidemic, a drug-infested den. New Hampshire sued OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP on Tuesday, joining several state and local governments in accusing the drugmaker of engaging in deceptive marketing practices that helped fuel opioid addiction. The lawsuit followed similar ones against Purdue and other drugmakers by Oklahoma, Mississippi, Ohio and Missouri and several cities and counties in California, Illinois, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and New York. Price said Trumps administration was taking no position on such suits. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Were only six months into the experiment with Trump. Some experiments are ended early for ethical reasons, Gore said, acknowledging the provocative nature of his comment. Gore said he was convinced that U.S. cities, states and business executives would meet U.S. obligations under the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change, despite Trumps decision in June to withdraw from the global pact. We have a global agreement and the American people are part of this agreement in spite of Donald Trump, he told hundreds of moviegoers at Berlins Zoo Palast cinema after a showing of his new film, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. We can win this ... All we need is the political will, he said, adding his hope that the United States would soon once again have a leader who was committed to halting global warming. The film argues that fighting climate change is a just, moral battle, on a par with social movements such as the civil rights movement in the United States or the fight for gay rights. Gores first documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, is credited with bringing climate change into mainstream political discourse in the United States a decade ago. Gore said he was confident the American and German people would remain united in their commitment to reversing the devastating effects of climate change already visible around the world on a daily basis. He said he was heartsick about Trumps decision to pull out of the Paris deal, but said it could trigger an even stronger commitment by other nations to reduce greenhouse gases as an act of defiance. He lauded Germanys leadership in moving toward alternative energy sources, and said global moves to shift to solar and wind power would drive economic growth and create many new jobs. The U.S. State Department last week officially informed the United Nations that it would withdraw from the Paris deal, but left the door open to re-engaging if the terms improved for the United States. But, in a diplomatic cable, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told U.S. diplomats to sidestep questions from foreign governments on what it would take for the U.S. government to re-engage in the Paris climate deal, Reuters reported earlier on Tuesday.

The Trump administration has asked Congress to extend the federal borrowing capacity to meet U.S. payment obligations with a clean bill that does not include any other provisions.  Asked if the House would act to pass such a bill when lawmakers return to Washington next month, U.S. Representative Tom Cole said probably not clean. Most Republicans want to do something to lower the trajectory of the debt, Cole, a member of the House  Appropriations and Budget committees, told MSNBCs Morning Joe program.  Disagreements over the countrys borrowing capacity have prompted skirmishes for years. The latest tussle among Republicans follows a fight over healthcare legislation that left the party unable to make good on years of promises to  repeal and replace Obamacare, and has also raised concern among some investors.. The Treasury is expected to fully exhaust its remaining borrowing capacity in October. More fiscally conservative House Republicans see the debt ceiling issue as tied to deficit-reduction, and want to include spending cuts or the selling off of government assets  something Cole, a more establishment Republican, backed on Tuesday. Representative Mark Walker, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee, said in a Washington Examiner Op-Ed article that a debt ceiling agreement should also address any future crises and recommended two conservative measures to that end. Both measures would require the government to issue new bonds to pay principal and interest on debt held by the public and by two Social Security trusts. One would also allow the president to rescind budget authority over unobligated funds and to order the sale of government assets.  Both these measures are steps in the right direction, wrote Walker, whose group represents the Houses largest conservative caucus. Both the House and the Senate left for summer recess until early September despite requests from the White House to pass a debt limit bill before the congressional break this month.   Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said debate over the issue could stretch into September, when lawmakers must also pass separate legislation to fund day-to-day government activities before the fiscal year ends later that month.

(Reuters) - South Carolina is suing the U.S. government to recover $100 million in fines it says the Department of Energy owes the state for failing to remove one metric ton of plutonium stored there, state Attorney General Alan Wilson said on Tuesday. The lawsuit, filed on Monday, is the states largest case ever against the U.S. government, Wilson said in a news release. Congress approved fines of $1 million per day for the first 100 days of each year through 2021, beginning last year, if the weapons-grade plutonium was not removed from the Savannah River Site at the states border with Georgia, the attorney generals office said. The lawsuit seeks money owed this year. The state is still working on a claim for 2016 fines as well, Wilson said. The federal government cannot break its obligations and leave South Carolina as the permanent dumping ground for weapons-grade plutonium, Wilson, a Republican, said in the complaint. A Department of Energy spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. Built in the 1950s, the U.S.-owned Savannah River Site processes and stores nuclear materials in support of national defense and U.S. nuclear nonproliferation efforts. A U.S. treaty with Russia in 2000 required each country to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium, left over from the Cold War. The United States began building a mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility, known as the MOX project, at the Savannah River Site to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium by mixing it with uranium to form safer fuel pellets for use in commercial nuclear reactors. But the project is years overdue and billions over budget, and the technology for the new fuel fabrication is not fully developed.Russian President Vladimir Putin last October pulled out of the plutonium pact amid rising tensions over Ukraine and Syria.  The Trump administration proposed in the fiscal year 2018 budget to scrap the project and pursue diluting the plutonium and disposing it underground, an alternative called for by the Obama administration.

The cable, sent by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to embassies on Friday, also said diplomats should make clear the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels. In the wake of President Donald Trumps announcement in June that the United States would withdraw from the accord, the cable tells diplomats to expect foreign government representatives to ask questions like: Does the United States have a climate change policy? and Is the administration advocating the use of fossil fuels over renewable energy? If asked, for example, What is the process for consideration of re-engagement in the Paris Agreement?, the answer should be vague: We are considering a number of factors. I do not have any information to share on the nature or timing of the process, the cable advises.  A U.S. State Department official declined to comment on the cable. (Click here for a link to the cable: here ) Trump, a Republican, had campaigned on a promise to cancel the Paris deal, saying he believed it would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars while leaving developing nations such as China unfettered. In a sharp difference with the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, Trump has several times called climate change a hoax. In June, Trump left the door open to re-engagement if terms improved. The United States will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal thats fair, he said. The State Department guidance clarifies that right now, there are no plans to seek to re-negotiate or amend the text of the Paris Agreement. But it adds: The President is sincere in his commitment to look for a path to re-engage that takes into account his concerns for U.S. economic growth and energy security.    The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming. The United States, under the Obama administration, had promised to cut emissions as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.  Separate from the diplomatic cable, the Trump administration is reviewing a draft report written by scientists across 13 federal government agencies that shows the effects of climate change pose dire, near-term threats to the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the draft, which The New York Times published on Monday. The report puts the White House in the awkward position of either clearing the reports findings or editing them.  The diplomatic guidance makes clear that the United States intends to attend global climate summits during the prolonged process of withdrawing from the Paris deal to protect U.S. interests. The next summit is in November.  A U.S. official said a major priority in these talks would be to beat back attempts to have separate standards in the guidance on emissions cuts for rich and poor nations - long a sticking point in negotiations. Theres certainly nothing in the policies of this administration that would make us think that we should be acting differently, the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal memo.  The cable also anticipates questions over why the United States has changed its policy to make it easier for global development banks such as the World Bank to finance coal-fired power projects. In 2013 the Obama administration said the United States would oppose most coal projects, guidance since altered by the Trump administration.  The new principles will allow the (United States) the flexibility to approve, as appropriate, a broad range of power projects, including the generation of power using clean and efficient fossil fuels and renewable energy, the cable said.

The Justice Department filed legal papers with the high court on Monday staking out the new position in the voting rights case, backing the Republican-led states policy to purge inactive voters. Former President Barack Obamas Justice Department had argued in a lower court that Ohios policy violated the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which Congress passed to make it easier for Americans to register to vote.  Civil liberties advocates who challenged Ohios policy have said it illegally erased thousands of voters from registration rolls and can disproportionately impact minorities and poor people who tend to back Democratic candidates. The state on Tuesday welcomed the administrations action but voting rights advocates opposed it. The League of Women Voters accused the administration of playing politics with our democracy and threatening the fundamental right to vote by siding with an Ohio policy it said disenfranchises eligible voters. Our democracy is stronger when more people have access to the ballot box - not fewer, the Democratic National Committee added.  The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati last year blocked Ohios policy, ruling that it ran afoul of the 1993 law. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed in May to hear the case.  The legal brief filed by the Justice Department said President Donald Trumps administration had reconsidered the governments stance and now supports Ohio. The brief, signed by Acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, argued that Ohios policy is sound because it does not immediately remove voters from the rolls for failing to vote, but only triggers an address-verification procedure.  The American Civil Liberties Union last year sued Ohio Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted over the policy. The suit said the policy led to the removal of tens of thousands of people from the voter rolls in 2015. Husted said in a statement he welcomed the federal governments support, noting Ohios policy has been in place for more than two decades and administered the same way by both Republican and Democrat secretaries of state. Under Ohios policy, if registered voters miss voting for two years, they are sent registration confirmation notices. If they do not respond and do not vote over the following four years, they are removed from the rolls. Ohio officials argue that canceling inactive voters helps keep voting rolls current, clearing out those who have moved away or died. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking steps at the state level, including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government-issued identification, intended to suppress the vote of groups who generally favor Democratic candidates.

The poll of more than 3,100 people offered a glimpse of private-sector expectations about tax reform that are less optimistic than public statements from Trump administration officials and lawmakers. Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing to get the corporate income tax rate down from 35 percent to 15-20 percent, saying that doing so would drive U.S. economic growth and competitiveness in coming years. Just under half of the polls participants viewed a lower corporate rate as being the main economic driver of tax reform, but nearly 40 percent predicted the rate would end up at 25 percent, due to the political and budgetary challenges facing tax reform.  Thirty-one percent of those surveyed by the professional services firm during a July 18 Deloitte webcast expected a corporate tax rate of 20 percent. Only 5.3 percent believed Trumps 15 percent rate would become law. Republicans have pledged to enact the most sweeping tax overhaul since the Reagan era before year-end. An ambitious White House timeline calls for legislation to be unveiled in September and voted on in the House of Representatives and Senate before the end of November. Still, about 74 percent of those surveyed were doubtful or not at all confident that a comprehensive tax reform bill would be enacted in 2017. Less than 19 percent were confident or somewhat confident that it would happen this year. More than 63 percent believed compromise to be the necessary ingredient for Congress to succeed at tax reform, a quality that has proved elusive for Republican lawmakers so far this year.

That could change this week as President Donald Trumps top trade negotiator and other senior U.S. officials head to the West African nation of Togo to review a Clinton-era free trade pact with sub-Saharan Africa, in the administrations first high-level delegation to visit the region. Looming over the two-day ministerial is Chinas growing role in African trade and influence, as Beijing finances massive infrastructure projects in the region, some through its new Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank.  While U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa as a whole have doubled to $21.81 billion from $10.96 billion in 2000, according to U.S. Commerce Department data, they were dwarfed by Chinas $102 billion in exports to the region in 2015. Also at issue is whether the Trump officials, led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, will signal a desire to change the trade agreement before it expires in 2025. Trump has sought to bolster his America First campaign by withdrawing from the Trans Pacific Partnership, threatening to rip up NAFTA and seeking to renegotiate the U.S.-South Korea free trade deal. Launched in 2000, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has been barely mentioned by any Trump officials.   But no moves toward an early renewal or extension of AGOA are expected, said Constance Hamilton, deputy assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Africa.    Lighthizer will stress the importance to the administration of deepening its trade relationship with Africa, but will also caution that African countries should engage in fair trade, eliminate barriers to U.S. exports and abide by the eligibility criteria of the AGOA program, said Hamilton.   The U.S. trade deficit with the 38 AGOA countries shrank to about $7.9 billion last year from a peak of $64 billion in 2008,  as U.S. shale oil production increases have lessened the need for oil imports from major exporters Nigeria and Angola. Overshadowing the talks will be an out-of-cycle review of AGOA trade benefits to Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania, which have  supported a phased ban on imports of second-hand clothing. U.S. groups say the move violates AGOA rules. The fact that we accepted the petition under the Trump administration, I wont say that means were any harder on any countries, it just says we respect the criteria, said Hamilton, who emphasized that the issue was still under review by USTR. The administration has paid little attention to developing a U.S.-Africa policy, said Kim Elliot, a trade expert at the Washington-based Center for Global Development. This administration has just shown almost zero interest in Africa, said Elliot. It has not been a big focus, there is no sign at all that it has engaged the presidents interest. Scott Eisner, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerces U.S.-Africa Business Center, said African countries should look at reforms to attract more foreign investment. AGOA, in its current form, will likely become irrelevant for a number of markets by 2025, he said. Those governments that want to continue to count on the U.S. market need to be prepared to come to the table to have bi-lateral or regional trade talks - whether they are called a free trade agreement or something different, Eisner said. Peter Barlerin, a senior State Department official, said African nations need to start thinking about what comes after AGOA. Were not going to see AGOA stretching out to infinity, so eventually we will move into some other kind of arrangement, and that could include bilateral or larger free trade agreements with parts of Africa, he said.

Repealing the valuation rule provides a clean slate to create workable valuation regulations, Zinke said in a statement.  The valuation rule was proposed by former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell last year to close a loophole that enabled companies to dodge royalty payments when mining on taxpayer-owned public land. It required energy companies to pay royalties on sales to the first unaffiliated customer, known as an arms-length sale, as the fuel moves to market. A Reuters investigation found in 2012 that coal companies were using affiliated brokers to settle royalty payments on exports to Asia at much lower domestic prices. Zinke said the valuation rule had increased costs for coal, oil and gas companies, which hampered production on federal lands, making us rely more and more on foreign imports of oil and gas.  Industry stakeholders and trade associations filed three lawsuits challenging the Obama-era rule. Meanwhile, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a taxpayer watchdog group, found that taxpayers missed out on nearly $30 billion in revenues over three decades because of the loophole. The repeal of the valuation Rule was published in the Federal Register on Aug. 7 and will become effective on Sept. 6. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Republican governor called on Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza to tap more than $600 million in various state accounts first to pay bills. Authorization for the general obligation bonds and for using money parked in the accounts was included in the fiscal 2018 budget the Democratic-controlled legislature enacted in July over the governors vetoes. [nL1N1JX20R] Rauner also said the state cannot go to market with the debt until he works with state lawmakers to identify an appropriation or plan to pay off the new bonds.  This bonding in and of itself is not the answer, Rauner told reporters. In a video and statement on Monday, Mendoza said Illinois bill backlog is costing residents $2 million a day in late payment penalties that can reach as much as 12 percent a year. The bond authorization, which expires on Dec. 31, was aimed at having Rauners budget office sell the 12-year bonds at a lower interest rate.  The debt is covered under the Illinois GO Bond Act, which constitutes an irrevocable and continuing appropriation for principal and interest payments on all of the states outstanding bonds, according to budget legislation. Illinois unprecedented two-year budget impasse ballooned the unpaid bill total to a record $15.4 billion in June. As of Friday, the backlog stood at $14.35 billion.  Abdon Pallasch, a spokesman for the Democratic comptroller, said inter-fund transfers were already underway. What we need right now is movement by the governors office and a solid timetable for refinancing the debt so that our office can establish a comprehensive cash management plan for the remainder of fiscal year 2018, he said. On Monday, Illinois bonds due in 12 years were yielding  4.13 percent, according to Municipal Market Data, a unit of Thomson Reuters. Illinois has the lowest credit ratings and pays the highest borrowing costs among the 50 U.S. states. Since enacting its first budget in two years along with a $5 billion income tax hike, and subsequently evading junk bond ratings, the states so-called credit spread over MMDs benchmark triple-A yield scale has narrowed. Mendozas office said the new borrowing will provide some relief to service providers and businesses that have been waiting months for payment.  Over the past two years without a budget, they have had to exhaust their lines of credit, lay off employees and, in some cases, turn away Illinois citizens in need of services, a  statement from the comptroller said.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, said the federal policies force the nations third largest city to choose between its constitutional rights and funding for law enforcement. These new conditions also fly in the face of longstanding City policy that promotes cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant communities, the lawsuit said. The policies also include a requirement that local law enforcement agencies give federal authorities 48 hours notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Sunday that the city would sue, escalating a pushback against an immigration crackdown launched by Republican President Donald Trumps administration. We are bringing this legal challenge because the rhetoric, the threats from this administration embodied in these new conditions imposed on unrelated public safety grants funds are breeding a culture and climate of fear, Emanuels senior legal adviser, Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel, said on Monday.The conditions from the Justice Department apply to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, which provide money to hundreds of cities. Chicago is expected to receive $3.2 million this year for purchasing equipment. Siskel said the city will follow the initial complaint with a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the governments imposition of the new conditions.  The city will request a decision from the judge before the Sept. 5 deadline to apply for the Byrne grant, Siskel said. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Monday that Chicago officials have shown an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to reduce crime and protect law enforcement.  He added that more Chicagoans were murdered last year than residents of Los Angeles and New York combined, and that Chicago needed to reverse a culture of lawlessness. This administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety, Sessions said in a statement. The lawsuit is the first to challenge the Justice Department over the Byrne program but is not the first legal attack on the administrations sanctuary city policies.  Emanuel said on Sunday that the lawsuit would prevent the administration from setting a precedent that could be used to target other funding. Sanctuary cities in general offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York and San Francisco, are part of the sanctuary movement. Sanctuary city is not an official designation. The lawsuit came nearly two weeks after Sessions said the Justice Department would bar cities from the Byrne program unless they allowed immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and give the 48 hours pre-release notice. Chicago and its high murder rate have been frequently criticized by Trump, and cracking down on illegal immigration was a theme of his 2016 presidential campaign.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday denied that he is preparing for a presidential election run in 2020, saying the suggestion is disgraceful and offensive.  Pence was responding to a New York Times report that some Republicans were moving to form a shadow campaign as though President Donald Trump were not involved. It said multiple advisers to Pence have already intimated to party donors that he would plan to run if Mr. Trump did not. The report said Pence had not only kept a full political calendar but also had created his own independent power base, including a political fund-raising group called the Great America Committee. But Pence called the article fake news and said his entire team was focused on advancing Trumps agenda and seeing him re-elected in 2020.  The allegations in this article are categorically false and represent just the latest attempt by the media to divide this Administration, Pence said in a statement. The Times stood by its coverage. We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting and will let the story speak for itself, New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in an email. Pence has good relations with conservative political groups and some of the Republican Partys big donors, including billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.  He is also a Trump loyalist, and there is typically little distinction between his public statements and the policies of the president. But as investigations deepen into Russias alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible ties to members of Trumps campaign, Pence has put some distance between himself and the president on the best way to approach Moscow.  On a trip to Eastern Europe last week, Pence condemned Russias presence in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, with which Moscow fought a brief war in 2008. He also said ties with Russia would not improve until Moscow changed its stance on Ukraine and withdrew support for countries like Iran, Syria and North Korea. The U.S. Congress recently passed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia with overwhelming bipartisan support, but Trump signed it into law last week with reluctance. Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low, Trump wrote on Twitter after signing the bill. You can thank Congress.  Trump has described probes into his campaigns ties to Russia, including those under way in Congress and a Justice Department investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as a witch hunt. The president has also sent mixed messages on whether he agrees with U.S. intelligence agencies conclusions that Russia tried to intervene in the 2016 election to boost his chances of beating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday also dismissed the idea that Pence was looking at running for president in 2020.       It is absolutely true that the vice president is getting ready for 2020 - for re-election as vice president, Conway told ABCs This Week on Sunday. Vice President Pence is a very loyal, very dutiful, but also incredibly effective vice president, and active vice president, said Conway, adding that she had worked for Pence for a decade as his pollster and senior adviser.

The moves come after Republican senators last month failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare reform law, creating uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million Americans will be funded and managed in 2018. Hundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months. Nevada had said in June that residents in 14 counties out of 17 in the state would not have access to qualified health plans on the state exchanges. Anthems decision to leave the state entirely does not increase the number of bare counties in the state, Nevada Insurance Commissioner Barbara Richardson said in a statement. The insurer will still offer catastrophic plans, which can be purchased outside the states exchange and are only available to consumers under 30 years old or with a low income. Anthem also said it will only offer Obamacare plans in 85 of Georgias 159 counties. It said the counties it will continue to offer the plans in are mostly rural counties that would otherwise not have health insurance coverage for their residents.  It said these changes do not impact Anthems Medicare Advantage, Medicaid or employer-based plans in either state.   The company said last week that it will pull out of 16 of 19 pricing regions in California in 2018 where it offered Obamacare options this year.  Anthem blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would maintain subsidies that keep costs down.  U.S. President Donald Trump last week threatened to cut off subsidy payments that make the plans affordable for lower-income Americans and help insurers to keep premiums down, after efforts to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, failed in Congress.  Trump has repeatedly urged Republican lawmakers to keep working to undo Obamas Affordable Care Act. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Tillerson said Russia had also expressed some willingness to resume talks about the crisis in Ukraine, where a 2015 ceasefire between Kievs forces and Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country is regularly violated. We should find places we can work together... In places we have differences were going to have to continue to find ways to address those, Tillerson told reporters. Tillerson met his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on the sidelines of an international gathering in Manila on Sunday, where he also asked about Moscows retaliation against new U.S. sanctions. Tillerson said he told Lavrov the United States would respond to the Kremlins order for it to cut about 60 percent of its diplomatic staff in Russia by September 1. We have not made a decision on how we will respond to Russias request to remove U.S. diplomatic personnel. I asked several clarifying questions...I told him we would respond by September first, Tillerson said. The meeting was their first since President Donald Trump reluctantly signed into law the sanctions that Russia said amounted to a full-scale trade war and ended hopes for better ties. Lavrov on Sunday said he believed his U.S. colleagues were ready to continue dialogue with Moscow on complex issues despite tensions. Tillerson said he discussed Russias suspected meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with Lavrov to help them understand how serious this incident had been and how seriously it damaged the relationship between the two nations. But Tillerson said that should not irreversibly damage ties. The fact that we want to work with them on areas that are of serious national security interest to us, and at the same time having this extraordinary issue of mistrust that divides us, that is just what we in the diplomatic part of our relationship are required to do, Tillerson said. The United States sent its special representative on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, a former U.S. envoy to NATO, to Ukraine last month to assess the situation in the former Soviet republic. Washington cites the conflict as a key obstacle to improved relations between Russia and the United States. We appointed a special envoy to engage with Russia but also coordinating with all parties.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has shown an affinity, and perhaps even a deference, to the generals he has surrounded himself with in his Cabinet and at the White House, save one exception: the war in Afghanistan. More than a dozen interviews with current and former U.S. officials familiar with the discussions reveal a president deeply frustrated with the lack of options to win the 16-year-old war, described internally as an eroding stalemate.  The debate carries echoes of the same dilemma Barack Obama faced in 2009. Then, as now, odds are that Trump will ultimately send more troops, current and former officials say. Its the least worst option, one former U.S. official familiar with the discussions said, speaking on condition of anonymity, while acknowledging that with Trump, a pullout cannot be completely ruled out. Trumps defense secretary, retired Marine Corps General Jim Mattis, has had the authority for nearly two months to add thousands more troops to the roughly 8,400 there now (down from a peak of more than 100,000 in 2011). Army General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, requested the troops back in February. But officials say Mattis wont use his authority until he has buy-in from Trump for a strategic vision for Americas longest war. Beyond more troops for Afghanistan, the strategy would aim to address militant safe havens across the border in Pakistan. That too has become a divisive issue, with several members of Trumps inner circle split on how hard to press Islamabad. Sources say that the discussions - which included a high-level White House meeting on Thursday - could drag out for the rest of the summer, blowing past a mid-July deadline to present a war strategy to an increasingly impatient Congress. After Thursdays meeting, chaired by Vice President Mike Pence, people familiar with the deliberations told Reuters that a final decision did not appear imminent. Pentagon officials have declined to comment on internal deliberations. The White House has also declined to comment ahead of a decision on the strategy. While U.S.-backed fighters are rolling back Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the same cannot be said of the fight against the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that the conditions in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year, even with a modest increase in military assistance from America and its allies. During a July 19 meeting in the White House Situation Room, Trump said Mattis and Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, might want to consider firing Nicholson, who was picked by Obama in 2016 to lead the war effort and has earned the respect of Afghan leaders.  We arent winning, Trump told them, according to accounts of the conversation. But current and former officials say the frustration had been mounting for months.  At least as far back as February, one former U.S. official said the internal deliberations about Afghanistan were not aimed  at creating a broad set of options for Trump. Shortly before McMaster was due to present his plan to Trump for approval ahead of the May NATO summit, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declined to endorse it, saying Trump was not being presented with options, the former official and another current official said. The lack of options meant that the only recommendation that was originally to be put forward to the president was essentially the status quo, the former official said, discounting the troop increase as any serious shift in strategy. But in the months since, the possibility of a full pull-out has been repeatedly presented and refined along with a true status-quo option in which no new troops are sent to Afghanistan, but none are pulled out either. Still, U.S. defense leaders are not believed to be favoring those options. David Sedney, a former Pentagon policy advisor under the Obama administration, said failure to prioritize Afghanistan could replicate the mistakes by previous U.S. presidents.  Weve been ambivalent about Afghanistan for the last 17 years and when you have an ambivalent policy, it fails, said Sedney, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank in Washington. McMaster, Mattis, Tillerson, Dunford, Nicholson and some U.S. intelligence officials argue that refusing to commit more U.S. forces to train, equip and in some cases support the Afghan security forces would eventually result in the Taliban retaking most of the country from the U.S.-backed government in Kabul. Trumps concerns about Afghanistan are shared by some senior officials close to the president, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, who, officials say, is skeptical about the need for an increase in troops in Afghanistan. Divisions have also emerged within Trumps administration on how much to pressure Pakistan, and how quickly, in order to address militant safe havens blamed for helping prolong Afghanistans war. Nicholson, McMaster and Lisa Curtis, senior director for South and Central Asia at the National Security Council, favor taking a strong hand with Pakistan to deal with Taliban militants using that country as a base from which to plot attacks in Afghanistan, current and former officials say. On the other side are State Department officials and others at the Pentagon, including Dunford, who take a broader view of Pakistans strategic importance and are less convinced that harsh actions will secure more cooperation from Islamabad, they said. Pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militant safe havens on its territory.  The Trump administration is exploring a new approach toward Pakistan, Reuters has reported. Potential responses under discussion include expanding U.S. drone strikes, redirecting aid to Pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistans status as a major non-NATO ally.

Chicago will not let our police officers become political pawns in a debate, Emanuel, a Democrat, said at a news conference. Chicago will not let our residents have their fundamental rights isolated and violated. And Chicago will never relinquish our status as a welcoming city.

Chicago, a regular target of Republican President Donald Trump because of its murder rate, expected to receive $3.2 million this year for purchasing equipment. Emanuel said the lawsuit would prevent the Trump administration from setting a precedent that could be used to target other funding. Under Trump and Sessions, the federal government has sought to crack down on sanctuary cities, which generally offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing sanctuary movement. The Justice Department said more Chicagoans were murdered last year than residents of Los Angeles and New York combined, and cited comments by Sessions last week saying sanctuary cities make all of us less safe. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a Sunday statement: Its especially tragic that the mayor is less concerned with that staggering figure than he is spending time and taxpayer money protecting criminal aliens and putting Chicagos law enforcement at greater risk.  Police and city officials in sanctuary cities have said deporting illegal immigrants who are not accused of serious crimes harms public safety by discouraging immigrants from coming forward to report crimes. Chicagos lawsuit is the first to challenge the department over the Byrne program, though city officials said they are in contact with other cities. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is also considering a similar lawsuit, the Sacramento Bee has reported. The Trump administration has already faced legal battles over its sanctuary city policies. Last month, a U.S. judge refused to revisit a court order that blocked Trumps January executive order denying broader federal funds to such jurisdictions, in a case filed by San Francisco and the California county of Santa Clara.

Lavrov, who met U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of an international gathering in Manila, said the first thing that Tillerson asked about was Russias retaliation to new U.S. sanctions against Moscow. He was primarily interested ... in details of those decisions that we grudgingly made in response to the law on anti-Russian sanctions, Lavrov said. The meeting was their first since President Donald Trump reluctantly signed into law the sanctions that Russia said amounted to a full-scale trade war and ended hopes for better ties. We provided an explanation, Lavrov said, referring to Russias decision to take over a summer-house compound in Moscow leased by the U.S. embassy and an order to slash U.S. diplomatic presence in Russia. Lavrov said he also cited President Vladimir Putin who, in an interview to Russian TV last week, explained Moscows need to retaliate to the U.S. sanctions over its role in the Ukrainian crisis and recently expanded to punish Russia for meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Lavrov described his talks with Tillerson as lengthy and said they covered a wide range of topics, from the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula to coordination plans between Russia and the United States to withstand attacks. We felt the readiness of our U.S. colleagues to continue dialogue. I think theres no alternative to that, Lavrov said. The two sides agreed that Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Under Secretary Thomas A. Shannon would continue discussing complex issues on the bilateral agenda. Speaking on Rossiya24 state TV, Lavrov also said Tillerson told him the United States special representative on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, a former U.S. envoy to NATO, would meet a senior aide to Putin, Vladimir Surkov, in the nearest future.  We would be interested to see what impression the U.S. special envoy has on the current state of affairs, Lavrov said. Washington sent Volker to Ukraine last month to assess the situation in the ex-Soviet republic, where a 2015 ceasefire between Kievs forces and Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country is regularly violated.

I wouldnt rule it out if there were a case where the reporter was purposefully violating the law. On Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that his department was tripling the number of investigations into leaks of classified information. President Donald Trump has been fiercely critical of the high number of leaks coming from the federal government since he took office. Rosenstein said the Justice Department has experienced a surge of referrals pertaining to leaks of government information.

Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meet this weekend at a regional forum in Manila, their first face-to-face talks since President Donald Trump reluctantly signed into law sanctions that Russia said amounted to a full-scale trade war and ended hopes for better ties. The sanctions, which passed both houses of Congress by overwhelming majorities despite Trumps objections, in part target the Russian energy sector, with new limits on U.S. investment in Russian companies. In retaliation, Moscow has ordered Washington to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consulate staff in Russia and is seizing two U.S. diplomatic properties there. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Tillerson held out hope for better ties. Theres been no belligerence, he said of his dealings with Lavrov. I think he is as committed as I am to trying to find ways that can bring this relationship back. Analysts and former U.S. officials were skeptical that much progress is likely any time soon on areas such as reducing the violence in Syrias civil war or calming the conflict in eastern Ukraine, let alone reversing Russias annexation of Crimea. The backdrop for that is obviously horrible given the Russian anger over the sanctions bill and the continued day-to-day revelations in the Russia probe, said Carnegie Endowment analyst Andrew Weiss, referring to investigations into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has denied seeking to sway the U.S. election and Trump has denied any collusion. The Russians are probably in no mood to even allow us to show progress because if they (did) they would be saying you can go ahead and sanction us without consequences, said a former U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. There is an incentive for them to have a lousy meeting. Tillerson and Lavrov are likely to discuss the de-escalation zone the nations agreed to establish in southwestern Syria. Russia and Iran are the main outside backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while Washington supports some of the rebel groups seeking to topple him in a six-year civil war. A second former senior U.S. official said he thought the best the two might achieve would be to prevent further deterioration. Do no harm is the other side of the coin, said the former official who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he would expect the two men to review those areas such as the arctic, space and arms control where U.S.-Russian cooperation continues. One of the few areas where Washington and Moscow could make progress is on nuclear and conventional arms control, something they have achieved throughout their long history of tensions. Tillerson and Lavrov agreed in principle in April to resume so-called strategic stability talks on disputes ranging from nuclear arms and missile defense to conventional military deployments in Europe. The last formal talks were held in 2012. Last month, the sides agreed to exchange scheduling proposals in the near future for that dialogue and for talks on extending New START, a 2010 accord that requires them to cut deployed strategic nuclear forces to 1,550 warheads and 700 delivery systems by Feb. 5 2018. It expires in 2021, but can be extended by five years if the U.S. and Russian presidents agree. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Pieters, looking to become the first Belgian winner on the PGA Tour, birdied the 18th hole for a four-under-par 66 that moved him to nine-under-par 201 at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio. His late birdie moved him level with twice major winner Johnson, who moments earlier had also birdied the last for a five-under-par 65 that briefly gave him the outright lead. The pair are one shot clear of Australian Scott Hend (63), with Japans Hideki Matsuyama (67) two shots back, and Rory McIlroy (68) tied with two others another shot further adrift. If I would have walked off today with a 65 or a 66, I would have felt that was a fair reflection of how I played, said McIlroy.  But only three behind going into tomorrow, I can get off to a fast start and try and put a bit of pressure on the guys up ahead of me. Overnight leader Jimmy Walker fell back after mixing two double-bogeys with two bogeys and two birdies for a four-over 74 that left him six back in a share of 10th with Bubba Watson (66), Jason Day (70) and U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka (67). Day was frustrated after following a birdie at the par-five 16th with two bogeys that left him with much more work to do in the final round. Im pretty angry right now, to be honest, said Day. Going bogey-bogey is pretty poor coming down the stretch. Ive got to do something special tomorrow so I get my chances back to try and win this thing. British Open champion Jordan Spieth (71) saw his hopes fade after two bogeys over his final three holes left him seven shots back in a share of 16th. Pieters started the round two shots back of Walker and got off to a sizzling start with four birdies in his first five holes but started to unravel down the stretch. The long-hitting Belgian made a pair of bogeys starting at the 13th that dropped him back into a share of the lead. He did well to make birdie two holes later but then fell back into a share of the lead again after a bogey at the 17th. Hends 63, the lowest round of the day by two shots, was built on four birdies on each nine with his only blemish coming in the form of a three-putt bogey at the par-three seventh.

Stephen Miller, a top aide and speechwriter for President Donald Trump, is a candidate to lead the White Houses communications team after a series of personnel changes in the more than six months that Trump has been president.  The official did not say how many people were on the short list but the Axios news site reported on Saturday that Miller is not the top contender. Last week, Trump ousted White House communications chief Anthony Scaramucci over an obscene tirade to a New Yorker magazine writer only 10 days after he was appointed, leaving the position vacant. Retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, the new chief of staff who sources said was seeking to impose order on a White House riven with factions and backbiting, is said to have recommended the move.  In June, Mike Dubke resigned from the communications director post and since then, there has been a revolving door, with Sean Spicer serving as acting director until Scaramucci was named.  Miller, who has been a top adviser to Trump since the presidential campaign last year, is a former aide to Jeff Sessions when he was in the Senate. Sessions is now Trumps attorney general.  He was one of the authors of Trumps controversial proposed ban on visitors from a half dozen Muslim majority nations, which has triggered protests and a slew of legal challenges. On Thursday, Miller briefed reporters at the White House on Trumps support for legislation that would overhaul the current immigration system by creating a merit based system for issuing visas, favoring younger immigrants with advanced degrees.  He sparred with a CNN reporter who asked whether such a policy was potentially racist and ran counter to the American values, and accused him of having a cosmopolitan bias.

(Reuters) - Three military helicopters hovered over Anne Chois backyard, engaged in what appeared to be a drill ahead of President Donald Trumps visit three weeks ago to this tranquil town of farmland and horse barns in rural New Jersey. My sheep were terrified, Choi, 44, said on Thursday inside her two-story barn a mile east of Trump National Golf Club, as half a dozen Shetland sheep grazed outside. Its awful. We dont have the infrastructure here. We cant support the weight of his presence. As Bedminster prepared this week for the presidents latest trip to the 600-acre (240-hectare) private club, a 17-day stay that is his first extended vacation in office, some of the towns 8,000 residents expressed frustration at the security protocols, road closures and daily disruption that will begin with his arrival on Friday. On Wednesday, the U.S. Secret Service said safety measures would also include a tethered drone, equipped with optical and infrared cameras and powered by a wire attached to a ground controller, that could impede on the privacy of nearby residences. Its super creepy, said Julie Henderson, an artist who lives down the road from Trump National, as two military helicopters roared overhead before circling and heading back toward the golf club. The Secret Service said the drone would focus primarily on the outer perimeter and would not physically intrude upon or disturb the use of private property outside the Trump National Golf Course. Trumps movements can also lead to the closure of local roads and highways. Julie Hendersons husband, Paul Henderson, said he has twice been stuck on an Interstate on his way to work while Trumps motorcade used the highway. Not everyone in this town about 40 miles (60 km) west of New York City agrees Trumps visit will be a nuisance. Steve Desiderio, who owns a restaurant and catering business in Bedminsters modest downtown, said the influx of federal agents and journalists would be a welcome boost to his business. Desiderio, a 48-year-old Trump supporter, added that complaints about the disruption were overblown and media-driven. Its just fake news, he said, echoing one of the presidents favorite phrases. They try to spin it like its gridlock. So there are five more cars at the stoplight? Bedminsters Republican mayor, Steven Parker, also brushed off the criticism. Its really been a big non-event, he said. Some residents said Trump has been a generous neighbor in past years, allowing local events to be hosted at his club. As in previous years, the township committee held its annual reorganization meeting in 2017 at Trump National, where Parker was selected to continue as mayor. While Trumps visit may help the towns eateries, it will shut down the local airport, where 110 private planes and 60 flight school students will be grounded from Aug. 4 to Aug. 20. Our summertime is our busiest time, said Somerset Airport President Chris Walker, as a Coast Guard helicopter landed on the runway in preparation for the weekend. Were just rolling with the punches. About half of the planes were being moved to other airports outside the 10-mile (16-km) no-fly zone, Stewart said. Some workers will be sent home until Trump returns to Washington. Trump has also drawn local protesters, both for and against him. Anti-Trump activists have been staging a weekly Peoples Motorcade, driving slowly down the road past Trump National and honking their horns. The towns administrator, Judith Sullivan, said they were more of a distraction for her 16-member police department than the president, though they have largely been well behaved. She hopes to recoup the $30,000 in overtime for officers working during Trumps visit from the U.S. government. Choi, who moved to Bedminster from Maryland two years ago, said she likely would not have chosen her house had she known the summer White House would be only a mile away.

As U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meet this weekend at a regional forum in Manila, here is a look at new Russia sanctions : * The law establishes a review process that allows Congress to block any effort by Trump to ease or lift sanctions on Russia. Lawmakers passed the bill to punish Russia over its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, its annexation of Ukraines Crimea region and its involvement in Syrias civil war.  * Trump, or any U.S. president, must submit a report to the appropriate congressional committee describing the rationale behind any easing of sanctions on Russia and how it would affect U.S. national security interests. Congress would have at least 30 days to hold hearings and then vote on any proposed change. If lawmakers back a joint resolution of disapproval, the president would be barred from changing the sanctions. * New sanctions are introduced on entities doing business with Russian military or intelligence agencies, companies involved in Russian off-shore oil projects, and those participating in Russian oil or gas pipeline construction within Russia. The bill targets a wide range of Russian industries, which might further hurt Russias economy, already weakened by 2014 sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea. * The law also ramps up sanctions against any entity involved in any cyber attacks on behalf of the Russian government, or that is owned by or acting on behalf of any such entity. The president is allowed to waive these sanctions if he determines it is in the national security interest to do so, subject to congressional review. * Six executive orders signed by President Barack Obama are codified, which would prevent Trump from using an executive order to revoke them. The measures, from 2014-2016, targeted Russias financial services, energy, defense and other industries in retaliation for its annexation of Crimea and incursion into Ukraine, as well as cyber-attacks and election interference in the United States. * The law also requires an interagency report on senior foreign political figures and oligarchs in Russia, their estimated net worth and sources of income, any indications of corruption, and their connection to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The plan, which originally envisioned a four-day per month furlough, is set to begin on Sept. 1 and last throughout the 2018 fiscal year in an effort to achieve $218 million in savings. It excludes frontline law enforcement personnel. Rossello openly challenged the boards authority to impose the belt-tightening measure on the bankrupt U.S. territory, however. The furloughs are part of the boards efforts to implement fiscal changes and achieve $880 million in savings for right-sizing the government this fiscal year and ensuring the islands long-term economic viability. Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the oversight board, said the government had offered a number of ideas for achieving savings. Speaking during a webcast of the boards ninth public meeting, she said the government had fallen short of meeting required money-saving goals, however. Furloughs could be scaled back or eliminated early if sufficient savings are achieved per the governments fiscal plan, the board said. Rossello, in a televised address late on Friday, said the furloughs were unjustified and unnecessary. He also highlighted, in a statement released by his office, public sector cutbacks and budgetary savings that resulted in higher than expected financial reserves. I do not accept nor will I execute the furlough submitted today by the Financial Oversight and Management Board, Rossello said. The board was created by the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA. Rossello said section 205 of the PROMESA law means the board can make recommendations but not impose changes. Furloughs would represent a $340 million hit to the economy  in the current fiscal year, he said. Puerto Ricos Treasury Secretary, Raul Maldonado, told Reuters on Wednesday that preliminary tax collections in July, the first month of fiscal 2018, were running $20 million to $30 million ahead of forecast.

The simple fact is that the government of Puerto Rico has run out of money, he said. He added that the difficult steps of raising taxes and cutting spending were something that the board and government alike have no choice but to do. Puerto Rico is seeking to restructure roughly $72 billion in debt and another near $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities while it struggles with the flight of residents to the U.S. mainland and a 45 percent poverty rate.

A council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a high confidence that North Korea ally China and Russia would support the draft resolution, which was circulated to the 15 Security Council members on Friday. The council is due to vote at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT). A resolution needs nine votes in favor, and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, France or Britain, to be adopted.  The draft resolution would ban North Koreas exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood. It would also prohibit countries from increasing the current numbers of North Korean laborers working abroad, ban new joint ventures with North Korea and any new investment in current joint ventures. These are export sectors where this money is viewed as a critical, critical source of hard currency that the North immediately turns around into its fantastically expensive war machine and these just amazingly expensive ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, the diplomat said. These sanctions are not targeted at the people of North Korea, the diplomat said.  The draft resolution would also add nine individuals and four entities to the U.N. blacklist, including North Koreas primary foreign exchange bank, subjecting them to a global asset freeze and travel ban. The United States and China have been negotiating the draft text for the past month. Typically, they agree sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. U.S. President Donald Trumps administration has been frustrated that China has not done more to rein in North Korea and Washington has threatened to impose new sanctions on Chinese firms doing business with Pyongyang. The Trump administration should issue new sanctions against China at the same time the new resolution is adopted as Beijing is still violating U.S. law by allowing its companies, individuals, and banks to facilitate North Koreas sanctions evasion, said Anthony Ruggiero, a Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow and former U.S. Treasury official. China has also been upset by possible moves by the Trump administration to exert trade pressure on Beijing.    (The draft) appears to reflect a compromise between the U.S. and China in several areas, Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. It notably does not include any reduction in Chinese crude oil shipments to North Korea. While supportive of new U.N. action, Security Council member Sweden said sanctions alone could not solve the problem. More creative diplomacy is urgently needed. A long-term solution can only be achieved through dialogue and negotiations, said Swedens Deputy U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau.  The United States had been informally keeping Britain and France in the loop on the bilateral negotiations, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said China had been sharing the draft and negotiating with Russia. It has not been clear if poor relations between Russia and the United States, which imposed new unilateral sanctions on Moscow on Wednesday, would hamper negotiations. Moscow has disagreed with assessments by Western powers that Pyongyang launched two long-range missiles, saying they were mid-range. Diplomats say China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches. The U.N. diplomat said North Korea has been estimated to earn in 2017 $400 million from coal, $251 million from iron and iron ore, $113 million from lead and lead ore and $295 million from seafood. The diplomat said it was difficult to estimate how much North Korea was earning from sending workers abroad.  A United Nations human rights investigator said in 2015 that North Korea has forced more than 50,000 people to work abroad, mainly in Russia and China, earning the country between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year for the government.

A report released on Friday by Republican staff of the House Financial Services Committee argued there was ample evidence to hold Cordray in contempt because of his alleged failure to fully comply with subpoena requests. Republicans on the panel have been fiercely critical of the CFPBs regulatory work. The report marked the most direct threat yet to pursue legal action against Cordray, who was appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama after the agency was created under the  2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The subpoenas sought records tied to the CFPBs successful efforts to ban mandatory arbitration clauses from financial contracts, including communications between CFPB staff and meetings with outside groups. The ban, hailed by consumer advocates, was finalized in July but Republicans in Congress are working to overturn it. Republicans demanded the documents as part of a probe into rulemaking, and whether the rules regarding mandatory arbitration clauses were written in a proper fashion. Mandatory arbitration clauses require consumers to resolve any disputes through arbitration instead of joining together in class-action lawsuits. Republican staff on the House banking panel had suggested in June that Cordray could face contempt charges for insufficient responses to congressional queries, but Fridays report took the conflict to new heights.  A committee spokesman, Jeff Emerson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the panel would actually seek contempt charges. In response to the report, CFPB spokeswoman Jen Howard said the agency had already produced thousands of pages in response to the requests and was endeavoring to do more. We will continue our efforts to understand how we can respond to the committee in a satisfactory manner, she said in a statement to Reuters. In the past, Cordray has criticized similar panel subpoenas as overly broad and confusing. Representative Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the committee, has been one of Cordrays outspoken critics, and demanded in the past that Republican President Donald Trump fire him as director. Democrats have rallied behind Cordray and the agency since its creation. The Republican attacks on Director Cordray and the Consumer Bureau are entirely baseless, and there are no grounds at all for them to hold the Director in contempt, Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on Hensarlings panel, said in a statement to Reuters.

The State Department said in a press release the United States would continue to participate in United Nations climate change meetings during the withdrawal process, which is expected to take at least three years. The United States supports a balanced approach to climate policy that lowers emissions while promoting economic growth and ensuring energy security, the department said in the release. President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris deal in June, saying the accord would have cost America trillions of dollars, killed jobs, and hindered the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries. But he also, at the time, said he would be open to renegotiating the deal, which was agreed by nearly 200 nations over the course of years - drawing ridicule from world and business leaders who said that would be impossible. During a visit last month to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, the two discussed the deal and Trump told reporters Something could happen with respect to the Paris accords, lets see what happens. As the President indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers, the State Department said in its press release about the formal notice of withdrawal. Republican U.S. congressional leaders have backed Trumps move to exit the accord. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, said it was another significant blow to the Obama administrations assault on domestic energy production and jobs. But numerous business leaders have called the move a blow to international efforts to combat climate change, and a missed opportunity to capture growth in the emerging clean energy industry. The United States, under former President Barack Obama, had pledged as part of the Paris accord to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 to help slow global warming.  The earliest date for the United States to completely withdraw from the agreement is Nov. 4, 2020, around the time of the next U.S. presidential election.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps choice of a general as chief of staff has quickly brought more order to the White House and is giving the president more time to ponder decisions as he tries to bounce back from a rocky six months with no major legislative achievements. But John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general with an intimidating air, still has many challenges to confront to stem the chaos that has raged at the White House since Trump took office in January, not least the Republican presidents free-wheeling style.  Trump, who attended a military prep school growing up, is said to be pleased at the increased discipline that Kelly has brought in since taking over from Reince Priebus, who struggled to maintain order and was often ignored by senior staff. He is feeling like hes getting more time to read the materials and have substantive discussions and talk about the decisions hes making, said a White House official, who asked not to be identified. Before, he was carrying a lot himself. It feels now like there is more burden-sharing around. He has more trust and confidence in Kelly, the official said. Aides said Kelly, who previously was running the Department of Homeland Security and who began work on Monday, was commanding respect in the West Wing. Kelly is scary in a way that Reince wasnt, said an administration official. Senior staff meetings are well attended and no longer considered optional as they were under Priebus. Typically anyone who goes into the Oval Office to see Trump makes sure Kelly knows. I think youve seen less backbiting, said Ken Duberstein, who was a chief of staff for 1980s President Ronald Reagan. I think the idea that he is asserting, that the White House cannot be a free-wheeling place but rather there is a chain of command and things go in an orderly process, are all major steps in the right direction. So far, Kelly has not managed to put a stop to leaks to the media that have infuriated Trump.  On Thursday, the Washington Post published transcripts of Trumps sometimes fraught calls in the early days of his presidency with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. He has not reined in the president himself, and it is by no means clear he will try to do so. Confidants say Trump is still speed-dialing people in the evenings, as he has done for decades. He is still firing off bombastic tweets, like one on Thursday blaming the Republican-controlled Congress for what he called an all-time low in relations with Russia because it piled on more sanctions. But Trump did stay on message at a rally in West Virginia on Thursday night, reading from a Teleprompter and sticking to the script. Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, said time will tell whether Kelly can reform any of the habits Trump has displayed during the first six months in office.Hell have some of the smartest people around him and theyre not there to change him but to make him better. Even Tom Brady needs a coach, said Bennett, referring to the highly successful New England Patriots quarterback. Trumps friends said there is value to letting Trump be Trump, particularly since Priebus attempt to shape Trump into a more traditional president failed spectacularly. Kelly can go too far in the other direction. Donald Trump doesnt need a babysitter. Hes his own man, said one friend. I understand the attitude of the military types that if they can control all information flow they can control the president. But the first time he learns something that he should have heard from staff, there will be hell to pay. Trump has yet to notch up a major legislative win and Kelly has scant experience with lawmakers. In the mid-1990s he served as the Marine Corps commandants liaison officer to the U.S. House of Representatives. So far his appointment is being welcomed on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers had grown weary of the chaos at the White House. Many were heartened to see one of Kellys first acts was to jettison Anthony Scaramucci as communications director after a foul-mouthed tirade against Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon. He is going to bring such an air of calm, said Senator David Perdue, a Republican and early supporter of Trumps election campaign. This man has been through a career of providing results, and showing leadership. Kelly is seen as likely to form a partnership with two other retired generals in Trumps inner circle, Defense Secretary James Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster. The three attended a meeting of top national security aides on Thursday in the White House Situation Room aimed at settling on a strategy for Afghanistan that Trump, who tends to be non-interventionist, will find acceptable. Whether they will be able to overcome his doubts about sending around 4,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan is unclear. I think he likes the snap and efficiency. But I seriously question whether any of them share his non-interventionist world view, the friend said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois fought on Friday against a potential court order it contends could cost the state, which just ended an unprecedented budget impasse, as much as an additional $1 billion annually to care for developmentally disabled people. In arguments before U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman, advocates for disabled people living outside of institutions said Illinois is violating a federal consent decree by failing to provide required services due to insufficient funding. The state maintained that even with the enactment last month of its first full budget in two years along with a tax hike, it still lacks enough money to pay off a more than $14 billion backlog in bills.   Additional funding to comply with the consent decree would have to be squeezed from existing spending on services for the developmentally disabled or from other unrelated programs, according to a court filing by the Illinois Attorney Generals Office. Brent Stratton, chief deputy Illinois Attorney General, told the judge the fiscal 2018 budget allocated $53 million for the first rate increase for developmentally disabled services since 2008. He said Illinois is in substantial compliance with the decree and that the funding boost should be allowed to play out. The court has the power to enforce the consent decree, but there is a limit, Stratton said. The court cant order us to increase rates. Another U.S. judge ordered Illinois in June to increase payments to $586 million a month for Medicaid providers that were owed more than $3 billion for caring for poor and disabled residents covered under a separate federal consent decree. A stalemate between Illinois Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature left the nations fifth-largest state operating on spending ordered by courts and mandated by Illinois law for two-straight years. Lawyers for the developmentally disabled residents pointed to a $5 billion income rate increase Illinois enacted in July to bolster its sagging budget, saying that money could be tapped in the future to fund services. In addition to seeking a ruling of noncompliance with the consent decree against the state, the lawyers also want the judge to order Illinois to produce a detailed plan on how it will comply with the decree. Cost is what this all comes down to, said Judge Johnson Coleman, who raised concerns about siphoning money from other state funding priorities.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, taking up an issue that has infuriated Republican President Donald Trump, went on the attack against leaks on Friday, warning of a possible crackdown both on reporters and their sources inside the federal government. In a move derided by critics as an attack on the free press, Sessions said the administration was reviewing policies on forcing journalists to reveal their sources.  It is, however, difficult to prosecute members of the news media in the United States for publishing leaked information. Sessions also told the employees of government agencies to stop leaking and called the issue a matter of national security.     Trump has repeatedly voiced anger over a steady stream of leaks to the media about him and his administration since he took office in January.  Some have been related to probes into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election; others have concerned infighting in the White House.     One of the things we are doing is reviewing policies affecting media subpoenas, Sessions told reporters as he announced administration efforts to battle what he called a staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country. We respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited, the nations top law official said.  His boss, Trump, has repeatedly criticized news outlets and their work as fake news, and administration officials have criticized the use of anonymous sources, a standard journalistic practice. A media subpoena is a writ compelling a journalist to testify or produce evidence, with a penalty for failure to do so.  The fact that the administration is reviewing its policy leaves open the possibility of sentencing journalists for not disclosing their sources.     Every American should be concerned about the Trump administrations threat to step up its efforts against whistleblowers and journalists, said Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union. A crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy as a whole. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told reporters the department was just starting to review the policy on media subpoenas and could not say yet how it might be changed. But he did not rule out the possibility of threatening journalists with jail time.     Historically, government employees or contractors who give sensitive information to the media are much more likely to be prosecuted than the reporters who receive it. U.S. regulations give journalists special protections, barring them from law enforcement that might reasonably impair newsgathering activities. Federal prosecutors must get special permission from the U.S. attorney general before issuing a subpoena to try to force a member of the news media to divulge information to authorities. New York Times reporter Judith Miller was jailed in 2005 for refusing to reveal a source about stories on Iraq, but she cut a deal with prosecutors before she was formally charged.   In addressing the wider issue of leaks, Sessions said the Justice Department has tripled the number of investigations into unauthorized leaks of classified information and that four people have already been charged. We are taking a stand, said Sessions, who in recent weeks has been publicly criticized by Trump for his performance in the job, including for what Trump called his weakness on the issue of going after leakers. This culture of leaking must stop, Sessions said. It is not illegal to leak information, as such, but divulging classified information is against the law. Some of the more high-profile leaks in the Trump administration have revealed White House infighting in articles that would appear not to involve divulging classified information.         Sessions did not immediately give the identities of the four people charged, but said they had been accused of unlawfully disclosing classified information or concealing contacts with foreign intelligence officers. Rosenstein did not give the exact number of leak investigations the Justice Department is currently handling, only that this number has tripled under the Trump administration.  In the latest major leak to the media, the Washington Post published transcripts on Thursday of contentious phone calls that Trump had in the early days of his administration with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. No government can be effective when its leaders cannot discuss sensitive matters in confidence or to talk freely in confidence with foreign leaders, Sessions said of that case.     One tool Sessions has for prosecuting leakers is the Espionage Act, a World War One-era law that was designed to stop leaks to Americas enemies. Federal prosecutors have used it 12 times to charge individuals for disclosing information to the media, eight of them under Democratic former President Barack Obama.   The most recent case, and the first under Trump, was the Justice Departments indictment in June of Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a U.S. intelligence contractor accused of leaking a classified National Security Agency report about Russias alleged interference in the 2016 election.\t ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Republican President Donald Trump has complained for months about leaks to the news media, but his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also took a hard line on leaking.  Eight of the 12 cases where federal prosecutors charged individuals with violating the Espionage Act, a World War One-era law aimed at keeping sensitive information out of the hands of the United States enemies, were brought under Obama. Here are the 12 cases, dating back 46 years. Daniel Ellsberg became the first such case in 1971 when prosecutors accused the national security analyst and his colleague, Anthony Russo, of providing what would become known as the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times and other media outlets. The secret documents revealed the extent of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Charges against the two men were dismissed when a judge found that the government had wiretapped Ellsberg, possibly illegally. Samuel Morison, a former Navy intelligence analyst, was charged in 1984 with illegally passing secret photographs of Soviet ships to a magazine, Janes Defence Weekly. He pleaded not guilty, but a jury convicted him, making him the first person convicted under the Espionage Act for divulging secrets to the press. He was sentenced to two years in prison but paroled. President Bill Clinton pardoned him. Lawrence Franklin, a Defense Department employee, was charged in 2005 with passing classified information about Iran to two pro-Israel lobbyists, Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman. Franklin pleaded guilty and received a 12-year sentence. Eventually, after the governments case against Rosen and Weissman collapsed, a judge reduced Franklins sentence to 10 months in a halfway house. Shamai Leibowitz was an FBI translator when material that he heard while translating ended up on a blog. He reached an agreement with prosecutors before he was charged, and pleaded guilty in 2009 to one count of disclosing classified information. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Former National Security Agency official Thomas Drake was suspected in 2010 of revealing information about the agencys warrantless wiretapping program. He was indicted under the Espionage Act but said the only information he leaked was about waste in an NSA program, which he gave to the Baltimore Sun. The 10 felony counts were dropped when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and received no prison time. Chelsea Manning, an Army private first class formerly known as Bradley Manning, turned over more than 700,000 classified files to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks in the biggest breach of secret data in U.S. history. Manning was found guilty of 19 counts but acquitted of the most serious one, aiding the enemy. She was sentenced in August 2013 to 35 years in a military prison but was released in May after Obama, in his last days in office, commuted the final 28 years of Mannings sentence.  Stephen Kim, a U.S. State Department contract analyst, allegedly divulged to a Fox News reporter what U.S. intelligence believed about how North Korea would respond to new sanctions. A grand jury indicted him in 2010 for disclosing defense information and making false statements. He pleaded guilty in 2014 and was sentenced to thirteen months in prison. He was released in May 2015.  Former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was charged in 2011 with illegally disclosing classified information about Iran to James Risen, a New York Times reporter, for his book State of War. A jury convicted Sterling in 2015. A judge sentenced him to 42 months in prison.  Former CIA officer John Kiriakou was charged in 2012 with divulging to journalists secret information about the CIAs interrogation program, including the identity of a covert officer. In an agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to one count and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. He was released in February 2015 on condition that he serve three months of house arrest. U.S. officials said in June 2013 they had filed sealed criminal charges against former NSA contractor Edward Snowden for unauthorized leaks and theft of government property. Snowden prompted a worldwide debate after he gave documents to newspapers showing the extent of U.S. surveillance programs. Russia granted him asylum. Former FBI bomb analyst Donald Sachtleben agreed in September 2013 to plead guilty to disclosing national defense information for telling an Associated Press reporter details of a failed airline bombing attempt by Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A judge sentenced Sachtleben that year to a 43-month prison term for the national security offenses and a consecutive 97-month term for unrelated child pornography charges. The Justice Department charged U.S. intelligence contractor Reality Leigh Winner with violating the Espionage Act for leaking a classified report on Russian interference in U.S. elections to The Intercept. The NSA report described Russian efforts to launch cyber attacks on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and send spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local officials days before the Nov. 8, 2016 election.

Politico said the popular deduction came up this week at a White House roundtable with real estate industry representatives led by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. The publication quoted an attendee as saying Cohn was willing to ruffle some feathers by putting everything on the table. The Internal Revenue Service says homeowners can deduct all interest on mortgages of up to $1 million. Lowering the mortgage deduction cap could help pay for major tax cuts for businesses and individuals that Republicans view as crucial for driving U.S. economic growth. But the White House pushed back on the notion that its position has changed. As weve said since we introduced our principles in April, we intend to protect the homeownership deductions, White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said. Cohn told Bloomberg TV on Friday that the 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate should be more in line with the 24 percent average rate among other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We cannot be substantially higher than the OECD average tax rate out there, he said. Weve got to get in line with the rest of the world, weve got to entice capital to be invested in the United States. President Donald Trump wants to cut the corporate rate far lower to 15 percent, a level that Republicans in Congress view as unlikely. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told Reuters this week it would be a challenge to get the rate to 25 percent. In a separate Friday interview on Fox Business Network, Cohn said the administration and Congress are committed to get as low a rate as possible for businesses. Two congressional tax committees are drafting tax legislation that is expected to be unveiled in September. Republicans hope to pass the bill before the end of 2017. Congress faces a packed legislative agenda when lawmakers return to Washington in September after their August break, including the task of raising the debt ceiling before October, when the Treasury Department is expected to fully exhaust its remaining borrowing capacity. Cohn told Fox the administration is well aware of the calendar and that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is working to ensure the debt ceiling gets raised.

Zinke called Murkowski and Alaskas other U.S. senator, Republican Dan Sullivan, on July 26, the day after Murkowskis crucial vote against a motion to begin debate on the healthcare overhaul, the Alaska Dispatch News reported. The interior secretary warned the two senators that Murkowskis vote could have negative consequences for energy and land use in Alaska, the newspaper said. Murkowski spokeswoman Karina Peterson confirmed that Zinke had called the senator. The Interior Department deals with policies crucial to the states economy such as drilling and mining on federal and tribal land and control of wildlife areas. The inspector generals office sent a letter to Democratic U.S. Representatives Frank Pallone and Raul Grijalva, the top Democrats on the House committees on energy and natural resources, respectively, on Thursday evening, saying it would start a preliminary investigation into the matter. The two lawmakers had asked the inspector generals office and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for an investigation following the report of the threat. Zinkes office and the GAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The sources added that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had convened the grand jury investigation in Washington to help examine allegations of Russian interference in the vote. One of the sources said it was assembled in recent weeks. Russia has loomed large over the first six months of the Trump presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to tilt the presidential election in Trumps favor. Mueller, who was appointed special counsel in May, is leading the probe, which also examines potential collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign, while regularly denouncing the investigations as political witch hunts.   At a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, on Thursday night, Trump said: Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign. ... We didnt win because of Russia. We won because of you. Muellers use of a grand jury could give him expansive tools to pursue evidence, including issuing subpoenas and compelling witnesses to testify. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported a grand jury was impaneled.  A spokesman for Mueller declined comment. A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who, working behind closed doors, considers evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing that a prosecutor is investigating and decides whether charges should be brought. This is a serious development in the Mueller investigation, said Paul Callan, a former prosecutor.  Given that Mueller inherited an investigation that began months ago, it would suggest that he has uncovered information pointing in the direction of criminal charges. But against whom is the real question.  A lawyer for Trump, Jay Sekulow, appeared to downplay the significance of a grand jury, telling Fox News: This is not an unusual move. U.S. stocks and the dollar weakened following the news, while U.S. Treasury securities gained. It was not immediately clear to whom subpoenas were issued and the sources did not elaborate.  Some lawyers said it would put pressure on potential witnesses to cooperate with Muellers investigation.  When someone gets a subpoena to testify, that can drive home the seriousness of the investigation, said David Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School and a former federal prosecutor.  In 2005, a grand jury convened by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald returned an indictment of Lewis Scooter Libby, a top aide to then-Vice President Dick Cheney. A special counsel can bring an indictment and it has happened before, said Renato Mariotti, a partner at the law firm Thompson Coburn and a former federal prosecutor. News last month of the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who he was told had damaging information about his fathers presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, fueled questions about the campaigns dealings with Moscow.  The Republican president has defended his sons behavior, saying many people would have taken that meeting. Trumps son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting. One of the sources said major Russian efforts to interfere in the election on Trumps behalf began shortly after the June meeting, making it a focus of Muellers investigation. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he was not aware that Mueller had started using a new grand jury. Grand jury matters are typically secret, Cobb said. The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller. John Dowd, one of Trumps personal lawyers, said: With respect to the news of the grand jury, I can tell you President Trump is not under investigation. A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.  Lawyers for Trump Jr. and Kushner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump has questioned Muellers impartiality and members of Congress from both parties have expressed concern that Trump might dismiss him. Republican and Democratic senators introduced two pieces of legislation on Thursday seeking to block Trump from firing Mueller.  Sekulow denied that was Trumps plan. The president is not thinking of firing Bob Mueller, Sekulow said. One source briefed on the matter said Mueller was investigating whether, either at the meeting or afterward, anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign encouraged the Russians to start releasing material they had been collecting on the Clinton campaign since March 2016. Another source familiar with the inquiry said that while the president himself was not now under investigation, Muellers investigation was seeking to determine whether he knew of the June 9 meeting in advance or was briefed on it afterward. Reuters earlier reported that Muellers team was examining money-laundering accusations against Manafort and hoped to push him to cooperate with their probe into possible collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump scolded U.S. lawmakers on Thursday for clamping down on Moscow with new sanctions, his message clashed with the one that Vice President Mike Pence pushed during a four-day trip this week to Eastern Europe. As he toured Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro, Pence said the sanctions passed overwhelmingly by Congress would send a unified message to Russia that it must change its behavior. Trump, by contrast, took to Twitter to complain that the sanctions legislation, which he grudgingly signed, would send U.S.-Russia relations to an all-time & very dangerous low. While some Republicans played down the divergence, critics said it exemplified an incoherent policy that would unsettle allies and fail to placate Moscow. There are some policies where a good cop/bad approach can work, said Michael McFaul, a U.S. ambassador to Russia under former Democratic President Barack Obama. But McFaul added that in the case of the Trump administrations policy toward Russia, Moscow was likely to view the mixed signals as a sign of policy disarray. If the Republican president continues to want improved relations with Russia, hes not achieving his goal, McFaul said. The White Houses two-track approach is mirrored in Moscow.  After Trump signed the new sanctions into law on Wednesday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the No. 2 in the Russian ruling hierarchy, launched a blistering attack on the White House. Yet Russian President Vladimir Putin  who has tried to cultivate a personal rapport with Trump in phone conversations and face-to-face meetings at a summit in Germany  has not uttered a word in public about the sanctions since Trump approved them. Trump has repeatedly said he wants better ties with Russia. But the country has loomed large over the first six months of his administration as a special counsel and U.S. congressional panels investigate allegations Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help Trump and also examine any potential role by Trump aides. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign.     After Congress passed the sanctions legislation with a large enough margin to override a presidential veto, Trump signed it on Wednesday but criticized it as infringing on his authority and said he could make far better deals with governments than Congress could. As a countermeasure to the sanctions, Putin called for reducing the staff of the U.S. diplomatic mission by 755 people and for the seizure of two properties near Moscow used by American diplomats. Jarrod Agen, deputy chief of staff to Pence, insisted that Trump and Pence were completely aligned on Russia. It was the presidents decision to send the vice president to the region. It was the presidents decision to deliver the message that the vice president delivered, Agen told Reuters. He added that Pence and Trump spoke every day during his trip and sometimes multiple times a day. The disconnect between Pence and Trump on Russia is an anomaly. Pence usually goes to lengths to emphasize his loyalty to his boss and to downplay any differences. Their different tone on Russia dates back to the U.S. presidential campaign. While Trump often praised Putin, Pence called the Russian president a small and bullying leader during a vice presidential debate last October. During his trip this week, Pence condemned Russia for its occupation of Georgias soil as he spoke to U.S. and Georgian troops engaged in joint exercises only 40 miles (64 km) away from Russian troops in South Ossetia. In Montenegro, Pence accused Russia of trying to destabilize the western Balkans - a message criticized by Moscow. Russias Foreign Ministry said it was regrettable to note that Washington is sliding ever deeper into the primitive ideology of the Cold War era, which is completely detached from reality. Traditional Republican conservatives - who favor a hard line on Moscow - have taken some comfort in Pences message, as have foreign leaders concerned about the impact of a rapprochement between Trump and Putin. What he (Pence) is saying is good and helpful and should be the policy of the Trump administration  and so for those of us who want it to be that way, were happy to embrace it, said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. None of us know what Donald Trump thinks in his heart of hearts about Russia, Pletka said. But she added: If (Trump) were not comfortable with Pence making this trip, Pence would not be making this trip. Republican Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would not read a lot into the different tones struck by Pence and Trump, although he welcomed Pences trip to the European countries. Corker described Pence as the administrations ombudsman on policy and said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trumps national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, were key to developing Trumps foreign policy. A former U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was at pains to explain the disconnect between Pence and Trump on Russia. We are dealing with a major, open split between the president and basically the rest of his administration with the possible exception of Tillerson, the former official said.

Typically, the United States and China have agreed sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, France or Britain to be adopted. The United States has been informally keeping Britain and France in the loop on the negotiations, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said China had been sharing the draft and negotiating with Russia. U.S. President Donald Trumps administration has been frustrated that China has not done more to rein in North Korea and Washington has threatened to impose new sanctions on Chinese firms doing business with Pyongyang. But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, on Friday that China would continue to fully and strictly implement Security Council resolutions on North Korea, the ministry said.  Haley said on Sunday the United States was done talking about North Korea and China must decide if it is willing to back imposing stronger U.N. sanctions. But she has also acknowledged that Russias engagement on the draft resolution would be the true test. Russia noted on Thursday that the permanent five (P5) veto powers had yet to formally discuss the draft. It was not immediately clear if poor relations between Russia and the United States, which imposed new unilateral sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, would hamper the negotiations. Even if there is an agreement between the U.S. and China, it doesnt mean there is an agreement between the P5 members, said Russias U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who met with Liu earlier on Thursday and discussed a possible resolution. Maybe there is a bilateral agreement (between Beijing and Washington), but thats not a universal one, he said, adding that while he was aware of what might be in the resolution he had not seen the draft as it stands now.  The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment. Moscow has disagreed with assessments by Western powers that Pyongyang has launched two long-range missiles, saying they were mid-range. Diplomats say China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration moved on Thursday to make permanent a new questionnaire that asks some U.S. visa applicants to provide their social media handles and detailed biographical and travel history, according to a public notice. The questionnaire was rolled out in May as part of an effort to tighten vetting of would-be visitors to the United States, and asks for all prior passport numbers, five years' worth of social media handles, email addresses and phone numbers and 15 years of biographical information including addresses, employment and travel history. (See: bit.ly/2v0qsR2) A State Department official declined to provide data on how many times the form had been used or which nationalities had been asked to fill it out since May, only stating that it estimates 65,000 visa applicants per year will present a threat profile that warrants the extra screening. President Donald Trump ran for office in 2016 pledging to crack down on illegal immigration for security reasons, and has called for extreme vetting of foreigners entering the United States. On Wednesday, he threw his support behind a bill that would cut legal immigration to the United States by 50 percent over 10 years. The Office of Management and Budget, which must approve most new federal requests of information from the public, initially approved the form on an emergency basis, which allowed its use for six months rather than the usual three years. The State Department published a notice in the Federal Register on Thursday seeking to use the form for the next three years. The public has 60 days to comment on the request. (See: bit.ly/2uZNXJD) The questions are meant to more rigorously evaluate applicants for terrorism, national security-related, or other visa ineligibilities, the notice said. While the questions are voluntary, the form says failure to provide the information may delay or prevent the processing of a visa application. Trump ordered a temporary travel ban in March on citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. After months of legal wrangling, the Supreme Court in June allowed the travel ban to go forward with a limited scope. The form does not target any particular nationality. Seyed Ali Sepehr, who runs an immigration consultancy in California serving Iranian clients applying for U.S. visas, said that since late June, all of his clients who have been referred for extra security checks have also been asked to fill out the new form. Kiyanoush Razaghi, an immigration attorney based in Maryland, said he knows of Iraqis, Libyans and Iranians who have been asked to fill out the form. Immigration attorney Steve Pattison said one of his clients, who is not from one of the six travel ban countries, had been asked to fill out the new form when applying for a visitor visa, indicating that consular officers are using it broadly.  It could be that everyone is missing another consequence of the use of the form  its deployment in a far wider sense to cover all sorts of individuals, Pattison said.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 17-4 for the measure, known as the Taylor Force Act, after a 29-year-old American military veteran who was fatally stabbed by a Palestinian while visiting Israel last year. The bill, which must be approved by the full Senate and House of Representatives before becoming law, is intended to stop the Palestinian Authority from paying the stipends, which can reach $3,500 per month. Forces attacker was killed by Israeli police, but his killers family receives such a monthly payment. What has happened here will hopefully, when passed, prevent other people from having the same fate: an innocent person going about their activities in an innocent way, being murdered by someone whos being incented to do that by their own government, Senator Bob Corker, the committees Republican chairman and a co-sponsor of the bill, told a news conference. Separately, 16 Republican and Democratic members of the committee wrote to Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to ask her to lead an international effort for similar action by other countries. Force was a graduate student at Vanderbilt University in Corkers home state, Tennessee, when he was killed. Forces parents live in South Carolina, the home state of Senator Lindsey Graham, the acts other Republican co-sponsor.     Graham, who dubbed the payments pay to slay, is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees foreign aid. Palestinian officials have said they intend to continue the payments, which they see as support for relatives of those imprisoned by Israel for fighting against occupation or who have died in connection with that cause. To win broader support, the original act was modified to take into account the need for humanitarian aid. It exempts assistance for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, creates an escrow account to hold assistance funds and spells out steps the Palestinian Authority can take for aid to resume. Corker said he was confident the bill would become law sometime in the coming months. Similar legislation has also been introduced in the House of Representatives. Opponents of the bill have said they worry that cutting off economic aid to the Palestinians would increase poverty and instability in the West Bank and Gaza, fueling more violence.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic senators introduced two pieces of legislation on Thursday seeking to block President Donald Trump from firing the special counsel probing his ties to Russia, as Congress increasingly seeks to assert its authority on policy. Members of Congress from both parties have expressed concern that Trump might dismiss Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to determine whether there was collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow. The Republican president on May 9 fired FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the investigation. He also recently criticized his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from the probe. With signs that Muellers investigation is intensifying, members of Congress sought to protect the special counsel, who was appointed on May 17. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday that Mueller had convened a grand jury in Washington to investigate the allegations of Russian meddling. The sources added that grand jury subpoenas had been issued in connection with a June 2016 meeting involving Trumps son, his son-in-law and a Russian lawyer. Moscow has denied any effort to influence the election, and Trump has disputed any allegations of collusion between his associates and Russia. Our bill allows judicial review of any decision to terminate a counsel to make sure its done for the reasons cited in the regulations rather than political motivation, said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who co-sponsored one of the bills with Democratic Senator Cory Booker. A second, generally similar, measure was introduced by Republican Senator Thom Tillis and Democratic Senator Chris Coons. Coons told reporters that he expected the two groups of senators would work together and seek more co-sponsors from both parties, to come up with a single bill. He said they were in discussions with the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the hope they would take up the bill, a step toward a vote in the full Senate. The measures were introduced as the Senate prepared to leave Washington for its August recess. Lawmakers will return in early September. Members of Congress, including some of Trumps fellow Republicans, have recently been pursuing legislation seeking to increase Congress influence on U.S. policy. Last week, lawmakers voted almost unanimously for a sweeping sanctions bill that gave Congress the right to review any Trump effort to ease or lift sanctions on Russia. Trump signed that bill into law on Wednesday. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

I cant help you anymore being a Democrat governor, Justice told the crowd. So tomorrow I will be changing my registration to Republican, he said to loud cheers. Justice, a billionaire businessman with interests in coal and agriculture, won election in November as a Democrat in his first attempt at political office. Until 2015, he had been a registered Republican. Trump, who won West Virginia by 42 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Clinton, campaigned on a promise to bring back coal jobs, an important industry in the state. Justice said his late mother would have told him about switching parties: Jimmy, its about damn time you came to your senses. Justice told the crowd he had met with Trump twice at the White House in the past several weeks to present ideas on coal and manufacturing.    Hes got a backbone. Hes got real ideas. He cares about America. He cares about us in West Virginia, Justice said of Trump, a fellow billionaire businessman. Trump, who earlier in the day promised a very big announcement at the rally, welcomed Justice into the partys ranks.  Having big Jim as a Republican is such an honor, Trump said of the 6-foot-7-inch governor. With Justice changing his affiliation, there are now 34 Republican governors, 15 Democrats and one independent.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressured the Mexican president to stop voicing opposition in public to his plan to have Mexico pay for a border wall, according to transcripts of phone calls published on Thursday that gave an insight into Trumps attempts to influence foreign leaders in his first days in office. The Washington Post published texts of sometimes fraught calls with Mexicos Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull just days after the Republican took office on Jan. 20. The substance of the calls has previously been reported but the lengthy transcripts reveal Trump, whose first elected office is the presidency, trying to use a mixture of bluster, tough talk and charm as he fully enters the world of diplomacy. Trump argued with Turnbull over refugees in an acrimonious call on Jan. 28 which the new U.S. president told his counterpart was unpleasant. In a Jan. 27 call, Trump pressed Pena Nieto to avoid saying in public that Mexico would not fund the planned border wall. But he complimented the Mexican leaders beautiful words and said he hoped Mexico would change its constitution to allow Pena Nieto to extend his stay in office. The proposed wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the United States, is a bone of contention between Mexico and Washington. Pena Nieto has repeatedly rejected Trumps promise that Mexico will end up paying billions of dollars for its construction.      Trump told the Mexican leader in the call that if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that, according to the transcript.  You cannot say that to the press, Trump said.     Pena Nieto had earlier scrapped a plan to hold talks with Trump in the United States due to tensions over the wall and trade. The two men have since met, holding talks at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Germany last month.             The White House has said the U.S. government will pay for the wall initially to get the project off the ground but that Mexico will eventually reimburse it for the work.      Both the White House and Mexicos foreign ministry did not have any immediate comment on Thursday about the release of the call transcripts. It was the latest in a series of leaks from inside Trumps administration which have angered the president. The Republican won some sympathy over leaks from a political opponent on Thursday.  I am alarmed at leaks of conversations between two heads of state, Democratic U.S. Senator Brian Schatz wrote on Twitter. It doesnt matter what I think of this president, this is terrible.  In the conversation with Pena Nieto, Trump said both leaders were in a little bit of a political bind due to Trumps campaign pledge to build the wall and have Mexico foot the bill. I have to have Mexico pay for the wall  I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period, Trump said.                     He suggested that the two men avoid the issue of paying for the wall when asked.     They are going to say, Who is going to pay for the wall, Mr. President? to both of us, and we should both say, We will work it out, Trump said. It will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, We will not pay and me saying, We will not pay, the U.S. president said.    Pena Nieto said he understood Trumps position on how to refer to paying for the border wall and suggested seeking a creative way to jump over this obstacle. Toward the end of their conversation, Trump responded effusively to a comment by Pena Nieto about the Mexican leaders wish for a constructive relationship with the United States.     Your words are so beautiful. Those are beautiful words and I do not think I can speak that beautifully, okay? Trump said. I want you to be so popular that your people will call for a constitutional amendment in Mexico so that you can run again for another six years, he said. By law, Mexican presidents can only serve one six-year term. DRUG INFESTED-DEN In comments likely to upset voters in New Hampshire - an important early voting state in the U.S. presidential election primaries - Trump described the state as a drug-infested den.  I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den, he said, complaining that drugs from Mexico are damaging the United States. While Trump won the Republican primary there, he narrowly lost the state to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the general election.     New Hampshire officials from both parties lashed out at Trump, with several saying his push to repeal the Obamacare healthcare law would worsen the nations opioid crisis. Speaking to Australias Turnbull, Trump became irritated that the United States was expected to honor an agreement made by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in Australian processing centers on remote Pacific islands. Trump said that would make him look bad given his campaign promises to reduce the number of refugees entering the United States, according to the transcript. This is going to kill me. I am the worlds greatest person that does not want to let people into the country, Trump said.        Seeking to win Trumps support, Turnbull on Friday said Washington could honor the deal while taking as few as 100 refugees from the two offshore centers, should the rest fail to satisfy its vetting. It has always been subject to American vetting procedures, Turnbull told reporters in Western Australia state. Those procedures from the Department of Homeland Security are ongoing. The dialogue was a frank conversation between adults, he added. Trump told Turnbull that their conversation was the most difficult he had held that day, after speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin and others. I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day, Trump said. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday unanimously confirmed two nominees to serve on the Federal Communications Commission as the Trump administration looks to reverse many Obama-era telecommunications regulations. Brendan Carr, a Republican who is general counsel at the FCC  and Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, were both confirmed by voice vote, bringing the five-member FCC to full strength and giving Republicans a 3-2 majority. Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama. The FCC, which since January has been controlled by Republicans by a 2-1 margin, is working to reverse a number of Obama-era telecommunications regulations, including the landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others.  The Senate did not immediately vote to reconfirm FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to another term, even though he appeared at a confirmation hearing in July with the other nominees. Pai would need to leave the commission by the end of the year if he were not reconfirmed. In a statement, Pai praised Rosenworcel and Carrs confirmations and said they have distinguished records of public service and will be valuable assets to the FCC in the years to come.Their experience at the FCC makes them particularly well-suited to hit the ground running. Pai, chosen by Trump in January to head the agency, also has said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. Pai also plans significant changes to local TV ownership limits and plans other changes to media regulations. Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm FCC Commissioner Mike ORielly. Republicans denied there was a deal but the standoff had delayed consideration of telecommunications legislation in the Senate. Under Pai, the FCC chose not to review AT&T Incs planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.  The FCC is currently reviewing Sinclair Broadcast Group Incs proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co, one of the largest U.S. TV station operators.

The sources added that Mueller had convened a grand jury in Washington to help investigate allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.

Anything that represents volatility is an automatic sell (for stocks).  Im not even sure if beyond the volatility theres much of Wall Street that would get terribly upset if (Trump) got impeached. That would give them (current Vice President Mike) Pence, and likely full power for Republicans and maybe some policies being enacted including health care, tax reform and a fiscal spending program. Even reinforce less regulations. From a Wall Street standpoint I cant say over the long term that (a Trump impeachment) would be a bad result for stocks. The uncertainty of going through it all would be a negative, but Im not sure the market would remain lower for long, assuming all else is equal.  AXEL MERK, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF MERK INVESTMENTS IN PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA: Given that Trumps approval rating is very low, and given that it might be all but impossible to find a jury that hasnt heard of the allegations, odds are this jury might be leaning against Trump.

This is good news for the euro, this should be good news for goldand it is ultimately a negative also for risk assets only for the reason that the Trump agenda has ever more difficulty of being realized because it does weaken the presidency.

CHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CORNERSTONE FINANCIAL PARTNERS, HUNTERSVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA:  To the extent that people are afraid something will happen to the presidency of the United States, whether that brings us closer to impeachment or serves as a further distraction for the administration, neither of those are good for the markets or a risk-on position. Its more distraction for the White House and less stability  It definitely was market moving. The timing lines up perfectly.

And now politics, even more than economic data, is really a driver of dollar weakness. Whats really going to weigh heavily on the dollar for the remainder of the year is that as long as this investigation continues and there is a probe and the White House continues to work on everything except the economic agenda its going to weigh heavily on the dollar.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A five-week summer break might sound sweet to many people, but maybe not to the 292 Republicans in Congress who leave Washington with none of their major legislative goals achieved after six months in power alongside President Donald Trump. With Congress due to be closed until Sept. 5, voters may ask: What happened to repealing and replacing Obamacare? Overhauling the tax code? Investing more money in job-creating infrastructure projects? The awkward answer for Republican lawmakers and Trump is not much. Despite having control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives since the November 2016 elections, Republicans have not delivered on their biggest campaign promises. Distracted by a probe of possible ties between his campaign and Russian meddling in the election, among many other issues he tweets about, Trump has yet to propose any major legislation since his Jan. 20 inauguration. Some Republicans fear voters will punish their party in the November 2018 elections for inaction now, and that congressional losses would make it even harder for Trump to get things done in 2019-2020, the second half of his four-year term. Republicans failure to repeal Obamacare is going to be difficult to explain to the (Republican) base, former Senate Majority Tom Daschle, a Democrat, said in a recent interview.   There are some achievements for Republicans to point to, including the Senate confirmation in April of Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, conservative judge Neil Gorsuch. This week, congressional Democrats and Republicans also pressured Trump into enacting a Russia-Iran-North Korea sanctions bill. Lawmakers also managed to pass bills to improve veterans healthcare and renew a Food and Drug Administration funding stream for reviewing drug safety. The Senate confirmed a new FBI director and Congress also repealed 14 Obama-era regulations. But as Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina told reporters, he and his fellow Republicans lack traction on major legislation. We have not done well on the big events. When Congress returns in early September, Republicans want to focus on taxes. But a comprehensive tax reform initiative remains under wraps amid deep divisions in the party. There has been no movement on legislation to finance the rebuilding of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who faces a possible tough re-election next year, said Trump remains popular among voters in her state, which he carried by 36 points in November. Theyre grateful for the rollback of what we all considered onerous regulations against industry; onerous overreach by EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), Heitkamp said of the regulations then-President Barack Obama imposed before leaving office, which Trump and Congress nullified. Republicans want to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, an action that was supposed to have been taken care of long before the summer recess. Without the measure, Republican legislation rewriting the U.S. tax code might not advance. There are serious disagreements among Republicans about long-term spending levels, however.

However, the Senate did not vote to confirm another Republican nominee, Dawn Stump.  A Senate Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Stump was not on the slate of nominees because the party did not want to approve a total of three Republican commissioners and only one Democrat. That would leave the CFTC with just one Democratic commissioner because the other one, Sharon Bowen, announced recently that she planned to step down soon. The aide added that once Republican President Donald Trump selects a second Democrat to replace Bowen, then that persons nomination will likely be approved along with Stumps.

In making the announcement, Sessions singled out four local police departments that had expressed interest in the new Public Safety Partnership Program, saying they first had to answer a list of questions by Aug. 18 confirming they do not have any sanctuary policies to shield illegal immigrants from possible deportation by ensuring they will allow federal immigration officials access to local jails. Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies make all of us less safe, Sessions said. The four police departments that must respond are Albuquerque, New Mexico; Baltimore, Maryland; and San Bernardino and Stockton, California. Baltimore is a welcoming city. We do not enforce federal immigration laws, said Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis, adding that when cities were initially selected for the program, there was no formal selection process and that Baltimore does not control the local jail. Jarrod Burguan, the police chief of San Bernardino, said his department first expressed interest in a similar program during the Obama administration, and remains interested in participating. He added San Bernardino is not a sanctuary city, it does not control the local jail, and he will answer the departments questions. Representatives from the other two police departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sessions announcement reflects part of a broader policy push by President Donald Trump to crack down on illegal immigration.  He has urged Congress to support funding the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and the administration has moved to dramatically widen the net of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation. The National Public Safety Partnership is a program launched in June that involves a three-year initiative geared toward areas with high rates of violent crime. Twelve cities were selected when it was first launched. Some municipalities have pushed back against the Trump administrations immigration policies. A U.S. judge last month refused to remove a block on an executive order by Trump that would have withheld federal funds from sanctuary cities, which do not use municipal funds or resources to help advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez on Thursday called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to stop making arrests in courthouses amid concerns it has a chilling effect on local policing and is sweeping up those with low-level misdemeanor cases.

(Reuters) - The 100 Democratic women who packed into a suburban Maryland conference room recently for a one-day training on how to run for political office were more than activists eager to battle President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans. The teachers, students and business leaders were also a window into the future for a Democratic Party desperate for new blood, and into the booming effort to turn the lefts grassroots anti-Trump activism into a new wave of Democratic officeholders. As thousands of potential first-time candidates explore  political bids in what Democratic veterans say is an unprecedented surge of activity, a broad but informal network of groups is beefing up efforts to train them for the task. The goal: turning neophytes into successful politicians who can win, giving the party a deep and diverse bench of up-and-coming progressive talent at all levels of government. This era of Trump has made everybody just want to run for office, and its not easy, said Josh Morrow, executive director of 314 Action, which since its founding last year has heard from about 6,000 scientists, engineers and mathematicians exploring  political runs and trained nearly 500 of them. No matter how accomplished people are, they need help when they first run, Morrow said. The surge of interest has given dispirited Democrats, long criticized as a top-heavy party lacking fresh faces, hope for a renaissance at the local and state levels after repeated setbacks under President Barack Obama. Building from the ground up, from the school board to the statehouse, is a party priority after losing nearly 1,000 state legislative seats in the last eight years. Republicans also control the White House, both chambers of Congress and 33 governors offices, the most in nearly a century. Local offices matter, and as Democrats we have sort of forgotten that, said Amanda Litman, a staffer on Democrat Hillary Clintons presidential campaign who founded the group Run for Something after the 2016 election to recruit and prepare millennials for office. For first-timers, the initial enthusiasm for public service can quickly give way to worried questions about the logistics of building a fundraising list, utilizing social media and crafting a message. I knew I had a steep learning curve, said Thereasa Black, a lawyer and Navy veteran running for the U.S. Congress from Maryland. She attended the Rockville session run by Emerge America, which prepares women for office. This is a way to find people who are like-minded and going through what you are, and can help you, she said. A Republican spokesman said Democrats would need more than training and fresh faces to gain ground in next years midterm elections given the losses of first-time Democratic candidates in special congressional races in Georgia and Montana earlier this year. The challenges that Democrats face go much deeper and come down to fundraising and messaging, said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, which sponsored a training program for about 4,500 volunteer field staff and operatives last year. Geoffrey Dittberner, 30, said he had volunteered on campaigns before deciding to run for the Minnesota legislature, but he was still unprepared for being a candidate before he was accepted into Run for Somethings training program. There were so many things I didnt know - fundraising, setting up a campaign organization - but they made it pretty easy, he said. The groups Slack application gave him access to a variety of resources, from tutorials to mentors and peer networks, discussion groups and on-call experts, he said. Aside from new groups like 314 Action and Run for Something, about a dozen established organizations that have long offered training to progressive candidates also have been flooded with interest since Trumps election. Emilys List, which for years has trained women candidates who favor abortion rights, has hired five more staffers this year for a reconstituted training unit. It already has heard from 16,000 women interested in becoming candidates this year, compared to 920 in 2016. Emerge America has seen applications jump by 87 percent and added five new state chapters. The Maryland state chapter, which ran the one-day course in Rockville, had trained 250 women by mid-year. Last year, it trained 55. At Emerges Rockville session, candidates were encouraged to listen more than they talk and delve into their own experiences to explain what motivated them to run. When we tap into our own personal story, we relate better to people in our community, Diane Fink, executive director for Emerge Maryland, told the class. She asked them to put together a three-minute story that explains how they got started. While Democrats nationally have battled over their core message, most of the training programs say they avoid telling candidates specifically what issues to emphasize. First and foremost you should be talking about what matters to voters, not to you, said veteran Democratic strategist Kelly Dietrich, who founded the National Democratic Training Committee last year to offer free online training for any Democrat running for any office. So far, more than 6,000 have signed up. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Post also published a transcript of a contentious call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in which the two leaders tangled over an agreement for the United States to accept as many 1,250 refugees held in Australia. (For the transcripts, see: wapo.st/2v2KGrp) Here  are some highlights of Trumps reported comments during the calls: Jan. 27 Trump call with Pena Nieto - Trump threatens to end talks with Mexico, if Pena Nieto continues to say Mexico will not pay for wall We cannot say that anymore because if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that. I am willing to say that we will work it out, but that means it will come out in the wash and that is okay. But you cannot say anymore that the United States is going to pay for the wall, Trump said. - Trump tells Pena Nieto that the United States has a very good trade relationship with Canada Well, Canada is no problem  do not worry about Canada, do not even think about them. That is a separate thing and they are fine and we have had a very fair relationship with Canada. It has been much more balanced and much more fair. So we do not have to worry about Canada, we do not even think about them, Trump said. - Trump tells Pena Nieto that Mexico has some tough hombres You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with, and we are willing to help you with that big-league. But they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job of knocking them out, Trump said. So we have to work together to knock that out. And I know this is a tough group of people, and maybe your military is afraid of them, but our military is not afraid of them, and we will help you with that 100 percent because it is out of control  totally out of control, he said. - Trump talks to Pena Nieto about the importance of the wall Believe it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important talk about, Trump said. - Trump on New Hampshire And we have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire  I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den  is coming from the southern border, Trump said.

Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people. Really it looks like 2,000 people that Australia does not want and I do not blame you by the way, but the United States has become like a dumping ground, Trump said. This is going to kill me. I am the worlds greatest person that does not want to let people into the country. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week, Trump said. I will say I hate it. Look, I spoke to Putin, Merkel, Abe of Japan, to France today, and this was my most unpleasant call because I will be honest with you. I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people, Trump said. I have had it.

During a July 19 meeting in the White House Situation Room, Trump demanded that his top national security aides provide more information on what one official called the end-state in a country where the United States has spent 16 years fighting against the Taliban with no end in sight.  The meeting grew stormy when Trump said Defense Secretary James Mattis and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford, a Marine general, should consider firing Army General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, for not winning the war.  We arent winning, he told them, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  RELATED COVERAGE Commentary: Steve Bannon is right on Afghanistan Commentary: The road to Afghanistan peace does not lie in Kabul In addition, once the meeting concluded, Trumps chief strategist, Steve Bannon, got into what one official called a shouting match with White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster over the direction of U.S. policy.  Some officials left the meeting stunned by the presidents vehement complaints that the military was allowing the United States to lose the war.  Mattis, McMaster and other top aides are putting together answers to Trumps questions in a way to try to get him to approve the strategy, the officials said.  The White House had no comment on the accounts of the meeting.  Another meeting of top aides is scheduled on Thursday.  Although Trump earlier this year gave Mattis the authority to deploy U.S. military forces as he sees fit, in fact the defense secretarys plans to add around 4,000 more U.S. troops to the 8,400 currently deployed in Afghanistan are being caught up in the delay surrounding the strategy, the officials said.  Its been contingent all along informally on the strategy being approved, a senior administration official said of the troop deployment.  Trump has long been a skeptic of lingering U.S. involvement in foreign wars and has expressed little interest in deploying military forces without a specific plan on what they will do and for how long.  Officials said Trump argued that the United States should demand a share of Afghanistans estimated $1 trillion in mineral wealth in exchange for its assistance to the Afghan government.  But other officials noted that without securing the entire country, which could take many years, there is no way to get the countrys mineral riches to market, except to Iran.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a crackdown on illegal immigration that has sharply reduced the number of unauthorized border crossings from Mexico, U.S. President Donald Trump is now turning his attention to reducing the number of legal immigrants in the country. The White House is throwing its support behind a bill developed by Republican senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia that would cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years by reducing the kinds of relatives immigrants can bring into the country.  But the legislation faces an uphill climb to get through Congress where some senior Republicans back comprehensive immigration reform, not a tough crackdown. Under the new bill, known as the RAISE Act, the United States would prioritize high-skilled immigrants by setting up a merits-based system similar to those used by Canada and Australia.  Trump and the Republican lawmakers blasted the current immigration system as out of date and argued that it hurts American workers by driving down wages. This competitive application process will favor applicants who can speak English, financially support themselves and their families and demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy, Trump said. The Senators said they worked closely with the White House on this latest version of their bill. This is probably our third or fourth visit to the Oval Office to work with President Trump, Cotton told reporters. Slashing legal immigration has long been pushed by low-immigration advocacy groups in Washington like NumbersUSA and the ideas have been backed by now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is now facing public criticism from Trump. NumbersUSA President Roy Beck hailed the bill and said that it will do more than any other action to fulfill President Trumps promises as a candidate. Trump vowed to crack down on illegal immigration during his campaign and signed two executive orders soon after taking office to increase border security and interior enforcement. Cotton and Perdue said their bill does not affect temporary visas for workers in certain tech sectors and seasonal jobs that are popular with many businesses. They stressed that the legislation was narrowly focused, an approach they hoped would be able to get bipartisan support. Were not trying to boil the ocean here and change everything about our immigration law, Cotton said. But other Republican lawmakers said the bill might be going too far. Senator Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, said his state is dependent on immigrant labor to sustain the two biggest sectors of the economy, agriculture and tourism.       Economists have called into the question the benefits of cutting legal immigration. FWD.us, a group that represents the tech industry said that the bill would severely harm the economy.       The bill aims to end the diversity visa lottery, which allows 50,000 people from underrepresented countries to obtain green cards.  It also sets a 50,000 annual cap on refugees, instead of a level mandated by the president.  Refugee organizations said permanently limiting number of refugees allowed in the country goes against an American value of offering safe haven to people fleeing violence and oppression.  Trump suggested at an event in New Yorks Long Island on Friday, where he spoke out against violence committed by Central American gang members, that immigrants today are different than in previous generations.    What happened to the old days when people came into this country and they worked and they worked and they worked and they had families and paid taxes and they did all sorts of things and their families got stronger and they were closely knit? Trump asked the audience of law enforcement officers. We dont see that.      ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump grudgingly signed into law new sanctions against Russia on Wednesday, a move Moscow said amounted to a full-scale trade war and an end to hopes for better ties with the Trump administration. Congress overwhelmingly approved the legislation last week, passing a measure that conflicts with the Republican presidents desire to improve relations with Moscow. Trump signed the bill behind closed doors, without the fanfare that has customarily accompanied his signing of executive orders. He criticized the measure as infringing on his powers to shape foreign policy, and said he could make far better deals with governments than Congress can. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called the sanctions tantamount to a full-scale trade war, adding in a Facebook post that they showed the Trump administration had demonstrated utter powerlessness. The hope that our relations with the new American administration would improve is finished, he wrote. Trumps litany of concerns about the sanctions, which also affect Iran and North Korea, raised the question of how vigorously Trump will implement them regarding Russia. While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed, Trump said in a message to lawmakers known as a signing statement. He also issued a statement for the press about the bill. The new law allows Congress, which passed the measure to punish Russia over interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the annexation of Ukraines Crimea, to halt any effort by Trump to ease sanctions on Russia.  His hands were tied after the Republican-controlled Congress approved the legislation by such a large margin last week that any presidential veto of the bill would have been overridden. The legislation provoked countermeasures by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said on Sunday that the U.S. diplomatic mission in Russia must reduce its staff by 755 people. Russia is also seizing two properties near Moscow used by American diplomats. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to improve relations with Russia. That desire has been stymied by U.S. intelligence agencies findings that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed the signing, saying it would send a powerful message to our adversaries that they will be held accountable. In his statements on the sanctions law, Trump complained about what he said was congressional infringement on the presidents constitutional power to set foreign policy, saying the law reflected congressional preferences rather than a legal mandate. It is flagging those areas where the administration sees itself as having wiggle room to underenforce the law by citing claimed constitutional concerns, said Harold Koh, a Yale Law School professor who was a legal adviser to the State Department during the Obama administration. The Houses top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, said the signing statement raises serious questions about whether his administration intends to follow the law. Trump said he was elected partly because of his successes in business, adding, As President, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress. Trumps signing statement was the latest in a series of mixed signals from the administration on Russia. I feel like theres several policies being implemented at once, and theyre not very compatible with one another. This is one more, said Olga Oliker, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington. Vice President Mike Pence, touring Baltic countries adjacent to Russia, has followed a hawkish line. Pence said Trumps signing of the legislation would show that Congress and the president were speaking with a unified voice on Russia. However, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, like Trump, has been critical of the legislation. The action by the Congress to put these sanctions in place and the way they did, neither the president nor I were very happy about that, Tillerson said on Tuesday. The sanctions will affect a range of Russian industries and might further hurt Russias economy, already weakened by 2014 sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea. Besides angering Moscow, the legislation has upset the European Union, which has said the new sanctions might affect its energy security and prompt it to retaliate if needed. Several provisions of the law target the Russian energy sector, with new limits on U.S. investment in Russian companies. American companies also would be barred from participating in energy exploration projects where Russian firms have a stake of 33 percent or higher.  The legislation includes sanctions on foreign companies investing in or helping Russian energy exploration, although the president could waive those sanctions.  It would give the Trump administration the option of imposing sanctions on companies helping develop Russian export pipelines, such as the Nord Stream 2 pipeline carrying natural gas to Europe, in which German companies are involved.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer pressed the Republican president to skip the investigation and go straight to trade action against China.  We should certainly go after them, said Schumer in a statement. Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio also urged Trump to rein in China. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated in recent months as Trump has pressed China to cut steel production to ease global oversupply and rein in North Koreas missile program. Sources familiar with the current discussions said Trump was expected to issue a presidential memorandum in coming days, citing Chinese theft of intellectual property as a problem. The European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern over Chinas behavior on intellectual property theft.  U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer would then initiate an investigation under the Trade Act of 1974s Section 301, which allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries, the sources said.     It is unclear whether such a probe would result in trade sanctions against China, which Beijing would almost certainly challenge before the World Trade Organization (WTO). The Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement to Reuters that China opposes unilateral actions and trade protectionism in any form. A spokesman for Chinas Ministry of Commerce told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that China puts a strong emphasis on intellectual property rights and that all WTO members should respect the rules of the organization.  We hope the positive momentum of cooperation can continue following recent bilateral trade talks, said commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng.   U.S. Section 301 investigations have not led to trade sanctions since the WTO was launched in 1995. In the 1980s, Section 301 tariffs were levied against Japanese motorcycles, steel and other products. This could merely be leverage for bilateral negotiations, James Bacchus, a former WTO chief judge and USTR official, said of a China intellectual property probe. Some trade lawyers said that WTO does not have jurisdiction over investment rules such as Chinas requirements that foreign companies transfer technology to their joint venture partners, allowing sanctions to proceed outside the WTOs dispute settlement system. But Bacchus argued the United States has an obligation to turn first to the Geneva-based institution to resolve trade disputes, adding: There is an obligation in WTO to enforce intellectual property rights that is not fully explored. Lighthizer and Trumps Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, have  complained the WTO is slow to resolve disputes and biased against the United States. The threat comes at a time when Trump has become increasingly frustrated with the level of support from Beijing to pressure Pyongyang to give up its nuclear and missile program. Trump has said in the past that China would get better treatment on trade with the United States if it acted more forcefully against Pyongyang. Beijing has said its influence on North Korea is limited. China counters that trade between the two nations benefits both sides, and that Beijing is willing to improve trade ties. A senior Chinese official said on Monday there was no link between North Koreas nuclear program and China-U.S. trade. Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to Lighthizer urging action to stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights.  Wydens state of Oregon is home to several companies that could make a case regarding intellectual property rights and China, including Nike Inc and FLIR Systems Inc.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. The Kremlin says it did not interfere in the election, and Trump has denied any collusion. Last week, Trump assailed Sessions in a tweet as very weak and said he was very disappointed with his attorney general in a Wall Street Journal interview.

To bring in skilled workers, Canada uses a points system to assess immigrants ability to enter the Canadian workforce. The majority of Canadas economic immigrants this year are expected to come from this so-called express entry system.  Canada plans to allow 300,000 immigrants into the country this year. Applicants are ranked on their age, education, language ability, and work experience and earn points for each category up to 600. For example, people aged between 20-29 years get the maximum 100 points while those over 45 get zero for that category. Potential immigrants get additional points if they have a sibling who is a citizen or permanent resident of Canada. Immigrants spouses are assessed on the same criteria if they are also applying to come to Canada. For a full list of points awarded under the ranking system, see here With a population of about 35 million, the immigration target for 2017 amounts to 0.9 percent of the population.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers must deliver tax legislation to President Donald Trumps desk before December or lose their chance to enact bold reforms capable of driving the U.S. economy, a leading Republican conservative said on Wednesday. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told conservative activists that the prospects for significant tax reform would diminish as lawmakers approach the start of the 2018 congressional election campaign in January.  He said lawmakers needed to introduce tax legislation in September, pass the measure through the House of Representatives and Senate and send it to Trumps desk by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. If it doesnt get there by Thanksgiving, guys, it isnt going to happen, Meadows said.  The White House has said it expects the House to vote on a tax bill in October and the Senate in November. Trumps fellow Republicans control both chambers, Analysts say the schedule could be too optimistic, because Congress is due to spend much of September and possibly October on spending bills to keep the government open and a debt ceiling increase to avoid default on sovereign U.S. debt. Lawmakers could be more likely to approve tax legislation in early 2018, the analysts say. But Meadows rejected that possibility. The minute we go past January, everybody starts saying: We cant do anything too bold, he said.  Republicans plan to move tax legislation forward through a procedure known as reconciliation, which would allow the Senate to pass a bill with a simple majority. Republicans control the chamber by a 52-48 margin and would otherwise need 60 votes. The failure of Senate Republicans to find a simple majority for healthcare legislation last week has led to calls for bipartisan tax reform.   White House budget director Mick Mulvaney shot down that idea earlier on Wednesday.  A tax bill looks a lot weaker, a lot less likely to get us to 3 percent economic growth, if weve got eight, 10, 12, 14 Democrats on it, he told Fox News. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell rejected a Democratic overture for broad bipartisanship on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he still hoped some Democrats would back Republican tax legislation. There is a great deal of bipartisan consensus about what ails our tax code, and my hope is that our friends on the other side of the aisle will join with us in a serious way, McConnell said on the Senate floor.

The U.S. government last month said it would bar Americans from traveling to North Korea due to the risk of long-term detention there. The ban comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea, which has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. North Korea will become the only country to which Americans are banned from traveling.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis testified at a classified Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, as it writes an authorization for the fight against the militant group in Syria and Iraq. They expressed a willingness to work on an authorization and I take them at their word, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told reporters. Earlier Wednesday, State said in a letter to the committees Republican chairman, Senator Bob Corker, that the administration is not seeking any additional authorization or any revisions to a 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF). The United States has sufficient legal authority to prosecute the campaign against al-Qaida and associated forces, including against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, wrote Charles Faulkner of the Departments Bureau of Legislative Affairs. The 2001 AUMF, passed days after the Sept. 11 attacks to authorize the fight against al Qaeda and affiliates, has been used by presidents since as the legal basis for a wide range of military action. Some members of Congress argue that it is long past time to repeal the 16-year-old authorization, especially for the campaign against Islamic State, which did not exist in 2001 and actually fights against al Qaeda in Syria and elsewhere. The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the right to approve such military action. Lawmakers have been struggling with the White House for a bigger say in foreign policy. Corker said Tillerson and Mattis were open to a new AUMF written in the appropriate way. He said, The administrations not seeking an AUMF (but) ... Im confident theyll work with us. It is not clear that any new AUMF could pass the Senate and House of Representatives. Attempts in recent years have come to nothing. There are disagreements even within the committee over how to proceed. Republican Senator Ron Johnson said he believes the 2001 authorization applies to the anti-IS campaign. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, a leading advocate for a new AUMF, said Mattis and other military leaders agreed congressional action would send a message of resolve to U.S. adversaries and allies, and support the troops.

Susan Thornton, the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Tillerson would have the chance to engage with Chinas foreign minister at the meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Manila, but had no plans to meet North Koreas foreign minister there. Thornton said Tillerson, who is due in Manila on Saturday, would be seeking greater cooperation in isolating North Korea and in enforcing U.N. sanctions over its missile and nuclear weapons programs. She said Washington wanted to see countries drastically reduce their dealings with Pyongyang. What we are trying to do is galvanize this pressure and isolate North Korea so it can see what the opportunity cost is over developing these weapons programs, she told reporters in a telephone briefing to preview Tillersons trip. Thornton said China had taken significant steps, ... frankly unprecedented steps to increase pressure on its neighbor North Korea, but it could do a lot more to step up enforcement of existing sanctions and to impose more. We would like to see more action faster and more obvious and quick results, but I think were not giving up yet. Thorntons remarks contrasted with those of U.S. President Donald Trump, who on Saturday accused Beijing of doing nothing to help on North Korea and pointed to the huge U.S. trade deficit with China. A senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday that Trump was close to a decision on how to respond to what he considers Chinas unfair trade practices and was considering action that could lead to tariffs or other trade restrictions on Chinese goods. Thornton declined to comment on any possible action but stressed that despite Trumps tweets, North Korea and the trade issue were not linked in a transactional, but in a sort of philosophical way. Can we work together jointly on the key security challenge facing Northeast Asia, which is the North Korea challenge? she said. If we can work together to do that, surely we can have a productive, mutually beneficial economic relationship in which we both enjoy reciprocal and fair access to each others markets. Thornton said Tillerson would continue to press China on the South China Sea issue while in Asia, where the United State has been pressing for rapid adoption of a code of conduct over competing territorial claims. She said the United States would certainly raise human  rights with Philippine President Dutertes government. U.S. criticism of Dutertes bloody war on drugs under Trumps predecessor Barack Obama damaged relations between the long-standing allies. Duterte has remained defiant, accusing critics of trivializing his drug campaign with human rights concerns. Tillerson will also visit Thailand next Tuesday and then Malaysia.

Republican President Donald Trump, frustrated that Obamacare survived attempts to repeal it, has threatened to cut off about $8 billion in subsidies that help control costs for low-income Americans under the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic initiative. The Administration has the opportunity to stabilize the health insurance market across our nation and ensure that our residents can continue to access affordable health care coverage, said a statement by the Health and Human Services Committee of the National Governors Association. A first critical step ... is to fully fund CSRs (cost-sharing reduction payments) for the remainder of calendar year 2017 through 2018, the statement said, adding this was needed as Congress and the administration address long-term reform efforts. The committee is led by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, a Republican. Earlier this year, the governors sent a letter calling on Congress to fully fund the cost-sharing payments. Some Congressional Republicans have joined Democrats in urging Trump to continue the payments. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of the health committee, said Tuesday the president should pay the subsidies through September while lawmakers work on bipartisan legislation to fund the outlays for another year. But the Senates No. 2 Republican John Cornyn hesitated when asked Wednesday if he would support such legislation. Ive said before that Im not in favor of throwing money at insurance companies without reform, so thats going to be the nature of the conversation, Cornyn told reporters outside his office. Asked what reforms hed like to see, Cornyn mentioned the skinny Obamacare repeal bill the Senate voted down last week. Among other things, it would have repealed the requirement that every American have health insurance or pay a penalty. Insurers say that the cost-sharing payments are passed onto customers in the form of lower deductibles and co-pays that make care more affordable for low income Americans. Insurers are finalizing 2018 premium rates for the individual Obamacare market, with many saying their decision hinges on government guarantees for cost-sharing subsidies. Molina Healthcare Inc said on Wednesday it would stop selling Obamacare plans in Utah and Wisconsin, joining a slew of health insurers that have exited Obamacare markets amid uncertainty over the healthcare law. Anthem Inc, one of the largest sellers of these plans in 2017, has pared back offerings or mostly exited five states including California and may exit more.

Trump is considering encouraging U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to initiate an investigation of Chinese trade practices under the 1974 Trade Acts section 301, the official said. An announcement could come as early as this week, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from unfair trade practices of foreign countries, such as trade agreement violations, or discriminatory actions that burden U.S. commerce. The United States has a long list of grievances about China on trade, including accusations of steel dumping and theft of U.S. intellectual property. China has said that trade between China and the United States benefits both sides and that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to improve their trade relationship. Trump has long been a critic of Chinese trade practices but his interest in penalizing Beijing has risen because of his concern at what he perceives to be Chinese inaction on reining in increasingly belligerent North Korea. The United States has pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing has repeatedly said its influence on North Korea is limited and that it is doing all it can. A senior Chinese official said on Monday there was no link between North Koreas nuclear program and China-U.S. trade. Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia, told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that new U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing North Koreans weapons programs, including measures aimed at Chinese financial institutions, could be expected fairly soon. Section 301 was used extensively in the 1980s to combat Japanese imports of motorcycles, steel and other products - an era during which Lighthizer served as deputy U.S. trade representative. The statute has been little used since the World Trade Organization was launched in 1995. The WTO provides a forum for resolving trade disputes, but Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have complained that it is extremely slow, often taking years to reach a conclusion, and that the Geneva-based organization has an inherent anti-U.S. bias. Both Chinas Foreign Ministry and Commerce Ministry did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met Michigans governor Rick Snyder in Beijing on Tuesday, where he said the common interests of China and  the United States were bigger than any disputes. China welcomes U.S. states, including Michigan, to ... enhance bilateral trade and investment, ... and consolidate and expand cooperative consensus to create better development opportunities and jobs for both countries peoples, Li told Snyder, according to a Chinese government statement. The Trump administration believes in free and fair trade and will use every available tool to counter the protectionism of those who pledge allegiance to free trade while violating its core principles, Ross said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Tuesday.  He tried to refute arguments that the Trump administration was taking a protectionist stance, saying that both China and Europe were more protectionist because they subsidized export industries and had formidable tariff and non-tariff trade barriers against imports. China is not a market economy. The Chinese government creates national champions and takes other actions that significantly distort markets, Ross wrote. Responding to such actions with trade remedies is not protectionist. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump has preserved the deal for now, although he has made clear he did so reluctantly after being advised to do so by Tillerson. He and I have differences of views on things like JCPOA, and how we should use it, Tillerson said at a State Department briefing, using the acronym for the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Tillerson said that Washington could tear it up and walk away or stay in the deal and hold Iran accountable to its terms, which he said would require Iran to act as a good neighbor. Critics say the deal falls short in addressing Irans support for foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria, arms shipments around the Middle East and ballistic missile tests. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tillersons remarks. Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last month that he predicts Iran will be judged noncompliant with the Iran deal at the next deadline in October, and that he would have preferred to do so months ago. Tillerson expressed a more nuanced view of the deals potential benefits on Tuesday. There are a lot of alternative means with which we use the agreement to advance our policies and the relationship with Iran, and thats what the conversation generally is around with the president as well, Tillerson said. European officials would likely be reluctant to re-impose sanctions, especially the broader measures that helped drive Iran to negotiate over its nuclear program in the first place. New U.S. sanctions on Iran in July were a breach of the nuclear deal and Tehran had lodged a complaint with the body that oversees the pacts implementation, a senior Iranian politician said. Tillerson acknowledged that the United States is limited in how much it can pressure Iran on its own and said it was important to coordinate with the other parties to the agreement. The greatest pressure we can put to bear on Iran to change the behavior is a collective pressure, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The U.S. Congress voted last week by overwhelming margins  for sanctions to punish the Russian government over interference in the 2016 presidential election, annexation of Crimea and other perceived violations of international norms.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that he and Trump did not believe the new sanctions would be helpful to our efforts on diplomacy with Russia. Trump has been clear that he wants to improve relations with Russia, a desire that has been hamstrung by findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. Tillerson, who did business in Russia when he was chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has said repeatedly that the worlds two major nuclear powers cannot have such a bad relationship. The action by the Congress to put these sanctions in place and the way they did, neither the President nor I were very happy about that, Tillerson said. We were clear that we didnt think it was going to be helpful to our efforts, but thats the decision they made, they made it in a very overwhelming way. I think the president accepts that. Tillerson stopped short of saying definitively that Trump would sign the sanctions, saying only that all indications are he will sign that bill. Vice President Mike Pence, at a press conference in Georgia with Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, said unequivocally that President Trump will sign the Russia sanctions bill soon. Pence acknowledged that the administration objected to earlier versions of the sanctions bill because it did not grant enough flexibility to the administration, but said it improved significantly in later versions. And let me say that in signing the sanction, our President and our Congress are speaking with a unified voice, Pence said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday the sanctions bill was under review and would be signed. Theres nothing holding him back, Sanders said at a news briefing. Trump has until Aug. 9 to sign the bill, or veto it, or it will automatically become law. In retaliation for the sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that the U.S. diplomatic mission in Russia must reduce its staff by 755 people. Russia is also seizing two properties near Moscow used by American diplomats. Tillerson said Putin probably believes his response was a symmetrical action to Washington seizing two Russian properties in the United States and expelling 35 diplomats last December. Of course it makes our lives more difficult, he said. Tillerson said he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would meet in Manila on the margins of next weekends meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday allowed Democratic state attorneys general to defend subsidy payments to insurance companies under the Obamacare healthcare law, a critical part of funding for the statute that President Donald Trump has threatened to cut off. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted a motion filed by the 16 attorneys general, led by Californias Xavier Becerra and New Yorks Eric Schneiderman. President Donald Trump, frustrated that he and fellow Republicans in Congress have been unable to keep campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare, has threatened to stop making the so-called cost-sharing subsidy, or CSR, payments. The President is working with his staff and his cabinet to consider the issues raised by the CSR payments, a White House statement said. The subsidies help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. The case, which dates back to administration of President Barack Obama, was filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives against the federal government in an effort to block the subsidy payments to insurers for the individual plans created by the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The courts order allows Democrats who back the law to have a say in the legal fight, giving them the power to block a settlement or appeal a ruling blocking the payments. They can also file briefs and their lawyers can participate in oral arguments. The courts decision is good news for the hundreds of thousands of New York families that rely on these subsidies for their health care. Its disturbingly clear that President Trump and his administration are willing to treat them as political pawns, Schneiderman said in a statement. If Donald Trump wont defend these vital subsidies for American families, then we will, Becerra said. The order issued by the three-judge panel, all Obama appointees, said the states had shown a substantial risk that an injunction requiring termination of the payments at issue here ... would lead directly and imminently to an increase in insurance prices, which in turn will increase the number of uninsured individuals for whom the states will have to provide health care. In addition, state-funded hospitals will suffer financially when they are unable to recoup costs from uninsured, indigent patients for whom federal law requires them to provide medical care, the court order said. Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said the decision was a big deal because it makes it difficult for the Trump administration to settle the case. Allowing the states to intervene will increase the pressure on the administration to keep making the cost-sharing payments, he said, noting that the administration could still stop making the payments. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold the payments to insurers, which amount to about $7 billion this year, and referred to them as a bailout. The attorneys general cited in their May court filing Trumps own words vowing to let Obamacare explode as part of the reasoning for their intervention.    The case is currently on hold at the request of both sides. The expectation had been that the case would be dismissed because the Republican-controlled Congress was poised to repeal the Obamacare law. But that effort failed last week, meaning the court case has taken on renewed importance. U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc is pulling back from 16 of 19 pricing regions in California where it offered Obamacare options this year in part due to uncertainty over the payments, state officials said on Tuesday.

Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey who was one of the EXIM Banks leading opponents during a 2015 fight in Congress to shut it down, refused to confirm that he would unequivocally support reauthorizing the bank, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and seven other senators said in a statement after meeting with Garrett. The nominee for EXIM chairman has met with strong opposition from industry groups that use its financing, including the National Association of Manufacturers, which said Garrett had a track record of trying to undermine the institution. The bank has been unable to approve loans above $10 million for two years because of efforts by conservative Republicans in Congress to shut it down and then block nominations to its board, keeping it from financing large aircraft, satellites, power turbines and other major projects. Critics have charged that EXIM provides unnecessary corporate welfare to large companies such as Boeing (BA.N), General Electric (GE.N) and Caterpillar (CAT.N), putting taxpayers at risk. The bank also provides export financing and guarantees for thousands of small manufacturers. Todays meeting was bizarre. Scott Garrett  one of the most vocal opponents of the Export-Import Bank while he was in Congress  agreed to speak with us about his nomination, but during the meeting, he wouldnt discuss his personal thoughts about the Bank and its mission, the senators said in a statement.

Greg Andres started on Tuesday, becoming the 16th lawyer on the team, said Josh Stueve, a spokesman for the special counsel. Most recently a white-collar criminal defense lawyer with New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, Andres, 50, served at the Justice Department from 2010 to 2012. He was deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division, where he oversaw the fraud unit and managed the program that targeted illegal foreign bribery. Mueller, who was appointed special counsel in May, is looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and  Russia during the election, among other matters. Congressional committees are also investigating the matter. That Mueller continues to expand his team means the probe is not going to end anytime soon, said Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as independent counsel for the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration. Its an indication that the investigation is going to extend well into 2018, said Ray. Whether it extends beyond 2018 is an open question. The special counsel last month asked the White House to preserve all of its communications about a June 2016 meeting that included the presidents eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign.  Among the cases Andres oversaw at the Justice Department was the prosecution of Texas financier Robert Allen Stanford, who was convicted in 2012 for operating an $8 billion Ponzi scheme.    Before that, Andres was a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn for over a decade, eventually serving as chief of the criminal division in the U.S. attorneys office there. He prosecuted several members of the Bonanno organized crime family, one of whom was accused of plotting to have Andres killed. A graduate of Notre Dame and University of Chicago Law School, Andres was a Peace Corps volunteer in Benin from 1989 to 1992. He is married to Ronnie Abrams, a U.S. district judge in Manhattan nominated to the bench in 2011 by Democratic President Barack Obama. Others on the special counsel team include Andrew Weissmann, chief of the Justice Departments fraud section; Andrew Goldstein, former head of the public corruption unit at the U.S. Attorneys Office in Manhattan; and James Quarles, who was an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation that helped bring down President Richard Nixon.

Alexander, who chairs the Senate health committee, urged U.S. President Donald Trump to drop his threat to cut government subsidy payments to insurers that make Obamacare plans affordable and to allow the payments through September. The senator also said fellow lawmakers should fund those payments for one year. Alexanders announcement followed the spectacular failure last week by Senate Republicans to pass their own repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obamas signature domestic initiative also referred to as Obamacare. The Tennessee Republican said the Senate health committee will hold hearings beginning the week of September 4 on the actions Congress should take to stabilize and strengthen the individual health insurance market so that Americans will be able to buy insurance at affordable prices in the year 2018. The goal, Alexander said, would be legislation sponsored by both parties that would stabilize the insurance market and help lower premiums in 2018 for the roughly 18 million Americans who buy health insurance in the individual market, instead of getting insurance through an employer. Trump, frustrated that he and Republicans have not been able to keep promises to repeal and replace Obamacare, has threatened to let the law implode, including by cutting off about $8 billion in subsidies that are used to make Obamacare health plans more affordable for low income Americans. Insurers, who are finalizing their insurance premium rates for 2018, have asked Congress to guarantee that those funds will stay in place for the rest of this year and 2018. Without the subsidies, they say they will need to raise premium rates by about 20 percent. Without an answer, insurers have filed preliminary rates based on different parameters: Some set rates that assumed the subsidies would be paid, others set rates that assumed they would not, and some submitted two different set of rates reflecting both outcomes. Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the health panel, welcomed Alexanders statement and said she looked forward to working in a bipartisan manner to stabilize the healthcare market and reduce premiums. In the House, a bipartisan group of 43 lawmakers on Monday called for Congress to quickly stabilize the individual insurance market by appropriating money for the cost-sharing payments and creating a stability fund for states.

The move, which takes effect for 2018, means Anthem will offer Obamacare coverage in three pricing regions comprising 28 counties in California. That is just 41 percent of its current enrollment, or about 108,000 consumers, leaving some 153,000 consumers without Anthem Obamacare options, state officials said. Anthem blamed the move in part on uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would maintain subsidies that keep costs down among the factors that have led to an increasing overall lack of predictability. As a result, the insurer said it does not allow them to provide affordable plan choices for all California consumers.  The market for these plans has become unstable. And with federal rules and guidance changing, its no longer possible for us to offer some of those plans, Brian Ternan, president of Anthem Blue Cross of California, said in a statement on the companys website. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to cut off subsidy payments that make the plans affordable for lower income Americans and help insurers to keep premiums down, after efforts to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, failed in Congress.  Trump has repeatedly urged Republican lawmakers to keep working to undo Obamas Affordable Care Act which has extended insurance to some 20 million more Americans. Anthem said it would offer individual plans both in and out of the states exchanges in the three regions made up of those 28 counties.  Anthem, which announced last month that it was mostly exiting individual plans in Wisconsin and Indiana, said the decision does not affect those with employer-provided insurance, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medi-Cal or grandfathered plans purchased before March 2010.

The move retracted broad decision-making authority granted to the agencys third-highest ranking official, the undersecretary for political affairs, by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Most of those powers will be reserved instead for Tillerson and his deputy. Tillerson is broadly reviewing how authority is delegated, a State Department official said, which will result in a streamlining of delegations, which will promote greater transparency, clarity and effectiveness in decision-making within the Department.  On July 17, Tillerson reversed Clintons 2009 decision to empower the undersecretary for political affairs, currently career diplomat Thomas Shannon, with all authorities and functions vested in the Secretary of State. Former officials said Clintons delegation of authority was helpful in allowing decisions to be made quickly when she or her deputy were traveling abroad. Everyone travels all of the time if youre doing your job right as a diplomat, said a former State Department official who served during the Obama administration and requested anonymity. There has to be some delegation of authority, or the work simply doesnt get done. Tillersons decision came as most of the high-level positions at the State Department are either empty or filled by career officials in an acting capacity. The secretary has said he wants to be cautious about hiring while he is conducting a review of the State Departments organization. On Tuesday, Tillerson acknowledged to reporters that I have a lot of open slots, but said he had been able to accomplish a great deal because there are remarkable, talented professional foreign service officers in this building. But the slow pace of appointments has logjammed decision-making and resulted in a rank-and-file bureaucracy disconnected from top officials, diplomats and some members of Congress said.  We dont know what the policies are, and the diplomats dont know what the policies are, Senator Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Tuesday. The second authority Tillerson took back from the undersecretary for political affairs in July was approval of State Department reports to Congress, which will now sit with the Office of Policy Planning, an internal State Department body usually headed by a political appointee. Unlike other senior officials, the office director and staff do not need Senate confirmation. The State Department is required by law to produce hundreds of reports for Congress each year, including on acts of terrorism, human rights conditions in different countries, countries narcotics control strategies, the state of religious freedom around the world, and human trafficking. Typically, such reports are prepared by offices and embassies with expertise in the relevant issue, and are reviewed by the State Departments Bureau of Legislative Affairs and top aides to the secretary of state before being sent to Congress. Three former officials said giving the policy planning staff final sign-off on the reports could inject political considerations into their preparation. The undersecretary for political affairs is typically a career foreign service officer, and oversees seven regional bureaus. The move represents a power grab by the policy planning body, said Eliot Cohen, who served as State Department counselor during former President George W. Bushs administration. You need a strong undersecretary for political affairs, Cohen said. You cant run the State Department with a tiny office ... you need to go out and establish good working relationships with the professionals of the department.

Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee asked its Republican leaders in a letter to summon Wells Fargo Chairman Stephen Sanger and Chief Executive Tim Sloan. That letter accompanied one sent by Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, who wants to know how Wells Fargo wrongly charged roughly 570,000 customers for auto insurance they did not ask for or need, leading to unwarranted delinquencies and car repossessions. Unwanted auto insurance is the latest wrinkle in a months-long scandal over sales practices at Wells Fargo, where employees also created as many as 2.1 million deposit and credit card accounts in customers names without their permission. Members should have the opportunity to question Mr. Sloan about the banks progress in addressing the damage it did to its customers, said the Senate letter, signed by Democrats including ranking member Sherrod Brown. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said the bank looked forward to answering questions from Washington. Wells Fargo understands and is committed to addressing policymaker concerns, said Jennifer Dunn. We are committed to fixing these mistakes and earning back trust. Employees have said they created unauthorized accounts to hit sales goals handed down by management. The creation of fake accounts and misplaced insurance charges went on for years before the banks management took action. After Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with regulators over the fake accounts in September, its then-Chairman and CEO John Stumpf appeared before both committees to face questions from lawmakers at heated hearings. He left the bank shortly after, to be replaced by Sloan and Sanger. Whether Stumpfs successors will be hauled before Congress publicly is uncertain. Only Republicans can summon witnesses, since that party controls Congress. The senate letter urged Idaho Senator Mike Crapo, who chairs the banking panel, to call a Wells Fargo hearing in September.

It added they should not engage in campaign-related activity even in a hallway, office or cafeteria, and ethics rules also apply to messages sent from personal devices.  In this age of always-on mobile communications, members may find it impractical or unreasonable to have to exit a House building before sending a three-word campaign email, the committee wrote.

The move, coming just 10 days after the Republican president named Scaramucci to the post, took place on the first day of work for Trumps new chief of staff, retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, who sources said was seeking to impose order on a White House riven with factions and backbiting. Theres a new sheriff in town, said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser. A Republican close to Trump said the president fretted on the weekend over what to do about Scaramucci, calling his advisers to ask their opinion, all of whom told him the tough-talking aide had to go. Trump was annoyed about Scaramuccis lewd comments to The New Yorker magazine published last Thursday and at how the abrasive New York financier appeared to inflate the strength of their friendship, since he had started the 2016 presidential election cycle as a fundraiser for two Trump rivals, Scott Walker and Jeb Bush. Trump decided it was time to cut him loose, the source said. Kelly, who also wanted him removed, summoned Scaramucci to Kellys office on Monday morning and fired him on the spot, the official said. It was one of Kellys first acts as chief of staff. A great day at the White House! Trump tweeted on Monday evening. The departure of Scaramucci followed one of the rockiest weeks of Trumps presidency in which a major Republican effort to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system failed in Congress and both his spokesman and previous chief of staff left their jobs as White House infighting burst into the open.    Scaramuccis comments to The New Yorker included a profanity-laced attack against then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trumps chief strategist, Steve Bannon. The president certainly felt that Anthonys comments were inappropriate for a person in that position, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. In a change from previous procedure at the Trump White House, all staff will now report to Kelly, including Trumps daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, Sanders said. A Republican official close to the White House said Kelly had been given wide authority to impose order on the unruly Trump White House. Things will run with regular order, the official said, adding that even the presidents daughter and her husband, who both have senior roles at the White House, are not above the law. At a dinner on Saturday night at Trumps hotel near the White House, Trump told Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to expect some staff changes, the official said. Kelly attended the dinner as well. Tensions in Trumps inner circle erupted last week when Scaramucci assailed Priebus and Bannon, two of the West Wings most senior figures. He accused Priebus of leaking information to the media. Priebus later resigned.         Trump appeared on Monday with Kelly in the Oval Office and in a Cabinet meeting where he predicted the new chief of staff would do a spectacular job. He praised Kelly for his tenure overseeing border security issues at the Department of Homeland Security. With a very controversial situation, theres been very little controversy, which is really amazing by itself, Trump said.    Republicans fear that staff chaos at the White House could derail any attempt to revive efforts to repeal and replace the Obamacare healthcare law and a plan to overhaul the U.S. tax system. The U.S. dollar hit a more than 2-1/2-year low against the euro on Monday on month-end portfolio adjustments and uncertainty over the U.S. political outlook after Scaramuccis departure.         Aside from domestic challenges, Trump is weighing how to respond to North Koreas latest missile test - a sore point between Washington and Beijing. Trump has been critical of China, North Koreas closest ally, saying it should do more to rein in Pyongyang. He is also dealing with several investigations into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and has been frustrated that the probes are also looking into potential collusion by his campaign. Moscow rejects the charge it tried to swing the election in Trumps favor, and Trump denies his campaign had anything to do with such interference.

As Republicans in Washington try to refocus on taxes after the collapse of their failed drive to repeal Obamacare, Trump sent a morning tweet that said: Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now. Corporate lobbyists and Republicans consistently argue that a cut in the corporate income tax is needed to help corporations be more competitive. But highlighting corporate profits could diminish that argument. This is a weird way to launch their proposal to cut corporate taxes, Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said in a tweet of his own responding to Trump. The largest U.S. public companies have seen profits accelerate in 2017, with quarterly earnings rising at a double-digit pace compared with a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Full-year earnings are expected to be up 11.5 percent, which would be the strongest growth since 2011. More than six months into his presidency, Trump still sends out tweets that catch aides and allies off guard and sometimes clash with Republicans messaging on their policy agenda. The Trump tweet takes the edge of urgency off the plea to reduce the burden on corporations, said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank. Trump later took credit for surging U.S. stock prices that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new record high on Tuesday. But the broader market saw a bigger rally under former President Barack Obama. The benchmark S&P 500 Index has gained 9.4 percent since Trump took office on Jan. 20, lagging a 16.2 percent S&P gain during Obamas first months in office. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Congress would take up tax reform after the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Sept. 4, beginning in the House of Representatives. A White House timeline envisions a House vote on tax legislation in October and Senate vote in November.  But there is little consensus on the issue. The White House insists on cutting the corporate rate to 15 percent, while House Republicans favor 20 percent. A top Senate Republican this week said lawmakers would be lucky to get it down to 25 percent.   On Tuesday, Senate Democrats offered to work with Republicans on a bipartisan tax package, but only if it does not cut taxes for the wealthy, add to the federal deficit or allow Republicans to enact legislation on their own. But McConnell rejected the offer from 45 lawmakers led by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Most of the principles that would get the country growing again, theyre not interested in addressing, the Kentucky Republican told reporters.  McConnell said he hoped Republican legislation might win support from three Senate Democrats who face reelection next year in Republican states and did not join the offer from other Democrats.

In a letter to Sessions, Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden said the Justice Department should release recommendations made by the Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, noting that the policy changes could end up hurting Americans. These [Justice Department] decisions could have dramatic and wide-ranging consequences for Americans daily lives, Wyden wrote, noting that the task forces work could impact everything from marijuana and asset forfeiture policies to hate crimes, immigration and human trafficking. Yet Americans remain in the dark about the content of the task forces recommendations. The Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety was established through an executive order by President Donald Trump in February. Names of those serving on the task force have not been published, and the group was supposed to deliver its recommendations by July 27. In a public statement last week, Sessions said he had received recommendations on a rolling basis and he had already been acting on the task forces recommendations to set the policy of the department. A Justice Department spokesman referred to Sessions prior statement when asked for comment, saying the department will make announcements on policy changes as appropriate. The department has already announced a few policy changes that stem from the task forces work. Earlier this month, for instance, the department said it plans to reinstate a controversial civil asset forfeiture program that lets local police departments seize cash from people without first charging them with a crime, even if their states do not condone such a policy.  The policy had been rolled back during the Obama administration amid concerns it was allowing the government to take away peoples property without due process. In May, the department also undid another Obama-era policy to allow for tougher charges and longer prison sentences.  Wyden, whose state voted to legalize the use of recreational marijuana, said he was particularly concerned about the secrecy shrouding recommendations related to the drug. Sessions has previously made critical comments about marijuana use. It is not the role of the Attorney General to unilaterally undermine the will of Oregon voters, he wrote.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a briefing that Trump certainly didnt dictate (the statement), but ... he weighed in, offered a suggestion like any father would do. The statement that was issued was true and there were no inaccuracies in the statement, Sanders said, even though emails later released by Donald Trump Jr. showed that the subject of the meeting was to be possible damaging information about Republican Trumps rival for the presidency, Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Washington Post reported on Monday that Trumps advisers discussed the statement about the meeting and agreed that Trump Jr. should issue a truthful account of the episode so that it couldnt be repudiated later if the full details emerged. But the president, who was flying home from Germany on July 8, changed the plan and personally dictated a statement in which Trump Jr. said he and the Russian lawyer had primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children, the Post said, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the deliberations. Trump Jr. released emails in July that showed he eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Clinton as part of Moscows official support for his father.

We are looking for a way forward to pass a debt limit increase sometime in the next month or so, McConnell said after meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. He also told reporters that comprehensive tax legislation will move forward in September, but that he does not expect many Senate Democrats to support the Republican legislation. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, whose panel oversees government borrowing, said in a brief hallway interview that he does not expect bipartisan cooperation on the debt legislation. Were not going to get any Democrat help, Ill tell you that, Hatch said. The government bumped up against its statutory limit on borrowing at just under $20 trillion in March. Since then, Mnuchin has had to take extraordinary measures to stave off a default until Congress agrees to raise the Treasurys borrowing capability. To ensure that we have robust economic growth and promote fiscal discipline, the Trump administration believes its important to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible, said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. While the Trump administration had been hoping Congress would pass a debt limit bill before embarking on a long summer recess, the House of Representatives already has begun its break and McConnell did not explicitly include the debt limit in a list of legislation to get done before the Senates recess begins in coming days. House conservative Republicans have been pushing for a variety of add-ons to a debt limit bill, such as deep spending cuts or the sale of government assets. That approach could draw opposition from Democrats and some Republicans as the government gets closer to a possible default. We dont know where the White House is because they have different factions saying different things, Schumer told reporters when asked if the White House had articulated clear goals. Conservative Republicans in the past have balked at debt limit increases as a wedge for advancing deficit-reduction legislation. When Congress returns from its summer break in early September, it also will have to pass bills to fund day-to-day government activities in the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 and there are some fears that the debt limit could get caught up in those negotiations.

The Republican governor said he used his amendatory veto on the bill, which creates a new model for education funding, to remove an unfair diversion of money to help fund CPS teacher pensions. Senate Bill 1, in its current form, took a significant increase in school funding I advocated for and diverted hundreds of millions of dollars from classrooms around the state to Chicago, unfairly hurting children across the state and unfairly advantaging one school district, a school district that has mismanaged its pension systems for decades, Rauner told reporters in the state capitol. His action marks a return to the political gridlock that left Illinois without a complete budget for an unprecedented two-straight fiscal years. The Democratic-controlled legislature gave CPS, which is struggling with escalating pension contributions, a funding boost for pensions and state aid in the bill passed in late May. The governors office was not immediately able to say exactly how much money for CPS was cut by the veto action. The $36 billion fiscal 2018 state budget the legislature enacted in July over Rauners veto prohibits the flow of $6.7 billion in state money to schools in the absence of a funding overhaul like lawmakers approved.  Rauner called for quick action by the General Assembly to accept his changes to the bill or to pass separate legislation reflecting what he wants so school operations will not be threatened. A failure by the House and Senate to muster a required three-fifths majority vote to override or accept the nine changes to the bill Rauner made would kill the measure. The governor has accused Democrats of jeopardizing the ability of schools to open later this month by not sending him the bill until Monday, two months after it was passed. The Illinois State Board of Education said it had not received any requests as of Tuesday from districts, which expect to receive their initial fiscal 2018 state funding by Aug. 10, to delay the start of their school year.  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who controls the nations third-largest public school system, said Rauner was ignoring the needs of Illinois school children and school superintendents who supported the bill.

Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Pat Foye, whom Cuomo appointed to the authority in 2011, and Chairman John Degnan, whom Christie appointed in 2014, are leaving. The shakeup comes amid a struggle to find a chief executive officer. This is a new position created under reforms intended to clean up the agency after the Bridgegate scandal raised questions of political meddling. Resuming the CEO search will be one of the first priorities for the incoming officers, Cuomo and Christie said in a joint statement. Replacing Foye is Rick Cotton, Cuomos special counsel since January 2015 who has overseen some of the governors highest profile infrastructure projects. Those projects include a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge, a $4 billion public-private partnership to renovate LaGuardia Airports central terminal and the transformation of an historic post office into a grand waiting hall for Pennsylvania Station, the busiest transport hub in the nation. Tapped to lead the board is Kevin OToole, a lawyer, Christie ally and former long-time state senator who joined the board in March. OToole and Cotton are expected to be sworn in at a special meeting of the Port Authority board on Thursday. The authority has been slow to fully adopt governance changes after the Bridgegate controversy. In 2013, a former Port Authority executive, David Wildstein, shut down lanes at the George Washington Bridge to cause massive traffic jams as punishment for a local mayor who declined to support Christies gubernatorial re-election bid. In his resignation letter to Christie on Tuesday, Chairman Degnan said he was disappointed that the CEO position has not yet been implemented. He highlighted changes including posting board meeting agendas and materials online well in advance, allowing the public to comment before board votes, and new guidelines on recusals and oversight. Degnan had championed a replacement for the authoritys crumbling 42nd Street bus terminal in Manhattan, helping to secure about $3.5 billion for the project in the authoritys latest capital plan.

The economy ministry document, circulating in the Mexican senate and dated July, will serve as the basis for Mexicos position at the upcoming talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement. The talks between Canada, Mexico and the United States are due to start in Washington on Aug. 16. Our objective is to have an expedited negotiation that maintains the benefits that we have achieved during the lifespan of NAFTA, but which at the same time serves as a platform for the modernization of the treaty, the document says. Mexico will seek to retain unimpeded access for goods and services in the NAFTA region, promote greater integration of North American labor markets and establish rules of origin to guarantee NAFTAs regional benefits, the document says. Mexico, which is in the midst of implementing a historic opening of its oil, gas and power sectors, also wants to incorporate measures to reflect the transformation of the regions energy sector and strengthen regional energy security.  Furthermore, the document says, Mexico wants to bolster the dispute resolution mechanisms of NAFTA - a desire that is sure to raise eyebrows in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has sought to ditch the so-called Chapter 19 tool.   Under Chapter 19, binational panels hear complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping, and then issue binding decisions. The United States has frequently lost such cases since NAFTA came into effect in 1994.  The mechanism has hindered the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexican and Canadian firms, and Canada, in particular, has expressed reservations about eliminating it from a new trade agreement. Last week, Mexicos Congress backed a non-binding motion urging the government to reject the Trump administrations proposal to scrap Chapter 19. According to the document, Mexico hopes to unify agricultural, animal and health safety regulations, to protect the intellectual property of domestic content producers and to forge measures for transparency and fighting graft. There will also be a focus on capitalizing and strengthening the North American Development Bank, and efforts to consolidate the digital economy. Mexico also hopes to move ahead with the liberalization for services and investment, and support for small and medium-sized companies. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Acting Director Chuck Rosenberg sent an agency-wide email on Saturday, one day after Trumps speech to officers in Brentwood, New York, on Long Island. The email was seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Trump suggested to officers that, as part of a tougher approach to suspects, they do away with practices like protecting the head of a suspect being put into a patrol car. That suggestion drew criticism from many local law enforcement agencies, as well as Rosenberg. I write because we have an obligation to speak out when something is wrong, the acting DEA chief said in the email. The President, in remarks delivered yesterday in New York, condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement. Rosenberg, who was not nominated by Trump but is a holdover from the Obama administration, was the first head of a federal agency to challenge Trumps remarks in a wide arena.  Incidents of police brutality and law enforcement killings of black suspects have sparked mass protests nationwide and led many departments to purchase body cameras to record interactions between officers and the public.  Trump, a Republican, campaigned on a pro-law enforcement platform, winning the support of several police unions by promising to be tough on crime and more supportive of police than his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama.  Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, the nations largest police union, said Trumps off the cuff comments are taken too literally by news media.  The President knows, just as every cop out there knows, that our society does not, and should not, tolerate the mistreatment or prejudgment of any individual at any point in the criminal justice process, Canterbury said in a statement on Saturday.  The DEA combats drug trafficking into the United States from offices nationwide and several international posts.  Rosenberg said he was not seeking to advance a political agenda, but to remind his agents of their core values, including accountability, diversity and integrity.  This is how we conduct ourselves.

In a letter to Trump, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer urged him to use his authority through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, to pressure Beijing by suspending approval of all mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. by Chinese entities. Schumers request comes amid concern about North Korea, which fired a missile Friday that experts said was capable of hitting Los Angeles. Trump has repeatedly urged China to rein in its ally North Korea, and Schumer agreed. It is my assessment that China will not deter North Korea unless the United States exacts greater economic pressure on China, Schumer wrote to Trump, a Republican. The U.S. must send a clear message to Chinas government. Senator John Cornyn, a Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was unconvinced that CFIUS was the right tool. Thats not specifically the purpose of CFIUS. CFIUS is a national security vehicle to try to make sure that high-tech investments by foreign countries dont steal our cutting-edge technology, Cornyn said outside his Senate office.  Im happy to work with Senator Schumer to figure out what his concerns are, added Cornyn, who has urged changes at CFIUS because of China. His worry, however, was not North Korea but that China would close the technology gap between the U.S. and Chinese militaries. Led by the U.S. Department of Treasury, CFIUS reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds and can take action on its own or refer cases to the president. In an interview with Reuters Friday, the top U.S. counter-intelligence official suggested the Trump administration was already working on a plan to toughen CFIUS. Were making significant progress on that, working with both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue, said William Evanina, National Counterintelligence Executive, referring to the White House and Congress. I think its going to look a lot different than it does now. Evanina, whose office oversees U.S. government efforts to counter spying and industrial espionage, declined to be more specific but noted that Chinas direct investment in the United States quadrupled from 2015 to 2016, to $48 billion annually. Chinas UN ambassador, on the other hand, has said that it was up to Washington and Pyongyang to work toward talks on North Koreas weapons programs. (The United States and North Korea) hold the primary responsibility to keep things moving, to start moving in the right direction, not China, Chinas U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told reporters on Monday. No matter how capable China is, Chinas efforts will not yield practical results. While China worries about North Koreas nuclear and missile programs, and the U.S. reaction to them, its overriding concern, U.S. officials say, is to avoid a North Korean collapse, which could send millions of refugees fleeing toward China and lead to a reunified Korea allied with Washington. Schumers plan to prohibit CFIUS from approving Chinese deals would be technically legal but would stretch CFIUS  mandate, CFIUS experts said. What sounds like effectively a bar on Chinese investment that is being suggested is probably legal but quite different than the case-by-case process that CFIUS has used in the past, said Stephen Heifetz of the law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP who represents clients before CFIUS. The U.S. government should consider the potential for a Chinese response. The task force this year faces what could well be a record number of deals, many of them controversial as Chinese firms scout U.S. targets as varied as hotels and film studios to hedge against a weaker yuan CNY=.

The move by the Republican came a week after the states top court ruled that law enforcement does not have the legal authority to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. The ICE requests ask that people facing civil deportation orders be held in custody for up to 48 hours after the cases that brought them into the court system are determined. Baker said the courts decision overturned longstanding policy in the state. For years, many local police departments and the trial court have cooperated with ICE to ensure that they can detain violent and dangerous criminals, convicted of crimes like murder and rape, to keep our communities safe, Baker said in a statement. This bill allows the state police to honor specific detainers. Bakers proposal would limit compliance to cases where the person ICE officials want detained is suspected of violent crimes such as terrorism, street-gang activity or human trafficking, or has been convicted of a felony not directly related to his or her immigration status. ICE detainer requests apply to immigrants in the country illegally who are arrested or otherwise enter the criminal justice system. Bakers proposal would require a judges approval to hold people facing a detainer request for longer than 12 hours after their cases are resolved. President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a top priority of his administration. The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union criticized the move.

Moscow, whose annexation of Crimea in 2014 prompted U.S. and EU sanctions, still has troops stationed in Georgia after a 2008 war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia, backing Georgias Abkhazia, a region also controlled by pro-Russian separatists.

Asked about Pences visit, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said nations had the right to choose their partners. The only problem for us, is when this involves the expanding of various alliances and their infrastructure toward our borders. This is a cause of concern for us, Peskov told reporters on a conference call. During his visit, Pence attended Georgian-American military exercises, which began in Georgia on Sunday. About 2,800 soldiers from the United States, Britain, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Slovenia, Armenia and Georgia are taking part in the maneuvers, which will last for two weeks. On Wednesday, Pence visits Montenegro, which joined NATO in June. The tiny Balkan nation won praise from Washington for joining despite pressure against the move from Russia.

Trump Jr. released emails earlier in July that showed he eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as part of Moscows official support for his father. The New York Times was first to report the meeting. The Washington Post said Trump advisers discussed the new disclosure and agreed that Trump Jr. should issue a truthful account of the episode so that it couldnt be repudiated later if the full details emerged. The president, who was flying home from Germany on July 8, changed the plan and personally dictated a statement in which Trump Jr. said he and the Russian lawyer had primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children, the Post said, citing unnamed people with knowledge of the deliberations. It said the statement, issued to the New York Times as it prepared to publish the story, emphasized that the subject of the meeting was not a campaign issue at the time. An attorney for Trump, Jay Sekulow, issued a statement in response to the Post report: Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent.  The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Post story, nor did Trump Jr.s attorney, Alan Futerfas. U.S. investigators are probing whether there was collusion between the Kremlin and Trumps Republican presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to hurt Clinton and help Trump in the 2016 election. Russia denies any interference, and Trump has denied collusion with Russia.The president applauded his sons transparency after he released the email exchanges on July 11. It remains unclear exactly how much the president knew at the time of the flight about Trump Jr.s meeting, the Washington Post said. David Sklansky, a professor of criminal law at Stanford Law School, said that if Trump, as reported by the Post, helped craft a misleading public statement about the meeting, he may have bolstered a potential obstruction of justice case against himself.  To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with corrupt intent. A misleading public statement could be used as evidence of corrupt intent, Sklansky said. Lying usually isnt a crime, he said. But it could be relevant in determining whether something else the president did, like firing (former FBI Director James) Comey, was done corruptly.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Tuesday plans to introduce legislation seeking to address vulnerabilities in computing devices embedded in everyday objects - known in the tech industry as the internet of things - which experts have long warned poses a threat to global cyber security.     The new bill would require vendors that provide internet-connected equipment to the U.S. government to ensure their products are patchable and conform to industry security standards. It would also prohibit vendors from supplying devices that have unchangeable passwords or possess known security vulnerabilities.  Republicans Cory Gardner and Steve Daines and Democrats Mark Warner and Ron Wyden are sponsoring the legislation, which was drafted with input from technology experts at the Atlantic Council and Harvard University. A Senate aide who helped write the bill said that companion legislation in the House was expected soon. Were trying to take the lightest touch possible, Warner told Reuters in an interview. He added that the legislation was intended to remedy an obvious market failure that has left device manufacturers with little incentive to build with security in mind. The legislation would allow federal agencies to ask the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for permission to buy some non-compliant devices if other controls, such as network segmentation, are in place. It would also expand legal protections for cyber researchers working in good faith to hack equipment to find vulnerabilities so manufacturers can patch previously unknown flaws.     Security researchers have long said that the ballooning array of online devices including cars, household appliances, speakers and medical equipment are not adequately protected from hackers who might attempt to steal personal information or launch sophisticated cyber attacks. Between 20 billion and 30 billion devices are expected to be connected to the internet by 2020, researchers estimate, with a large percentage of them insecure. Though security for the internet of things has been a known  problem for years, some manufacturers say they are not well equipped to produce cyber secure devices. Hundreds of thousands of insecure webcams, digital records and other everyday devices were hijacked last October to support a major attack on internet infrastructure that temporarily knocked some web services offline, including Twitter, PayPal and Spotify.  The new legislation includes reasonable security recommendations that would be important to improve protection of federal government networks, said Ray OFarrell, chief technology officer at cloud computing firm VMware.

This election cycle, the lifelong Democrat who lives on a farm in Powhatan County, Virginia, upped the ante, donating $6,500 so far to Herrings re-election bid. These are desperate times, she said.  Like many Democratic state attorneys general, Herring has made legal challenges to the agenda of President Donald Trump a priority. He joined with attorneys general in other states to challenge Trumps executive order banning travel to the United States from six predominately Muslim countries and to defend former President Barack Obamas Clean Power Plan, which aims to slash carbon emissions.  Those fights, and the prospect of others, are drawing record amounts of campaign contributions into attorney general races in a number of states, according to campaign finance records and more than a dozen interviews with attorneys general, challengers, political operatives and donors.  Attorneys general, who as the top elected legal officers in each state are charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own, have always helped shape national politics.  But their influence grew during the Obama administration, when Republican attorneys general regularly sued the administration over immigration and the environment. Now, with Republicans controlling the White House and Congress, Democrats are using the same playbook to challenge some of Trumps initiatives in the courts.  Donors from both parties have taken notice and are pouring money into upcoming attorneys general campaigns. In his most recent campaign filings, Herring reported raising about $2.8 million through the end of June - over three times more than he had at this point during his campaign four years ago.  What I am seeing is a lot of energy, Herring said.  Herrings Republican challenger this November, John Adams, has also done well. A corporate defense lawyer who worked in George W. Bushs White House, Adams has raised about $1.5 million, roughly 26 percent more at this point than the Republican candidate in Virginia had in 2013.  When I first ran in 2012 I would tell people this is one of the most consequential offices, and people would give me a funny look, said Bob Ferguson, Washington states attorney general who successfully sued to block Trumps first travel ban. I dont get that look anymore.  The national fundraising arm for Republican attorneys general, RAGA, announced raising a record $7.4 million in the first six months of 2017, 45 percent more than at this point during the last election cycle in 2015. Republican AGs have filed legal briefs defending Trumps travel ban and other policies.  The substantive work we are doing helping the Trump administration, but also weighing in on a lot of regulatory issues, is motivating people, said West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, RAGAs chairman.  Meanwhile, the Democratic AGs counterpart, DAGA, raised about $3.1 million between January and June, DAGA executive director Sean Rankin said, 73 percent more than in the first half of 2015.  DAGA hired full time finance staff for the first time this year, Rankin said, and launched its first candidate recruiting program. Four years ago people werent moving at this pace, he said.  To be sure, some donors are motivated by more than simply whether a candidate supports or opposes Trump. C. Boyden Gray, who served as a White House counsel and then Ambassador to the European Union under two Republican presidents, doubled his donation in the Virginia AGs race this year, largely because he thinks Adams has the talent to aspire to even higher office.  But Gray also said he recognizes the growing stature of attorneys general.  Theyve upped their game over the last decade, Gray said.  RAGA decided this year to end a longstanding custom to avoid spending money against Democratic incumbents, and DAGA followed suit. Neither committee has yet filed individual donor lists for the first half of 2017; the deadline is Monday.  Republicans currently hold 29 state AG seats across the country. Next year, 32 AG elections are scheduled including the District of Columbia.  In Wisconsin, Republican attorney general Brad Schimel has raised about $454,000 through the end of June, even though he is not up for reelection until November 2018. In his 2014 campaign Schimel had not raised that much until about three months before his election.  A representative for Schimel did not return requests for comment.  Schimel faces Josh Kaul, an attorney who has raised about $175,000 since he launched his run in April. Kauls law firm, Perkins Coie, served as top election law adviser to Hillary Clintons campaign last year.  Kauls campaign has already drawn RAGAs attention, which funded a web site targeting him. RAGA has also funded online ads against Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is expected to run for reelection next year, and set up a website attacking Aaron Ford, a Democratic state senator in Nevada eyeing an AG run in 2018.  In Colorado, four Democrats are currently vying for the AG nomination. The fundraising leader, Phil Weiser, served as a technology advisor in the Obama White House and has raised about $355,000 through the end of June, almost four times more than the Democratic candidate had raised at this point in 2013.  The incumbent, Republican Cynthia Coffman, has disclosed about $40,000 in contributions to her AG committee. However, Coffman is also mulling a run for governor, and it is unclear whether donors are awaiting her decision before they write checks.  Coffman did not respond to a request for comment.  Weiser, who has made fighting Trump the centerpiece of his messaging, says Democratic donors are making a sophisticated investment to confront the administration.

The total savings are combined over five years, from fiscal 2017 through 2021, according to a report from the legislatures office of fiscal analysis on Monday. The house approved the deal last week. On Monday evening Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman, a Democrat who acts as president of the Connecticut Senate, broke a tie so the measure could pass 19 to 18. The state missed its July 1 deadline to pass a biennial budget for the current and next fiscal year, leading Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, to take over state spending and slash costs.  The labor pact is a key piece toward adopting a budget for our state, Malloy said in a statement after the vote. I am urging legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle to work with our administration on finding a solution on this as possible so that the most vulnerable populations do not suffer long-term consequences. Pension and healthcare provisions were also extended until 2027 in the deal, which Malloy said would ultimately save $24 billion over 20 years. Labor costs have been one sticking point in budget talks as lawmakers differed with each other and Malloy over how to close a $5.1 billion shortfall over two years. Through the State Employee Bargaining Agent Coalition (SEBAC), which covers about 42,000 members in 15 different unions, public employees ratified the deal on July 17. They negotiated with Malloy, who said the agreement would shave $1.6 billion off of the current deficit. This fiscal year alone contains the biggest savings of any other year at $371.8 million, the legislative analysis said. The largest concessions come from changes to public pensions and retiree healthcare. Employees will contribute more towards their pensions, and annual cost of living adjustments will be tied to the consumer price index. Wages will also be frozen for the three years ending fiscal 2019 but will be raised 3.5 percent in each of the following two years.  Republican critics said that concessions did not go far enough, that taxes would have to rise to pay for it and that the deal squandered an opportunity for a broader restructuring of public pensions and benefits.

If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldnt it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays? Trump, a Republican, wrote on Twitter. Trump, frustrated that he and Republicans have not been able to keep campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare, has threatened to let it implode. So far, the administration has continued to make the monthly subsidy payments, but withholding them would be one way to make good on Trumps threat. Republican Senator Rand Paul told reporters on Monday he spoke to Trump by phone and the president was considering taking executive action to address problems with the healthcare system. Paul said he told Trump he thought he had the authority to create associations that would allow organizations - such as the AARP that represents retirees, or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - to offer group health insurance plans. The White House declined to comment on matter. On Capitol Hill, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said senators were too divided to keep working on healthcare overhaul legislation, and that he and other senior Republicans would take that message to the White House. Theres just too much animosity and were too divided on healthcare, Hatch said in an interview. He said lawmakers could return to a healthcare overhaul later but for now should pivot to tax reform. Some senators were not ready to drop healthcare, however. Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, met with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and several Republican state governors at the White House on Monday to discuss a proposal Cassidy and others have made to send federal healthcare funds to the states in grants, Cassidy told reporters. But Cassidy said he had not discussed bringing his proposal to the Senate floor with Senate leaders. And the third-ranking Republican senator, John Thune, told reporters Monday evening that until there is a proposal that can win a majority of senators support, I think weve had our vote and were moving onto tax reform. Hatch, in the interview with Reuters, also said he thought Congress would have to approve new funds for the governments cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurers that Trump had been threatening to end. These subsidies lower the price of health coverage for the poor under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.  Insurers have asked the government to commit to making the $8 billion in payments for 2018, saying they may raise rates or leave the individual insurance marketplace if there is too much uncertainty.

HNA, along with holding company Ron Transatlantic EG, in January announced an agreement to purchase a majority stake in SkyBridge, the New York-based hedge fund investment firm.

The deal signed at a sheriffs meeting in suburban Dallas comes as both the administration of U.S. Republican President Donald Trump, and Texas, the most populous Republican-controlled state, seek to crack down on sanctuary cities, places that shield immigrants who are in the country illegally. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reached what is known as a 287(g) agreement with the counties. The deal trains local agents in the sheriffs offices to check if the people they have in custody may be in violation of U.S. immigration law. The program has been on the books since 1996 and allows the Department of Homeland Security to enter into formal written agreements with state and local police departments for officers to perform some of the functions of federal immigration enforcement officials.  Theres no doubt that arresting removable aliens in a jail  is safer for the officers, safer for the community and even safer for the alien himself, Acting ICE Director Tom Homan told a news conference. A.J. Louderback, sheriff of Jackson County, told the news conference that his county southwest of Houston joined the program to control criminality. The sheriff of Harris County, the most populous county in the state and home to Houston, dropped out of the program earlier this year, saying it cost his office too much in terms of manpower and money. Many of the 18 counties, which have a total population of about 1.5 million, are near Harris County. Texas has a population of about 28 million. The new agreement in Texas is for jails, but a task force model of the program has been used to allow police on patrol to check on peoples immigration status. Civil rights groups contend the method promotes illegal racial profiling. Former President Barack Obamas administration wound down the task force model and only six new agreements were added between 2012 and 2016, according ICE, part of Homeland Security.  With the addition of the 18 programs in Texas, ICE now has 60 active 287(g) agreements, nearly double the number of programs that were active in 2016. The mandate to expand the program was outlined in an executive order on immigration enforcement signed just days after Trump took office in January.

The nations third-largest city projects it will end fiscal 2017 on Dec. 31 with a $137.6 million gap in its $3.73 billion operating budget, down from $232.6 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2018, the deficit is expected to fall by 17 percent to $114.2 million. The citys budget gaps have been declining since hitting a high of $654.7 million in fiscal 2011. This decrease is a direct result of sustainable and balanced revenue growth coupled with lasting savings and reforms made in the past six budgets, the citys analysis said. Chicago has taken big steps in recent years to shore up its four employee retirement systems by hiking property taxes for its police and fire fighter funds, levying a new tax on water and sewer usage for its municipal workers fund, and increasing a telephone surcharge for its laborers fund. The city is gradually increasing contributions to the systems until it meets requirements for actuarially funding public safety worker pensions in 2020 and for the other two systems in 2022. As a result, Chicagos pension payments will jump from $1.18 billion in fiscal 2018 to a projected $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020, topping $2 billion in fiscal 2022 when all four systems will be on an actuarially funded path, according to the analysis. At the same time, the city is weaning itself off of one-time revenue fixes, such as so-called scoop and toss restructurings of outstanding bonds to push off debt payments.  Chicagos base budget forecast indicates gaps of $212.7  million in fiscal 2019 and $330.3 million in 2020, although the projections do not completely account for escalating pension payments. The city previously secured ongoing and sustainable funding sources to match these growing contributions, and the funding sources for these increased contributions will be determined through our annual budget process, the analysis said.  The citys total unfunded pension liability, which climbed to $35.76 billion in fiscal 2016 from $33.8 billion in fiscal 2015, has been a concern of credit rating agencies that currently rate Chicago at the low investment grade to junk levels.

Last week, the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committees chairman asked the chief executives of those three companies, as well as AT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) to testify at a Sept. 7 hearing on the future of net neutrality rules.

Representative Greg Walden, the Republican who chairs the committee, said last week that the time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out. Walden, Colwell added continues to be interested in moving forward on a bipartisan legislative solution to the longstanding issue of net neutrality. Since we all basically agree on the fundamental principles and the need to provide certainty for all participants in the internet economy, he believes we are close to reaching an agreement. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering tossing out 2015 Obama administration net neutrality rules that reclassified internet service as a public utility. The rules bar providers from blocking, slowing or offering paid prioritization of websites. Many internet providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules. A group representing major technology companies earlier this month urged the FCC to abandon plans to rescind the rules barring internet service providers from hindering consumer access to Web content or offering paid fast lanes. Major internet services have urged the FCC to reverse the rules, even as they vowed not to hinder internet access. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pais plan to withdraw the Obama administrations order reclassifying internet service providers as utilities. More than 14 million public comments have been filed. The Internet Association, a group representing companies including Facebook, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), said last week it was open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories.

Trump made replacing Obamacare a key part of his presidential campaign and Republicans have promised for years to repeal or replace the law.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, in an interview with Reuters, said that getting the corporate rate to 25 percent from 35 percent would bring a sea change to the U.S. economy. But he added that bipartisan cooperation may be necessary for tax reform to succeed. The Utah Republicans comments mark the first time that a member of the Big Six principals involved in high-level tax reform talks has described a 25 percent corporate tax rate as a challenge. In recent weeks, officials have described a target range of 20 to 25 percent. He described Trumps 15 percent proposal as very unlikely. In fact, it would be kind of miraculous if we could get it down to 25 percent or less. Id like to get it down to around 20 percent. Id love to get it at 15 percent if we could, Hatch said. But I think the odds are, were going to be lucky to get it down at all. Twenty percent is the corporate tax rate proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives.  He said success could hinge on getting Democratic support for tax legislation, saying he has had discussions on a bipartisan path forward with his committees top Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden. He called on Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to open the door to cross-party cooperation. Hatch and other Big Six negotiators from the Senate, White House, Treasury and House issued a joint statement last week, emphasizing their commitment to sweeping tax law changes. On Monday, a White House aide said Trump would travel to promote tax reform in states including Michigan and Wisconsin. The White House hopes the House will vote on tax legislation in October and the Senate in November. If we could get the corporate tax rate down to, lets say, a maximum of 25 percent, it would be a sea change for this country. It would be great, Hatch said. In this current Congress, its almost impossible to change because the Democrats have just about slowed everything down to such a point that we cant hardly move on anything.

Foxconn said last week in a White House ceremony it plans to build a $10 billion LCD flat screen factory in southeast Wisconsin. The company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), hopes to open the 20 million-square-foot plant in 2020 at a 1,000-acre site and will initially employ 3,000 people. Republican Governor Scott Walker and Foxconn said the company ultimately may employ 13,000 people at the site.  The draft bill released Monday discloses new details of the expensive incentive package that Wisconsin offered as it competed with six other states to land the project that it says will also generate 22,000 ancillary jobs and 10,000 construction jobs. The Republican-controlled legislature will take up the measure on Tuesday but it is not clear when they will vote. If the incentives are approved, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation would then negotiate a formal contract with Foxconn on the project, said Mark Maley, a spokesman for WEDC. Tim Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Michigan who studies government tax incentives, said the Foxconn package is at least six times the average U.S. award but similar to some deals for auto plants and planemaker Boeing Co (BA.N). Foxconn is a major supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for its iPhones but the company has not said if the Wisconsin factory would produce any parts for Apple. Under the legislation, Foxconn can receive up to $200 million per year in refundable tax credits, capped at $2.85 billion if meets capital and employment compensation targets. It can also avoid paying $150 million in sales taxes on building materials, equipment and supplies. Although the state measures to attract Foxconn are labeled tax incentives, they largely would be paid in cash since the effective Wisconsin state tax rate is 0.4 percent on manufacturers. In addition to incentives, President Donald Trump suggested the investment decision was due to his election and promised changes in corporate regulatory and tax policy. The incentives include up to $1.5 billion in state income tax credits for job creation and up to $1.35 billion in state income tax credits for capital investment. Foxconn is eligible for additional local incentives. The company is eligible for refundable tax credits equal to 17 percent of wages paid instead of the typical 7 percent and 15 percent of capital costs instead of 10 percent. Wisconsin also agreed in the draft legislation to issue up to $252.4 million in state debt to reconstruct parts of Interstate 94 near the sites that the company is considering sites in Kenosha and Racine counties near the border with Illinois.  The draft legislation released by Walker waives a required state environmental impact statement and allows the company to discharge dredged or fill material into some wetlands without state permits. The legislation also would allow Foxconn to connect artificial bodies of water with natural waterways without state permits. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that one reason Wisconsin was appealing is because of its proximity to abundant fresh water from Lake Michigan needed to build panels. The legislation also waives requiring approval for the project by the Public Service Commission, which oversees power and water utilities in Wisconsin.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus rule abolishing mandatory arbitration clauses was released on July 10, and was immediately threatened by Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trumps administration. Acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika publicly argued with CFPB Director Richard Cordray, appointed by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, over whether the rule could endanger the banking system.  Many had expected Noreika to ask colleagues on the Financial Stability Oversight Council consisting of the countrys chief financial regulators to stay the rule. But in Mondays statement he said he was unable to complete a thorough review of the rule in time to make a petition. Nothing so far diminishes my concerns that the rule may adversely affect the institutions within the federal banking system and their customers, Noreika said, adding it may have unintended consequences such as increased costs. The CFPB declined to comment. Still, Noreika backing down was a victory for the independent agency, which spent years researching and writing the rule.  The rule bans companies from requiring customers to sign an agreement when opening new accounts that they will not join a group lawsuit, or class action, in the event of a dispute. Instead they must take disputes to secret arbitration. Critics of the rule say class actions mostly benefit lawyers, while arbitration is quick, cost-effective, and renders large awards for complainants.  Supporters, though, say citizens are entitled to a day in court and companies often hire the arbitrators, rigging the process against the customers. They also say public proceedings are effective at ending bad corporate behavior. The rule is a well thought-out response to the serious consumer harm of forced arbitration, said Brian Marshall, policy counsel for advocacy group Americans for Financial Reform.  Noreikas threat is not the only one levied against the regulation. But it was the first time a stay from the oversight council was seriously considered to dismantle a rule. Noreika added he hopes congressional efforts to kill the  rule succeed. Even though the House of Representatives passed a resolution repealing it earlier this month, Republicans hold a slimmer majority in the Senate and will struggle to gather enough votes for a similar resolution, analysts said.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In terms of travel, I think you will see him out there more ... in the states where we need votes, said Marc Short, the White Houses legislative liaison.

In his first six months in office, Trump has upended White House convention with a loose decision-making style and an open-door policy to his Oval Office for advisers, both internal and external. Infighting among his senior staff has become bitter and public. Hes going to have to reduce the drama, reduce both the sniping within and reduce the leaks, and bring some discipline to the relationships, Karl Rove, a Republican strategist and former White House adviser to George W. Bush, said on Fox News Sunday. Trump announced Kelly would replace his embattled chief of staff Reince Priebus at the end of a particularly chaotic week that saw his first legislative effort - healthcare reform - fail in Congress. He (Trump) is in a lot of trouble. This week was the most tumultuous week weve seen in a tumultuous presidency, Rove said. On top of the healthcare debacle, Trump came under fire for banning transgender people from the military, and was pilloried for politicizing a speech he made to the Boy Scouts. Adding fuel to the fire, his new communications director Anthony Scaramucci unleashed a string of profane criticism about Priebus and Trump strategist Steven Bannon to a New Yorker magazine reporter. Republicans welcomed Trumps decision to bring in Kelly, who starts on Monday. I think he will bring some order and discipline to the West Wing, said Republican Senator Susan Collins and Trump critic on  NBCs Meet the Press. The last week heightened concerns in Trumps party that the distractions and West Wing dysfunction would derail other legislative priorities, including tax reform and debt ceiling negotiations. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said he thought Priebus had been effective but was probably a little bit more laid back in the way he ran the office. I think the president wants to go in a different direction, wants a little bit more discipline, a little more structure in there, said Mulvaney, who reports to the chief of staff. It is not yet clear whether all of Trumps senior staff will answer to Kelly. Some members, including Scaramucci and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, report directly to Trump, a structure which gives them more power. I will do whatever the president and our new chief of staff General Kelly ask me to do, Conway told Fox News Fox News Sunday.

During a visit to NATOs Brussels headquarters in May, Trump jarred allies by not restating U.S. support for a critical portion of the alliances charter and instead berated some members for not spending enough on defense. Trump has since said he supports the NATO charters Article 5, the requirement that each member of the alliance defend each other if they come under attack.

Nearly two-thirdsof the country wants to either keep or modify the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and a majority of Americans want Congress to turn its attention to other priorities, the survey found. Republicans have vowed to dismantle the Affordable Care Act since Democratic President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010, and it appeared they finally had their chance when Republican President Donald Trump took office in January. But the law, which helped 20 million people obtain health insurance, has steadily grown more popular. The July 28-29 poll of more than 1,130 Americans, conducted after the Republican-led effort collapsed in the Senate, found that 64 percent said they wanted to keep Obamacare, either entirely as is or after fixing problem areas. That is up from 54 percent in January.  The survey found that support for the law still runs along party lines, with nine out of 10 Democrats and just three out of 10 Republicans saying they wanted to keep or modify Obamacare. Among Republicans, three-fourths said they would like their partys leaders to try to repeal and replace Obamacare at some point, though most listed other issues that they would give a higher priority right now.  Disappointment among Republicans and happiness among Democrats about the repeals failure were palpable. Two-thirds of Republicans felt bad that the Senate failed to pass a healthcare bill, while three-fourths of Democrats felt good, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. When asked what they think Congress should do next, most Americans picked other priorities such as tax reform, foreign relations and infrastructure. Only 29 percent said they wanted Republicans in Congress to continue working on a new healthcare bill. Gene Anderson, 81, a Trump voter living in a retirement community in Zionsville, Indiana, said the president should refocus on some stability in his administration and some demonstration of being able to work together with Democrats in Congress. I dont understand why they had to push for healthcare reform before tax reform, he said. They ought to sit down and come up with a viable legislative, doable tax reform. Americans appear to be more supportive of some of the main features of Obamacare. For example, 77 percent said they were in favor of expanding Medicaid to low-income families, and 43 percent said they favored requiring U.S. residents to own health insurance. That was up from 66 percent and 36 percent, respectively, when Reuters/Ipsos first asked those questions in April 2012. The latest Republican effort failed when Senator John McCain split from his partys leadership and joined Republican colleagues Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowksi and Senate Democrats to vote against a so-called skinny repeal eliminating certain aspects of Obamacare. McCain later said the measure offered no replacement to actually reform our healthcare system. Respondents said they thought a lot of people shared responsibility for the failure on healthcare. When asked who is most responsible, 20 percent picked Senate Republicans, 13 percent said Trump, and 11 percent said McCain. The rest picked Senate Democrats and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Senators Collins and Murkowski. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,136 people, including 381 Republicans and 475 Democrats. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

For the second day running, the Republican president tweeted his impatience with Congress inability to deliver on his partys seven-year promise to replace the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamas signature healthcare bill commonly known as Obamacare. Members of his administration took to the airwaves to try to compel lawmakers to take action. But it was unclear whether the White House admonishments would have any impact on Capitol Hill, where Republicans who control both houses signaled last week that it was time to move on to other issues. Republicans zeal to repeal and replace Obamacare was met with both intra-party divisions between moderates and conservatives and also the increasing approval of a law that raised the number of insured Americans by 20 million.   Polling indicates a majority of Americans are ready to move on from healthcare at this point. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Saturday, 64 percent of 1,136 people surveyed on Friday and Saturday said they wanted to keep Obamacare, either entirely as is or after fixing problem areas. That is up from 54 percent in January.   With the U.S. legislative branch spinning its wheels, the executive branch pledged to look at rewriting Obamacare regulations. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told ABCs This Week that he would change those regulations that drive up costs or hurt patients. Price sidestepped questions about whether there were administration plans to waive Obamacares mandate that individuals have health insurance, saying all things are on the table to try to help patients. But Price also told NBC he would implement Obamacare because it is the law of the land. That Obamacare was still law clearly angered Trump, who has no major legislative accomplishments to show for his first half-year in office. Dont give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace ... the president said in a tweet on Sunday morning. On Friday, Senate Republicans failed to collect enough votes to repeal even a few parts of Obamacare. That capped a week of failed Senate votes on whether to simply repeal, or repeal and replace, the 2010 law, while Trump repeatedly berated lawmakers in a late attempt to influence the legislation.  The president will not accept those who said, quote, its time to move on, Kellyanne Conway, a senior counselor to Trump, said on Fox News Sunday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, had made exactly that comment before dawn on Friday morning after the failed healthcare vote.      The White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said on Sunday lawmakers should stay in session to get something done on healthcare - even if this means postponing votes on other issues such as raising the debt ceiling. So yes. They need to stay. They need to work. They need to pass something, Mulvaney said on CNN. The House of Representatives has already gone home for its August break and the Senate is expected to do the same by mid-August. Mulvaney also said Trump was seriously considering carrying out threats he tweeted about on Saturday, when the president said that if a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!  That tweet appeared to be referring to the approximately $8 billion in cost-sharing reduction subsidies the federal government pays to insurers to lower the price of health coverage for low-income Americans.  The Saturday tweet also appeared to be a threat to end the  employer contribution for members of Congress and their staffs, who were moved from the normal federal employee healthcare benefits program onto the Obamacare insurance exchanges as part of the 2010 healthcare law. What hes saying is, look, if Obamacare is hurting the American people  and it is  then why shouldnt it hurt insurance companies and more importantly, perhaps for this discussion, members of Congress? Mulvaney said on Sunday on CNN. Some Republicans have said they are trying to find a way forward on healthcare. Senate Republican Susan Collins, one of three Republicans who voted against repealing parts of Obamacare on Friday, told NBC that Congress should produce a series of bills with bipartisan input on healthcare, including appropriating the cost-sharing subsidies.

Corey Lewandowski, Trumps former campaign manager who still speaks regularly to the president, criticized a CFPB rule that would make it easier for consumers to sue financial companies. Currently, many consumers are required to settle disputes related to credit cards and other banking products through mandatory arbitration. Its my recommendation to the president of the United States to fire Richard Cordray, Lewandowski told NBCs Meet the Press. The CFPB is the brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. Created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the bureau is charged with protecting consumers from predatory lending practices that were commonplace during the financial crisis. Under current law, the president can only fire Cordray for cause. The legal burden to show cause is high, and Cordrays term does not expire until July 2018. Cordray is widely expected to run for governor in Ohio, though he has not announced any plans to do so. Lewandowski said Cordrays potential political aspirations were part of the reason he should be ousted, saying if he wants to run for governor of Ohio, go run for governor of Ohio, but dont do so while youre sitting in a federal office right now. A CFPB spokesman did not have any immediate comment in response. Republicans fought the creation of the CFPB and have long complained the agency wields too much power without enough accountability to the president or Congress. They have accused it over imposing overly burdensome regulations that they say may unduly harm consumers. A U.S. appeals court is weighing a case involving whether the president should be allowed to fire Cordray at will, and not just for cause. If Trump were to remove Cordray prior to the courts ruling, it would likely escalate the ongoing legal battle. When asked if his comments about the CFPB were driven by business interests he represents, Lewandowski said he had no clients with such interests before the agency. However, Lewandowski previously worked for Avenue Strategies, which is registered to lobby for Ohio-based payday lender Community Choice Financial.

Many insurers have been waiting for an answer from Trump or lawmakers on whether they will continue to fund the annual government subsidies. Without assurances, many plan to raise rates an additional 20 percent by an Aug. 16 deadline for premium prices. With Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare in disarray, hundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets.   In response, Trump on Friday again suggested his administration would let the Obamacare program implode. He has weakened enforcement of the laws requirement for individuals to buy insurance, threatened to cut off funding and sought to change plan benefits through regulations. Meanwhile, some congressional Republicans were still trying to find a way forward on healthcare.  Senator Lindsey Graham said in a statement issued late on Friday that he and two other Republican senators, Dean Heller and Bill Cassidy, had met with Trump after the defeat to discuss Grahams proposal to take tax money raised by Obamacare and send it back to the states in the form of healthcare block grants. Graham said the move would end Democrats drive for a national single-payer healthcare system by putting states in charge. President Trump was optimistic about the Graham-Cassidy-Heller proposal, Graham added. I will continue to work with President Trump and his team to move the idea forward. However, a majority of Americans are ready to move on from healthcare at this point. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Saturday, 64 percent of 1,136 people surveyed on Friday and Saturday said they wanted to keep Obamacare, either entirely as is or after fixing problem areas. When asked what they think Congress should do next, most picked other priorities such as tax reform, foreign relations and infrastructure. Only 29 percent said they wanted Republicans in Congress to continue working on a new healthcare bill.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump replaced his beleaguered White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, after only six months on the job on Friday, installing retired General John Kelly in his place in a major shake-up of his top team. Trump announced the move in a tweet a day after his new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, accused Priebus of leaking information to reporters in a profanity-laced tirade.  Kelly, 67, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, is currently secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and will assume the chief of staff post on Monday. He was hired with the goal of bringing more discipline to the White House, a senior White House official said. Trump issued his decision just as he landed aboard Air Force One after a visit to Long Island and hours after Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare failed in the Senate. Priebus was on the plane with the Republican president and made no comment. Reporters had noticed no sign of stress from Priebus during the day.Priebus told CNN he had been talking to Trump for some time about exiting the White House, and is the latest in a long line of officials to leave or not take a job at the White House. The president has a right to hit a reset button. I think its time to hit the reset button, Priebus said in a televised interview from the White House. He intuitively determined that it was time to do something different, and I think hes right. Trump had lost confidence in Priebus, privately questioning his competence after major legislative items failed to pass the U.S. Congress, a Trump confidant said. A source close to Priebus said the former Republican National Committee chairman turned in his resignation on Thursday night, after Scaramuccis rant against him was published by the New Yorker magazine. A senior White House official said Trump had informed Priebus two weeks ago that he would be replacing him and that the move had no connection to Scaramucci, whose hiring a week ago prompted Sean Spicer, a Priebus ally, to abruptly resign as press secretary. After frequent conversations with Kelly, Trump recently warmed up to the idea of naming Kelly chief of staff to more effectively manage personnel and offered it to him earlier this week, a senior White House official said. Carrying an umbrella, Trump approached reporters as he stepped off Air Force One, with rain storming down. Reince is a good man. John Kelly will do a fantastic job. General Kelly has been a star, done an incredible job thus far, respected by everybody. Hes a great, great American. Reince is a good man, Trump said. Priebus 189-day tenure was the shortest in modern history for a White House chief of staff. He had hoped to stay on at least a year but struggled to manage his unpredictable boss and was unable to get a handle on conflicting factions in the White House who have frequently squabbled. In a statement, Priebus said it had been one of the great honors of his life to serve Trump and the country. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the presidents agenda and policies. I cant think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him Gods blessings and great success, he said.    Trump loyalists had chafed at Priebus, feeling he had installed his RNC allies at the White House and overlooked the people close to Trump who helped get him elected president in November. But Priebus allies felt he was an important link to establishment Republicans in Washington as the capital attempted to adjust to the anti-establishment style of the president. He has served the president and the American people capably and passionately, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said of his close friend in a statement. He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she did not think Priebus exit would affect the White Houses relationship with the Republican Party. I think weve still got a good relationship. Were going to continue working with the party and doing what we came here to do, she said. Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke will become the acting chief of the department on Monday, DHS said in a statement. U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, is among those being considered for Homeland Security secretary, a DHS official said.

While senators grappled with healthcare, Trump banned transgender people from the military. He regaled a Boy Scout jamboree with a tale from a New York cocktail party. He indulged an obscene tirade by his flamboyant new communications director. In the end, the Senates efforts collapsed in a predawn vote on Friday, magnifying the ineffectiveness that often goes with the chaos around Trump, the constant storm of tweets, the White House infighting, the self-inflicted wounds. Were seeing clear evidence that all of these distractions are standing in the way of their ability to achieve legislative accomplishments, said Republican strategist Alice Stewart, a top aide to Senator Ted Cruzs presidential campaign last year. In the latest twist, Trump late on Friday named U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly as his new White House chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus, who has been in a feud with Trumps new communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Among some establishment Republicans, there were signs that patience with Trump was wearing thin. His national security team, seen as a bedrock of normality, increasingly is frustrated. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were described by sources as unhappy with their handling by the White House. Defense Secretary James Mattis was coming to grips with Trumps abrupt decision on Wednesday, via a tweet, to ban transgender individuals from military service. The Pentagon  said it would not execute the order without more guidance. Republican strategist Charlie Black said Trump needs to let an investigation of possible ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign run its course and not keep talking about it. Russia denies meddling, and Trump denies any collusion. The Russia probe has fed public spats with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, quarreling among aides and attacks on Robert Mueller, the special counsel running the investigation. He should be talking about policy and sticking to issues for a while, Black said. There are still some good things that could get done in Congress like tax reform. He can help further those things if thats what he talks about. In the Senate healthcare fight, Trump phoned Republican senators and urged them to support repeal of Obamacare, but the effort fizzled, a sign there was little political retribution to fear from a president with a sub-40 percent approval rating. A moderate House Republican said Trump let down the Obamacare rollback effort by not going out and selling a plan. For Trump, a businessman and former reality TV show host, the presidency is his first elected office. This issue was outsourced to Congress. It was never really sold. I think that was part of the reason why it was a failure, said Republican Representative Charlie Dent. As the Senate fight was coming to a head, Washington was suddenly mesmerized by a profanity-laced rant from Scaramucci, who tore into Priebus and Trump strategist Steve Bannon in an interview in The New Yorker magazine. Stunned aides stopped what they were doing to read the article online. The rant has so far gone unpunished. Inside the White House, there was a sense of genuine concern and bewilderment about what Scaramuccis future might portend. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the tensions did not seem to trouble Trump. The presidents management style seems to be to encourage factionalism among people below him. He seems to place value on watching people fight, Fleischer said. Aside from sacking Priebus, it was unclear how Trump planned to proceed to regain his footing. With healthcare stalled, Trump has his sights set on tax reform with no consensus on how to proceed. Top aides are split on how deeply to cut taxes. It is the same moderates-versus-conservatives split that doomed the Obamacare rollback. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The July 26-28 poll suggested that the country largely disagrees with President Donald Trumps announcement this week that he will ban transgender personnel from the armed forces.  When asked to weigh in on the debate, 58 percent of adults agreed with the statement, Transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military. Twenty-seven percent said they should not while the rest answered dont know.  Democrats mostly supported military service by transgender Americans while Republicans were more evenly split.  Among Republicans, 32 percent said transgender Americans should be allowed to serve, while 49 percent said they should not. Another 19 percent of Republicans said they dont know.  The public was also divided over the impact of banning transgender service members. Some 32 percent said it would hurt morale in the military while 17 percent said it would improve morale. Another 33 percent felt it would have no impact and the rest said they dont know.  When asked about the impact on military capabilities, 14 percent said prohibiting transgender service members made the military more capable while 43 percent said no impact, 22 percent said less capable and the rest said they dont know.  The presidents announcement, made in posts on his Twitter account, surprised many senior military officers and appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review into its inclusion of transgender service members.  The United States top military officer, Marine Corps. General Joseph Dunford, said the military will not alter its current policies until it receives additional guidance from Trumps secretary of defense.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will sign legislation that imposes sanctions on Russia, the White House said on Friday, after Moscow ordered the United States to cut hundreds of diplomatic staff and said it would seize two U.S. diplomatic properties in retaliation for the bill. The U.S. Senate had voted almost unanimously on Thursday to slap new sanctions on Russia, forcing Trump to choose between a tough position on Moscow and effectively dashing his stated hopes for warmer ties with the country or to veto the bill amid investigations in possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. By signing the bill into law, Trump can not ease the sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. Moscows retaliation, announced by the Foreign Ministry on Friday, had echoes of the Cold War. If confirmed that Russias move would affect hundreds of staff at the U.S. embassy, it would far outweigh the Obama administrations expulsion of 35 Russians in December. The legislation was in part a response to conclusions by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and to further punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Late on Friday, the White House issued a statement saying Trump would sign the bill after reviewing the final version. The statement made no reference to Russias retaliatory measures. Russia had been threatening retaliation for weeks. Its response suggests it has set aside initial hopes of better ties with Washington under Trump, something the U.S. leader, before he was elected, had said he wanted to achieve.  Relations were already languishing at a post-Cold War low because of the allegations that Russian cyber interference in the election was intended to boost Trumps chances, something Moscow flatly denies. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.    The Russian Foreign Ministry complained of growing anti-Russian feeling in the United States, accusing well-known circles of seeking open confrontation. President Vladimir Putin had warned on Thursday that Russia would have to retaliate against what he called boorish U.S. behavior. Putins spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Friday that the Senate vote was the last straw. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by telephone that Russia was ready to normalize relations with the United States and to cooperate on major global issues. Lavrov and Tillerson agreed to maintain contact on a range of bilateral issues, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. The ministry said the United States had until Sept. 1 to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, the number of Russian diplomats left in the United States after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December. It was not immediately clear how many U.S. diplomats and other workers would be forced to leave either the country or their posts, but the Interfax news agency cited an informed source as saying hundreds of people would be affected. A diplomatic source told Reuters that it would be for the United States to decide which posts to cut, whether occupied by U.S. or Russian nationals.  An official at the U.S. Embassy, who declined to be named because they were not allowed to speak to the media, said the Embassy employed around 1,100 diplomatic and support staff in Russia, including Russian and U.S. citizens. Russian state television channel Rossiya 24 said over 700 staff would be affected but that was not confirmed by the foreign ministry or the U.S. embassy. The Russian Foreign Ministrys statement said the passage of the bill confirmed the extreme aggression of the United States in international affairs. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov met outgoing U.S. ambassador John Tefft on Friday to inform him of the counter measures, Russian news agencies reported. The U.S. Embassy said Tefft had expressed his strong disappointment and protest. Most U.S. diplomatic staff, including around 300 U.S. citizens, work in the main embassy in Moscow, with others based in consulates in St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was also seizing a Moscow dacha compound used by U.S. diplomats for recreation, from Aug. 1, as well as a U.S. diplomatic warehouse in Moscow.  In December, the outgoing Obama administration seized two Russian diplomatic compounds - one in New York and another in Maryland - at the same time as it expelled Russian diplomats. Trump and Putin met for the first time at a G20 summit in Germany this month in what both sides described as a productive encounter, but Russian officials have become increasingly convinced that Congress and Trumps political opponents will not allow him to mend ties, even if he wants to. The European Union has also threatened to retaliate against new U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they would harm the blocs energy security by targeting projects including a planned new pipeline to bring Russian natural gas to northern Europe.     A European Commission spokesman in Brussels said the bloc would be following the sanctions process closely. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian central bank held its key interest rate unchanged at 9 percent on Friday, citing geopolitical risks and inflationary pressures, but it indicated rate cuts would follow in the coming months. Facing new U.S. sanctions and a recent spike in food prices, the central bank opted for a cautious no-change decision, even though inflation, its key area of focus, has nearly slowed to its 4 percent target. The inflation slowdown has allowed the central bank to cut benchmark borrowing costs three times this year, helping the economy recover following two years of contraction. Volatility in global commodity and financial markets, as well as exchange rate dynamics amid elevated geopolitical risks may have negative implications for exchange rate and inflation expectations, the central bank said in a statement. The U.S. Senate this week voted almost unanimously to slap new sanctions on Russia and backed a provision that allows Congress to stop any effort by President Donald Trump to ease existing sanctions. Although analysts have played down the potential economic impact of the new sanctions, the rouble has been dragged lower in recent days because of them. If rouble weakness were to intensify, that would represent an inflation risk. Although annual inflation unexpectedly rose from 4.1 percent in May to 4.4 percent last month because of higher food prices, the central bank said it still saw room to cut the key rate in the second half of 2017 as a new harvest would help lower prices for fruit and vegetables. While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast, the bank said. Keeping its 2017 economic growth forecast unchanged at 1.3-1.8 percent, the central bank noted that a decline in inflation expectations had come to an end. In order to maintain inflation close to the 4 percent target, the Bank of Russia will continue to conduct moderately tight monetary policy, said the bank, which has previously promised to keep its key rate up to 3 percentage points above inflation. All in all, extreme caution is the focus at the CBR, Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at ING Bank in Moscow, said in a research note. With the threat of more U.S. sanctions looming, the central bank likely wants to take no risks with financial stability by keeping rates stable, said Tim Ash, senior strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. The bank is seen cutting its main lending rate to 8.25 percent by the end of the year, a Reuters poll showed last month. Capital Economics said it expected the central bank to cut rates as soon as its next board meeting, scheduled for Sept. 15, as inflation would fall back towards the central banks target by year-end.

The honeymoon is over. Russias tit-for-tat decision to expel hundreds of U.S. diplomats and seize two U.S. compounds may be an acknowledgment in Moscow that Trumps ability to bring better ties is limited, at best, and the start of a new downward spiral in relations. Russia took the step after the U.S. Senate on Thursday sent a breath-taking signal that it does not trust Trump on Russia by passing a bill that imposes new sanctions on Moscow and ties the presidents hands if he seeks to ease them. The White House issued a statement on Friday night saying Trump had negotiated changes to the legislation and now intends to sign it. (The Russians) have taken Trumps measure and while they are willing to exploit his goofy fixation on Putin and naive sense you can do deals with someone like Putin ... they realize his clownish performance as president makes it really hard for him to deliver on any of the big things that Russia wants, said Andrew Weiss, a former national security council Russia expert. At the top of Russias wish list is an easing of U.S. sanctions imposed for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its destabilization of eastern Ukraine, something the Senate action would all but rule out. Another, all but inconceivable,  item would be formal U.S. recognition Russias claim to Crimea. Trumps performance surely has left nobody in Moscow with the impression he is a guy who can deliver, said Weiss, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. Trumps desire, often expressed during the 2016 presidential campaign, to improve relations has been hamstrung by findings from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democrat Hillary Clinton. A federal law enforcement investigation and multiple U.S. congressional probes looking into the possibility that Trumps campaign colluded with Russia, have made it harder for Trump to open a new chapter with Putin. Russia denies it interfered in the election and Trump has said there was no collusion. The Senates 98-2 passage of the sanctions bill, which followed a 419-3 vote in the House of Representatives, forces Trump to take a hard line on Moscow or veto the legislation and infuriate his fellow Republicans. The huge margins mean Congress could easily override a veto. Weiss suggested that Trumps low approval ratings at home, his tendency to alienate NATO allies such as Germany and his inability to pass domestic legislation all contribute to a Russian perception that he is weakening the United States. (That) is going to pay dividends for Moscow, so there is no need to turn him away from the course he is already on which is self-destructive and bad for Americas standing internationally. All of that is a huge win for the Kremlin, Weiss said. Russia gave the United States until Sept. 1 to cut its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, the number of Russian diplomats left in the United States after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December because of the alleged election hacking. It also said it would seize a Moscow compound used by U.S. diplomats as well as a U.S. diplomatic warehouse. Some former officials said Russia could take other steps, such as seeking to help Russian-backed forces seize more ground in eastern Ukraine or to try to limit U.S. air operations in Syria, while others said any reaction might be more muted. Russia could look at imposing economic counter-sanctions against the United States, the former official said, saying he thought that retaliation in Ukraine or Syria was less likely because it was more likely to lead to a U.S. counter response. Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012-2014, said he does not think that Russia will escalate tensions with the United States just yet because Trumps assertions that he wants better relations with Moscow are encouraging Putin to continue seeking some kind of accommodation with the U.S. president. I dont think they are going to walk away from that just yet, said McFaul. I believe that Putin still believes there might be something he can do with Trump.

John McCain, the maverick 80-year-old senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee, cast the deciding vote in the dramatic early-morning showdown on the Senate floor as a bill to repeal key elements of Obamacare was defeated, 51-49, dealing Trump a crushing political setback. McCain, who flew from Arizona this week after being diagnosed with brain cancer and was heading back for further treatment starting on Monday, joined fellow Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski in voting with Senate Democrats unified against the legislation. Its time to move on, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose reputation as a master strategist was diminished, said on the Senate floor after the vote at roughly 1:30 a.m. (0530 GMT). While House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said fellow Republicans should not give up on healthcare, he cited other pressing issues that needed attention, including major tax-cut legislation sought by Trump. We have so much work still to do, Ryan said in a statement. The Senates healthcare failure called into question the Republican Partys ability to govern even as it controls the White House, Senate and House of Representatives.  Trump has not had a major legislative victory after more than six months in office, and his administration is mired in investigations into contacts between his election campaign and Russia and high-level White House staff infighting. He had promised to get major healthcare legislation, tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending through Congress in short order. Also on the legislative agenda are spending bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to avoid a government shutdown and raising the U.S. debt limit. Speaking in Brentwood, New York, on Long Island, Trump expressed dismay at the bills failure, saying, I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode and then do it (pass legislation). I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode. Trump, who earlier on Twitter said the three Republicans who voted no let America down, again took aim at lawmakers in his own party. Boy, oh boy, theyve been working on that one for seven years, he said in Brentwood. Can you believe that? The swamp. But well get it done.               Some lawmakers urged a bipartisan effort to buttress the existing healthcare system. With the partisan divide as wide as ever in Washington, it remained to be seen if a bipartisan approach can get off the ground.  McCain said the defeated bill did not offer meaningful reform and that its defeat presents an opportunity to start fresh on legislation crafted by lawmakers in both parties. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to trust each other, stop the political gamesmanship and put the healthcare needs of the American people first, McCain said. Top congressional Democrats urged a bipartisan effort to fix problems in the Obamacare law without repealing it. Change it, improve it, but dont just take a knife and try to destroy it and put nothing in its place, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said. Democratic Senator Bill Nelson said he was working with Republican Collins on a bipartisan effort on healthcare. While Ryan was able to secure House passage of a comprehensive bill to gut Obamacare in May, McConnell earlier in the week was unable to win passage of similarly broad healthcare legislation amid intraparty squabbling and competing demands by hard-line conservatives and moderates. On Friday morning, he failed to get even a stripped-down, so-called skinny bill over the finish line. Killing the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement dubbed Obamacare, has been a passion for Republicans since its 2010 enactment over their unified opposition, and was a key campaign promise by Trump last year. Republicans lawmakers, some of whom have been gleeful about razing Obamas presidential legacy, now fear a backlash from their conservative political base that could affect the 2018 congressional elections. For the moment, the Affordable Care Act, which extended health insurance to 20 million people and drove the percentage of uninsured people to historic lows, remains in place and must be overseen by an administration that is hostile to it. This leaves health insurers unsure of how long the administration will continue to make billions of dollars in Obamacare payments that help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. Schumer warned against any efforts to sabotage the law. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents insurers across the country, said it would work to ensure a smooth open enrollment period from Nov. 1-Dec. 15 and stabilize the individual insurance market under Obamacare for the long term. Shares of health insurers, which had fought against the bills proposed repeal of the mandate that Americans obtain insurance, were up. Aetna Inc rose 0.9 percent, Anthem Inc gained 2.3 percent and Humana Inc edged up 0.2 percent.  On Wall Street, shares of hospitals were mostly higher because of the dwindling prospects for big cuts in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled. Community Health Systems Inc rose 2.2 percent, HCA Healthcare Inc gained 0.6 percent and Tenet Healthcare Corp edged up 0.1 percent.     Republicans have long denounced Obamacare - which expanded Medicaid and created online marketplaces for individuals to obtain coverage - as an intrusion by government on peoples healthcare decisions. Veteran House Republican Tom Cole said he thought there were a number of other Republican senators who were uncomfortable with the Senates healthcare legislation but were able to vote yes knowing McCains vote would kill it. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain, met on Friday with Trump to discuss Grahams proposal to take tax money raised by Obamacare and send it back to the states in the form of healthcare block grants, the senators office said. The skinny bill, released just three hours before voting began, would have retroactively repealed Obamacares penalty on individuals who do not obtain health insurance, repealed for eight years a penalty on certain businesses that do not provide employees with insurance and repealed a tax on medical devices until 2020.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Teamsters union on Friday praised House lawmakers for keeping self-driving commercial trucks out of a proposed bill aimed at speeding deployment of the advanced technology for cars.  The U.S. House Energy and Committee on Thursday unanimously approved a bill that would hasten the use of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles. The measure only applies to vehicles under 10,000 pounds and not large commercial trucks. The 1.4-million-member union, hoping to protect the jobs of truck drivers, has been lobbying at the federal and state levels to slow legislation to make it easier for companies to roll out self-driving trucks. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has said she is very concerned about the impact of self-driving cars on U.S. jobs, a big part of President Donald Trumps campaign message. It is vital that Congress ensure that any new technology is used to make transportation safer and more effective, not used to put workers at risk on the job or destroy livelihoods, Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said in a statement, adding the union wants more changes in the House measure. Teamsters officials have been involved in talks with Senate aides, seeking to exclude commercial trucks from a similar bill setting federal regulations for autonomous vehicles, lobbyists said. The Senate proposal has not been made public yet. The House bill would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years. Auto industry leaders have said 3 million commercial truck jobs could eventually be at risk if self-driving vehicles replaced human drivers. Alphabet Incs self-driving car unit Waymo is working on developing self-driving trucks, the company said last month. Other companies have also been working on self-driving trucks. Ride services company Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] is working on autonomous trucking through its Otto unit, which it acquired last year. Tesla Inc, which is working on self-driving technologies, plans to unveil a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi in September. The Teamsters have opposed efforts by states to approve plans by logistics companies to use platooning technology that could reduce driver jobs by allowing a pack of trucks to be digitally connected and driven in formation. Missouri Governor Eric Greitens approved a revised platooning measure this year that requires a driver in the cab of each truck. His predecessor Jay Nixon vetoed platoon testing last year.

The gaudy billboard sports a caricature of Trump with a blue and red fleshless face beneath his blond hair. It went up above the two-tier inner city ring road known as the Periferico last week after failing to find takers in the United States. Backed with an American flag, the 13-by-7 meter (43-by-23 feet) placard of a finger-pointing Trump was originally intended to adorn a U.S. city, said its creator, Chicago-based artist Mitch OConnell. America is afraid to put up this tongue-in-cheek billboard, OConnell told Reuters by telephone. Then Mexico came to mind because Trump started out his campaign by being cruel and mean to everyone in Mexico. The White House had no comment on the sign. A real estate developer and reality TV star-turned politician, Trump sparked fury in Mexico when he launched his campaign for the presidency in 2015 with a pledge to build a massive border wall and accusations that Mexico sent rapists and drug runners across the border. At the time, OConnell was working on a poster for a science-fiction and horror film festival featuring John Carpenters 1988 cult classic They Live about aliens living incognito among humans. That project would inspire his vision of Trump. About four months ago, OConnell set up a GoFundMe page to get the image onto a billboard. The campaign raised about $3,000. He failed in some 30 attempts at pitching the arresting image in Washington, Chicago and other U.S. cities. He said he found no U.S. company wanted to touch it because its political. In the end, the Trump billboard was placed in Mexico and will remain on display for about a month, said Jorge Alderete, an Argentine artist living in Mexico City who helped mount the billboard above the busy highway. With every month that passed since I did the drawing two years ago, he has become more like that crazy alien, OConnell said. It seems over time he became more and more like the movie, so it became more and more appropriate over time. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare in disarray, hundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months. Republican senators failed this week to repeal and replace Obamacare, former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare reform law, creating new uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million Americans will be funded and managed in 2018. In response, Republican President Donald Trump on Friday again suggested that his administration would let the Obamacare program implode. He has weakened enforcement of the laws requirement for individuals to buy insurance, threatened to cut off funding and sought to change plan benefits through regulations.  Anthem Inc, Cigna Corp, Health Care Service Corp and Molina Healthcare, four of the biggest health insurers selling Obamacare plans, said they are weighing whether to pull out of more markets for 2018 rather than face financial losses. They have until Sept. 27 to finalize their plans.  So far, 40 U.S. counties are expected to have no insurer offering individual coverage next year, but that number could rise by the hundreds, according to U.S. government data, Kaiser Family Foundation analysis and insurer disclosures. More than 1,300 counties, primarily in 15 states, currently have only one insurer participating in 2018. Anthem and HCSC are the last man standing in one-third of those counties and states - putting those areas in particular at risk. Right now the number of counties at immediate risk of having no insurers in 2018 is small, but it could easily grow significantly if a couple major insurers decide to exit, Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said.  Many insurers have been waiting for an answer from Trump or lawmakers on whether they will continue to fund $8 billion in annual government subsidies. Without assurances, many insurers plan to raise rates an additional 20 percent by an Aug. 16 deadline for premium prices. Others say that the many unknowns will make the business too risky. The last-minute drama has left millions of Americans questioning whether they will have medical coverage next year. Julie Grady, a 59-year-old small business owner in Carson City, Nevada, is currently covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nevada, part of Anthem, which has already decided to leave the exchanges in her county and most of the state. Carson City will have no insurer on the exchanges next year.  Gradys pays a reduced premium of $70 per month and a deductible under $1,000 for her plan, which is part of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. Grady is looking at being uninsured, as she was before the law.  I would have to go without health insurance, she said. I would just stay healthy, hike, eat well. Id be in trouble if something catastrophic happened. I would lose everything.  Anthem, the second-largest U.S. health insurer, sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states. It has already decided to pull out of most individual markets in Nevada, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin in 2018. Earlier this week, Chief Executive Officer Joe Swedish said he was still weighing 2018 participation in its other states.  In states like Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia, Anthem sells plans in more than 250 counties where it is the only insurer, and they could be left bare next year, according to government data.   Health Care Services Corp is a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee in five states and is the only Obamacare individual insurer in more than 90 Texas counties, more than 75 Oklahoma counties, and half a dozen Illinois counties. It confirmed on Friday that it has submitted products for its five states but is still weighing next year.  Were working through the regulatory filing process and hope to fully participate...in 2018, however no final decisions have been made, HCSC spokeswoman Kristen Cunningham said.  Molina, which has more than 1 million members in Obamacare plans, and Cigna, with more than 250,000 participants, have said they need more certainty from the government to decide on 2018 participation and would weigh their decisions up until the late September deadline.   State insurance regulators have worked hard in recent months to replace insurers who have left. In Nevada, for instance, Centene Corp and Aetna Inc entered in some counties that Anthem left after the insurance commissioner said he would favor these insurers for its Medicaid contract bids. But they are unlikely to find replacements for new dropouts in these final weeks, particularly if the Trump administration signals it wont fund $8 billion in subsidies for out-of-pocket medical costs.  There is almost no chance they would step in to participate, said Kurt Wrobel, a fellow at the Society of Actuaries and chief financial officer of the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania.  Some insurers say they will likely just raise rates and hope it works. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan filed two sets of rates with the state department of insurance, one up to 32 percent higher if the fate of subsidies remains unclear.  We dont have any plans to pull out, said Rick Notter, director of the individual business at BCBS Michigan. But it would certainly help to have more certainty around what the market holds.

The regulation, known in corporate tax circles as the 385 rule, is intended to combat a tax-avoidance technique called earnings-stripping, in which multinational corporations transfer taxable income from a U.S. subsidiary to a foreign affiliate in the guise of tax-deductible interest payments on internal debt.   The rule, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is now reviewing as part of the Trump administrations push for deregulation, seeks to eliminate the incentive for earnings-stripping by reclassifying certain loans as equity under Section 385 of the U.S. tax code. The change converts tax-deductible interest payments employed by the schemes into taxable stock dividends. Finalized last October, the regulation required corporations to file documentation on their internal loans with the IRS by a January 2018 deadline.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who has worked closely with President Donald Trumps administration on Latin American issues, held a news conference with two other Republican members of Congress, all from Florida, to discuss the issue ahead of the controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday. Julio Borges, who leads Venezuelas opposition-led National Assembly legislature, telephoned in to the news conference to discuss the vote. Rubio noted that the Trump administration had announced sanctions this week, and added, You can expect more. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials on Wednesday, heaping pressure on unpopular President Nicolas Maduro to scrap plans for the new congress. A senior Trump administration official told Reuters this week that the administration would make good on Trumps threat to take action and would act very quickly on further sanctions if Maduro goes ahead with his plan. Another lawmaker at the news conference, U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, said he hoped Maduro will take a deep breath and back off. If they dont, the United States will not stand still, he said. Rubio insisted the United States was not seeking to dictate to Venezuela. What unifies us today in this cause isnt interference in another countrys affairs, but support for its people, he said. Rubio said Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin had been involved in the issue, and that Trump had spoken to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about Venezuela this week.

The state is one of eight in the United States to have legalized use of the drug by adults 21 and older. Marijuana possession was legalized on Dec. 15, 2016, but retail sales of the drug remain illegal until Jan. 1, 2018, a delay intended to give state and local authorities time to decide how to regulate the trade. Baker, a Republican, opposed legalization as did several senior state officials, and he voiced concern about the future after signing the law. I dont support this. I worry terribly about what the consequences will be, Baker told reporters. We appreciate the careful consideration the legislature took to balance input from lawmakers, educators, public safety officials and public health professionals, while honoring the will of the voters regarding the adult use of marijuana. The law also allows cities and towns to ban or limit marijuana sales and creates a five-member Cannabis Control Commission with responsibility for overseeing the sale of recreational and medical marijuana. The measure approved by voters called for legal retail sales of the drug to begin on July 1, but state legislators pushed that date back by six months to allow time to develop regulations. Legalization backers, who had protested the delay, called on state officials to move quickly in appointing the new control commission. The state will benefit greatly from the tax revenues and jobs created by the new industry, and we are confident lawmakers will secure appropriate funding to get the regulatory system up and running on the current timeline, said Jim Borghesani, a spokesman for Regulate Mass, which supported the ballot initiative.

The requests made on Thursday by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology are the latest blow to the antivirus company, which has been countering accusations by U.S. officials that it may be vulnerable to Russian government influence. The committee asked the agencies for all documents and communications about Kaspersky Lab products dating back to Jan. 1, 2013, including any internal risk assessments. It also requested lists of any systems that use Kaspersky products and the names of any U.S. government contractors or subcontractors that do so. Kaspersky has repeatedly denied that it has ties to any government and said it would not help any government with cyber espionage. It said there is no evidence for the accusations made by U.S. officials. The committee is concerned that Kaspersky Lab is susceptible to manipulation by the Russian government, and that its products could be used as a tool for espionage, sabotage, or other nefarious activities against the United States, wrote the panels Republican chairman, Lamar Smith, in the letters. They were sent to all Cabinet-level agencies, including the Department of Commerce and Department of Homeland Security, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, among others. A committee aide told Reuters the survey was a first step designed to canvas the U.S. government and that more action may follow depending on the results. The committee asked for responses by Aug. 11. Kaspersky Lab, founded in 1997 and now counts over 400 million global customers, has tried largely in vain to become a vendor to the U.S. government, one of the worlds biggest buyers of cyber tools.  Longstanding suspicions about the company grew in the United States when U.S.-Russia relations deteriorated following Russias 2014 annexation of Crimea and later when U.S. intelligence agencies determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election using cyber means. Congress this week slapped new sanctions on Russia, in part in response to the allegations, which Moscow flatly denies. Moscow retaliated by ordering out some U.S. diplomats. U.S. intelligence chiefs in May publicly expressed doubt about the safety of Kaspersky products for the first time, although they offered no specific evidence of any wrongdoing. The government is reviewing how many agencies use software from Kaspersky Lab. In June, FBI agents visited the homes of Kaspersky employees as part of a counterintelligence probe, two sources familiar with the matter said. The Trump administration also took steps to remove Kaspersky from a list of approved government vendors.  A defense spending policy bill advancing in the U.S. Senate would prohibit the Department of Defense from using Kaspersky products. Kaspersky employees attending the annual Black Hat conference in Las Vegas this week appeared to be largely taking the setbacks in stride. The company cheekily hosted a party at the Red Square restaurant and bar, where it invited attendees to don fur coats before entering a vodka freezer to enjoy high-end imported bottles of alcohol. On Tuesday, the company launched a free, global version of its antivirus software, saying in a blog post that it would help secure the whole world.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the end, it was a simple hand gesture - Senator John McCain pointing his right index finger in a downward motion to register a no vote - that ruined his partys seven-year effort to repeal Obamacare. But in that signal in the early hours of Friday, the 80-year-old McCain also delivered a political gut-punch to U.S. President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican and a man he has clashed with repeatedly over the past two years. McCain, who just last week was diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer, dropped a hint on Tuesday that if his legislative demands were not met he was prepared to take on Trump in the dispute over how to replace parts of Obamacare with a Republican healthcare program. We are not the presidents subordinates. We are his equals, he said in an emotional speech to the Senate - his first since being diagnosed. McCains relations with Trump have been frosty for some time. At an election campaign appearance in Iowa in 2015, Trump responded to criticism from McCain by denigrating the senators military service, which included 5 1/2-years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He was tortured while in captivity and is seen as a war hero by many Americans. Hes not a war hero, Trump told a gathering of religious conservatives. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who werent captured.  The following day, Trump said McCains work on behalf of military veterans was all talk no action. McCain, a leading Republican voice on defense and security, has generally been restrained in his criticism of Trump but has also at times let loose, including recent accusations that Trump has weakened Americas standing in world affairs and kowtowed to Russian President Vladimir Putin. With his Friday vote that brought the tally to 51-49 against a Republican bill repealing parts of former President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, McCain became the third Senate Republican to bolt, leaving no path for passage of the measure. The Arizona Republican, who was the Republican presidential candidate in 2008, also added another important chapter to his maverick, 30-year Senate career, stunning some of his fellow legislators and leaving Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with the worst defeat of his long political career. But most notably, McCain denied Trump what could have been the first major legislative victory of his administration, and demonstrated to the businessman-turned-president that Washington works in different ways from companies where CEOs have freer hands in dictating outcomes. Although Trump was minimally involved in the process of crafting the legislation, he had made plain it was a priority. When the Senate failed to push through bills drawn up by the Republican leadership over the past few weeks, Trump told Republicans to get back to work and try again. He has been publicly urging them to get the job done. Despite McCains tensions with the White House, Vice President Mike Pence was assigned the task of trying to convince him to vote for the so-called skinny bill that aimed to pare away parts of Obamacare. That, after it became apparent that Trumps cheerleading tweet on Thursday night was not working: Go Republican Senators, Go! Get there after waiting for 7 years. Give America great healthcare! Pence spent 21 minutes, according to reporters watching inside the Senate chamber, talking to McCain on the Senate floor. McCain was not budging, even after taking a short phone call from the president. After the Senate vote tally was announced in the Senate, McCain was embraced by senators from both sides of the aisle. Democrats were delighted he had helped kill the Obamacare repeal effort and some Republicans just wanted to show their respect for the man. McConnell spoke bitterly of the defeat. I imagine many of our colleagues on the other side are celebrating, probably pretty happy about all of this. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer again called for bipartisan work to fix Obamacares shortcomings, saying, I would suggest we turn the page... We are not celebrating. We are relieved. Just three days ago, Trump praised McCain as a brave American hero for coming back to Washington from Arizona, where he had been recuperating from surgery, to take part in the healthcare legislative effort.  Now the president was dejected. 3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!, Trump tweeted following his defeat. On Friday, McCain advised a much different approach: an immediate, collaborative effort with Democrats on healthcare. For McCain, who also hoped to shepherd a major defense bill through the Senate, his political and legislative tussles could now be interrupted by the more pressing need to treat his cancer.

The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis sent the case back to the federal district court in Little Rock, telling the court it must estimate approximately how many women would likely be harmed by the law before the case could proceed further. Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which runs two of the three clinics providing abortions in Arkansas, sued the state in 2015, saying the law would deprive many Arkansas women of their right to an abortion.  The law requires that any doctor dispensing abortion-inducing drugs sign a contract with another doctor who would agree to handle any medical complications that might stem from the drugs. The contracted doctor must have admitting privileges at a hospital designated to handle emergencies related to abortion pills. Planned Parenthood said it ran a 24-hour telephone helpline for patients and that medical complications were extremely rare, but that in those instances its doctors and nurses already have procedures to ensure a patient receives any care they need at a nearby hospital. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker sided with Planned Parenthood in 2015, concluding that it would not be able to find such a doctor and be forced to stop offering abortion services at its clinics in Little Rock and Fayetteville.  Women in Fayetteville, for example, would then have to make two 380-mile (610-km) round trips to get an abortion at what would be the states last remaining abortion clinic, Bakers ruling said. Ruling that this was an undue burden on those women and that Planned Parenthood would likely win its lawsuit, Baker granted a preliminary injunction stopping the law from taking effect. On Friday, the appeals court overturned that injunction. The ruling said the district court had abused its discretion and criticized it for not determining even approximately how many women would be affected. Planned Parenthood could win its case if the court found a large fraction of women seeking abortion-inducing drugs would face an undue burden, but the lower court failed to determine this, the ruling said. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge welcomed the ruling, saying in a statement that Planned Parenthood failed to show that the state law is a substantial obstacle preventing most women from having access to abortion services. Danielle Wells, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the organization was mulling its next steps, but noted it would have two weeks under the appeals court rules to petition for a rehearing. This law was written by politicians, and not doctors, and is part of a national strategy to end access to abortion step by step and law by law, Wells wrote in an email.

The December timeline is the first time the company has publicly set a deadline about making an investment decision for the project since U.S. President Donald Trump approved Keystone XL in March, reversing a decision by Barack Obama. The investment decision will be based on shipper demand and a regulatory outcome from the U.S. state of Nebraska, through which the project passes, Paul Miller, executive vice president and president of liquid pipeline at TransCanada, said in a conference call after the release of quarterly results.  Our assessment of these factors will really drive our investment decision when we get into that November-December time frame, he said. While TransCanada has good support from existing shippers, including those who departed after Keystone XLs 2015 rejection, it is seeking new entrants and wants a significant level of commitment, Miller said, without specifying precise figures. TransCanada launched an open season on Thursday for additional commitments for Keystone XL. The expansion increases the capacity of the current Keystone system from Canadas oil-producing Alberta province to the Gulf of Mexico. TransCanada also said on Friday it will invest about C$160 million ($129 million) to expand the capacity of the Canadian natural gas mainline, a move that could help producers who have been denied an export route after this weeks cancellation of the Pacific NorthWest project. Malaysian state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd [PETR.UL], or Petronas, announced scrapping of its Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas terminal in Canadas British Columbia province this week, due to depressed commodity prices. TransCanada, which spent at least C$500 million to build the pipeline connecting gas wells to the terminal, said it would be reimbursed this year for costs associated with the project.  The companys profits on Friday were helped by strength in its U.S. natural gas pipelines and liquids pipelines units.

In paragraph 12 corrects description of IHG brand to Holiday Inn Express from Holiday Inn; corrects to say new brand would aim to capture part of $20 billion market rather than to generate $20 billion in revenues on its own) Trump Hotels, diversifying from a longtime focus on the luxury market, has about 10 hotels in the pipeline for its recently announced midscale American Idea chain, Chief Executive Eric Danziger said in an interview with Reuters. The new chain, the product of conversations last year between President Donald Trumps sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump about the lack of options in the midscale market, will be franchised and thus not directly operated by Trump Hotels, unlike most of the companys other properties. When closely held Trump Hotels, which is part of the Trump Organization, announced the brand last month, it said it had struck a deal with Chawla Pointe, LLC, to open three of the properties in Mississippi. If the further 10 or so properties come to fruition, the deals would thrust Trump Hotels into the midscale market at a time when other hotel companies are extending their range in that area. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) and Intercontinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG.L) have announced new midscale brands over the past year and a half.      Generally that midscale product is all the same with a different name on it, Danziger said in a phone interview this week, adding that American Idea would differentiate itself with a decor he described as flea market chic, with decor and design tailored to local industries and landmarks.    Danziger said most American Idea hotels would be conversions from other brands, with the first expected to open in early 2018. Advertising is set to begin next month, he said. Danziger declined to provide further details about the potential new American Idea locations, saying the deals had not been finalized, but said the negotiations were with owners from different parts of the country. Trump Hotels, whose best-known properties are luxury hotels in major cities like New York, Chicago, Washington and Las Vegas, earlier this year unveiled a third brand, Scion, which has lower prices than the traditional Trump hotels and is aimed at millennials. The U.S. president turned over management of the umbrella Trump Organization in January to a trust controlled by his two oldest sons, but he still owns his businesses, including its hotels, and can draw revenue from them at any time. Among other, larger chains, Hilton is hoping its Tru brand will eventually be its largest, supplanting the companys Hampton Inn, Trus global head, Alexandra Jaritz, said in a phone interview. That brands room prices have risen over time, leaving a gap in Hiltons portfolio for the $100-to-$120 price point, Jaritz said,  InterContinental also announced an unnamed midscale brand in June, which is expected to be at a price point $10 to $15 less than its Holiday Inn Express brand and could eventually capture part of an estimated $20 billion market segment, Heather Balsley, IHGs senior vice president of Americas brands and marketing, told Reuters.

The U.S. Department of Justice, in a friend of the court brief, told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Wednesday that Congress never intended Title VII, which bans sex discrimination in the workplace, to apply to gay workers.  The department also said the court owed no deference to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces Title VII and has argued since 2012 that the law bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The brief came hours after President Donald Trump said he would ban transgender people from serving in the military. That would reverse a 2016 policy adopted by Obama.  Justice Department spokesman Devin OMalley said the brief was consistent with rulings by 10 federal appeals courts and reaffirms the Departments fundamental belief that the courts cannot expand the law beyond what Congress has provided. The departments brief was in support of New York skydiving company Altitude Express Inc in a lawsuit filed by a former employee, Donald Zarda.  Zarda claimed he lost his job as a skydiving instructor after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. He died in a BASE-jumping accident after filing the lawsuit. In April, a three-judge 2nd Circuit panel dismissed Zardas case, citing a prior ruling that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. The full court, which can overturn the prior decision, agreed in May to review the case. The issue could reach the U.S. Supreme Court in a different case brought by a former security guard at a Georgia hospital who claims she was harassed and forced to quit because she is gay.  Earlier this month, LGBT rights group Lambda Legal, which represents the former security guard, said it would ask the high court to review the case.  On Wednesday, the Justice Department said employers engage in sex discrimination only when they treat male and female workers differently. Objecting to homosexuality does not depend on sex, the department said, but on moral or religious beliefs. Of course, if an employer fired only gay men but not gay women (or vice versa), that would be prohibited by Title VII, the department wrote, but precisely because it would be discrimination based on sex, not sexual orientation. Zardas lawyer, Gregory Antollino, said on Thursday that the department was making the same arguments the Supreme Court rejected in cases involving discrimination against workers in interracial relationships.

Scaramucci blasted White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Trumps chief strategist, Steve Bannon, in an article in The New Yorker based on a telephone conversation on Wednesday night between one of the magazines correspondents and Scaramucci. Amid a stream of vulgar language, the former Wall Street financier named to the communications post last Friday called Priebus a fucking paranoid schizophrenic and accused Bannon of trying to build his own brand off the fucking strength of the president. In a Twitter message after the article appeared online, Scaramucci said: I sometimes use colorful language. I will  refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrumps agenda. Asked about the article, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration was focused on healthcare and other items. He used some colorful language that I dont anticipate hell do again, she told reporters. Any apology needs to happen personally between them, she said. Priebus and Bannon had no comment. Trump himself made no public comment on his aides outburst.   Some of Trumps advisers have questioned Priebus competence and his position appeared weak. Republicans close to the White House said Trumps family had also been critical of his chief of staff. The drama was the latest sign of disarray within the Trump White House even as it tries to advance healthcare and tax reform legislation. The president himself is preoccupied with an investigation into Russian meddling in last years presidential election and has been fiercely critical in recent days of his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The scathing remarks by Scaramucci came as he and other Trump loyalists ratcheted up pressure on Priebus, a former Republican National Committee chairman, who does not have years-long ties with Trump.  There has been speculation that Priebus, who steered the party apparatus behind Trumps unorthodox candidacy in last years election, is on his way out because Trump has no major legislative achievements in his first six months in office. Earlier in the day, Sanders would not say whether Trump had confidence in Priebus.  We all serve at the pleasure of the president and if it gets to a place where that isnt the place, hell let you know, Sanders told reporters. She added that Trump hires the very best people who are not always going to agree and that he supports healthy competition, and with that competition you usually get the best results. Priebus had sought to block Scaramucci from a White House job, according to officials. Priebus allies said Trumps hiring of Scaramucci, which prompted press secretary Sean Spicer to resign, was a bad omen for Priebus. In The New Yorker article, Scaramucci demanded to know how the reporter found out about a White House dinner Scaramucci had with Trump on Wednesday. In the conversation, Scaramucci made clear he suspected that Priebus had leaked the information to the reporter, calling Priebus a paranoiac, according to the magazine. Scaramucci also told The New Yorker that unlike Bannon, he had no interest in media attention. Im not Steve Bannon, he said, adding: Im here to serve the country. On Wednesday, Scaramucci appeared to suggest in a Twitter message, later deleted, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation should investigate Priebus over a leak of Scaramuccis financial records. If Reince wants to explain hes not a leaker, let him do that, Scaramucci said on CNNs New Day on Thursday. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan defended Priebus on Thursday. The two men, both from Wisconsin, are close. Reince is doing a fantastic job at the White House and I believe he has the presidents confidence. If those two gentlemen have differences, my advice would be to sit down and settle your differences, Ryan told a news conference. Trump allies saw the drama playing out as a sign that the group of original Trump supporters was growing weary of Priebus and the RNC faction he brought with him. There is a widespread feeling among Trump supporters that hes never been a real supporter of Donald Trump and that he isnt playing to win on the presidents behalf, said an outside Trump adviser.

The fleet spokesman later said the question was asked as an outrageous hypothetical. Admiral Scott Swift was speaking at the Australian National University in Canberra when he was asked whether he would be prepared to launch a nuclear attack on China if ordered to do so by Trump. The answer would be yes, he said.  Swift said that all members of the U.S. military had sworn an oath to obey officers and the U.S. president as commander in chief to defend the constitution. This is core to the American democracy, he said, in a recording of the event obtained by Reuters. Any time you have a military that is moving away from a focus, and an allegiance, to civilian control, then we really have significant problems.   Swifts answer reaffirmed the principle of civilian control over the military and was based on an outrageous hypothetical in the question, Pacific Fleet spokesman Captain Charlie Brown told Reuters. Frankly, the premise of the question was ridiculous, he said. It was posed as an outrageous hypothetical, but the admiral simply took it as an opportunity to say the fact is that we have civilian control of the military and we abide by that principle.

The United States and China enjoy a generally friendly relationship, with strong economic ties, albeit with frequent barbs about trade, jobs, currencies, human rights, Tibet, the South China Sea and North Korea.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot.

The legislation all but dashes Trumps hopes for warmer ties with Moscow as his administration is dogged by congressional and special counsel investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to sway it in Trumps favor. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly denied the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered using cyber warfare methods, has threatened retaliation against the legislation. The Senate backed the bill, which also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea, by a margin of 98-2 with strong support from Trumps fellow Republicans as well as Democrats. The bill, which includes a provision that allows Congress to stop any effort by Trump to ease existing sanctions on Russia, will now be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. It is the first major foreign policy legislation approved by Congress under Trump, who has struggled to advance his domestic agenda despite Republicans controlling the Senate and House of Representatives. The strong bipartisan support for the bill was a sharp contrast to the bitter partisan rancor during debate over how to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system. If Trump chooses to veto it, the bill is expected to garner enough support in both chambers to override his veto and pass it into law. The sanctions measure has already passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 419-3.  Republicans and Democrats have pushed for more sanctions partly as a response to the election allegations. Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow. Republican Senator John McCain, a leading congressional voice calling for a firm line against Russia, said before the vote: The United States of America needs to send a strong message to Vladimir Putin and any other aggressor that we will not tolerate attacks on our democracy. Putin said Moscow would only decide on how to retaliate once it had seen the final text of the proposed law. The bill would affect a range of Russian industries and might further hurt the Russian economy, already weakened by 2014 sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crime from Ukraine. Besides angering Moscow, the legislation has upset the European Union, which has said the new sanctions might affect its energy security and prompt it to act, too. The legislation also cracks down on Iran and North Korea  for activities including their missile development programs and human rights abuses, including seeking to punish foreign banks that do business with North Korea. It also imposes restrictions on anyone involved in Irans ballistic missile program and those who do business with them. The sanctions also apply to Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps security force. Earlier on Thursday, a senior White House aide said Trump could veto the pending legislation in order to push for a tougher deal, an idea that drew skepticism in Congress because his administration had spent weeks lobbying for a weaker bill. He may sign the sanctions exactly the way they are or he may veto the sanctions and negotiate an even tougher deal against the Russians, White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci told CNN. Earlier on Thursday, Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters: I would guess that he (Trump) will sign it. A White House official said the bill would be reviewed, but we strongly support sanctions against all three countries. Another White House official said it could take a couple of days before the legislation gets to Trumps desk. Trump can impose new sanctions at any time through an executive order. This bill doesnt preclude him from issuing tougher sanctions. That doesnt make any sense, said Edward Fishman, a former State Department official during the Obama administration who worked on U.S. sanctions policy. Once Trump receives the bill, if he does not sign it, he has 10 days, excluding Sundays, before he must issue a veto and prevent the bill from becoming law automatically.  If he opts for a veto, the bill can become law anyway if two-thirds of both the House and Senate vote for an override.  Putin said on a visit to Finland on Thursday that Russia was exercising restraint and patience, but at some moment well have to retaliate. Its impossible to endlessly tolerate this boorishness towards our country. Putin, at a news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, also spoke about former President Barack Obamas order last December to seize Russian diplomatic property in the United States and to expel 35 Russian diplomats. This goes beyond all reasonable bounds, Putin said. And now these sanctions - they are also absolutely unlawful from the point of view of international law.

Many Republican lawmakers said they did not want the eight-page bill to become law, and held off supporting it until they received assurances from House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan that members of both chambers could set up a special committee that would craft new legislation.  Senate Republican leaders said the bill was simply a way to keep alive the seven-year promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, which was also a top campaign promise from President Donald Trump. The Senate failed to pass two major bills earlier in the week that would repeal or replace the healthcare law after spending months on both pieces of legislation.  The Affordable Care Act, known informally as Obamacare, brought insurance to 20 million previously uninsured Americans and was the signature domestic achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Republicans say the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in healthcare.  Heres whats in the skinny repeal bill, formally called the Health Care Freedom Act:  The bill repeals an Obamacare penalty on individuals who do not purchase health insurance. It also repeals a penalty for eight years on employers with more than 50 employees that do not provide health insurance.  The legislation repeals a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device sales, until Dec. 31, 2020. If it were to become law, this repeal would be welcome news to manufacturers such as Medtronic Inc and Abbott Laboratories Inc.  The Senate bill effectively defunds Planned Parenthood for one year by prohibiting Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, from reimbursing the womens healthcare provider. The majority of Planned Parenthood patients are on Medicaid.

The two-term Republican addressed both topics at a news conference in Topeka a day after the White House announced that he would soon be nominated as U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom, a State Department post. Brownback, who previously represented his home state in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, was a sponsor of the 1998 law that created the diplomatic post he now aspires to fill. International religious freedom is going the wrong way. Its getting worse around the world, not better, Brownback told reporters. It affects all faiths, it affects all religions. One of Brownbacks most notable forays into the realm of faith as governor came in 2015, when he issued an executive order to protect the religious convictions of clergy as Kansas began to comply with the landmark ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage. His gubernatorial legacy, however, has been largely defined by 2012 legislation he championed to roll back tax rates to help stimulate Kansas economy. The deep cuts shrank state coffers and caused Kansas to miss revenue targets, turning the state into a cautionary tale of fiscal mismanagement.  Its amazed me, too, that a tax cut done in a Midwestern state in 2012 has been the dominant tax discussion in America the last five years, Brownback said on Thursday. He mostly defended his tax strategy, though conceded some resulting spending cuts could have been carried out more artfully.  More than a dozen conservative allies in the state legislature lost their seats in the November election in what was seen as a political repudiation of Brownbacks fiscal policies. Earlier this year, both chambers of the Republican-controlled legislature voted to raise taxes and overrode Brownbacks attempt to veto that measure. Republican state Representative Melissa Rooker, in a separate interview with Reuters, called Brownbacks tax policy an unmitigated disaster. Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer, a physician who previously served in the legislature, would succeed Brownback if he resigned to assume the diplomatic post. It was unclear how soon Brownback might move to Washington, D.C. In the meantime, his standing at home is low. Brownback ranks as the second-least popular governor in the United States, with a 66 percent disapproval rating, according to the nonpartisan political research company Morning Consult.

Overall, Scaramucci has assets in a range of approximately $61 million to $85 million, the forms show. He also has liabilities, such as mortgages and personal loans, of between $6.9 million and $25.8 million.  Scaramuccis income since the start of 2016 - more than $10 million - is mostly derived from SkyBridge Capital, the hedge fund investment business that he founded in 2005 and is now in the process of selling to join the Trump administration. The disclosure says Scaramucci stands to make more than $50 million from the SkyBridge sale, which he said in May would likely close in June. The deal is on hold pending a regulatory review of its foreign-linked buyers. Scaramucci did not respond to a request for comment.  His wife Deidre is listed on the forms as making $256,250 for investor relations work at SkyBridge starting last year. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Deidre Scaramucci no longer works at the firm but did not say when she left. The disclosure document, obtained by Politico, was made to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on Scaramuccis appointment in June as chief strategy officer to the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Scaramucci on Thursday was not listed on the banks leadership web page. At first, when Politico reported the disclosure on Wednesday, Scaramucci decried it on Twitter as a criminal leak.   Scaramucci later deleted the tweet. The form is a public document available on request. As a proud son of what he calls blue-collar Long Island, Scaramucci has long rooted for the New York Mets and made an investment in the baseball team valued between $1 million and $5 million, the disclosures show. It paid him $53,000 over the last year and a half.  Scaramucci has an investment of as much as $250,000 in Strat-O-Matic Media LLC, which creates online simulations for baseball, football, hockey and basketball. A love of entertainment, particularly the Hollywood kind, is also apparent. Investments include a $50,001 to $100,000 stake in the film company behind American Psycho and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. According to media reports, Scaramucci paid $100,000 to have himself and SkyBridge make appearances in the 2010 sequel to the 1987 Oliver Stone-produced hit, Wall Street.Scaramucci, the document shows, is a financial backer of Crazy for the Boys, a movie in production about a group of high school girls who take a stand against bullying. Real estate features prominently in Scaramuccis portfolio. It ranges from residential property valued between $1 million and $5 million in Southampton, Long Island, where wealthy hedge fund managers often spend their summer weekends, to a loan valued at up to $100,000 to the Manhattan property of the restaurant he co-owns, Hunt & Fish Club.  Scaramucci has often mingled with celebrities, professional athletes and media types at the steakhouse, which features $130 porterhouses, personalized steak knives and shoeshines during dinner. There is a smattering of smaller holdings.  One is a stake worth between $30,002 and $100,000 in two Genesis nutrition supplement companies founded and previously led by Lindsey Duncan.

Anthony Scaramucci, a New York financier who last week became the White House communications chief, also compared his relationship with Trumps chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to a pair of brothers from the Bible, one of whom killed the other. Scaramucci said last week he and Priebus were friends and a little bit like brothers, where we rough each other up once in a while, which is totally normal for brothers. On Thursday, Scaramucci said in an interview with CNN: When I said we were brothers from the podium, thats because were rough on each other. Some brothers are like Cain and Abel. Other brothers can fight with each other and get along. I dont know if this is repairable or not. That will be up to the president. Scaramucci appeared to suggest in a Twitter post late on Wednesday that Priebus may have had a hand in what Scaramucci described as a leak of his official financial disclosure documents to the U.S. news organization Politico.  Politico said the information was not a leak but was publicly accessible. When I put out a tweet and I put Reinces name in a tweet, theyre all making the assumption that its him because journalists know who the leakers are, Scaramucci told CNN on Thursday. So if Reince wants to explain hes not a leaker, let him do that, Scaramucci added. Scaramucci had written earlier on Twitter: In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45. Scaramuccis comments illustrated an ongoing power struggle at the highest levels of Trumps staff as the Republican president faces investigations into his election campaigns connections with Russia and with Trump yet to win congressional approval for any major legislation. Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan defended Priebus after Scaramuccis comments. Reince is doing a fantastic job at the White House and I believe he has the presidents confidence.

Members of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee attending a briefing with Ross said he did not specify a timetable for releasing a long-awaited report that will lay out options for shielding the steel industry from imports on national security grounds. Ross had originally hoped to release the steel Section 232 report at the end of June but the timing has slipped amid disagreements among White House aides over the merits of restricting imports that could hurt steel consuming industries. A House Democratic aide who attended the briefing said Ross repeated President Donald Trumps comments in a Wall Street Journal interview this week that the decision on potential steel tariffs would take more time and could come after congressional debates on health care, tax reform and infrastructure spending.     I can only follow my leader, the aide said Ross told the briefing. The Commerce secretary also told lawmakers the issue had a lot of complexities and that he was considering the interests of both steel makers and steel users and concerned about potential trade retaliation against U.S. agricultural products. The lawmakers said Ross told them he was taking a similar approach to a parallel national security probe into aluminum imports. I think its a good sign that theyre actually slowing down and taking a long look, not trying to mix this in with these other issues that have to be lifted, said Republican Representative Jackie Walorski.   I think that Secretary Ross is committed to making sure that were doing no harm, that were getting this right. I need it to be right when it comes to aluminum, Walorski said, adding that the recreational vehicle industry in her northern Indiana district does not want to higher aluminum prices due tariffs. Representative Judy Chu, a California Democrat, said Ross told the lawmakers that the Trump administration also wanted to pursue negotiations with other steel-producing countries to address the problem of excess capacity that was causing a flood of dumped imports. But Ross and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week failed to secure commitments from their Chinese counterparts to make specific commitments to cut steel production capacity. China, which produces half the worlds steel, is widely viewed as the source of much of the metals excess production. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trumps declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military, and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by Reuters on Thursday.     I hope our commander in chief understands that we dont transmit orders via Twitter, and that he cant, either, one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if its even possible.      Rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands.. The United States top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel. Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trumps announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders and senior enlisted leaders. I know there are questions about yesterdays announcement on the transgender policy by the President, Dunford wrote. There will be no modifications to the current policy until the Presidents direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance, Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters. Dunford then made the assurance that the military would treat all of our personnel with respect.  His message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trumps decision. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force acknowledged that Trumps announcement on Wednesday was unexpected. The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay to allow for a review.  As a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.  His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans. The White House said Trump had extensive discussions with his national security team, and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead. Trump cited tremendous medical costs and disruption as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individuals capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference. The Armys chief of staff, General Mark Milley, said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army. I will be candid. ... This is a complex issue and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it, but this is not clean-cut either way, he said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of  Trumps decision was still being worked out. Separately, the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took. Trumps plan to ban transgender military service members has  unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue. Trumps tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.  But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say. Theres no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military, said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal. It was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to reservists. Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who  resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status. I try to be tough about it, he said, but added: It breaks your spirit down. One active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted. Were scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from, the officer said by phone.  Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with todays military. Our service personnel today dont give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts.

U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, said an investigation is necessary and called Zinkes actions unethical. The congressman will ask the Government Accountability Office, the Interior Departments inspector general or both to investigate, a spokesman said. The Alaska Dispatch News on Thursday reported that Zinke had called Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both Republicans, on Wednesday. He warned them that Murkowskis vote on Tuesday against a motion to begin debate on the healthcare overhaul could have negative consequences for energy and land use in Alaska, the newspaper said. Murkowskis no vote forced Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote to pass the motion by a 51-50 ballot. The call from Zinke followed a phone conversation Murkowski had with Republican President Donald Trump on Tuesday, which she described to E&E News, an energy and environment publication, as very unpleasant.  Murkowski spokeswoman Karina Petersen confirmed that Zinke had called the senator. Threatening to punish your rivals as political blackmail is something wed see from the Kremlin, Grijalva said. Secretary Zinkes willingness to deliver these threats speaks volumes about his ethical standards and demonstrates that Interiors policy positions are up for political grabs, rather than based on science or the public interest. Zinkes office did not respond to requests for comment. His Interior Department oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks such as Yosemite, and deals with energy development on public land and offshore areas. The department deals with policies crucial to Alaskas economy such as oil drilling and control of wildlife areas.

On Friday, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, comprising the chiefs of U.S. financial regulatory agencies, will discuss AIGs designation as a systemically important financial institution, commonly known as one that is too big to fail. In an agenda for the meeting, the council did not say which institution it will discuss.  However, there are only two non-banks designated as so large and interconnected that they would ruin the financial system if they failed - AIG and Prudential Insurance (PRU.N). The labels trigger stricter oversight and greater capital requirements. Trump has ordered a review of the designation process, currently at the heart of a lawsuit involving MetLife Inc. (MET.N), which many expect will lead his administration to rescind the current designations to try to lighten regulation it considers burdensome.  In a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse said Icahn has retained his massive business interests while advising Trump on regulation, including his sizable investment in AIG (AIG.N).  AIG company received a $182 billion taxpayer bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis, which prompted Congress to call for the designations of non-banks in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law as systemically important. Icahn owned a 4.95 percent stake in AIG as of March 31. Concerned about compliance costs, Icahn had publicly pressed AIG to shrink, and tried to convince the FSOC that AIG no longer qualified for the label. Recently though, after AIG sold some assets and appointed a new chief executive, Icahn has not pushed the issue further.      Senators Warren and Whitehouse also noted Icahn met with one current FSOC member, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Jay Clayton, after Clayton was nominated for the position. Given Mr. Icahns recent modification of his position on the breakup of AIG, and his past interactions with administration officials, we write to seek assurances that Mr. Icahn has not provided input on or received information on the pending FSOC decision on AIGs SIFI status, they said. The two senators asked about any FSOC measures to ensure  individuals with an interest in its decisions do not inappropriately influence its members. They also asked if any members are subject to recusal on AIG because of interactions with Icahn, and about any staff-level conversations regarding Icahns investments. AIG declined to comment, and the White House and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. lawmakers reached an agreement on Wednesday paving the way for the U.S. Senate to pass a bill as early as this week to impose the new sanctions on Russia and bar President Donald Trump from easing them without Congress approval. The European Union fears the new U.S. restrictions could be an obstacle to its companies doing business with Russia and threaten the blocs energy supply lines, but the 28-country bloc is divided over how to respond. The head of the German Committee on East European Economic Relations said potential damage to European energy sector companies with business interests in Russia could justify counter-sanctions. Its the last thing we want, but we must keep the option open, Michael Harms told a news conference in Berlin. The sanctions they want against pipeline projects seem designed to boost U.S. energy exports to Europe, create U.S. jobs and strengthen U.S. foreign policy. Unlike the United States, whose growing production of shale gas has slashed its reliance on energy imports, much of Central Europe depends on imports of Russian gas through a vast latticework of pipelines. Imposing sanctions that hit a third party, namely Europe, and at the same time promoting the American economy with the slogan buy American gas - thats pretty striking, said Kurt Bock, chief executive of Germans chemicals giant BASF , which drills for gas in Russia. The EU has imposed its own sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis, and Germany has taken a particularly tough stance towards Moscow. Last week Reuters reported that Germany was urging Brussels to add four more Russian nationals and companies to its blacklist over Siemens gas turbines delivered to Ukraines Crimea region, annexed by Moscow in 2014. German economy minister Brigitte Zyries complained on Thursday that Washington had abandoned the common line it has maintained with Europe over Russia. But despite the EU sanctions and Europes criticism of Moscow on other fronts as well as Ukraine - including allegations that Russian spies are meddling in Western elections  - Russia remains a crucial business partner for Germany. On Thursday, the Committee raised to 20 percent its forecast for growth in German exports to Russia in 2017, compared to 10 percent in its previous forecast.

Putin, speaking on a visit to Finland, was commenting on a vote by the U.S. House of Representatives which on Tuesday decided to impose new sanctions on Moscow and to force President Donald Trump to obtain lawmakers permission before easing any sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions have yet to be approved by the Senate or Trump, and a top White House aide said on Thursday that Trump could veto the legislation in order to push for a tougher deal. Putin, who has repeatedly denied U.S. allegations that Russia interfered with last years U.S. presidential election, said Moscow would only decide on how to retaliate against Washington once it had seen the final text of the proposed law. As you know, we are exercising restraint and patience, but at some moment well have to retaliate. Its impossible to endlessly tolerate this boorishness towards our country, Putin told a joint news conference with his Finnish counterpart. When will our response follow? What will it be? That will depend on the final version of the draft law which is now being debated in the U.S. Senate. Putin also spoke about an ongoing diplomatic row between Moscow and Washington which erupted last December when then U.S. President Barack Obama ordered the seizure of Russian diplomatic property in the United States and the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats. This goes beyond all reasonable bounds, said Putin. And now these sanctions - they are also absolutely unlawful from the point of view of international law. Calling the proposed sanctions extremely cynical, Putin said the demarche looked like an attempt by Washington to use its geopolitical advantages ... to safeguard its economic interests at the expense of its allies. He dismissed Congressional investigations into Russias alleged meddling in last years U.S. presidential election, calling them a symptom of growing anti-Russian hysteria in the United States and a result of U.S. domestic politics.

Bush in 2004 that big U.S. bank mergers were totally out of control and should be stopped as they were forcing businesses to borrow money from foreigners, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Though it is 13 years old, the unsolicited letter from Trump, when he was a New York real estate developer and businessman, to then-Treasury Secretary John Snow sheds some light on Trumps attitudes toward big banks, which he has alternately lambasted and embraced since becoming a politician. As recently as May, Trump said he was looking at breaking up big banks, echoing a campaign theme from 2016. But as president, Trump has also promised to roll back bank regulations, and he has hired Goldman Sachs veterans as close advisers. In the February 2004 letter to Snow, Trump urged the Bush administration to block a historic merger between Wall Street giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank One. Unveiled a month before Trump wrote to Snow, the deal was completed in July 2004. Trump also asked Snow to stop a merger then under way between Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial. It was completed in April 2004, a few months after the Trump letter, which Reuters obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and which has not been previously reported. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter shows that as a businessman and a reality TV celebrity, Trump was worried about bank combinations and businesses relying on foreign lenders. Hopefully, you can do something about this very serious situation - which has gotten totally out of control, Trump wrote. If this present trend continues, there will literally be one bank left in New York and, perhaps, the country. This merger activity has made it almost impossible to deal with these institutions ... and is pushing a tremendous amount of business to foreign banks and lenders, he wrote. A financial disclosure statement released last month showed that Trump owed at least $130 million to a U.S. unit of Germanys Deutsche Bank, a sizable share of his total debts of at least $315 million as of mid-2017. Trump has not released his complete income tax returns, which would give a clearer view of his debts to foreign lenders. Amid a public debate on whether the president could be influenced by his debts to foreigners, Trumps lawyers said in May he does not owe money to Russian lenders. JPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment. Snow also declined to comment. The United States had about 9,000 federally insured banks in 2004. That number was down by about half from 1984, due in part to aggressive buyout activity. By 2017, the number of U.S. banks was down further, to about 6,000, while the share of assets managed by smaller community banks had fallen to 13 percent from 38 percent in 1984.        Before becoming president, Trump had a contentious relationship with commercial banks after a slump in his casino business. In 1990 he owed a combined $4 billion to scores of banks, according to a lawyer whose team led negotiations between Trump and 72 banks to restructure Trumps loans.  The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991 and some of Trumps lenders vowed never to work with him again after failing to recover 100 percent of what they were owed.  But by 2004, Trump was back on the upswing. His television show The Apprentice premiered the month before he sent the letter to Snow. In a hand-written postscript to the letter, Trump wrote: P.S.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved a $68 billion increase in military spending next year with legislation that also provides money to start construction of President Donald Trumps Mexican border wall. The bill increased spending on the U.S. capability to defend itself from foreign missile attacks amid growing concerns about North Koreas increasing capacity to hit the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile after it successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile in July. The money for the wall is dwarfed by the $658.1 billion the bill would provide for the Defense Department, an increase of $68.1 billion above the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $18.4 billion above Trumps budget request.      The House voted 235-192 for the fiscal 2018 spending bill that would provide $1.6 billion for initial construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, which was a centerpiece of Trumps 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats repeatedly have referred to any money for the wall as a poison pill and are likely to try to kill it in the Senate. Congress is up against an Oct. 1 deadline - the start of a new fiscal year - for either passing spending bills or temporarily extending funding at current-year levels to give negotiators more time to come to agreements. Funding for the wall was tucked into a wide-ranging national security appropriations bill at the last minute by Republican leadership, knowing that many House members who oppose the wall would not sink defense spending with a no vote. Trump has argued that a big beautiful wall was needed along the entire southwestern U.S. border and that Mexico would ultimately pay for its construction. Mexico has flatly refused to pay and in recent weeks Trump indicated that there could be portions of the border that are not conducive to a wall. Democrats and many Republicans in Congress have questioned the feasibility and effectiveness of a border wall, with immigration advocacy groups arguing that it would not stem the flow of illegal border crossings and would hurt U.S.-Mexico relations. In interviews in recent weeks with more than a half-dozen Republican senators from states that voted for Trump for president last November, only Ted Cruz of Texas embraced building the wall. Similarly, House Republicans representing districts along the U.S.-Mexico border have expressed opposition to the barrier, which could end up costing well over $21 billion. Representative Nita Lowey, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, called the wall a waste ... that experts confirm is unneeded and ineffective and cuts against our values as Americans. Furthermore, Lowey noted that Pentagon funding would run into a technical problem as it breaches a cap on defense spending by $72 billion. If the bill became law, she said, it actually would trigger across-the-board cuts of 13 percent to every defense account in order to stay within the cap.      The beefed up defense spending would allow the Pentagon to continue military activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and other trouble spots and hire more troops while providing soldiers with a 2.4 percent pay raise. It also would allow the Pentagon to undertake a shopping spree with money to buy ships and submarines, aircraft, tanks and other big-ticket items.   The House-passed bill also includes an increase for Americas nuclear weapons stockpile managed by the Department of Energy, as well as for U.S. Capitol Police following a June 14 shooting that gravely wounded Republican Representative Steve Scalise.       A $825 million increase for the Missile Defense Agency to more than $8.6 billion is more than Trump asked for and includes additional boosters and missile silos for the main system that would defend against an ICBM attack, a program run by Boeing Co.  Missile defense would also gain 14 more THAAD interceptors made by Lockheed Martin Co. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

I do think the Fed can look at being more transparent about those activities and do it in a way that doesnt reduce the effectiveness of those tests, Quarles told a confirmation hearing at the Senate banking committee. If you are clear about what you expect you will get more compliance.  Quarles, a former Wall Street lawyer and U.S. Treasury official, is expected to be confirmed as vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve, a post that will be key to Trumps plan to loosen the leash put on big banks following the 2008 financial crisis. Viewed as an industry-friendly figure who has spoken out in the past against breaking up big banks, Quarles said he would work to simplify the Volcker rule, which bans banks from making speculative bets with their own money. Wall Street has criticized the rule as unworkable, arguing it was impossible for banks to determine when a trade is purely for profit as opposed to creating market liquidity. Quarles told senators that he agreed with former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, who effectively ran banking supervision until he stepped down in February, that some changes to the existing financial rules were needed, including raising the threshold at which banks are labeled systematically important and the level at which stress tests kick in. If confirmed, Quarles will also vote on monetary policy as a member of the Feds board of governors. A previous proponent of using the Taylor Rule, an interest rate forecasting model, to guide interest rate decisions, he told the committee he no longer held that view, putting him in back in line with the central banks current policymakers. I think that the Taylor rule is merely one example of a rule and I am not advocating the adoption of the Taylor rule to guide Fed policy, he said. Quarles was appearing in front of the committee with Joseph Otting, the nominee to be Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks. Opposition senators attacked both mens record in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Otting was a former chief executive of One West, a Californian lender that foreclosed on 36,000 homes after striking a lucrative deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Quarles meanwhile, benefited from government support for troubled and failed banks when he worked at private equity firm Carlyle. Mr. Ottings bank made money by kicking seniors out of their homes and then turned around and said the government made them do it, said Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown. Mr. Quarles bemoaned the role of the government as a player in the financial sector rather than as a referee. Those sentiments would ring a little less hollow had their banks not accepted $2.5 billion from FDIC to protect them from losses. Given that current Senate rules require only a slim majority to approve presidential nominees, neither is expected to face a realistic threat to their confirmation. A spokeswoman for the Senate Banking Committee has declined to comment on how quickly the panel could vote on the pair, but Senate Republicans agreed to stay in session two additional weeks in August with an eye toward working through a backlog of nominees.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions plans to announce soon several criminal investigations into intelligence leaks, news outlets reported on Wednesday, as the countrys top law enforcement official faced mounting criticism from President Donald Trump. The announcement has been in the works for some time and will most likely happen sometime in the next week, Fox News reported, citing an unnamed U.S. official. The Washington Post also reported the planned announcement, citing multiple unnamed officials. The investigations will look at news stories that publicized sensitive intelligence material, according to the reports. Officials at the U.S. Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that Sessions has not aggressively pursued people who leaked intelligence secrets during his time in office, one of a series of criticisms apparently aimed at pushing the former Republican Alabama senator to step down. Trump also said again that he was frustrated that Sessions had recused himself from a federal investigation into possible collusion between Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, but stopped short of saying whether he would fire him. Top Republican lawmakers have rallied to Sessions defense as allies of the attorney general said Trump appeared to be trying to pressure him to quit by repeatedly criticizing him on Twitter and in interviews. The latest apparent leak involved Sessions himself. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Russias ambassador to Washington was overheard via surveillance by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters, including issues important to Moscow, with Sessions during the 2016 presidential race. The newspaper cited current and former U.S. officials familiar with U.S. intelligence intercepts. Earlier this month, a report written by Republican members of the Senates homeland security panel said the Trump administration faced an alarming amount of media leaks that posed potential danger to national security and urged law enforcement officials to step up their investigations.  Separately, Trumps new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, told Fox News on Wednesday he expected Trump would soon announce a plan to stem leaks, adding that there seemed to be some political holdovers from the Obama administration that are not helping. Scaramucci said he recognized it was impossible to eliminate leaks in Washington but added: Were going to try and hit a cultural reset on these leaks not only here in the White House, but Im going to be working with the agencies and the departments to do that. Now one of the big problems here that Im discovering in the (communications) team is that senior people are really the guys doing the leaking and they ask junior people to leak for them, Scaramucci told Fox News in a separate interview later on Wednesday. On Tuesday, he told reporters on Air Force One after Trumps trip to Ohio that he would probably restructure the communications operation at the White House and fire staff if leaks did not cease: If the leaks continue, then Ive got to let everybody go.  Scaramucci said there were no immediate plans to fire anyone else following the resignation of senior assistant press secretary Michael Short earlier on Tuesday. Leaks of classified intelligence that endanger national security have customarily prompted investigations, including by the administration of President Barack Obama, Trumps predecessor.

On Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to call Sessions very weak, prompting questions about whether Sessions, one of Trumps earliest and most vocal supporters during his 2016 presidential campaign, would be forced out. On Wednesday, Sessions entered and left the White House  without speaking to the president and with his status unchanged, while conservative lawmakers in Congress rallied around Sessions, a former senator. A source close to Sessions said he has a spine of steel and plans on remaining in office until he is fired or asked to resign. Trump has kept Sessions at a distance, the source said. The two rarely speak and Sessions has been kept out of meetings.  Trump has said he is frustrated that Sessions recused himself from a federal investigation into possible collusion between Trumps election campaign and Russia and said he would not have appointed him had he known he would do so. At a White House press briefing, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders did not address Sessions job security, but said that Trump and Sessions had not spoken this week. You can be disappointed in someone but still want them to continue to do their job, Sanders said. The president wants the attorney general to focus on his duties as attorney general. In a pair of morning tweets, Trump said Sessions should have named a replacement for Andrew McCabe, the acting director of the FBI. Trump has accused McCabe of having ties to his former presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. The FBI has defended McCabe, saying he did not have conflicts of interests. Trump has since nominated Christopher Wray to be the FBI director. Wray is waiting to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  At a news conference on Tuesday, Trump said he was very disappointed with Sessions. Asked whether Sessions would remain in the cabinet, Trump said, Time will tell.     But Republicans on Capitol Hill and conservative groups have stood by the attorney general.  Senator Lindsey Graham said Trump was acting weak by not following through and firing Sessions. I would fire somebody I did not believe could serve me well rather than trying to humiliate them in public - which is a sign of weakness, Graham tweeted on Wednesday.  Earlier, Graham had praised Sessions as a rock-solid conservative who believes in the rule of law. Sessions is working to keep our streets safe, secure our borders, and enforce our immigration laws, and protect our nation, Senator Tom Cotton said in a statement. Sessions hardline stance on immigration endears him to conservatives. On Tuesday, the Justice Department said it would now withhold grant money from so-called sanctuary cities - communities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.  That move earned Sessions praise from NumbersUSA, a group that advocates limits on immigration. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A proposed border tax in the House of Representatives was killed on Thursday, bringing relief to retailers and other large importers whose profits faced threats and removing a hurdle that had kept negotiations on the long-promised Republican overhaul of the U.S. tax code from advancing. The border adjustment tax was part of a broad reform of the tax code being pushed by House Republican leaders. It was meant to discourage companies from manufacturing products overseas and then importing them into the United States for sale instead of producing goods in the U.S.  The tax would have generated roughly $1 trillion in revenue, allowing tax-code writers to slash the corporate tax rate without increasing the nations deficit. Removing the controversial provision could make it easier to pass tax legislation, but likely narrows the scope of what could become law. It suggests Republicans are more likely to implement simple rate cuts and not accomplish sweeping tax reform on the scale of the last major overhaul in 1986, such as moving to a territorial tax system, in which companies would pay tax only on profits earned in the United States. Without a new source of revenue, it will make it more difficult for Republicans to make tax code changes permanent and deficit-neutral. The Republicans are looking to use rules that would require passage of a tax bill only with a simple majority - meaning they would not need any Democratic votes. Those rules restrict creating long-term deficits, so if the bill is not deficit-neutral the tax cuts would likely carry an expiration date. The group of six Republican negotiators working on tax reform on Thursday did not announce any agreement on their target for corporate rate cuts - a signal that tax lobbyists said shows continuing divisions among Republicans about the closely watched rate.  Corporate profits are currently taxed at 35 percent, but President Donald Trump wants them slashed to 15 percent, which he says will promote business spending, economic growth and job creation.      While we have debated the pro-growth benefits of border adjustability, we appreciate that there are many unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this policy aside in order to advance tax reform, the Big Six Republican tax negotiators said in a joint statement. Large retailers and other importers had lobbied aggressively against the border tax proposal, including a coalition that included automakers like Toyota (7203.T) and stores like Target (TGT.N), Autozone (AZO.N) and Best Buy (BBY.N). The retailers argued that the border tax would drastically increase consumer prices, hitting low- and middle-class households the most. The Big Six is comprised of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council - both representing Trump - House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the heads of the two tax-writing committees in Congress, Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Kevin Brady. In addition to killing the border tax, the group offered other vague goals but no details, saying they remain committed to increased expensing for corporations, or allowing them to write off the cost of new equipment more quickly, and to return profits held by American companies overseas, known as repatriation, at a lower tax rate than the current 35 percent. The statement offered no specific goals or targets on the personal income tax code. We have always been in agreement that tax relief for American families should be at the heart of our plan, the Big Six said. Trump has vowed to finish a tax overhaul by the end of this year. Republicans leaders in Congress are hopeful that the current debate on repealing and replacing Obamacare, which is now before the Senate, can be completed quickly, allowing Congress to then turn its attention to the tax code. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the announcement as progress toward an ultimate goal of overhauling the code.  Were pleased, but were not satisfied until we get an outcome, said Neil Bradley, the head of policy for the business group. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

McCaskill requested for documents and information from opioid manufacturers Mallinckrodt Plc, Endo International Plc, Teva Pharmaceutical and Allergan Plc. In March, McCaskill asked Johnson & Johnson, Mylan NV, Purdue Pharma, Insys Therapeutics Inc and Depomed Inc for internal estimates of the risk of abuse, addiction and overdose of opioids.

McCaskill also requested for information on compensation provided that is in any way derived from revenue or profitability targets for sales of opioid products. We appreciate Senator McCaskills inquiry and look forward to thoughtfully answering her questions, a McKesson spokeswoman said in an email, adding that there was no link between the sale of controlled substances and incentive compensation for the companys executives.      AmerisourceBergen said it would respond to the letter from the Senator, adding it provides daily reports to the regulators about the quantity, type and receiving pharmacy of every single order of controlled substances it distributes.

I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree, Michael Surbaugh wrote in an open letter published on the Scouts website. That was never our intent. He said that every U.S. president, who serves as the Scouts honorary president, has been invited to speak at the national jamborees held every four years since 1937, but that the Scouts were nonetheless steadfastly non-partisan.  We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program, Surbaugh wrote. He said there were 40,000 participants, including Boy Scouts, volunteers, staff and visitors. Trump, a Republican, started his speech before thousands of boys aged 12 to 18 in a West Virginia field on Monday evening lauding hard work and perseverance, then quickly turned to partisan attacks and ridicule of fake media. He attacked Democratic rivals, lambasted the current healthcare law and reminisced about a cocktail party he went to decades ago filled with the hottest people in New York. Trumps speech drew intense criticism from former Scouts, parents of Scouts and others, with many saying the speech was not in keeping with Scout values and inappropriate. While many Scouting families expressed outrage, a few said the reaction was overblown, arguing that exposure to political speech in all forms was an important part of a Scouts development. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she had not seen Surbaughs letter of apology, and said she attended the event. I saw nothing but roughly 40,000 to 45,000 Boy Scouts cheering the president on throughout his remarks and I think they were pretty excited that he was there, Sanders said.

Among the things the Democratic nominee will say happened are sexism against the first woman to be the presidential candidate for a major U.S. party and an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary, according to  publicity material from the publisher, Simon and Schuster.  Staff in Clintons campaign and at Democratic party headquarters saw thousands of their internal emails stolen and published online last year. U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Russian intelligence agencies stole the emails as part of an effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to foil Clintons chances of becoming president.  Putin has denied the charges, and U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed doubt about the conclusion of intelligence agencies he oversees. In a tweet on Thursday, Clinton said, Writing What Happened was hard, so is what we see every day. As we move forward & fight back, I hope this helps.  Clinton has at times faced intense scrutiny by the media and political opponents for more than 25 years since her husband, Bill Clinton, successfully sought the U.S. presidency in 1992. In the past, for reasons I try to explain, Ive often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net, Clinton wrote in the books introduction. Now Im letting my guard down.  Despite polls showing the former secretary of state was expected to triumph in the election last November, Clinton won only 227 electoral college votes to Trumps 304. She won the popular vote by about 2.9 million votes. Since then, she has made a handful of speeches and public appearances while working on the book. In April, she told the Women in the World Summit in New York City that she had no intention of running for another public office and that she was writing a book that, in part, delves into what derailed her attempt to become Americas first woman president. For people who are interested in this, the nearly 66 million people who voted for me, I want to give as clear and as credible an explanation as I can, she said. Clinton has also faulted the manner in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation, under director James Comey, investigated how she managed her email, some of which involved classified information, when she was secretary of state.  Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, told the Washington Post last week, When you lose to somebody who has 40 percent popularity, you dont blame other things  Comey, Russia you blame yourself.

I have to tell you, we dont consider what we are hearing from the president as protectionist, Chief Executive Officer David Abney told Reuters in a phone interview after the worlds largest package delivery company reported a higher-than-expected second-quarter net profit. Protectionist would be we dont want trade agreements and just try to protect the U.S. in that regard, he added. Its much more about having more favorable terms than it is about protectionism. Abneys remarks come as the Trump administration nears the August 16 start of talks with Mexico and Canada to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump has repeatedly called the 1994 trade treaty a disaster that has shuttered U.S. factories and sent American jobs to Mexico. UPS has been expanding its services into Mexico. Ahead of NAFTA negotiations, Abney said UPS has told the Trump administration it wants to take friction out of border crossings to speed them up and modernize the agreement with language about ecommerce. Id be more worried if there were no changes to the deal, he said, adding that NAFTA needs to be modernized. We believe that weve been listened to.  In a conference call with analysts earlier on Thursday, Abney praised a free trade pact Japan and the European Union concluded in early July creating the worlds biggest open economic area. The CEO also reiterated UPS previous strong support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and a desire to see the U.S. enter into trade agreements with its member countries.  The Japan-EU trade deal was interpreted as signaling resistance to what many world leaders see protectionism by Trump. On the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump has championed America First policy positions on trade, promising new or revised deals to boost American manufacturing.  In January, shortly after taking office, Trump formally withdrew America from the TPP. The 12-nation trade deal was negotiated by former Democratic President Barack Obamas administration. UPS on Thursday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly net profit due to rising ecommerce deliveries even as investors worried about the companys performance in the back-half of the year and shares fell 4.6 percent.

The bill would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years.  Automakers and technology companies believe chances are good Congress will approve legislation before year end. They have been pushing for regulations making it easier to deploy self-driving technology, while consumer groups have sought more safeguards. Current federal rules bar self-driving cars without human controls on U.S. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in California are too restrictive.  The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. The House of Representatives will take up the bill when it reconvenes in September, while senators plan to introduce a separate similar measure. Our aim was to develop a regulatory structure that allows for industry to safely innovate with significant government oversight, said Representative Greg Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Initially, authors proposed to allow automakers and others to sell up to 100,000 vehicles immediately. Representative Frank Pallone said the phase-in period was essential so millions of exempted cars will not hit our roads all at once. Manufacturers must demonstrate self-driving cars winning exemptions are at least as safe as existing vehicles. Under the House proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards. Automakers praised committee passage, while Consumer Watchdog privacy director John Simpson said preempting state laws leaves us at the mercy of manufacturers as they use our public highways as their private laboratories. General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others have been lobbying for legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars. Consumer advocates want more changes, including giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars. The issue has taken on new urgency since U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual jump since 1966.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/MOSCOW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers reached an agreement on Wednesday paving the way for the U.S. Senate to pass a bill as soon as this week to impose new sanctions on Russia and bar President Donald Trump from easing sanctions on Moscow without Congress approval. Earlier on Wednesday, Russia warned it was edging closer to retaliation against Washington after the House of Representatives backed new U.S. sanctions on Moscow, while the European Union said the move  might affect its energy security and it stood ready to act too. I am glad to announce that we have reached an agreement that will allow us to send sanctions legislation to the presidents desk, Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday evening. He said the Senate would move to approve sanctions on Russia and Iran that it originally passed in mid-June, as well as sanctions on North Korea developed by the House of Representatives and included in a bill the House passed overwhelmingly on Wednesday. Before the latest agreement, some senators had objected to the North Korea measures and it had looked like the sanctions bill, already delayed since mid-June, could languish into September. If the bill passes the Senate as expected, it would be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. It is, however, expected to garner enough support to override a Trump veto. The House voted 419-3 on Tuesday to impose new sanctions on Moscow and force Trump to obtain lawmakers approval before easing any punitive measures on Russia. This is rather sad news from the point of view of Russia-U.S. ties, said Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman. We are talking about an extremely unfriendly act. He said President Vladimir Putin would decide if and how Moscow would retaliate once the sanctions became law. Russias deputy foreign minister warned the move was taking bilateral relations into uncharted waters, killing off hopes of improving them in the near future. Trump, whose presidency has been embroiled in a distracting dispute over his associates alleged ties to Moscow, is on the defensive over accusations Russia helped elect him last year. He has said he wants to mend relations with Russia that are languishing at a post-Cold War low. Trump had denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Most White House watchers believe Trump will reluctantly sign off on the new sanctions, given deep support for them among U.S. lawmakers and his desire to avoid being accused of being soft on Moscow. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Trump would have little choice. The Senate passed a version of the legislation, without the North Korea sanctions, on June 15 by 98-2.  I think the president will sign it, Royce said on NBCs Meet the Press Daily on Wednesday. The issue has rattled Russia, which fears that its economy, weakened by 2014 Western sanctions imposed over its role in the Ukraine crisis, will now find it harder to recover and grow. Foreign investors could be scared off. The European Union frets that new U.S. restrictions could pose obstacles to its companies doing business with Russia and threaten the blocs energy supply lines. The Kremlins alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is one reason lawmakers have pushed for the new sanctions. Peskov said Moscow would wait until the sanctions became law before fully analyzing them and deciding how to respond.   Moscow had hoped that Trump, who made upbeat statements about Putin before winning the White House, would work to repair the U.S.-Russia relationship. But it has watched with frustration as the vote-meddling allegations killed off hopes of any detente. The Russian Foreign Ministry said this month that too many American spies were operating in Russia under diplomatic cover and it might expel some to retaliate for the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats last year by then-President Barack Obamas administration. Many Russian politicians increasingly believe Trumps political foes and Congress have left the U.S. president with little room for maneuver on Russia and they have nothing to lose by retaliating. In Brussels, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU was ready to act within a matter of days if it felt the new U.S. sanctions undermined the blocs energy security. Brussels fears the new sanctions will damage European firms and oil and gas projects on which the EU is dependent. The Russia section of the bill includes sanctions on a range of industries. Several provisions target Russian energy, with new limits on U.S. investment in Russian companies. U.S. firms also would be barred from participating in energy exploration projects where Russian firms have a stake of 33 percent or higher. The bill includes sanctions on foreign firms investing in or helping Russian energy exploration, although the president could waive those sanctions. The bill would give the Trump administration the option of imposing sanctions on firms helping develop Russian export pipelines, such as the Nord Stream 2 pipeline carrying natural gas to Europe, in which German companies are involved. In a concession to allies, those sanctions are optional, not mandatory. The European Commission said a number of EU concerns had been taken into account in the most recent version of the bill, but said it could lead to sanctions on any company, including European, that worked on Russian energy export pipelines.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia risks being saddled with U.S. sanctions for decades, curbing economic growth and preventing it from regaining its status as a leading economic power, an adviser to President Vladimir Putin said in an interview. Alexei Kudrin told Reuters that the current proposed tightening of sanctions in Washington should not have any serious impact. But he called for a major structural reform program after the 2018 presidential election. He said that was the only way for Russia to return to growth of more than 2 percent a year. Putin has not yet said whether he will run for re-election next year, but is widely expected to do so and to win what would be a fourth term as president. Putin has tasked Kudrin, who has known Putin since they worked together in the St Petersburg Mayors Office in the 1990s, with devising a strategy to lift Russian economic growth after 2018. Whereas Putin oversaw several years of growth in excess of 5 percent in his early presidential terms, the Russian economy suffered two years of contraction in 2015 and 2016 and is forecast to grow by a little over 1 percent this year. In May GDP rose by 3.1 percent year on year, but that pace is not expected to last. The slowdown has put Putin under pressure. U.S. lawmakers earlier this week voted to impose new sanctions on Russia  on top of earlier penalties over its role in the Ukraine conflict  and Kudrin said the mood in Washington meant it would be difficult for U.S. President Donald Trump to ease sanctions in future. In its current form the tightening of sanctions under discussion wouldnt seriously affect the Russian economy, there arent serious changes with the version that exists. But the hope that sanctions would be canceled in the coming years has now faded, Kudrin said. We are likely to end up with the story with the old Jackson-Vanik amendment  even when all the conditions had already changed, they couldnt cancel it, he said. Jackson-Vanik, a 1974 provision to a U.S. federal law that punished former Communist bloc countries for restricting human rights, was only repealed in 2012 under previous U.S. President Barack Obama. It was a major sticking point in relations between Moscow and Washington. Trump was widely perceived to be the Kremlins favored candidate in last years U.S. presidential race, and his White House victory raised hopes in Moscow that sanctions could be relaxed as early as this year. But Trumps administration has since become bogged down in investigations into possible ties between his campaign and Russia. Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia, which flatly denies allegations it meddled in the U.S. vote. Kudrin, who served as finance minister from 2000 to 2011, won praise from foreign investors for building up Russias formidable fiscal buffers during an era of high oil prices. He  was one of relatively few liberal voices among top officials. He now heads the Centre for Strategic Research, an analytical group founded on Putins initiative to draft policy ideas. Kudrin said Western sanctions in their current configuration were knocking off around 0.5 percent from Russian gross domestic product, down from 1 percent in the year after they were introduced in 2014. Russia had a window of opportunity after the 2018 election in which to enact meaningful reforms to counteract the effects of sanctions, he said. But for now a populist camp around Putin appeared to have the upper hand over those calling for reform. To what extent the president will use that [window], we dont know, Kudrin said. After previous elections that window for reforms wasnt used. Among the reforms Kudrin is calling for are greater public control over law enforcement officials, raising the retirement age, reducing government stakes in large companies, and improving revenue collection from the shadow economy. He said he thought the state should sell government stakes in Russian oil companies in stages over the next six to 10 years, and that it could sell a portion of its majority holding in the countrys largest bank Sberbank in the same time period. With such reforms, Kudrin said Russia could increase its economic growth rate to 3-4 percent in five to six years, even with sanctions staying in place. Without reforms, Russia will not notice the damage from sanctions before it is too late, he said. In the next six to seven years we could not notice the decline in the areas of productivity and technological development. In the end we will see it, because others will grow faster, but by then it will be difficult to change something. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would ban transgender people from the U.S. military, a move appealing to some in his conservative political base but creating uncertainty about the fate of thousands of transgender service members. The surprise announcement by Trump, who as a presidential candidate last year vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people, came in a series of morning Twitter posts. It drew condemnation from rights groups and some lawmakers in both parties as politically motivated discrimination but was praised by conservative activists and some Republicans. The administration has not determined whether transgender individuals already serving in the military would be immediately thrown out, a point the White House and Pentagon have yet to decide, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. A transgender ban would reverse Democratic former President Barack Obamas policy and halts years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service based on sexual orientation or gender identity. After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military, Trump tweeted, without naming any of the generals or experts. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail, he said. Sanders said Trump had extensive discussions with his national security team, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president made the decision on Tuesday. This was about military readiness, Sanders told a briefing. This was about unit cohesion. This was about resources within the military, and nothing more. The Pentagon earlier referred questions about Trumps decision to the White House. Critics said the health costs of caring for transgender service members were a tiny portion of the militarys healthcare budget and Trumps policy change was based on prejudice. His action unleashed a torrent of legal threats from civil liberties advocates seeking plaintiffs willing to challenge the ban in court and sparked a protest by hundreds who rallied outside an armed forces recruiting station in Manhattans Times Square. We are in a crisis. This is a dark day for everyone, Brad Hoylman, New Yorks sole openly gay state senator, said as he addressed the crowd, which carried Resist signs amid chants of: Hey-hey, ho-ho, Donald Trump has got to go. Trumps tweet caught some White House officials by surprise.  A senior administration official said Trump had been determined to act for a while but the question was the timing, with advisers split on whether to conduct reviews before announcing the move. The announcement at least temporarily changed the subject in Washington, where Trumps administration faces investigations into his presidential campaigns contacts with Russia and has struggled to win major legislative victories. It was not the first time Trump has targeted transgender people since taking office in January. In February, he rescinded protections for transgender students put in place by Obama that had let them use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman John McCain - the most prominent military veteran in Congress, who was a Navy pilot and prisoner of war during the Vietnam War - called Trumps announcement unclear and inappropriate until a Pentagon study on the issue is completed and reviewed by Mattis, the military leadership and lawmakers. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council advocacy group, was among those praising Trump, saying, Our troops shouldnt be forced to endure hours of transgender sensitivity classes and politically correct distractions. Under Obama, the Pentagon last year announced it was ending its ban on transgender people serving openly, calling the prohibition outdated. The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay in that step. Transgender service members already number about 2,500 active-duty personnel, with about 1,500 more in the military reserves, according to a RAND Corporation think tank study cited last year by Obamas defense secretary, Ash Carter. To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military, Carter said on Wednesday, noting the existing ranks of transgender individuals serving capably and honorably. Advocacy groups said Trumps policy was open to legal challenge under the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of equal protection under the law. American Civil Liberties Union attorney Joshua Block said Trump had rejected the basic humanity of transgender service members. There are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with allowing trans people to fight for their country, Block said. The president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country. The House of Representatives top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, noted that a Pentagon-commissioned study determined the cost of providing medically necessary transition-related care involving transgender service members would amount to about one-100th of 1 percent of the militarys healthcare budget.  The study put the cost at $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year of the more than $50 billion the Defense Department spends on healthcare. Once again, President Trump has shown his conduct is driven not by honor, decency, or national security, but by raw prejudice, Pelosi said. Retired Colonel Sheri Swokowski, 67, the highest-ranking openly transgender veteran, joined the criticism.  Transgender people are serving today knowing that their leader frankly doesnt trust them, she said. The bottom line is that this does great harm to people who simply want to serve their country. U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican whose son is transgender, said on Twitter: No American, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be prohibited from honor + privilege of serving our nation. Transgender celebrity Caitlyn Jenner defended patriotic transgender Americans in the military and asked Trump on Twitter, What happened to your promise to fight for them? Canadas military also took to Twitter on Wednesday to say it welcomes citizens of all sexual orientations and gender identities, adding the hashtag #DiversityIsOurStrength. But Vicky Hartzler, a Republican congresswoman, praised Trump for changing Obamas costly and damaging policy. The U.S. militarys ban on gays serving openly in the armed forces ended under Obama in 2011 after Congress passed legislation in 2010 reversing a law dubbed dont ask, dont tell that had forced the ouster of thousands of service members and others to hide their sexual orientation. The Pentagon under Obama also opened all combat roles in the military to women. The U.S. military at times has been in the vanguard of social progress. Trumps action came on the 69th anniversary of Democratic President Harry Truman racially integrating the armed forces, years before the 1950s and 1960s civil rights battles.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senate leaders, struggling to keep a seven-year promise to end Obamacare, turned their focus on Wednesday to passing a slimmed-down skinny repeal measure that would throw the issue into negotiations with the House of Representatives. The last-ditch effort came after senators voted 55-45 against a straight repeal of Obamacare, which would have provided for a two-year delay in implementation to give Congress time to work out a replacement. Seven Republicans opposed the measure. It was the Senates second failure in 24 hours to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which expanded health insurance to about 20 million people, many of them low-income. On Tuesday, senators rejected the repeal-and-replace plan Republicans had worked on since May. The failures underscored the partys deep divisions on the role of government in helping provide access to healthcare as the Senate conducted its second day of a freewheeling debate that could stretch through the week. Republicans said they were still working out what would be in a skinny repeal, which could simply eliminate mandates requiring individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance, and abolish a tax on medical device manufacturers. Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said the party was trying to figure out what the traffic will bear, in terms of getting 50 of our members to vote for things that will repeal as much of Obamacare as possible. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate. Any Senate legislation would be enough to kick the issue to a special negotiating committee with the House, which passed its own version in May. If that panel can agree on a new bill, the full House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, would again have to approve the legislation - a process that could last months. I think people would look at it not necessarily based on its content, but as a forcing mechanism to cause the two sides of the building to try to solve it together, Republican Senator Bob Corker said. Thats going to be the last chance. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters there was growing support for a slimmed-down approach that would kick the can to negotiators. I think there is plenty of agreement, he said. President Donald Trump has come down hard on his fellow Republicans for failing to act on Obamacare, something he promised repeatedly to repeal and replace in his election campaign last year. Some Senate Republicans were growing uncomfortable with the chaotic debate. Weve got to have a more organized process, Republican Senator Ron Johnson said, noting the skinny repeal would simply delay acting on the core issue. We just dont have the courage and really the intestinal fortitude to suck it up and ... do this right. Late on Wednesday, only 10 senators voted for a largely symbolic amendment stating lawmakers commitment to preserve a part of Obamacare that helped states expand the governments Medicaid insurance program for the poor to cover a wider net of people.  Democrats refused to approve any amendment to a bill they dislike and the vote primarily highlighted deep divisions among Republicans. The amendment was introduced by Senator Dean Heller, who faces a tough re-election fight in Nevada next year, and supported by Senators Susan Collins, John McCain and other party moderates who have expressed skepticism about the repeal-and-replace process. Trump attacked one of those senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, by name in an early morning tweet on Wednesday. Murkowski, one of two party members who voted on Tuesday against opening debate on a bill to end Obamacare, told MSNBC she was not worried about the political fallout. Every day shouldnt be about winning elections. How about just doing a little bit of governing around here? she said. Healthcare industry organizations are similarly troubled and have urged a more bipartisan effort. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents health insurers across the country, said that if the individual mandate is repealed, it must be replaced with incentives for people to buy health insurance and keep it year-round. The mandate is considered critical to helping hold down the cost of premiums, because it means that healthy people as well as the sick, who incur high medical costs, buy insurance. The group also said the government needed to fund subsidies for medical expenses and provide funds to cover high-cost patients. Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), a health insurer with more than 1 million customers in Obamacare individual insurance plans, threatened to further shrink its 2018 market participation because of uncertainty about the government paying for the subsidies that make the plans affordable for millions of Americans.

Grover Norquist, head of the anti-tax Americans for Tax Reform and a lobbyist close to Republican leaders, said a Big Six group of Republican tax decision-makers was targeting the end of this month for producing a basic framework for a bill to be introduced in September.  The House, the White House and the Senate have been meeting for a couple months. Theyll have a package in September, said Norquist, a conservative tax and small-government activist who has met with Big Six members. The group met on Wednesday evening and two members who emerged 45 minutes later said they were united on tax principles but offered no comment on whether they had agreed to a framework. Were all on one page, on one unified page, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said.  House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady also told reporters there was unity and to expect a statement in coming days. Central to the discussion is the 35 percent corporate income tax rate, how much it can be cut and whether a cut can be made permanent. The White House wants to slash the rate to 15 percent for seven years, while congressional Republicans are trying to settle on a permanent rate that does not increase the deficit. President Donald Trump and his representatives on the Big Six - Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin - are really excited about the 15 percent rate for corporations, Norquist said. The congressional Big Six members are Brady, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch. Norquist has played a key role in tax negotiations in Washington for years.  Trump is insisting on lowering the tax rate for pass-through businesses, now taxed at the top individual tax code rate, to 15 percent, Norquist said. The Big Six agree that Trumps 15 percent corporate rate cannot be achieved on a permanent basis without adding to the federal deficit, administration officials said.   Such a steep tax rate cut would mean a revenue loss of more than $2 trillion over a decade, independent analysts say.  To solve the deficit issue, the White House is open to making the 15 percent rate temporary, with an expiration in seven years, Norquist said. That would conflict with Republicans in Congress who want a permanent tax overhaul, but it would ensure rates would not have to be renewed during Trumps presidency. Mnuchin said on Wednesday morning that the administration would be sensitive to increasing the debt. We are very close to releasing a detailed plan and I can assure you that we believe that detailed plan will be responsible on the impact on the economy and the cost to the debt, he said. Under current law, companies adhere to complex depreciation schedules for how long it takes for equipment to wear out and lose value. Business groups have called for 100 percent expensing, a policy that would let companies write off the entire price of equipment in the year of purchase. Former President Barack Obama pushed for temporary 100 percent expensing as a economic stimulus to help reverse the recession when he took office.  The White House is considering a three-year window to allow 100 percent expensing, Norquist said. After the three years, the rate would return to 50 percent, which is the current law.

Officials have not reached an agreement on whether to proceed with a recommendation to President Donald Trump and his senior leadership, but there is a feeling that some action is necessary in reaction to the move by Egypt, the official told Reuters. U.S. aid to Egypt has long been sacrosanct. Egypt is one of Washingtons closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid and about $200 million in economic assistance annually. We told them over and over again dont do this, that they are putting at risk U.S. aid, but they did it anyway, the official said. Were figuring out how to respond. The discussions involve cutting off a portion of American aid, not all of it, the official said. The Egyptian law restricts NGO activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to give years for non-compliance. Egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. The government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. In May, when the law was issued after being ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, U.S. senators criticized it. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham called it draconian legislation and they said the U.S. Congress should in response strengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on U.S. assistance for Egypt.  U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, and nine other senators sent Trump a letter on June 19 urging the president to press Sisi on the issue. The U.S. Congress will take the Egyptian governments recent actions into consideration as we review our bilateral assistance to Egypt to ensure that the American peoples tax dollars are used appropriately, the letter said. U.S. President Barack Obama froze aid to Egypt for two years after Sisi, then a general, overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursis rule. Trump has been intent on rebooting the bilateral relationship with Sisi and building on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September. Trump gave Sisi firm backing and vowed to work together to fight Islamist militants when Sisi visited the White House in April. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trumps surprise tweets did not make clear when a ban reversing former President Barack Obamas policy would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join. But if the U.S. Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight,  legal experts say. Theres no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military, said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal. They are currently serving without a problem. There hasnt been an extraordinary cost. There hasnt been disruption. Experts say singling out transgender people would violate their rights to equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Joshua Block at the American Civil Liberties Union said his inbox was flooded with emails about Trumps ban, including from service members. I think the most important thing for people to understand is that for the immediate future, nothing can happen to them ... Trumps tweet is not self-executing, said Block, a senior staff attorney on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues. Under Obama, the Defense Department declared in June 20016 that transgender people could serve openly in the armed forces. The Pentagon was considering a second step of allowing openly transgender people to enlist when Trump on Wednesday issued three tweets saying transgender people would not be allowed to serve any capacity in the military, citing disruptions and medical costs. The Pentagon referred all questions to the White House, where press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump made the decision in consultation with his national security team and that the Defense Department would work with the White House and take the lead on a lawful implementation.  Sarah Warbelow, the Human Rights Campaigns legal director, said Trumps declaration amounted to discrimination on the basis of sex and identity, and was therefore open to legal challenge. The courts do provide quite a bit of deference to the military in determining its own policies, she said. However, that doesnt mean the military is above the law. But the Pentagon may have a clearer path to a ban should it merely prevent new transgender recruits from signing up. If the ban applies only to those seeking to enlist, the legal bar would be higher because the military already has wide leeway to exclude classes of people based on medical needs, Block said. If Trump did want to remove all existing transgender servicemembers from the ranks, it was unclear what legal mechanism he could use to forcibly discharge U.S. troops. If transgender people disclosed their identity as a result of the Obama policy and that policy is then changed, they would have a legal recourse should they be arbitrarily denied their jobs and benefits, Davidson said. Even those seeking to enlist might allege the government banned transgender individuals in an arbitrary way and without good reason. But at least one legal expert said a challenge would be difficult to mount because courts typically defer to the government on military matters. Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School, said even if discharged transgender service members asked for military reviews of their cases and won, those decisions could be overturned by the secretaries of the four branches of the military, who are political appointees. It would difficult to convince federal courts to reverse the secretaries, Fidell said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

(Reuters) - After 13 years of military service that included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew felt crushed on Wednesday by President Donald Trumps decision to ban transgender soldiers. The sergeant first class, who transitioned to living as a man while on active duty, said getting kicked out of the military two years before his planned retirement could mean losing many of his pension and healthcare benefits, and even harm his chances of being hired again. Why serve a country that doesnt want me? It breaks my heart, to be honest, said St. Andrew, 37, of Indianapolis. Despite the devastating effect Trumps move could have on him, he said he was more concerned about younger soldiers who were earlier in their careers and transition. You pull that rug out from under them after they have this false sense of security, that could really throw them into a downward spiral, he said.  The Republican presidents announcement, made through a series of Twitter posts, upended years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Just last year, the Pentagon ended a prohibition keeping transgender people from serving openly. Trump, who cited tremendous medical costs and disruption  for the ban, did not specify how it would be implemented. It remained unclear whether the policy would apply to existing transgender service members or new transgender recruits.  The presidents action was condemned by rights groups and some lawmakers in both parties, who called it discrimination with purely political motives. The move was praised by conservative activists and some Republicans. I have a lot of service members that are scared that their careers are over with, said Navy Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann, who leads a support organization working with actively serving transgender military members. Right now, they still have their jobs and we will continue to work to make sure that policy doesnt change. The Pentagon said only that it was working on developing guidance following Trumps tweets. St. Andrew said he did not know he was transgender when he enlisted, eager to serve his country after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. After an impoverished childhood in a small town in Michigan, he wanted to give back to the nation whose welfare system had kept him clothed and fed. Several years into his military service, he began reflecting on his gender identity. He said he struggled with the anxiety that accompanied the fear of being outed and losing his job. They pound into you this thing of selfless service, he said. So you do that for a few years, and then you come out socially or to a few close people and that gives you some relief, but you still have to hide what you are. He said he received support from his commanders and peers through his transition and found that few accommodations were needed. He already was discreet in changing facilities and had trained for the male physical fitness requirements. Still, anticipating changes like Trumps ban coming, St. Andrew resigned from full-time service after the November election. He now wonders if his part-time reservist status is in jeopardy. I try to be tough about it, he said, but added: It breaks your spirit down. Transgender people are serving today knowing that their leader frankly doesnt trust them, said retired Colonel Sheri Swokowski, 67, of Windsor, Wisconsin, the highest-ranking openly transgender veteran. The bottom line is that this does great harm to people who simply want to serve their country. Sergeant Sam Hunt, an electrician serving in the Nevada Army National Guard, said people had long referred to him as a man. He thought he could serve openly as such after former Democratic President Barack Obama lifted the transgender ban. Earlier this month, he learned that the Department of Defense had approved his transition to male from female.

Healey, a Democrat who has been part of a loose coalition of state officials mounting court challenges to President Donald Trumps administration, said the Monday ruling on civil immigration detainer requests, the first to cover a full state, showed the power of state-level challenges. We may see in other courts efforts to draw from that, Healey said in a interview in her office. In this age of some really adverse actions and a lot of fear-mongering, frankly, by Donald Trump and (U.S. Attorney General) Jeff Sessions and others, it is important to make clear what the law here is and that no one is above the law. The Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement, threatening to deport the estimated 12 million people who have entered the country illegally, contending they raise crime rates and drain government resources. The federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has asked local police and courts to hold illegal immigrants who enter the justice system for up to 48 hours after their cases conclude to allow them to be taken into custody. Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that because the detainer requests are civil, rather than criminal, the detentions amount to unconstitutional arrests. ICE said it was determining what next steps it might take after the ruling, saying it weakens local law enforcement agencies ability to protect their communities. Healey said her office is preparing instructions for court officials and local law enforcement on responding to the detainer requests. She dismissed the idea that the decision endangered public safety, saying the state continues to hold illegal immigrants who are wanted for criminal proceedings. Keeping up federal focus on the issue, Sessions said on Tuesday the Justice Department would block federal grants to sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with immigration agents, including detainer requests. Healey said the move would not change state policy. Its wrong, its unlawful and well see them in court if they intend to proceed on this front, she said. This reflects a callous disregard for the rule of law and for governance and for what it takes to run our cities our states and indeed our country.

Edwin Pawlowski, a Democrat who is running for a fourth term, was one of five people accused of bribery, extortion, wire fraud and other charges in two indictments that included a total of 73 counts. Seven others have already pleaded guilty in the probe. Wednesdays new defendants include Vaughn Spencer, 70, a Democrat who previously served as the first black mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania. Pawlowski and Spencer essentially put a for sale sign on City Hall and sold out to the highest bidder, said Louis Lappen, the acting U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, at a news conference on Wednesday. At his own news conference, Pawlowski called that accusation fiction and vowed to keep running for reelection. I want to make it clear to everyone: I have done nothing wrong, nor have I ever accepted a dime beyond my salary, he said. In no way, shape or form was City Hall ever up for sale. Pawlowski, who has also run unsuccessfully for governor and U.S. Senate, is accused of accepting more than $150,000 in contributions to his various campaigns from vendors with the understanding they would receive city contracts in exchange. The mayor sought to cover up the scheme by deleting emails, instructing his campaign aides to do the same and sweeping his office for listening devices installed by law enforcement, the indictment said. Spencer, meanwhile, was charged with a similar scheme in which he allegedly directed a contract to a donors engineering firm. He is also accused of agreeing to bribe the city council president in exchange for repealing campaign finance limits.  A lawyer for Spencer, Geoffrey Johnson, said he intends to vigorously defend against these charges but declined to comment further, saying he was still reviewing the indictment. The separate schemes outlined in the two indictments included some of the same players. James Hickey, a business consultant, was named in both indictments, while Michael Fleck, who previously pleaded guilty, served as campaign manager for both mayors. A lawyer for Hickey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Charges against Pawlowski had been expected. Earlier this year, Allentowns former managing director pleaded guilty as part of the investigation and implicated Pawlowski in a $3 million bid-rigging scheme to benefit a campaign donor.

Maintaining U.S. creditworthiness is of the utmost importance and the United States must pay its bills on time, Mnuchin told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee. As Ive suggested in the past, based upon our best estimate at the time, we do have funding through September, but I have urged Congress to take this up before they leave for the recess, Mnuchin said. However there was little sign Congress would heed Mnuchins call, at least for the moment. The House of Representatives is due to start its recess on Friday with no hint of movement on the issue, while the Senate is consumed with trying to pass a healthcare overhaul bill. That could leave the debt limit unaddressed until Congress returns on Sept. 5, perhaps one month before the Treasury runs a real risk of not being able to pay all of its obligations.   The last extension of the federal borrowing limit expired in March with total debt of around $20 trillion, but the Treasury has extended its ability to issue debt by employing extraordinary cash management measures, including deferring reinvestments in federal employee pension funds. But short-term Treasury bill markets have grown nervous about the potential for the Treasury to exhaust its borrowing capacity by mid-October, sending yields higher and crushing demand for a recent 3-month bill auction. The situation is costing taxpayers money and stoking market uncertainty, said Mnuchin, a former banker and Hollywood film financier.  Right now effectively, as opposed to borrowing in the market at lower rates, were borrowing and making our trust funds whole at slightly higher rates, so there is a real cost to doing that, he said. Theres also an implied cost of uncertainty into the market. And the longer we wait, that more that uncertainty will be. Senator James Lankford, a Republican, said at the hearing that his best estimate, derived through working with Treasury officials, was that the use of extraordinary measures would amount to about $2.5 billion, largely because the government would have to cover interest owed to the affected pension funds. Mnuchin did not dispute that estimate. Lawmakers showed varying levels of concern on Capitol Hill this week as the Senate focused on trying to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Right now, my focus is Obamacare, said Senator Ted Cruz when asked on Tuesday if the lack of action on the debt limit was a concern. Cruz led fellow Republicans in 2013 to demand spending cuts as part of a fiscal fight that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown. Another fiscal conservative senator, David Perdue, said however he would prefer that Congress stay in session in August to deal with raising the debt ceiling, adding: Weve just got to get it done. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to pass a debt ceiling increase but does not have timing nailed down, a spokesman said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

A week after certifying Iran as complying with the 2015 agreement negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama, Trump made clear to thousands of raucous supporters that he remains extremely wary of Tehran. Trump administration officials, briefing reporters last week, said new economic sanctions against Iran were being prepared over its ballistic missile program and for contributing to regional tensions.  Trump devoted part of his speech in Youngstown, Ohio, to Iran. If that deal doesnt conform to what its supposed to conform to, its going to be big, big problems for them. That I can tell you. Believe me, Trump said. You would have thought they would have said thank you United States. We really love you very much. Instead, theyve become emboldened. That wont take place much longer, he said. Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday he would be surprised if Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal when recertification comes up again in three months.  Well talk about the subject in 90 days but I would be surprised if they were in compliance, he told the Journal in an interview. Fresh from a rare legislative victory in Washington when the Senate voted to start a debate on repealing Obamacare, Trump called on Democrats to end their opposition to his efforts but doubted they would. Its time for Democrats to stop resisting. Thats their term, resist, resist. They have to do finally whats right for the American people, but probably well do it ourselves, he said. Trump used his speech to revisit some of the themes that helped him to his improbable victory in the presidential election in November. He railed against radical Islamic terrorists and vowed he wanted to keep them from entering the United States after the total devastation he said they had caused in Europe. We only want to admit those into our country who share our values, Trump said. Trump came to Ohio amid a simmering feud with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and facing a prolonged investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election. He cast himself as an anti-establishment figure fighting entrenched special interests in Washington, a point that his wife, Melania Trump, stressed when she introduced him on stage. Washington has fought him every step of the way, but I know my husband and he will never give up, she said. Throughout the crowd were reminders of the campaign from chants of drain the swamp to CNN sucks. Several protesters were ejected, including a youth waving a Soviet-style flag. Boy, hes a young one, Trump said. Hes going back home to mommy. And I bet mommy voted for us. Trump rejected criticism that he has a style as president that is not politically correct. He routinely draws criticism for his tweets. Id say with the exception of the late great Abraham Lincoln, I can be more presidential than any president thats held this office, he said. But we have to move a little faster than that. We will never be beholden to the lobbyists or the special interests. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House Domestic Policy Council (DPC) is taking the lead on a decision about how many refugees to admit to the United States next year, two current and three former officials said, a move that may empower those who wish to reduce immigration. The council, which reports to U.S. President Donald Trumps senior adviser for policy Stephen Miller, an architect of Trumps initial travel ban, is adopting a role traditionally handled by National Security Council and State Department officials. The shift may strengthen the hand of officials who, like Trump himself, wish to cut the number of refugees resettled in the United States, against foreign policy experts who view the issue through an international humanitarian lens and say taking them in is vital to getting others to keep their borders open. The bureaucratic maneuver appears to be part of a wider Washington fight over steps that the Trump administration has taken to limit immigration to the United States. These include two Trump executive orders, both challenged in court, temporarily banning most refugees from entering as well as most visits by citizens of six Muslim-majority nations; an internal debate over the cost of resettling refugees; and a crackdown on illegal immigration. By law, the president must tell Congress before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year how many refugees he believes need to be resettled in the United States in the next year. It is not known how many refugees Trump will decide to admit. The DPCs enhanced role may reflect a White House tendency to view the issue through a political prism given Trumps focus in his 2016 election campaign on curbing immigration and its popularity with his base, the current and former officials said. They see it as continuation of a campaign issue about keeping America safe rather than as a humanitarian issue about helping people who were fleeing persecution and war overseas, said one former official who spoke on condition of anonymity. In his original Jan. 27 executive order, Trump said some people admitted as refugees have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes and called for tighter vetting. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter, he added.     Critics argue refugees are the most heavily vetted group to come to the United States and highly unlikely to pose a threat. The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment. Miller was the keynote speaker at a 2015 awards ceremony of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group which aims to limit immigration. DPC member John Zadrozny has worked for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to lower immigration to a level that more closely reflects past policy. In both his travel ban executive orders, Trump has ordered the United States to accept a maximum of 50,000 refugees for permanent resettlement in the fiscal 2017 year ending Sept. 30, less than half the 110,000 President Barack Obama authorized. That would be the lowest level of refugee resettlement in the United States since fiscal 2007, when 48,282 were admitted. As of July 21, the United States had taken in 50,334 so far in fiscal 2017, according to official data. (For a graphic of U.S. refugee admissions see: tmsnrt.rs/2h0PQRC) However, it would track with the original guideline set by the Refugee Act of 1980, which capped admissions at 50,000 for fiscal 1980, 1981 and 1982 unless the president found more were justified on humanitarian or other national interest grounds. From fiscal 1983, the 50,000 cap did not apply. Proponents argue that the United States needs to take in refugees for many reasons, not least to help make the case to states such as Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon accepting hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees to keep their borders open. There has been so much talk recently of the alleged security implications of letting refugees in, but the administration doesnt seem fully cognizant of the national security implications of keeping refugees out, said Rebecca Heller of the International Refugee Assistance Project, which sued to block Trumps travel ban executive orders. Our allies in the Middle East, on whom we depend in the partnership to defeat (the Islamic State group), rely on U.S. refugee resettlement to relieve the strain placed by refugees on their domestic infrastructure, she added.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans narrowly agreed on Tuesday to open debate on a bill to end Obamacare, but the partys seven-year effort to roll back Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law still faces significant hurdles. The Senate deadlocked 50-50 on moving forward with the healthcare debate, forcing Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. Senator John McCain, who was diagnosed this month with brain cancer and has been recovering from surgery at home in Arizona, made a dramatic return to the U.S. Capitol to cast a crucial vote in favor of proceeding. The outcome was a huge relief for President Donald Trump, who had pushed his fellow Republicans hard in recent days to live up to the partys campaign promises to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Minutes after the vote, Trump called it a big step. But the narrow victory on a simple procedural matter raised questions about whether Republicans can muster the votes necessary to pass any of the various approaches to repeal. Moderates are worried repeal will cost millions of low-income Americans their insurance and conservatives are angry the proposed bills do not go far enough to gut Obamacare, which they consider government overreach. In a first vote of the many likely to come this week, the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare that Senate Republicans have been working on for months failed to get the 60 votes needed for approval on Tuesday night. The vote was 43 in favor and 57 against. Nine Republicans, ranging from moderates such as Susan Collins of Maine to conservatives such as Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the bill, which would have made deep cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and reduced Obamacare subsidies to lower-income people to help them defray the cost of health insurance. Earlier McCain, 80, received an ovation from his fellow senators when he entered the chamber to cast a vote to open debate. After that vote, he decried growing partisanship in the Senate and urged members to learn how to trust each other again. Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski were the only Republicans to oppose the measure to open debate, and with Republicans controlling the Senate by a 52-48 majority, those were the only votes the party leadership could afford to lose. Democrats were united in opposition to the motion to proceed. Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who cast the last and deciding vote to open debate, engaged in a heated discussion with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before casting his vote and ending the suspense. A loss on the vote to open debate on Tuesday could have been a death blow for Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and cast doubt on Trumps prospects to achieve any of his other top legislative agenda items, including tax reform. We have a duty to act, McConnell told senators before the vote, reminding Republicans they had promised to repeal Obamacare in four straight elections. We cant let this moment slip by. Republicans have found it difficult to fulfill their campaign promises to repeal Obamacare, which enabled 20 million more Americans to get health insurance. Polls show Obamacare is now far more popular than the Republican alternatives. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the Senates replacement bill could lead to as many as 22 million fewer Americans being insured. The health industry has watched the debate nervously, and after the vote some groups urged the Senate to reconsider its approach. Americas Essential Hospitals, a group representing safety-net hospitals, said in a statement it strongly opposed all the Republican plans and feared the big cuts in Medicaid in the bills would jeopardize the health and financial security of millions of working people and families. Shares in health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) turned sharply lower after the Senate vote. Earlier on Tuesday, the company had reported a better than expected profit as it benefits from a strong Obamacare business.     As the debate vote opened, more than two dozen protesters in the Senate chamber chanted kill the bill before they were removed. Senators said several approaches have been discussed, including a straight repeal of Obamacare with no replacement plan, or repealing and replacing the law while also overhauling Medicaid. Senate Republicans also could consider a shortened version of repeal, called a skinny repeal, which would end the mandates in Obamacare on individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance, and a medical device tax, a Senate aide and a lobbyist said. Some of us want clean repeal, some of us want the Senate leadership bill, theyre both going to get a vote early on and I think thats a fair way to do it, Republican Senator Rand Paul said. If either one of them fails and another one succeeds, maybe we can find something in between that actually succeeds. Republican Senator Bob Corker said the goal was to gain enough votes to get a bill through the Senate and send it to the House of Representatives, which passed its own bill to replace Obamacare in May, for negotiations. Everybody understands this is just a first step, he said. Several of the Democrats opposing the motion for debate were from conservative states that backed Trump in 2016 and face tough re-election bids next year, including Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana. We have a good chance to beat this, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after the vote. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, praised Collins and Murkowski for taking a principled stand against the Republican move to open debate. That wasnt easy, Durbin said. That was an act of political courage on their part; Im sure they were under tremendous pressure. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Joe Schiavoni, the former top Democrat in the Ohio state senate, is talking to a crowd at a fundraising event for his fledgling bid to become their next governor. He believes leaders of his party in Washington have lost touch with voters. Its a familiar refrain among Democrats in a state that helped catapult Republican Donald Trump into the White House in November. You cant just talk about things and send out press releases, says Schiavoni, a former boxer who revels in his blue collar roots. Many in the crowd, a few miles from the Rust Belt city of Youngstown, nod in vigorous agreement. Meeting voters and hearing their daily concerns is vital, he says. In Ohio, as in other politically competitive swing states that Democrats won in 2012 but lost in 2016, Democrats are struggling to come up with a clear message and identity to win back the voters they lost. Listening to voters is the key to moving forward, some three dozen Democratic Party members across Ohio said in interviews. But there was little consensus on how to win over those voters. Many of those interviewed said the partys national leaders have not learned the lessons of last years defeat, when many voters rejected the party as too elitist and out of touch with working Americans.  David Pepper, chairman of the state party, dismissed that criticism in an interview, saying he and his team have been traveling around Ohio, talking to voters and visiting their homes. They have been especially focused on two groups: the people who voted twice for President Barack Obama and then Trump, and Democratic voters who sat out the last election. Democrats across America, as in Ohio, are desperate to win again as they look ahead to next years congressional elections. The stakes are high. Without a significant shift in voting patterns, the party will fail to recapture the House of Representatives and could lose more seats in the Senate, where they are already in the minority. On Monday, the national Democratic Party unveiled an economic platform they said would help U.S. families. Called A Better Deal, it was the first major step by the party to try to reconnect with voters since the election. The plan called for creating 10 million jobs over five years and cracking down on monopolies and big corporate mergers. But the plan was missing a vital piece, said Alan Melamed, a longstanding member of the Ohio Democratic Partys executive committee and a political consultant who has worked on dozens of campaigns for more than 40 years. We need to show we are fighting for people. The plan failed to do that. Since Clintons defeat in November, Tom Perez, the head of the Democratic National Committee  the body which runs the national party  has conducted a nationwide listening tour to hear why so many traditionally Democratic voters defected to Trump last year. Yet when he came to Ohio, some Democrats said, he didnt do much listening  just a lot of talking. In June, the listening tour came to Youngstown. About 75 party stalwarts paid $25 each to attend a Pizza with Perez event at a local pizzeria. What I saw was a typical campaign event, with the audience doing the listening while Democratic operatives touted their positions, said John Russo, the former co-director of the Center for Working Class Studies at Youngstown University and a political analyst. We paid $25 to be told by Perez what he thought we were thinking. Michael Tyler, a spokesman for Perez, disputed that account, saying Perez had done a lot of listening at the event. Too many in Ohio and elsewhere feel politically homeless because for too long the national party focused solely on electing the president of the United States at the expense of local concerns, Tyler said. Thats exactly why Ohio was among the first places Tom visited when he decided to run for DNC chair. One of the national politicians unveiling A Better Deal in the town of Berryville, Virginia at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley, was Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Mention Pelosi to Democrats in Ohio and many roll their eyes. A California liberal, Pelosi is part of the problem, not the solution, they said in interviews. They view Pelosi as part of a coastal elite that does not understand the struggles of Americans in the Midwest.  Christopher Celeste, the son of former Ohio governor Dick Celeste and a major Democratic Party donor at both the state and national level, said the retention of Pelosi as a party leader earlier this year was mindboggling. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said the Democratic leader has raised almost $570 million for Democrats since becoming part of the party leadership in 2002, and was a master legislator and strategist. While some may find it politically advantageous to engage in a circular firing squad, Leader Pelosi isnt in Congress on a shift. Shes on a mission to protect the Affordable Care Act, said Hammill, referring to Obamas healthcare reform law which Trump wants to repeal. Joyce Beatty, a congresswoman from central Ohio, also defended Pelosi. To just blame Nancy Pelosi is not only wrong, but its wrong for Democrats to do it. If there has been a failure we all need to own it. Angered by last years defeats up and down the ballot in Ohio, a group of political consultants circulated a memo to every member of the state partys executive committee in December. The memo, which has not been previously reported, lambastes the party leadership for the electoral carnage of 2016. (Read the memo here tmsnrt.rs/2h2sTgT) Clinton lost Ohio, a key battleground, by over eight points. Only one Democratic presidential candidate in the past 40 years  Walter Mondale in 1984  won fewer counties in Ohio than Clinton. Ohio Democrats also lost the U.S. Senate race, both Democratic nominees for the Ohio Supreme Court were defeated, and state races were lost. Ohios Democratic congressional delegation in Washington is at its lowest in decades and Republicans control the governors mansion and both the state House and Senate. The status quo cannot stand, the memo says. It calls for  new messages  and more effective strategies for delivering them. The memo does not make clear what those messages should be. A source close to the state party leadership dismissed the memo as sniping by disgruntled consultants. Pepper, the Ohio party leader, does not want to relitigate the past. We need to go and talk to voters and win them back, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The bill, introduced by Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, would outlaw chlorpyrifos, an agricultural insect-killer that has been found to cause brain damage in children. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency denied a petition to ban the chemical on March 29, and a federal appeals court on July 18 denied a petition by green groups to force the agency to reverse its decision and enact the ban. The bill is called the Protect Children, Farmers and Farmworkers from Nerve Agent Pesticides Act of 2017. Seven other senators are co-sponsoring it: Ben Cardin of Maryland, Kamala Harris of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.  Chlorpyrifos, produced by a variety of manufacturers, including a subsidiary of Dow Chemical, is listed as a neurotoxin by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Current regulatory safety standard for chlorpyrifos rests on five decades of experience in use, health surveillance of manufacturing workers and applicators, and more than 4,000 studies and reports examining the product in terms of health, safety and the environment, a Dow spokesman said on Tuesday. Authorized uses of chlorpyrifos products, when used as directed, offer wide margins of protection for human health and safety.   The EPA considered whether to ban it for roughly a decade before Trump appointed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a Republican from Oklahoma, to lead the agency. In denying the petition to ban chlorpyrifos, Pruitt said the EPA had previously relied on novel and uncertain scientific study methods to conclude the substance was dangerous. The agency said it was still reviewing the chemicals registration.  EPA will continue to evaluate the potential risks posed by chlorpyrifos as part of the ongoing registration review, said EPA spokeswoman Amy Graham. Trump and Pruitt have vowed to roll back environmental regulations they say are harming business growth in the United States.  Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician who is dean for global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said three long-term, independently funded studies showed the substance was toxic. Chlorpyrifos has been shown beyond any shadow of a doubt to damage the brains of children, especially those of fetuses in the womb, he said. Udalls bill also calls for the EPA to conduct a broad review of the use of other pesticides similar to chlorpyrifos to determine which groups are most vulnerable to their harmful effects. If the review shows any people are being exposed to harmful levels of the chemicals, called organophosphates, the EPA administrator must take appropriate regulatory action within three months by either suspending or revoking the their registration or lowering the amount that can legally be used.  Congress must act because Administrator Pruitt has shown that he wont, Udall said in a statement on Monday. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union warned on Wednesday that it was ready to act within days to counter proposed new U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they would harm the blocs energy security. Sanctions legislation overwhelmingly approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday has angered EU officials: they see it as breaking transatlantic unity in the Wests response to Moscows annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Brussels also fears the new sanctions will harm European firms with connections to Russia, and oil and gas projects on which the EU is dependent. The U.S. bill could have unintended unilateral effects that impact the EUs energy security interests, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said in a statement issued after a meeting at which European commissioners were united in their views, according to a senior EU official. If our concerns are not taken into account sufficiently, we stand ready to act appropriately within a matter of days. America First cannot mean that Europes interests come last, he said, mentioning President Donald Trumps guiding slogan. A EU document prepared for the commissioners, seen by Reuters, laid out the EUs plans to seek demonstrable reassurances that the White House would not use the bill to target EU interests. The bloc, it says, will also prepare to use an EU regulation allowing it to defend companies against the application of extraterritorial measures by the United States. If diplomacy fails, Brussels plans to file a complaint at the World Trade Organization. In addition, the preparation of a substantive response that would deter the U.S. from taking measures against EU companies could be considered, it says. However, most measures taken by Brussels would require approval from all 28 EU member governments, which could expose potential differences in individual nations relations with Moscow and Washington. Despite changes to the U.S. bill that took into account some EU concerns, Brussels said the legislation could still hinder upkeep of the gas pipeline network in Russia that feeds into Ukraine and supplies over a quarter of EU needs. The EU says it could also hamper projects crucial to its energy diversification goals, such as the Baltic Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project. The new sanctions target the disputed Nord Stream 2 project for a new pipeline running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. But the EU note says: the impact would in reality be much wider. A list prepared by the EU executive, seen by Reuters, shows eight projects including those involving oil majors Anglo-Dutch Shell, BP and Italys Eni that risk falling foul of the U.S. measures.  Voicing frustration at the fraying in the joint Western approach to Moscow, Juncker said close coordination among allies was key to ensuring that curbs on business with the Russian energy, defense and financial sectors, imposed in July 2014, are effective. EU sources said Juncker told Commissioners the risk to EU interests was collateral damage of a U.S. domestic fight between Trump and U.S. lawmakers. It was unclear how quickly the U.S. bill would reach the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. The bill amounts to a rebuke of Trump by requiring him to obtain lawmakers permission before easing any sanctions on Moscow. Rejecting the legislation - which would potentially stymie his wish for improved relations with Moscow - would carry a risk that his veto could be overridden by lawmakers. European energy industry sources voiced alarm at the potentially wide-ranging damage of the new U.S. measures. This is pretty tough, one industry source told Reuters. We are working with EU officials to see what safeguards can be anticipated to protect our investment and give us certainty.  Five Western firms are partnered with Russias Gazprom in Nord Stream 2: Germans Wintershall [WINT.UL] and Uniper, Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, Austrias OMV and Frances Engie.  But EU officials warn the U.S. measures would also hit plans for the LNG plant on the Gulf of Finland in which Shell is partnering with Gazprom. The EU document shows they might jeopardize Enis 50 percent stake in the Blue Stream pipeline from Russia to Turkey as well as the CPC pipeline, carrying Kazakh oil to the Black Sea, involving European groups BG Overseas Holdings, Shell and Eni . It further warns that BP would be forced to halt some activities with Russian energy major Rosneft. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The sanctions, which have yet to be approved by the U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump, expand and tweak a list of existing sanctions, but cannot be viewed as a game changer, analysts said. Russian President Vladimir Putin will decide if and how Moscow will retaliate once the fresh sanctions become law. Below are highlights from the bill and analysts reactions:   The United States should continue to uphold and seek unity with European and other key partners on sanctions implemented against the Russian Federation, which have been effective and instrumental in countering Russian aggression in Ukraine. The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit ... a report describing in detail the potential effects of expanding sanctions ... to include sovereign debt and the full range of derivative products. The Secretary of the Treasury shall review sanctions from 2014 to ensure that the directive prohibits the conduct by United States persons or persons within the United States of all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of longer than 14 days maturity or new equity of persons determined to be subject to the directive, their property, or their interests in property. The Secretary of the Treasury may determine that a person meets one or more of the criteria ... if that person is a state-owned entity operating in the railway, or metals and mining sector of the economy of the Russian Federation. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, shall submit a detailed report on Russias senior foreign political figures and oligarchs. The bill is designed to continue to oppose the NordStream 2 pipeline given its detrimental impacts on the European Unions energy security, gas market development in Central and Eastern Europe, and energy reforms in Ukraine. Trump, in coordination with allies of the United States, may impose sanctions on an entity that makes an investment described in the Act or sells, leases, or provides to the Russian Federation, for the construction of Russian energy export pipelines, goods, services, technology, information, or support ... any of which has a fair market value of $1,000,000 or more; or that, during a 12-month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $5,000,000 or more. With the Senate voting 92-2 and the House 419-3, it is highly unlikely that President Trump would veto the bill, said Charles Robertson, Global Chief Economist at Renaissance Capital in London. Long term this is really bad news. We know from Jackson-Vaneck that these kind of sanctions are hard to remove once in place. This will further stall foreign investment into Russia, negatively impacting growth and development, furthering long-term capital flight and brain drain. It will further the isolation from the West, and stagnation of the Russian economy, said Tim Ash, a Senior Strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. Most importantly for Russia, the original Senate bill with regard to Nord Stream 2 was watered down as it now requires coordination with allies when imposing such sanctions. Moreover, the bill only gives the option for the president to introduce such sanctions, but does not require that he does so. So, overall, I expect marginal negative effect, Ivan Tchakarov, senior economist at Citi in Moscow. In general we think that the impact on the Russian economy should be relatively limited. Compared to 2014 when the first set of sanctions was introduced the Russian economy is in much better state to weather the measures, said Liza Ermolenko, emerging European economist at Barclays in London. In the U.S. sanctions bill we have not seen any direct negative implications for the rouble so far. Some tightening of the trade financing terms would not have a material negative impact on the rouble, although it may lead to a shortage of the dollar liquidity in the market and its not clear how well companies and banks were prepared to this, said Alexey Pogorelov, chief economist at Credit Suisse in London.

Russia was responding after the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to impose new sanctions on Moscow and to force President Donald Trump to obtain lawmakers permission before easing any sanctions on Russia. Moscow had initially hoped that Trump would work to repair a relationship which has slumped to a post-Cold War low, but has watched with frustration as allegations that Moscow interfered with last years U.S. presidential election and concerns over Trump associates Russia ties have killed off hopes of detente. Russia flatly denies the meddling accusations.   On Wednesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency the latest U.S. sanctions move left no room to improve ties between Moscow and Washington in the near future and took the relationship into uncharted waters. This is already having an extremely negative impact on the process of normalizing our relations, Ryabkov told Interfax. U.S.-Russia relations were entering uncharted territory in a political and diplomatic sense, he added. Russia has repeatedly warned the United States it will retaliate against what it sees as hostile moves and Ryabkov made clear Moscow was growing tired of showing restraint. The Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier this month that too many American spies operated in Russia under diplomatic cover and that it might expel some of them to retaliate over Washingtons expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats last year. That warning reflected rising frustration in Moscow over the Trump administrations refusal to hand back two Russian diplomatic compounds which were seized at the same time as the  diplomats were sent home. Many Russian politicians believe Trumps political opponents and Congress have successfully reduced the U.S. presidents room for maneuver on Russia to almost nil.  Ryabkov told Interfax the new sanctions bill was the brainchild of U.S. Congressmen who hated Russia and wanted to box in Trump.   Konstantin Kosachyov, who heads the foreign relations committee in Russias upper house of parliament, called on Moscow to devise a painful response to the U.S. move.

Trump said again he was frustrated that Sessions had recused himself from the federal investigation into possible collusion between Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and Russia and said he would not have appointed him had he known he would do so. He stopped short of saying whether he would fire him. Two allies of Sessions told Reuters that Trumps public attacks went beyond a president simply venting his frustration but were part of a deliberate campaign to encourage the attorney general to step down. They said Trump was likely reluctant to fire Sessions after his sacking of FBI Director James Comey backfired and led to the appointment of an independent special counsel, Robert Mueller, whose wide-ranging probe into contacts between Trump aides and Russian officials has cast a deep shadow over Trumps presidency.   The Kremlin says it did not interfere in the election, and Trump has denied any collusion. Asked about Sessions future, Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday, Time will tell. Time will tell. The two allies of Sessions said the attorney general, who was the first Republican senator to back Trumps presidential campaign, has been deeply offended by the public berating from his boss, but his resolve to stay is strong. It is not clear though whether that will be possible in the long term if Sessions relationship with the president irretrievably breaks down.  As Trump and top White House aides stepped up their attacks on Sessions on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers, stunned by the extraordinary scene of a president lambasting a member of his own cabinet, push backed strongly. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the chamber, said Sessions is doing a fine job and made the right decision to recuse himself from the Russia matter. Some lawmakers also expressed disquiet with Trumps public humiliation of Sessions, who has mostly stayed silent on his bosss criticism. Mr. President, maybe just try a meeting? This is beneath the office - of any held office - from city councilman to POTUS, said Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger, using the presidential acronym.  The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, accused Trump of trying to bully his own attorney general out of office. He said if Trump fired Sessions, Democrats would fight any attempt to replace him during the August congressional recess. The split between Trump and Republicans in Congress is the latest test of a strained relationship. Lawmakers have expressed frustration that the upheaval in the White House is distracting from their legislative agenda. Republicans have little to show for Trumps first six months in office. Were getting nothing done, lamented Senator John McCain on the Senate floor on Tuesday. Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday that Sessions had taken a VERY weak position on investigating his former opponent in the 2016 presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, over her use of a private email server. On Monday, Trump had called his attorney general beleaguered.  Sessions recused himself in March from the Russia  investigation after failing to disclose at his confirmation hearing that he had held meetings last year with Russias ambassador in Washington. In publicly attacking Sessions, Trump has torn out yet another page from the Washington rulebook - typically a president would convey his displeasure with a cabinet secretary out of the public eye. In an administration where a lot of unexpected things have happened, this may be the most unexpected. This has risen to a level that we have never seen before, said Douglas Heye, a former top aide to former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.  RIGHT-WING BACKLASH? A third Sessions ally said an article published by the right-wing website Breitbart on Tuesday painting Trump as weak for criticizing a man who is tough on immigration was significant. Breitbarts previous chairman, Steve Bannon, is one of Trumps closest White House advisers. That says to Trump, If you do this, if you get rid of him right now, you will have to face the wrath of the far right, said the ally. Sessions made a name for himself for his hardline views on immigration and criminal justice. He is aligned with groups that lobby for cutting the number of legal immigrants allowed into country each year, as well as programs to ensure that employers arent able to hire illegal workers. As attorney general, he has vowed to crack down on the violent El Salvadorian gang Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, and strip Justice Department funding from so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.  At a news conference last Thursday, Sessions said he loved his job and planned to stay in it as long as that is appropriate. A Justice Department official said Sessions started his day on Tuesday with his usual early morning run on the treadmill in the departments gym. Soon afterward, he got down to work.

Despite tensions with Moscow over its backing for separatists in Ukraine, most of central Europe relies on Russian gas to power its economy, delivered via a laticework of pipelines that require constant maintenance and expansion. Treier called on the European Commission, the EUs executive, to seek clarification from the United States over the eventual scope of the sanctions.

U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan rejected claims that federal law preempted New York and its Public Service Commission from offering credits to promote clean energy and reduce reliance on fossil-fueled or gas plants. The plaintiffs said the credits could boost electric bills for New Yorks captive ratepayers by $7.6 billion over 12 years, and violate the dormant Commerce Clause by impeding Congress power to regulate commerce among states. But the judge said New Yorks zero-emissions credits program was plainly related to a matter of legitimate state concern: the production of clean energy, and reduction of emissions from other energy that could add to global warming. The New York program is constitutional, Caproni wrote. Fatal to plaintiffs argument is their failure to offer any cogent explanation why ZECs are preempted but other state incentives to generate clean energy - such as tax exemptions, land grants, or direct financial subsidies - are not. Seven plaintiffs had challenged the credits, including the Coalition for Competitive Electricity, Dynegy Inc (DYN.N) and NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N). Requests for comment from their lawyers were forwarded to a spokesman for New Yorkers for Fair Energy, (www.ny4fairenergy.com/), who said there will be an appeal. The public service commission failed ratepayers last year when it instituted a $7.6 billion bailout for uneconomic nuclear plants with almost no public input, the spokesman said. Cuomo welcomed the decision. At a time when the federal government has abdicated its leadership on climate change, the decision ensures our progresswill not be blocked or rolled back by fossil fuel interests and others seeking to maintain the status quo, Cuomo said in a statement. Audrey Zibelman, in her role as PSC chair, was the lead defendant. Nuclear generators receiving the credits and their owners, including Exelon Corp (EXC.N), also sided with the governor. Cuomo endorsed the subsidies in connection with his Clean Energy Standard announced last August, which required that half of New Yorks electricity come from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar by 2030.

It was unclear how quickly the bill would make its way to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. The bill still must be passed by the Senate, which is mired in debate over efforts to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system as lawmakers try to clear the decks to leave Washington for their summer recess. The sanctions bill comes as lawmakers investigate possible meddling by Russia in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion by Republican Trumps campaign. Moscow has denied it worked to influence the election in Trumps favor, and he has denied his campaign colluded. The White House said the president had not yet decided whether he would sign the measure. Rejecting the bill - which would potentially hamper his hopes of pursuing improved relations with Moscow - would carry a risk that his veto could be overridden by lawmakers. While the president supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the presidents desk, said spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. House members backed the bill, which also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea, by a near-unanimous margin of 419-3, with strong support from Trumps fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, despite objections from Trump, who wanted more control over the ability to impose sanctions. The Republican-controlled Senate passed an earlier version of the bill with near-unanimous support. The House added the North Korea measures after becoming frustrated with the Senates failure to advance a bill it passed in May. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the three countries are threatening vital U.S. interests and destabilizing their neighbors. It is well past time that we forcefully respond. But the combined bill has run into objections from some senators, who are unhappy that the House added the North Korea sanctions after holding up the measure for more than a month. Senate leaders have not said when they might consider the House bill. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was not sure the bill would fly through his chamber. The only language we agreed to was Iran and Russia. So adding North Korea on, I just dont know how were going to deal with it yet, Corker told reporters. The better route would have been to send over what had been agreed to. The bill had raised concerns in the European Union, where U.S. allies depend on supplies of Russian gas. But House members said the bill was tweaked to try to alleviate the worries of Europeans and the energy sector. The intense focus on Russia, involving several congressional probes and a separate investigation by a Justice Department-appointed special counsel, Robert Mueller, has overshadowed Trumps agenda. The scrutiny has angered and frustrated the president, who calls the investigations a politically motivated witch hunt fueled by Democrats who cannot accept his upset win in last Novembers election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state. Without offering evidence, Trump lashed out on Twitter on Tuesday about Ukrainian efforts to sabotage his presidential campaign in order to aid Clinton. The Ukrainian embassy in Washington denied the accusations. The Senate Judiciary Committee had been set to compel Trumps former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, to testify at a hearing on Wednesday, but rescinded the subpoena late on Tuesday as negotiations over his participation continued. Manafort has started turning over documents to the committee and is negotiating a date to be interviewed, the panel said in a statement. The committee is looking at a June 2016 meeting in New York with a Russian lawyer organized by Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Trump Jr. released emails this month that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information at the meeting about Clinton. On Friday, the panel had asked that Manafort and Trump Jr. appear at the Wednesday hearing, but a witness list released on Tuesday evening included neither of their names.  Manafort met with Senate Intelligence Committee staff on Tuesday morning, his spokesman said. On Tuesday, Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, spent three hours with the House of Representatives intelligence panel, his second straight day on Capitol Hill answering questions about his contacts with Russians during the campaign. Kushner had a very productive session with the House Intelligence Committee, Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said after the meeting. Republican Representative Michael Conaway said Kushner was straightforward and forthcoming. He wanted to answer every question that we had. Kushner, who is now a top aide in Trumps White House, told reporters on Monday he had no part in any Kremlin plot.. U.S. House Republicans on Tuesday rejected a legislative effort by Democrats to obtain Treasury Department documents that could show any ties between the finances of Trump, his inner circle and the Russian government.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administrations refusal to publicly accuse Russia and others in a wave of politically motivated hacking attacks is creating a policy vacuum that security experts fear will encourage more cyber warfare. In the past three months, hackers broke into official websites in Qatar, helping to create a regional crisis; suspected North Korean-backed hackers closed down British hospitals with ransomware; and a cyber attack that researchers attribute to Russia deleted data on thousands of computers in the Ukraine. Yet neither the United States nor the 29-member NATO military alliance have publicly blamed national governments for those attacks. President Donald Trump has also refused to accept conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections using cyber warfare methods to help the New York businessman win. The White House is currently embroiled in a cyber crisis of existential proportion, and for the moment probably just wants cyber to go away, at least as it relates to politics, said Kenneth Geers, a security researcher who until recently lived in Ukraine and works at NATOs think tank on cyber defense. This will have unfortunate side effects for international cyber security. Without calling out known perpetrators, more hacking attacks are inevitable, former officials said.  I see no dynamics of deterrence, said ex-White House cyber security officer Jason Healey, now at Columbia University.  The government retreat is underscored by the departure at the end of July of Chris Painter, the official responsible for coordinating U.S. diplomacy on cyber security. No replacement has been named and the future of the position in the State Department is in flux. Some of Trumps cyber officials have publicly highlighted a strategy to focus less on building global norms and more on bilateral agreements. Trump and the Kremlin have said Russia and the United States are in discussions on creating a cyber security group. But at the big Black Hat and Def Con security conferences this week in Las Vegas the U.S. government will have an unusually light footprint. Past government speakers have included a head of the National Security Agency and senior Homeland Security officials.  A session featuring U.S. law enforcement officials discussing the purported theft by Russia of hundreds of millions of Yahoo account credentials was pulled at the last minute. A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the presentation was canceled  because the Yahoo expert slated to talk, Deputy Assistant Director Eric Sporre, had been reassigned to run the Tampa FBI office. The policy vacuum left by the United States is also affecting private security firms, which say they have grown more cautious in publicly attributing cyber attacks to nation-states lest they draw fire from the Trump administration.  Trump suggested in an April interview that the security firm CrowdStrike, which worked on investigating the election hack of the Democratic National Committee, might not be trustworthy because he was told it was controlled by a Ukrainian. It is not. Cyber policy veterans are particularly alarmed about the lack of U.S. and NATO response to the destructive attack, dubbed NotPetya, in June that struck computers worldwide but was especially harmful for Ukraine, which is in armed conflict with Russia in the east of the country. Cyber security experts, such as Jim Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a government veteran who advised former President Barack Obama, believe Russia carried out the attack. The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lewis and others predicted that Trump will not publicly accuse Russia, and NATO has only said it appears to be the work of a government agency somewhere. If you are not ringing alarm bells in an eloquent way, then I think youre dropping the ball, said retired CIA officer Daniel Hoffman, who worked on Russian issues.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, in a rare media interview, said that the Trump administration would work to hold Chinas practices to the rules of the World Trade Organization, an organization that he has criticized for being ineffective in enforcing fair trade. Speaking on the syndicated Kevin McCullough Radio conservative talk show, Lighthizer said there was no question that China has an industrial policy that is designed to create jobs and wealth in China. Our objective is not to let that go on in an unfair way. Lighthizer, a longtime steel industry trade lawyer who served as deputy USTR in the 1980s, said there were many examples of Chinas WTO violations, including dumping of products below cost, unfair subsidies for state firms and other non-economic policies. You have to take on their industrial policy one way or another, Lighthizer said. For example, they will develop an industry behind a closed market in China. When that industry is developed with subsidies and with protection, theyll then let it loose on the world. He said this has happened in steel, aluminum and other products. If its unfair the presidents going to go after it. Lighthizers comments come about a week after senior Trump administration officials at bilateral economic talks failed to secure any concrete commitments from their Chinese counterparts to eliminate excess steel production capacity or to further open the Chinese services industry to foreign competition. News conferences at the conclusion of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue talks were canceled and there was no joint statement for the first time since the summer bilateral economic meetings were launched in 2006. China later sought to put a more positive spin on the meeting, saying the two sides had agreed to take active and effective measures to tackle the global steel overcapacity problem. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview that his administration would take its time in deciding on whether to enact steel tariffs or quotas on national security grounds, saying we dont want to do it at this moment. Trump added that the steel decision could come after debates in Congress on health care, taxes and infrastructure spending Regarding negotiations starting in August to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, Lighthizer said that Trump wanted to change the 23-year-old trade pact to stop a basic unfairness that has allowed U.S. factories and manufacturing jobs to migrate to Mexico. Asked by radio host McCullough if Trump still wanted to scrap NAFTA, Lighthizer said: Scrapped is too strong but the president wants very substantial changes, Lighthizer said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain, recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, was given a heros welcome on his return to the Capitol on Tuesday, but quickly seized the opportunity to blister his party and his president for partisan politics. Bruised and scarred from his recent surgery and flashing at times his characteristic self-deprecating humor, McCain spoke at length on the Senate floor, delivering a passionate rebuke of his fellow Republicans in Congress and an administration that has shown few results during Republican President Donald Trumps first six months in office.  Were getting nothing done, the 80-year-old senator lamented.  McCain made a dramatic return from his Arizona home to cast a critical vote to keep alive one of Trumps top legislative priorities, the repeal of 2010s Obamacare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. McCain entered the Senate chamber to a standing ovation, with his vote helping Republicans open a floor debate, setting the stage for them to fashion a replacement for Obamacare. After the vote, McCain took to the floor and urged his fellow Republicans to stand up to Trump, who has frequently chided the Republican-led Congress for failing to advance his agenda. We are not the presidents subordinates. We are his equals, he said to a smattering of applause in the chamber.  McCain, who has served in the Senate for 30 years and ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008 against Barack Obama, has frequently criticized the Trump administration, particularly on issues of foreign policy and national security.  Most of his remarks on Tuesday, however, were directed at his fellow senators. He blasted the process through which Senate Republicans crafted their healthcare legislation, shutting out Democrats and writing the bill out of public view.  McCain has repeatedly said that Democrats did little better in 2010, when Obamacare was passed, and added, We shouldnt do the same with ours.         Democrats say they tried to work with Republicans in 2010 but could find no common ground. No Democrat voted in favor of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells motion to open debate on the healthcare bill on Tuesday. Two Republican senators also opposed the measure, leading to a 50-50 ballot and forcing Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. McCain said that while he voted to start the debate, he expected the Republican efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare to fail, and received an ovation when he called on his party to work with Democrats to produce a new healthcare bill. He also accepted some responsibility for Washingtons deep partisan divide. Sometimes, Ive let my passion rule my reason, he said. Sometimes I made it harder to find common ground because of something harsh I said to a colleague. McCain called on his fellow senators to work together and to stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the internet. To hell with them. They dont want anything done for the public good. Earlier this month, after surgery to remove a blood clot above his eye, McCain was diagnosed with a primary glioblastoma, a fast-growing type of brain tumor. He has been discussing treatment options with his medical team.  As recently as Monday, he had not been expected to be present for the Senate vote. His last-minute help to open debate on one of Trumps major priorities was laced with irony, given that two years ago, Trump famously derided McCains military service and his capture during the Vietnam War.  A Navy officer, McCain spent almost six years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam and was tortured repeatedly. In 2015, in the early weeks of his presidential campaign, Trump was dismissive of McCains ordeal, saying he was not a true war hero.  He was a war hero because he was captured, Trump said then. I like people who werent captured. At the time, many thought Trumps remarks might sink his fledgling campaign, but instead they became part of a pattern of attention-getting statements that helped propel him to the presidency.  Trump was more gracious on Tuesday after the news of McCains return to the Senate became public. So great that John McCain is coming back to vote, Trump tweeted. Brave  American hero. McCain said that he will remain in Washington for a few days before returning to Arizona for treatment. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled Texas Senate gave preliminary approval on Tuesday to a bill that restricts bathroom access for transgender people, endorsing a piece of legislation denounced by civil liberties advocates as discriminatory. Final Senate adoption of the bill was possible later on Tuesday or Wednesday. The measure would then be sent to the state House of Representatives, where passage during a 30-day special legislative session that ends in mid-August is less certain despite a Republican majority in that body as well. The preliminary vote in the Senate was 21-10, with one Democrat crossing the aisle to vote with the Republican majority in favor of the measure, Senate Bill 3. Enactment in Texas, the most-populous Republican-dominated state, could give momentum in other socially conservative states for additional action on an issue that has become a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars. The Texas measure requires that all restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities must be designated for and used only by persons of the same sex as stated on a persons birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. The measure also would overturn local ordinances affirming transgender bathroom rights in such cities as Austin, San Antonio and Dallas.  Supporters, including Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a staunch social conservative, have said the proposed bathroom restrictions promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children. Momentum for so-called bathroom bills stalled earlier this year when a similar law in North Carolina was partially repealed in March. The original law prompted boycotts by a number of athletic organizations and businesses that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Opponents in Texas warned of a similar backlash. The state of Texas cannot afford discriminatory acts, Democratic Senator Borris Miles said during debate on the bill. The bills sponsor, Republican Senator Lois Kolkhorst, said there was no solid evidence showing that enacting the bill would hurt the states economy. Perhaps we will find that this one bill will lead to more economic activity, she said. Business leaders, socially progressive clergy and police chiefs of several major Texas cities have called on lawmakers to halt the bathroom bill, saying it does not protect the public. Civil rights groups said there were already laws on the books protecting people from sexual assaults and voyeurism, and that enactment of SB 3 would further endanger transgender people, who are more prone to be victims of violence. The Texas Senate previously passed a bathroom bill during the regular legislative session that ended in May, but the measure died in the House, under pressure from pro-business Republicans. Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, a moderate Republican who steers that chambers agenda, has said such measures are unnecessary and raise worries of economic harm.

In lashing out against an investigation of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia, Trump is slamming Sessions, prompting speculation that the president wants to oust the attorney general.[nL1N1KG11O] If Robert Mueller, the special counsel running the Russia investigation, is Trumps ultimate target and he moves to fire Mueller, a legal and political showdown could ensue. Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, told CNN on Tuesday that he expected fellow lawmakers would not tolerate any effort by Trump to replace Sessions with a loyalist, especially if it appeared aimed at undermining Muellers investigation. The senators are going to be very skeptical about this, said King, who normally votes with Democrats. My expectation is youd see a special prosecutor pass by veto-proof majorities in both houses. And the investigation would continue. Trump, who dismissed James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as it was looking into possible Russian connections, was asked about Sessions at a news conference on Tuesday and said, Time will tell. Time will tell. These remarks followed Twitter messages by Trump in which he described Sessions as weak and beleaguered. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in a Capitol hallway on Tuesday that Sessions is doing a fine job. Republican Richard Shelby told reporters Sessions, formerly his fellow senator from Alabama, is not the presidents lawyer; he is the attorney general of the United States. Here are basics on the law covering dismissal of Justice Department officials, including Mueller, who was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein because Sessions is recused from matters dealing with the Russia investigation. On what grounds could Mueller be fired? Justice Department regulations say a special counsel can only be removed for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for any other good cause. Do Trumps claims that Mueller is on a witch hunt and that he is conflicted constitute good cause?   Probably not. No court has ever interpreted the meaning of good cause in this context. But Mueller has a sterling reputation and there is no indication he has exceeded the scope of his mandate, said Andrew Wright, former associate counsel in the Obama White House and professor at Savannah Law School. Campaign donations from members of Muellers team to Democrats do not pose a conflict of interest, Wright said. Could Trump directly fire Mueller?  Probably not. Department of Justice rules say the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or the acting attorney general. Trump has criticized Rosenstein for appointing Mueller and due to Sessions recusal, Rosenstein has sole authority to fire Mueller. But a few constitutional lawyers have said that Trump might be able to lawfully fire Mueller directly. Saikrishna Prakash of the University of Virginia Law School said the special counsel regulations may interfere with the presidents broad power under the Constitution to remove executive branch officials. I dont know if that regulation is constitutional, he said. If Trump fires Sessions or Sessions quits, could Trump handpick an attorney general who would fire Mueller? Normally, the president nominates an attorney general who must win Senate confirmation. If Trump followed this course, the Senate would likely press any nominee on his or her intentions on terminating Mueller, Prakash said.  The Senate is going to want promises that this person will be independent of the White House and not be a toady, he said.  How else could Trump name an attorney general who he believes would fire Mueller? Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, Trump could appoint an interim attorney general, but only someone previously confirmed by the Senate. The law can only be invoked to replace officials who die, resign or are otherwise unable to do their job. If Trump invoked the Federal Vacancies Reform Act to replace Sessions, a court may rule that Trump overstepped, Josh Chafetz, a professor of constitutional law at Cornell Law School, said. What about a recess appointment?  Trump could try replacing Sessions while the Senate is on summer recess, expected to begin Aug. 11. The constitution grants the president such authority, said Stephen Vladeck, constitutional law professor at the University of Texas School of Law.   The Supreme Court ruled in 2014 the president cannot make a recess appointment during recesses of less than 10 days. The Senate calendar is controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday that Democrats would use every tool at their disposal to block a recess appointment of a Sessions replacement. If Mueller were fired, could he mount a court challenge? Unclear. Vladeck said the special counsel regulations do not address this question. If he brought a lawsuit, Mueller likely would argue the rules would be pointless if there was no way to enforce them, Vladeck said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Republican-led House voted 231 to 190 along strict party lines to kill the rule barring financial institutions from forcing customers to agree to take future disputes to arbitration, instead of the courts, as a condition of opening accounts. It now goes to the Senate. Under the Congressional Review Act, both chambers can vote to repeal a new rule with simple majorities.  The Republican majority in the Senate is slimmer. If the party loses just three lawmakers the CFPB rule, finalized 15 days ago, will survive. Also, the Senate calendar is currently full with healthcare and tax reform, and lawmakers may not get around to voting on the rule. Republicans say mandatory arbitration works quickly to garner individuals substantial awards, while group lawsuits benefit only the attorneys who file them. Democrats contend the contract clauses rob customers of constitutional rights. Because companies hire the arbitrators and proceedings are secret, they also say the process is rigged against consumers. The Senate is being pressured on both sides by major interest groups, including the pro-business Chamber of Commerce and the workers rights group the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Much of the fight, though, is about the CFPB itself, which is appealing a legal decision that its structure is unconstitutional. Now that Republicans control Congress and the White House the six-year-old agencys future is in doubt. President Donald Trumps administration has argued against the CFPB in court, the House has approved legislation radically overhauling it, and the acting comptroller of the currency has attacked the arbitration rule. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo helped author the resolution to kill the new rule. Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, held a news conference on Tuesday rallying supporters to protect it.  Warren originally came up with the idea of an agency to shield individuals from predatory lending and help prevent the type of devastation average people experienced during the 2007-09 financial crisis.

The legislation puts California at the forefront of plans by mostly Democratic governors to reduce carbon emissions and adhere to the goals of the Paris climate change accord after Republican President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the pact. California is leading the world in dealing with a principal existential threat that humanity faces, Brown said at a  signing ceremony in San Francisco. We are a nation-state in a globalizing world and were having an impact and youre here witnessing one of the key milestones in turning around this carbonized world into a decarbonized, sustainable future, he said. Both houses of Californias Democratic-controlled legislature passed the bills on July 17. Opponents had said they represented a regressive tax that would not affect climate change. Californias cap-and-trade program sets a state limit on emissions of greenhouse gases and lets companies, such as factories and refineries, buy and sell permits to emit carbon dioxide. The system uses market forces to find the most efficient ways to cut pollution, supporters say. The legislation extends the program, which was set to expire in three years, through 2030. But it also seeks to strengthen the program by cutting the number of free carbon allowances and requiring that offsets be sourced from California, not elsewhere. Large industrial facilities will also be required to upgrade old equipment with cleaner, more modern technology by 2023. Despite holding a supermajority, Democrats failed in previous attempts to pass new cap-and-trade legislation over opposition from more liberal members of the party who felt it did not go far enough and moderates concerned about the impact on business. Republicans were largely united in opposing the legislation, saying it placed unfair burdens on consumers and employers, especially on top of a 12-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax hike passed by state lawmakers earlier this year.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering tossing out 2015 Obama administration net neutrality rules that reclassified internet service like a public utility. The current rules bar providers from blocking or slowing websites, or allowing websites to pay for fast lanes over competitors.  Internet providers and major tech companies have been sharply divided over the rules. Many internet providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules, while websites say the Obama era rules are critical to preserving the open internet. The outcome of the debate could have a major impact on the future of the internet economy and potentially profits of the companies involved. Other chief executives asked to testify include the heads of Comcast Corp, Netflix Inc and Charter Communications Inc. Several companies said they were reviewing the letter but none immediately said if they will testify. Comcast said it welcomed the hearing and believes the best way to stop the regulatory ping-pong on this important issue is for Congress to enact bipartisan legislation. A strong consensus is forming across party lines and across industries that its time for Congress to call a halt on the back-and-forth and set clear net neutrality ground rules for the internet, said Representative Greg Walden, a Republican, who chairs the committee. The time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out. Democrats on the committee want Republicans to invite small businesses and consumers, not just the CEOs from some of the largest corporations in the world with a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion, said a statement from Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Doyle, both Democrats. Democrats have so far refused to work with Republicans on internet legislation. A group representing major technology firms last week urged the FCC to abandon plans to rescind the rules barring internet service providers from hindering consumer access to web content or offering paid fast lanes. Major internet service have urged the FCC, however, to reverse the rules, even as they vowed not to hinder internet access. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pais plan to withdraw the former Obama administrations order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. The FCC is considering whether it has the authority to limit internet providers ability to block, throttle or offer paid prioritization, and, if so, whether it should keep any regulations in place. More than 12 million public comments have been filed on the proposal. The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook, Google, Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc, said last week it was open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission.

The rule, which was supposed to take effect in December 2016 but was blocked by a federal judge, is a top target for business groups that say it would force employers to convert many salaried employees into hourly workers.  The U.S. Department of Labor on Tuesday called for public comments on the rule, which is the first step in revoking or revising it. The rule would have doubled to $47,000 the maximum salary a worker can earn and still be eligible for mandatory overtime pay under federal wage law. A group of 21 states and business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce challenged the rule in a lawsuit filed last year.  The Labor Department appealed the judges decision temporarily blocking the rule to a New Orleans-based U.S. appeals court weeks before President Donald Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, the department defended its power to base overtime eligibility on workers salaries in a brief submitted to the court. But the agency made clear that it did not agree with the threshold set by the Obama administration. On Tuesday, the department said in light of the pending appeal, it decided to issue a request for comments rather than skip immediately to rescinding or revising the rule. The agency asked for input on whether the current threshold of $23,660 set in 2004 should be updated for inflation, and whether there should be multiple levels based on region, employer size, industry or other factors.  Workers rights groups criticized the Trump administration for moving to change the rule, with some noting that the Obama administration reviewed 300,000 comments before setting the salary threshold at $47,000. Working people should not have to wait another day for government to be on their side, Christine Owens, executive director of the union-backed National Employment Law Project, said in a statement on Tuesday. The department also asked employers to explain how they prepared for the rule to take effect and whether it has had an outsize impact on small businesses and particular industries. The department said it was considering eliminating the salary threshold, leaving overtime eligibility to be based on workers job duties.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The bill was rejected amid intense sparring with Democrats openly wondering whether or not Trump, a Republican, is compromised by a foreign power and Republicans dismissing it as a political stunt. Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chair of the  House Financial Services Committee that rejected the proposal, said the panel would not be spending any time exploring Trumps financial network. Hensarling cited open investigations by congressional committees and a special counsel into conclusions by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign to help New York businessman Trump win. Moscow has denied any meddling and Trump has denied and collusion between his campaign and Russian officials. The bill, known as a resolution of inquiry, is a rarely used legislative tool that allows Congress to formally request certain documents from the executive branch. But following Tuesdays voice vote in the committee, the bill is not expected to receive consideration by the full House of Representatives.  Specifically, the bill sought documents that may have been unearthed by the Treasurys Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that could show any ties between Trumps finances and Russia. Democrats on the committee have been trying for months to obtain financial records tied to Trump. In particular, they have pressed for information involving his business dealings with foreign banks, and any potential connection to Moscow. Clearly we have something afoot in this country that leads right to the top, said Representative Earl Perlmutter, a Democrat. We need to make sure that this nation isnt under the thumb of another nation because of financial leverage or whatever it might be. The resolution asked for any records of loans or credit from a number of banks to Trump, and 22 of his closest associates, including family members and top White House and campaign advisers. The banks include Deutsche Bank AG and Russian lenders Sberbank and Gazprombank. Hensarling chided Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the panel who has called for the presidents impeachment, for pushing the bill.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans were expected to vote on Tuesday for opening debate on a healthcare bill without knowing what is in it, but the potential components of the legislation were clear.  Approaches hammered out by Republicans in recent months were expected to be in the mix, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell making key choices about what is in and what is out, based on how much support a given combination can attract. One bill he could introduce would repeal much of Obamacare with no replacement plan. Another bill could repeal and replace the 2010 law while also overhauling Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Both bills have faced criticism from the health industry.  The Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, extended insurance to 20 million Americans and was Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic achievement. For seven years, Republicans have promised to repeal and replace it, but have struggled to do so, even though they now control both chambers of Congress and the White House. Another path open to McConnell would be to develop an entirely new bill on the Senate floor through amendments. Here are summaries of bills that could be in play: A shortened version of Obamacare repeal, called a skinny repeal, could end Obamacares individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax, said a Senate aide and a lobbyist. Senate Republicans would likely go for a bare-minimum skinny repeal only if other approaches, such as those below, cannot win approval. McConnell has said he could introduce a bill that Republicans passed in 2015 that was subsequently vetoed by Obama, called the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act. It would repeal most Obamacare taxes and end funding for Obamacares Medicaid expansion, as well as tax credits that help low-income people buy health insurance on the individual insurance market. It would abolish a penalty on individuals who do not purchase insurance, as well as a penalty on certain employers who do not provide employees insurance. But the legislation does not include a replacement plan. If signed into law, Congress would have two years to craft and pass a replacement. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the law would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 17 million in 2018, and by 32 million in 2026. The Senate has spent months negotiating a bill, called the Better Care Reconciliation Act, that would repeal and replace much of Obamacare, while also drastically cutting Medicaid. The latest version would repeal many Obamacare taxes, but retain two taxes on the wealthy. It would unwind Obamacares Medicaid expansion over three years, then slash spending on Medicaid beginning in 2025, as well as overhaul the laws tax credits. It would also eliminate penalties on individuals for not purchasing insurance and employers who do not provide it. The bill includes an amendment from Senator Ted Cruz that would let insurers sell bare-bones policies that fall short of broad benefits mandated under Obamacare, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs. The CBO estimated the bill would result in 22 million more people losing their insurance by 2026 and, in a separate report, estimated that Medicaid would be cut by 35 percent come 2036.  HOUSE-PASSED LEGISLATION In May, the House of Representatives passed its own version of healthcare legislation, called the American Health Care Act.  It would repeal most Obamacare taxes, including taxes on the wealthy, replace the laws income-based tax credits with flat age-based credits capped at upper-income levels and end funding for the Medicaid expansion beginning in 2020.  Like the Senate legislation, it would eliminate the penalty on individuals who do not purchase insurance and employers who do not provide it to employees. Controversially, the House bill would eliminate the Obamacare mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. The CBO found it would result in 23 million more uninsured Americans by 2026 and destabilize the individual insurance market in much of the country.

The bipartisan measure aims to punish Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and for alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The measures fate in the Senate is uncertain after a key senator said the deal announced over the weekend may not be final. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters that negotiators had a very good weekend but any announcement seemed somewhat premature. Were about there, theres still some procedural issues were discussing but, you know, I think it worked out very, very well. Weve still got a couple of things to talk about on North Korea, Corker said. If the Republican-led Senate passes the measure, Trump will need to decide whether to sign the bill or veto it. Rejecting it would carry a risk that his veto could be overridden by lawmakers. The Trump administration has objected to a provision in the sanctions bill that the president obtain congressional approval before easing any sanctions on Moscow. Hes going to study that legislation and see what the final product looks like, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday, when asked whether Trump would support it. An earlier version of the bill, including sanctions on Russia and Iran, passed the Senate by 98-2 on June 15. A North Korea sanctions bill passed the House by 419-1 in May and House lawmakers were becoming increasingly impatient with the Senates failure to take up that legislation. House members saw the Iran and Russia sanctions bill as a chance to finally get the North Korea measure through the Senate.

Tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. youve been hearing about with the fake news and all of that, he told the teenaged boys, sitting state by state in brightly colored t-shirts. You know, I go to Washington and I see all these politicians and I see the swamp and its not a good place, said Trump. In fact, today I said we ought to change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool or perhaps to the word sewer. Its not good. I see whats going on and believe me, Id much rather be with you, that I can tell you, Trump said. He told the boys that the media were dishonest and would not  show the size of their jamboree on television. Fake media, fake media, Trump said, eliciting a chorus of boos and cheers. Trump recounted his election night victories, state by state, the boys from Wisconsin cheering when they heard their state mentioned, the boys from Michigan doing the same. But the most sustained round of cheers and jeers came when Trump mentioned his predecessor President Barack Obama, who had declined invitations to speak to the scout gathering while he was in office. By the way, just a question: did President Obama ever come to a jamboree? Trump said. Trump said he has 10 former Boy Scouts serving in his cabinet and White House, and brought a few on stage as examples of Boy Scout leadership in action, including Tom Price, his health secretary. Hopefully hes going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this horrible thing known as Obamacare, Trump said, referring to Obamas signature health care legislation, as the boys booed. He better get them, otherwise Ill say, Tom, youre fired! he said, borrowing the catch phrase from his reality television show, The Apprentice. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

We still have a little work to do, Senator Bob Corker told reporters at the U.S. Senate. He said he expected differences could be resolved quickly but declined to give a specific timeframe. Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate Democrats had announced on Saturday that they had reached an agreement that would allow a vote on the sanctions bill in the House on Tuesday. House aides said the bill is expected to pass overwhelmingly. But Corker said the announcement of a deal seemed somewhat premature. Its not quite done, but it feels like its moving to a good place, Corker said. He said issues included North Korea sanctions that were added to a bill including sanctions on Iran and Russia that passed the Senate overwhelmingly in June. He said Senate and House staff members were still discussing the measure. Its very, very close, he said. An earlier version of the bill, including sanctions on Russia and Iran, passed the Senate 98-2 on June 15. But it never came up for a vote in the House, after President Donald Trumps administration objected to provisions including a requirement that he obtain Congress approval before easing any sanctions on Moscow. Trumps relationship with Russia has been a focus of the first six months of his presidency after he called for warmer relations with Moscow while campaigning and amid an investigation of whether his associates colluded with Russian hackers to influence the election on his behalf. The new sanctions bill is the latest in a series of efforts by members of Congress to prevent Trump from easing sanctions on Moscow. The new version of the measure announced on Saturday added sanctions on North Korea but left intact most provisions of the bill passed by the Senate, including the congressional review provision. Corker said he had been in touch with the administration since Saturday but declined to elaborate beyond saying he thought officials had come to a fuller understanding of the measure. On Monday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump would examine whether the bill was offering the best deal for the American people and then decide whether he would support it.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump exhorted every Republican to vote yes on a healthcare overhaul when it comes before the Senate this week, but one of his partys most vocal opponents of the bill, Senator Susan Collins, said he had made no effort to reach her. The Democrats arent giving us one vote, so we need virtually every single vote from the Republicans, not easy to do, Trump declared Monday in the White House, appearing with families he said had been harmed by Obamacare. Hours later on Capitol Hill, Collins, one of a handful of Republican holdouts and the partys most reliable moderate in the Senate, said she had not heard from Trump. Ive had conversations with Vice President (Mike) Pence, and Seema Verma, and Reince Priebus has called me a few times, to discuss the bill, but the president understandably I think is focusing on others, Collins said in an interview on Monday evening with Reuters. Verma is the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Priebus is White House chief of staff.  Asked if Trump had given up on her, Collins said: I dont know but it sounded that way from one of his press statements that I saw. He said something like - Susan Collins, shes from Maine. As if that explained it. After a mostly hands-off approach to the Senate debate on healthcare over the past few weeks, Trump urged fellow Republicans on Monday to deliver on their promise of the past seven years to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. A defeat in the Senate would be a major setback for Trump and congressional Republicans, who view Obamacare as government intrusion in the healthcare market. Critics warn the Republican bill will deprive millions of health insurance. Collins, who voted two years ago against a repeal of Obamacare, repeated on Monday she would vote no on a motion to proceed to any of the known versions of the legislation now being circulated to repeal or overhaul the healthcare law.  The 64-year-old Maine lawmaker refused to try to predict what the outcome would be when the Senate votes on Tuesday on whether to open debate on a Republican healthcare bill. Once that episode is over, she said she hoped lawmakers would start work on a bipartisan bill on healthcare. My hope is that well end up going back to committee and doing what we should have in the first place: which is having hearings, perhaps coming up with several smaller bills to address the very real problems created by the Affordable Care Act, she said. Representatives of the Trump administration, asked whether the president intended to contact recalcitrant senators such as Collins, said others in the administration had done so.  Weve talked to virtually every single Republican senator, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told reporters, noting that Collins had been at the White House on a number of occasions.  Collins said lawmakers would first need to address the collapse of insurance markets in many counties across the country. She said Congress should fund cost-sharing subsidies that help keep down consumers out-of-pocket costs. Collins, who said she had held individual discussions with at least eight Senate Democrats about some kind of bipartisan healthcare effort, said she believed Trump would sign a bipartisan healthcare bill. At times he called for a bipartisan bill, and so I think hed be fine with a bipartisan bill. She was forthright about her problems with the Senate Republican approach, including its sweeping cuts to Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor, and the expected increase in costs for older Americans who buy private health insurance. Maines population is older, mostly rural, and one-fifth of the population is on Medicaid. The median age is 43, the oldest in the country.  In northern Maine, where the (insurance) rates are highest, and the population is older, the information from what Ive seen, it (the cost of insurance) would be like a third of their income in some cases. So Im very concerned about that, Collins said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The clash between internationalists urging the traditional U.S. leadership role in the world and advocates of an America First approach has worn down foreign policy and intelligence professionals inside the government, according to the officials. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has told friends he will be lucky to last a year in his job, according to a friend, while two officials said national security adviser H.R. McMaster was frustrated by what he sees as disorganization and indiscipline on key policy issues inside the White House. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that Tillerson was very upset at not having autonomy, independence and control over his own department and the ability to do the job the way the job ... is traditionally done. The source said he had heard nothing about any possible departure, but added: The situation doesnt seem to be getting any better, and in some respects appears to be getting worse. R.C. Hammond, Tillersons spokesman, denied Tillerson was considering leaving or that his frustrations were boiling over, saying he had plenty of reasons to stay on the job, and all of them are important to America. Theres a desperate need for American leadership in the world and thats where the secretarys focusing his attention, he said. Tillerson scored a policy win last week when the administration certified, albeit reluctantly, that Iran was complying with the 2015 nuclear deal under which Tehran agreed to restrain its atomic program in exchange for sanctions relief. He was upset, however, by fierce internal criticism from Trump, as well as his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and White House aide Sebastian Gorka, over the decision, said another  U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The secretary does not feel that White House staff members should be in a position to conduct hostile cross-(examinations) of Cabinet officials, the official said.    Hammond disputed the account of harsh discord between Trump and Tillerson regarding recertifying the Iran nuclear deal, saying: I dont buy this whole thing that there are tensions. Developing public policy is about vetting out ideas, he said. Following last months move by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to boycott Qatar, which they accuse of financing extremist groups and supporting terrorism, Tillerson publicly asked the nations to ease their blockade, and put the onus on both sides to end the crisis. Less than 90 minutes later, Trump accused Qatar of being a high level sponsor of terrorism and suggested he had helped plan the Qatar action with Arab leaders. As a government we offered some confusing signals, but weve since been able to clear up and clarify that, Hammond said. Politico reported last month that Tillerson was furious with Johnny DeStefano, the head of the presidential personnel office, for torpedoing proposed nominees to key State Department posts. Senior national security officials said McMaster was dismayed that his recommendations, backed by his senior director for Russia, Fiona Hill, about taking a tough stance with Russian President Vladimir Putin, had been ignored. Trump has questioned the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to try to help him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. McMaster, a three-star Army general who once praised Trump as a disruptive figure, is also troubled by a protracted debate about sending more U.S. forces to help Afghanistan reverse gains by the Taliban, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. Asked to respond to the characterizations of the views of McMaster and other officials, a White House official said: Assertions not of fact but of state of mind in internal thought have no place in a story like this.     While circumspect, Tillerson talked about the challenges of his new job earlier this month, telling reporters that it differed from his former role as chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp, where I was the ultimate decision-maker. That always makes life easier. I knew what to expect and we had very long-standing disciplined processes and decision-making, he said.

Democrats proposed new standards that companies must meet to complete large mergers and enhanced post-merger reviews, singling out the airline, telecommunications, beer, food and eyeglass industries as areas of concern in the proposal dubbed A Better Deal for working Americans.  Last year, Republicans proposed legislative goals with a similar title: A Better Way. The Democrats platform is a move to regroup ahead of the 2018 midterm congressional elections, after Hillary Clintons loss to Republican President Donald Trump in 2016. Republicans control both the House and the Senate. Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, accused Trump of running a populist election campaign and then abandoning working people for special interests once in the White House. We cant delude anyone that this Congress will begin passing our priorities tomorrow but we have to start presenting our vision for the countrys future, Schumer said at a kickoff event in the town of Berryville, Virginia. Accompanying Schumer was House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen and Amy Klobuchar, and Representatives Hakeem Jeffries and David Cicilline, among others. Democrats want to create an independent government agency that would crack down on drug companies that raise prices excessively. They also want to allow Medicare, the government health insurance program for the elderly, to negotiate prices with manufacturers. Additionally, drug companies would need to justify big price hikes to the government. Policy proposals provided to reporters singled out a few companies by name, including Turing Pharmaceuticals and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. One document criticized United Continental Holdings Inc for the brutal assault of a United passenger who was already seated on an overbooked flight and refused to give up his seat for a crew member.  Separately, if AT&T Incs purchase of Time Warner Inc succeeds, it would allow the resulting behemoths to unfairly discriminate against smaller distributors, one document stated. When Anheuser Busch InBev, the worlds largest beer maker, purchased SABMiller, the second-largest beer company, it put smaller brewers at a disadvantage, the documents said. Mergers between Dow Chemical Co and DuPont, Monsanto Co with Bayer AG and Syngenta AG with ChemChina threaten the safety of food and agriculture in America, one document said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""DETROIT (Reuters) - A federal judge in Michigan halted on Monday the deportation of more than 1,400 Iraqi nationals from the United States, the latest legal victory for the Iraqi nationals facing deportation in a closely watched case. U.S. DistrictJudge Mark Goldsmith granted a preliminary injunction requested by American Civil Liberties Union lawyers, who argued the immigrants would face persecution in Iraq because they are considered ethnic and religious minorities there. Goldsmith said the injunction provides detainees time to challenge their removal in federal courts. He said many of them faced a feverish search for legal assistance after their deportation orders were unexpectedly resurrected by the U.S. government after several years. Goldsmith wrote, in his 34-page opinion and order, the extra time assures that those who might be subjected to grave harm and possible death are not cast out of this country before having their day in court.  The decision effectively means no Iraqi nationals can be deported from the United States for several months.  It was not immediately known whether the U.S. government would appeal. A representative for the U.S. Attorneys Office in Detroit was not immediately available for comment. There are 1,444 Iraqi nationals who have final deportation orders against them in the U.S., although only about 199 of them were detained in June as part of a nationwide sweep by immigration authorities.  The ACLU sued on June 15 to halt the deportations, arguing the Iraqis could face persecution, torture, or death because many were Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims, or Iraqi Kurds and that the groups were recognized as targets of ill-treatment in Iraq. Those arrested by immigration authorities had outstanding deportation orders and many had been convicted of serious crimes, ranging from homicide to weapons and drug charges, the U.S. government said. Goldsmith sided with the ACLU, expanding on June 26 an earlier stay which only protected 114 detainees from the Detroit area to the broader class of more than 1,400 Iraqi nationals nationwide. Goldsmiths Monday decision came hours before that injunction was set to expire. The ACLU argued many Iraqi detainees have had difficulty obtaining critical government documents needed to file deportation order appeals, and also that the government has transferred many detainees to facilities in different parts of the country, separating them from their lawyers and families. Under Goldsmiths ruling, immigration authorities must provide the ACLU with bi-weekly reports about each Iraqi that include where they are detained. On Friday, a federal prosecutor told Goldsmith his injunction was not necessary because many of the detainees were appealing final deportation orders through immigration court. The roundup of Iraqis in the Detroit area followed Iraqs agreement to accept deportees as part of a deal that removed the country from Trumps revised temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries. Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago but were allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to the agreement in March.          ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""KABUL (Reuters) - (This version of the July 23 story corrects reference to A-29 Super Tucano in para 7. The aircraft are built in the United States under an agreement between their Brazilian manufacturer, Embraer and Sierra Nevada Corp.) As the U.S. administration prepares its new strategy for Afghanistan, the Kabul government and its Western allies are working hard to develop an air force that gives government forces the advantage in their war against Taliban militants. The level of equipment, training and assets falls far short of matching the air assets the Americans still maintain in Afghanistan, but billions of dollars are earmarked for the force which is being built up almost from scratch. That is what will provide the asymmetric advantage to break the stalemate on the ground, Brigadier-General Phillip Stewart, commander of TAAC-Air, the Resolute Support mission advising the air force, told Reuters. A four-year, $7 billion expansion plan is aimed at training more flight and maintenance crews and increasing the number of aircraft in the Afghan Air Force (AAF). In 2014, remember, we (NATO and the U.S. military in Afghanistan) had the best air force in the world and the coalition pulled out and we realized we hadnt grown the Afghan Air Force, Stewart said. U.S. officers say the aim is to build a counter-insurgency force able to support troops fighting in remote and forbidding terrain with air strikes, supplies and intelligence. The air force is already conducting some air strikes using Brazilian-designed A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft and specially adapted MD-530 scout helicopters and it is building capacity in other areas. Last month, an Afghan air crew parachuted around 400 kg of supplies to an isolated border police outpost, the first time the AAF had conducted an aerial supply drop. We can do casualty evacuations, we can take cargo, we can take ammunition, we can transport vehicles to different places where they cant go by road, said Major Khail Shinwari, an Afghan C-130 Hercules pilot. The AAF has about 120 aircraft in service, ranging from small propeller Cessna 208s to old Soviet-era helicopters, as well as the A-29s, MD-530s and its four veteran C-130 Hercules transporters. In coming years, the old Russian Mi-17s helicopters, which are increasingly difficult to maintain, will be replaced by American UH-60 Black Hawks. The AAF says it is flying up to 140 sorties a day, carrying supplies and providing close air support to troops fighting the Afghan Taliban and Islamic State. But whether it can be built up quickly enough to turn the tide against the stubborn Taliban insurgency is unclear. All the air power of the NATO-led coalition was not enough to defeat the militants and the AAF is nowhere near being able operate alone. U.S. drones, F-16s and Apache attack helicopters are still heavily engaged in areas like Helmand, where U.S. aircraft conducted at least 52 air strikes in the space of five days last week in support of Afghan forces. For the moment, the Afghan A-29s are still using unguided bombs rather than the guided weapons used by the Americans, and the MD-530 helicopters, which came into service in 2015, fire machine guns and rockets attached to their landing gear. Its close air support but not as anyone who grew up in the U.S. Air Force would understand it, Stewart said. Its not precision, its .50 cal(ibre machine guns) and rockets but they get close to their work and theyre very good. U.S. trainers say Afghan pilots and crews are being trained to a standard comparable with their American counterparts. But the length of time it takes to train crews - up to four years for pilots and as much as seven years for specialized mechanics - means it will be years before the air force can operate fully independently. For the moment, the emphasis is on building a force suitable for Afghanistan, which means using less complicated equipment such as the C-208s or MD-350 helicopters at the expense of maybe getting some bigger, sexier platform, Stewart said. The aim is to increase the effectiveness of the security forces, which advisers hope to get to a point where the Taliban are forced to negotiate a political settlement. As the AAF has grown, however, it has faced increasing pressure from army units to step up operations. Advisers say one of the main risks it faces is overstretch. They just dont have the airplanes and sometimes the ground forces will become frustrated because they want more, Stewart said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Senate will vote on Tuesday on whether to open debate on an overhaul of the law, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promising an open amendment process and a robust debate. To every member of the Senate I say this: The American people have waited long enough. Theres been enough talk, and no action. Now is the time for action, Trump said on Monday at the White House. Standing in front of families who he said had been hurt by the law popularly known as Obamacare, Trump said, So far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare. Even as it remained unclear on Monday whether McConnell had enough votes in the Senate to open debate, he said the vote would take place regardless. I know many of us have waited years for thismoment to finally arrive. And, at long last, it finally has. I would urge every colleague to join me, McConnell said. Senator John McCain, who has been battling brain cancer in his home state of Arizona, is expected to return to the Senate to cast a vote, his office said on Monday.      Moderate Senator Susan Collins, who has vocally opposed McConnells efforts so far, said on Monday she would vote no on a motion to proceed.  Republicans have been under heavy political pressure to make good on their longstanding campaign promises to gut the 2010 law, which they view as a government intrusion in the healthcare market. But the party is deeply divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to the Obamacare legislation. Senate Republicans have been unable to reach consensus on an approach, with McConnell failing to secure enough votes for either a repeal and replacement of Obamacare or a straight repeal. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the 100-member Senate. With Democrats united in opposition, McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes.  The question for every senator, Democrat or Republican, is whether they will side with Obamacares architects, which have been so destructive to our country, or its forgotten victims? Trump said. While Trump has repeatedly called on Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare, he has shown little interest in the policy specifics. Trump last week initially suggested he was fine with letting Obamacare collapse, then urged Republican senators to hash out a deal. His remarks on Monday were among the lengthiest statements he has made regarding healthcare. Obamacare is death. Thats the one thats death, Trump said. And besides that, its failing so you wont have it anyway. McConnell will ask senators whether to begin debate on the healthcare bill passed in May by the House of Representatives. If that procedural vote succeeds, the House bill would then be open for amendment on the Senate floor. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the Senates replacement bill could lead to as many as 22 million fewer Americans being insured. A plan to repeal Obamacare without replacing it could cost 32 million Americans their health insurance by 2026, CBO estimated. At the same time, premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026 if Obamacare is repealed, CBO said. Uncertainty over the future of healthcare has left health insurance companies and U.S. states as well as hospitals and doctors unclear about future funding and coverage. Public opinion polls also show Americans worried about potential changes to the healthcare system.       ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

All of my actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events of a very unique campaign, Kushner later told  reporters outside the White House. I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did. Kushner, 36, a senior White House adviser, met Senate Intelligence Committee staff behind closed doors for about two hours. Two sources with knowledge of what Kushner told them said the session was pleasant and conversational. In an 11-page written statement Kushner made public before the meeting, the real estate businessman portrayed himself as new to politics when he became a top adviser to Trumps 2016 campaign. The letter was his fullest account to date of contacts with Russian officials. A businessman married to Trumps eldest daughter Ivanka Trump, Kushner has rarely spoken in public since his father-in-law launched his presidential campaign in mid-2015. I am not a person who has sought the spotlight, he wrote in the letter. Trump prevailed over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in November 2016 because he ran a smarter campaign and to suggest otherwise ridicules those who voted for him, Kushner said at the White House. He took no questions. The congressional committee is one of several investigating the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, engaged in a hacking and propaganda campaign to try to tilt the November election in Trumps favor. Russia denies the accusation and Trump denies his campaign colluded with Moscow. Special counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter.  A steady drip of information, much of it leaked to the news media, about contacts that Trump aides had with Russians has raised questions about possible collusion with Moscow, viewed by many of Trumps fellow Republicans and rival Democrats as a hostile power trying to undermine U.S. interests around the world. Trump, who has called the Russia probes politically motivated, lashed out at the investigations in Twitter messages on Monday.  Kushner did not initially disclose any meetings with Russians on forms he filed to get a government security clearance for his work in the White House. He has since revised those forms several times. According to the sources with knowledge of Mondays meeting, Kushner told the investigators that his lawyers and staff had not handled his security clearance form properly but they informed the FBI immediately when they realized it had been sent before it was complete, and then submitted a complete version. He said in his written statement that the initial form omitted not just Russian contacts but also all foreign contacts. In his written statement Kushner said he first met Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in Washington in April 2016 and they shook hands.  He said that in a Dec. 1 meeting with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador asked if there was a secure line in Trumps transition office to facilitate a discussion with Russian generals about Syria, and Kushner replied there was not.  Kushner said he asked if there was an existing communications channel at the Russian Embassy that could be used, but Kislyak said that was not possible and they agreed to follow up after the inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a secret back channel, Kushner said. Kushner said he met on Dec. 13, with Sergei Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned Vnesheconombank, because of Kislyaks insistence and because the Russian had a direct relationship with Putin. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts - one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village, Kushner said. He said that neither sanctions imposed by Democratic former President Barack Obamas administration nor Kushners business activities were discussed. Vnesheconombank has been subjected to U.S. economic sanctions since mid-2014 over Russias annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Relations between the United States and Russia deteriorated under Obama and Trump has said he wants to improve ties with Moscow, at times expressing admiration for Putin.

The judge said a lawsuit by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) watchdog did not have grounds for an injunction in part because the collection of data by the commission was not technically an action by a government agency so was not bound by laws that govern what such entities can do.  Washington-based U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly also pointed out that the commission was an advisory body that does not have legal authority to compel states to hand over the data. Most state officials who oversee elections and election law experts say that voter fraud is rare in the United States. Trump, who set up the commission by executive order on May 12, has charged without evidence that millions voted unlawfully in the November presidential election.  Republican Trump won the Electoral College, which tallies wins in states and determines the presidential winner. But he lost the popular vote to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. We look forward to continuing to work with state election leaders to gather information and identify opportunities to improve election integrity, the commissions vice chair Kris Kobach said in a statement after Mondays ruling. Kobach is the secretary of state for Kansas and a high-profile advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commission could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder to vote. The panel, chaired by Vice President Mike Pence, met for the first time last week. It ran headlong into controversy when Kobach asked states to turn over voter information. The data included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. Some states refused, and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data.  The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a separate lawsuit against the commission to ensure that it follows open government laws. The commissions efforts to gather personal data should not escape judicial review, EPICs senior counsel Alan Butler said in a statement, adding the group would closely watch what the commission does next.

The budget research office, known as the CBO, has drawn recent Republican criticism, including from the White House, after it concluded that Republican proposals to replace Obamacare would lead to 23 million more Americans being uninsured if they became law. Representative Mark Meadows, head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said on Monday his colleague Morgan Griffith has offered an amendment to an appropriations bill the House is expected to take up this week that would cut the CBOs staff of 235 by 89 employees, saving about $15 million. They ought to be aggregators, Meadows said of the CBO at a National Press Club lunch. Theres plenty of think tanks that are out there. We ought to take a score from Heritage, from AEI (American Enterprise Institute), from Brookings, from the Urban Institute and bring them together for a composite score. The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank based in Washington, as is the American Enterprise Institute. The Brookings Institution and Urban Institute are liberal-leaning think tanks based in Washington. The CBO is one of a handful of analysis units of Congress whose employees strive for political impartiality, providing dependable and neutral information that lawmakers can use when making often complex budget, tax and other decisions. Its staff includes economists, public policy analysts, lawyers and editors. In May, after Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney called the CBOs healthcare analysis absurd and questioned its continued existence, Democrats defended the office, saying Republican attacks were irresponsible. When Trump administration officials either disagree with or do not understand the impacts of their own policies, they prefer to attack the nonpartisan analysts who are doing their jobs with integrity and expertise, Representative Steny Hoyer, a Democratic House leader, said at the time. The CBO was created in 1974 during a spending dispute between the Democratic-controlled Congress and Republican President Richard Nixon after he withheld funds for government programs that did not support his political positions.

While the risk of a recession within the next 12 months has fallen into a 15-20 percent range from 20-25 percent, the rate of economic expansion is expected to remain fairly anemic at 1.8 percent over the longer term (roughly 10 years), well below the 3.0 percent average growth rate that prevailed from 1980 to 2000, the report said. And while the risk that federal policy could trigger a recession has eased, the potential for a dramatic scaling-back of federal aid for Medicaid has never been greater, the report said. The slow-growth economy is producing sluggish revenue trends for the states, said Gabriel Petek, an analyst at S&P, in a telephone interview.  S&P does not expect Washington will enact a federally funded public infrastructure package in the next two years, which will put further stresses on state budget management. Addressing deferred maintenance and inadequate capacity in public infrastructure will depend heavily on state and local government solutions, the report said. Without a possible bump in growth from a federal infrastructure package, projected GDP growth for 2017 was lowered to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent, the report said. Anything that is done at the federal level would imply that more of the burden has to be picked up by the state and local government level in the area of infrastructure investment, Petek said. The report added that the U.S. mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) will have the slowest growing economy compared to other regions. Real GDP growth for the region is projected at 1.25 percent for 2017, the report said. The best performing region forecast for the current year, with an economic growth forecast of 2.88 percent is the Mountain region (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming). Overall, regional economies growth rates are expected to peak in 2018 before some of those gains ebb, the reports data showed. The best performing region forecast for 2018 are the states in the West South Central region (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas) with a combined growth rate of 3.36 percent, followed closely by the Mountain region at 3.29 percent and Pacific region at 2.93 percent.

The Republican governor set a July 31 deadline for enacting a new funding formula without extra money for Chicago Public Schools (CPS) teacher pensions that was included in a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature in late May. We must act now, which is why Im calling lawmakers back to Springfield for a special session. Our schools must open on time, Rauner said in a statement. At a news conference earlier on Monday, Rauner accused Democrats who control the legislature of playing political games with the states approximately 2 million school children by not sending him the education funding bill. Rauner said he supports the bills establishment of an evidence-based model that ties public school funding to best practices aimed at enhancing student achievement. But the measure also addresses a state funding disparity for CPS pensions, which the governor has labeled a bailout for a badly managed retirement system. The $36 billion fiscal 2018 state budget the legislature enacted earlier this month over Rauners veto prohibits the flow of state money to schools in the absence of an evidence-based funding model. That has raised the possibility some school districts largely dependent on state funding may not be able to open in August.  Rauner dismissed a request by Democratic Senate President John Cullerton to meet with legislative leaders so the governor can make a rational decision on the bill. Id like to have a conversation with Governor Rauner in hopes of getting some clarity as to exactly what is going on, Cullerton said in a statement on Monday. We slowed down the process in the Senate in order to let everyone blow off some steam, politically speaking. Rauner, who insisted on getting the bill on his desk before holding any discussions, declined to describe in detail his amendatory veto plans for CPS funding in the bill. Data posted on his website indicated the bills $293 million funding boost for CPS for state aid and pensions would be sliced nearly in half, freeing up $145 million for other school districts. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for CPS, the nations third-largest public school system. The governor called the CPS pension funding a poison pill in the legislation, adding that it should be taken up separately. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Pruitts frequent visits to Oklahoma have raised concerns among critics that he is cultivating political relationships in the state at taxpayer expense, instead of focusing on his job as head of the environmental regulator. EPA officials contend that  Pruitt works hard and pays for his trips home to Tulsa to see his wife and children. Administrator Pruitt works long hours and is available around the clock,said EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman. He is extremely focused and disciplined, which is evident by the fact that he spearheaded over two dozen significant regulatory actions since being sworn in. Pruitt has riled environmentalists by routinely raising doubts about the realities of climate change and by vowing to sweep away scores of Obama-era regulations rules to help business. Before becoming head of the EPA under Republican President Donald Trump, he was Oklahomas attorney general and repeatedly sued the agency he now runs to block federal environmental rules. The travel records show Pruitts schedule this spring often took him to cities in the U.S. heartland where he held meetings  often with oil and gas industry representatives - made speeches and attended events, before flying to Tulsa for extended weekends.  The records showed Pruitt paid for some legs of the trips directly related to his visits home, although it was not clear he paid for all such legs. The airfare for Pruitts travel to and from Oklahoma totaled more than $12,000, the Environmental Integrity Project said. That did not include travel and lodging expenses for his staff or his security detail, the records for which were not immediately available. The practice of spending long weekends away from Washington was seen as unusual by former officials.

The decision amounts to a rejection of requests by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for courts and law enforcement agencies to hold illegal immigrants, who are facing civil deportation orders, in custody for up to 48 hours after their cases are resolved. The Supreme Judicial Court ruled that doing so amounts to a fresh arrest of the person that is not authorized by state law, in the first such ruling to apply to an entire state, according to Massachusetts attorney general. Massachusetts law provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody, the court wrote in its decision. The case focused on Sreynuon Lunn from Cambodia. Federal officials said he entered the United States as a refugee in 1985 and was ordered deported to Cambodia in 2008 after a series of criminal convictions. Cambodia declined to accept him and he was released. Lunn was arrested in Boston last year on an unarmed robbery charge and ordered released in February after prosecutors failed to present a case. Federal ICE officials took him into custody while he remained in his holding cell, an event that made his case moot. The court agreed to hear the case on the premise that the issue would come up again. The U.S. Justice Department had argued that the 48-hour detainer requests reflected basic practices of cooperation between various law enforcement agencies. Attorneys for Lunn and the state had largely agreed that Massachusetts lacked the authority. This decision allows local law enforcement to focus their resources on keeping people safe, said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a top priority of his administration. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts praised the decision.    At a timewhen the Trump administrationis pushing aggressive and discriminatory immigration enforcement policies, Massachusetts is leading nationwide efforts by limiting how state and local lawenforcement assist, the groups executive director, Carol Rose, said in a statement.

The following are some of the main points in the statement: - Kushner said he became a point of contact for foreign countries once it was clear that Trump would be the Republican presidential nominee. Kushner said he had incoming contacts with people from roughly 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails, he said. - Kushner said he was introduced to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, among other foreign dignitaries, in April 2016  at a Washington hotel where then-candidate Trump was making a speech. He said he shook hands with the dignitaries at the reception. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election ... Each exchange lasted less than a minute, he said. - Kushner said he attended a meeting, at the invitation of his brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr., on June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower in New York.

No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted, he said. - After Trump won the election, ambassador Kislyak on Nov. 16 invited Kushner to a meeting, Kushner said. He said that at the time, he could not recall the ambassadors name. When he and Kislyak met at Trump Tower on Dec. 1, Kushner said he asked Kislyak to identify the best person to be a contact for direct discussions and a line to Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Kushner said he met on Dec. 13 with Sergey Gorkov, a Russian banker, for 20-25 minutes and received gifts of a piece of art and a bag of dirt, both from a village in Belarus where Kushners grandparents were from.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - I am voluntarily providing this statement, submitting documents, and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the Trump for President Campaign and during the transition period. I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception. Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. My Role in the Trump for President Campaign Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-laws campaign when he decided to run for President. However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility.  Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials. All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaigns ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not. It is also important to note that a campaigns success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people. Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons  When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail. To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange. With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in  Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trumps speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to Americas foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions. Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador. When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, What is the name of the Russian ambassador? Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred. The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m. The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the others meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner. No one else was mentioned. I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting. I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form. There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname Guccifer400. This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trumps tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all traveling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply  which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again. To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.  Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited. On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassadors name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks  on December 1. The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the Presidents National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day. The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his generals. He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a secret back channel. I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions. Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12. My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13. The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts  one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since.  To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government. Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it. In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017. That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had numerous contacts with foreign officials and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form. It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordans King Abdullah II, Israels Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexicos Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before. Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be update(d), clarif(ied), and explain(ed) as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting. For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the meeting. As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia. I have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved. It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest.

The EU has barred its firms from doing business with Crimea since the 2014 annexation, imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities, and curbed cooperation with Russia in energy, arms and finance over its role in the crisis in Ukraine.  After it annexed Crimea from Kiev, Moscow threw its support behind a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine, which has killed more than 10,000 people and is still simmering.  The EUs blacklist comprises 150 people and 37 entities subject to an asset freeze and a travel ban. The restrictions are in place until Sept. 15. The regular review would normally be the moment to look at who is on the list. In the past, when there were good grounds, weve added entries to the list, an EU official said.  Siemens, trying to distance itself from the scandal, last week said it was halting deliveries of power equipment to Russian state-controlled customers and reviewing supply deals. Russias Energy Minister Alexander Novak played down the potential consequences of a halt. What Siemens supplies can be delivered by other companies, Novak told reporters in St Petersburg. As for electricity generation, we ... have now learnt to produce the necessary equipment, he said, without referring to the prospect of additional sanctions. Siemens says it has evidence that all four turbines it delivered for a project in southern Russia had been illegally moved to Crimea. German government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said on Monday the turbines were delivered to Crimea against the terms of the contract and despite high-ranking assurances from Russian officials that this would not happen. Berlin was consulting on what consequences this unacceptable operation might have, she said, adding, however, that the onus was on companies to ensure they did not violate the sanctions regime.  The proposed additions to the blacklist could include Russian Energy Ministry officials and the Russian company that moved the turbines to the Black Sea peninsula, one senior diplomatic source in Brussels said. Another source said representatives of all 28 EU member states could discuss the matter for the first time in Brussels as soon as Wednesday.  The EU needs unanimity to impose or extend any sanctions. Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy and Cyprus are among EU states which are usually skeptical of Russia sanctions. They take the line that punitive measures have failed to force a change of course by Moscow while hurting European business. Reuters first reported a year ago on the Siemens case, which has exposed the difficulties of imposing EU sanctions.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump was open to signing legislation toughening sanctions on Russia after Senate and House leaders reached agreement on a bill late last week. Congressional Democrats said on Saturday they had agreed with Republicans on a deal allowing new sanctions targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea in a bill that would limit any potential effort by Trump to try to lift sanctions against Moscow. We support where the legislation is now and will continue working with the House and Senate to put those tough sanctions in place on Russia until the situation in Ukraine is fully resolved and it certainly isnt right now, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told ABCs This Week with George Stephanopoulos program. A White House official said the administrations view of the legislation evolved after changes were made, including the addition of sanctions on North Korea.  The official said the administration supports the direction the bill is headed, but wont weigh in conclusively until there is a final piece of legislation and no more changes are being made. Anthony Scaramucci, Trumps new communications director, said Trump had not yet decided whether he would sign the bill. My guess is ... that hes going to make that decision shortly, Scaramucci told CNNs State of the Union. Trump has faced resistance from Republican and Democratic lawmakers for his pledge to pursue warmer relations with Moscow. His administration has been bogged down by investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia. With the bill, Republicans and Democrats are seeking to punish Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied any interference in the U.S. democratic process last year. The House is expected to vote on the sanctions bill on Tuesday. The legislation would require the president to submit to Congress a report on proposed actions that would significantly alter U.S. policy toward Russia, including easing sanctions or returning diplomatic properties in Maryland and New York that former President Barack Obama ordered vacated in December. Congress would have at least 30 days to hold hearings and then vote to uphold or reject Trumps proposed changes. If Trump were to veto the bill, he would run the risk of an embarrassing political setback if Congress were to override his veto. In recent weeks, Trump administration officials have met with lawmakers to argue against parts of the Senate version of the bill, including the requirement that Trump obtain Congress permission before easing sanctions. The sanctions bill, known as the Countering Irans Destabilizing Activities Act, was passed by the Senate a month ago but held up in the House of Representatives after Republicans proposed including sanctions on North Korea.  Lawmakers, including Republican Senator John Thune and Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Sunday the bill had broad bipartisan support.  I think (it) will pass probably overwhelmingly again in the Senate and with a veto-proof majority, Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, told Fox News Sunday. In Brussels, the European Union has sounded an alarm about the U.S. moves to step up sanctions on Russia, urging Washington to coordinate with its Group of 7 partners. The European Commission, the EU executive, will consider its next steps at a meeting on Wednesday in Brussels if Trump signs the bill into law, and is willing to consider retaliation, according to an EU official. After warning against unilateral U.S. sanctions at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is concerned Congress legislation could hit European companies upgrading pipelines in Russia that feed into Ukraines gas transit system. The measures could also target European companies doing legitimate business with Russia in rail transport, financial, shipping and mining, the EU official said. Any significant EU retaliation would need the support, however, of the EUs 28 governments and would face resistance from members of the bloc, such as Britain and Hungary, that are reluctant to upset the Trump administration.

The White House said on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump was open to signing legislation toughening sanctions on Russia after Senate and House leaders reached agreement on a bill late last week. That has raised concerns in Germany which has already threatened to retaliate against the United States if the new sanctions end up penalising German firms, such as those involved with building Nord Stream 2, a project to build a pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call Moscow was worried that U.S. sanctions could hit third countries, as well as Russia, hard. We are working with our European partners on implementing a number of large-scale projects, said Peskov, when asked about the possible impact of the new U.S. sanctions on projects like  Nord Stream 2. It goes without saying that we and our European partners attach great importance to finishing these projects and we will work towards this, he said. That is why discussions about sanctions themes  which could potentially obstruct these projects  are a cause of concern for us. Peskov said the Kremlin took an extremely negative view of the proposed new sanctions, calling the rhetoric surrounding them counter-productive and damaging to U.S.-Russia ties. But he said Moscow was for now ready to wait and see what the final shape of the sanctions might be. As for the Washington administrations stance on sanctions, we have seen some corrections to it, said Peskov. We will wait patiently ... until this position has been formulated unambiguously. Separately, Peskov declined to comment on reports that the European Union might discuss new sanctions against Moscow over its delivery of Siemens turbines to sanctioned Crimea.

A bill agreed by U.S. Senate and House leaders foresees fines for companies aiding Russia to build energy export pipelines. EU firms involved in Nord Stream 2, a 9.5 billion euro ($11.1 billion) project to carry Russian gas across the Baltic, are likely to be affected. Both the European Union and the United States imposed broad economic sanctions on Russias financial, defense and energy sectors in response to Moscows annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its direct support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. But northern EU states in particular have sought to shield the supplies of Russian gas that they rely on.  Markus Beyrer, director of the EUs main business lobby, Business Europe, urged Washington to avoid unilateral actions that would mainly hit the EU, its citizens and its companies. The Commission, the EU executive, will discuss next steps on Wednesday, a day after the U.S. House of Representatives votes on the legislation, knowing that the U.S. move threatens to reopen divisions over the blocs own Russia sanctions. Among the European companies involved in Nord Stream 2 are German oil and gas group Wintershall, German energy trading firm Uniper, Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, Austrias OMV and Frances Engie. The Commission could demand a formal U.S. promise to exclude EU energy companies; use EU laws to block U.S. measures against European entities; or impose outright bans on doing business with certain U.S. companies, an EU official said. But if no such promise is offered, punitive sanctions such as limiting the access of U.S. companies to EU banks require unanimity from the 28 EU member states. Ex-Soviet states such as Poland and the Baltic states are unlikely to vote for retaliation to protect a project they have resisted because it would increase EU dependence on Russian gas. An EU official said most member states saw Nord Stream 2 as contrary or at least not fully in line with European objectives of reducing reliance on Russian energy. Britain, one of the United States closest allies, is also wary of challenging the U.S. Congress as it prepares to leave the EU and seeks a trade deal with Washington. In fact, the EUs chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, has few tools that do not require unanimous support from the blocs 28 governments. The Commission could act alone to file a complaint at the World Trade Organisation. But imposing punitive tariffs on U.S. goods would require detailed proof to be gathered that European companies were being unfairly disadvantaged - a process that would take many months. Diplomatic protests such as cutting EU official visits to Washington are unlikely to have much effect, since requests by EU commissioners for meetings with members of Trumps administration have gone unanswered, EU aides say. As if to highlight the confusion in the EUs position, two sources in Brussels told Reuters that Germany was urging the EU to add up to four more Russian nationals and companies to the blocs own sanctions blacklist, after evidence emerged that gas turbines built by Germanys Siemens had been delivered to Crimea in contravention of sanctions. As the EUs trade with Russia has tumbled, keeping unity to maintain the sanctions has been strained by rival business interests that have been worsened by a perceived lack of U.S. leadership since President Donald Trump entered the White House in January. However, the White House said on Sunday that Trump was open to signing the bill once it is agreed. Meanwhile there is little or no sign that the Western sanctions have had any tangible effect in Ukraine, as the Russian-backed rebellion in the countrys industrial east continues unabated.

President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned on a pledge to roll back former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, told Fox News Sunday the initial vote was simply a way to open debate on the bill so that senators from both parties could offer amendments. The first vote, which will occur sometime this week, will be to proceed to the consideration of that legislation and to at least have a debate where we can have an open amendment process, Thune said. The Republican-controlled House in May passed its version of a healthcare bill. Senate Republicans have considered two versions of related legislation but have been unable to reach consensus after estimates showed as many as 22 million fewer Americans would be insured if the proposals became law. A plan to repeal Obamacare without replacing it also ran aground. Republicans control a narrow majority in the Senate, holding 52 of 100 seats. With the Democrats united in opposition to the Republican effort, Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose the votes of two Republican senators. The fate of any legislation to rewrite Obamacare is uncertain as many Republicans have not yet made clear their positions. It appears well have a vote on Tuesday but we dont know whether well be voting on the House bill, the first version of the Senate bill, the second version of the Senate bill, Republican Senator Susan Collins told CBS Face the Nation on Sunday. Collins is a moderate Republican who has objected to prior versions of the Senate bill and also to repealing Obamacare without replacing it. Trump suggested last week that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail, but he then switched course and invited Republican senators to the White House to try to hash out a healthcare deal. The Republican effort has also been complicated by the absence of Republican Senator John McCain, who has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has been in his home state of Arizona weighing treatment options.

Scaramucci told CBSs Face the Nation that leakers are actually un-American, and that he would lead a team meeting on Monday.

Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, was appointed to his current role on July 7 to help resolve the conflict between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists, which has  killed more than 10,000 people since 2014.   Washington cites the conflict as a key obstacle to better relations with Russia.  On a visit to the Ukrainian-held town of Kramatorsk, 690 km (430 miles) southeast of Kiev, Volker said he would prepare a set of recommendations on how Washington can better engage with the peace process. This is not a frozen conflict, this is a hot war, and its an immediate crisis that we all need to address as quickly as possible, he said. Relations between Ukraine and Russia went into freefall after Moscows 2014 annexation of Crimea and the subsequent outbreak of a pro-Russian insurgency in the eastern Donbass region. Ukraine accuses Russian of sending in its own soldiers and military equipment, which Moscow denies. Volker replied in the affirmative when asked whether he saw the conflict as being as the result of Russian aggression rather than internal Ukrainian factors. Weve seen whats happened, we understand the way this conflict has begun, we understand the way it is being managed today, and thats why its important that the United States become more engaged. Fighting in the Donbass region has killed 12 people in a particularly bloody week, prompting Germany and France to urge immediate progress in implementing ceasefire agreements signed in Belarus in 2015 that are regularly flouted.  Leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia will speak by phone on Monday to discuss the conflict.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in early July that Russia must make the first move to bring peace to Ukraine, which President Petro Poroshenko called a powerful signal of Washingtons backing. A career diplomat, Volker is a former aide to Republican Senator John McCain, a Russia hawk who wants the United States to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine, a move the previous administration under Barack Obama shied away from.

The Russian embassy in Washington said on its Twitter feed that Minister-Counseler and Deputy Chief of Mission Denis V. Gonchar would serve as Charge dAffaires until Kislyaks successor arrived. Kislyak, who held the post since 2008, is expected to be replaced by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Antonov. Antonovs nomination for the post, which has yet to be approved by the Kremlin, comes at a time of intense scrutiny over Moscow-Washington relations following U.S. allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. election last year. Kislyaks name has emerged in relation to several of Trumps associates as a special counsel and congressional panels investigate Russian meddling and possible ties with the Trump campaign.      On Friday, the Washington Post reported Kislyak was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses he had discussed campaign-related matters, including issues important to Moscow, with Jeff Sessions during the 2016 presidential race. As Attorney General, Sessions recused himself in March from matters connected to an investigation by the FBI following his admission he had talked to the Russian envoy. Sessions has denied discussing campaign issues with Russian officials and has said he only met Kislyak in his role of U.S. senator. Former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign in February after it became known that he had failed to disclose the content of conversations he had with Kislyak and misled the vice president about their meetings. Trumps senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner also failed to disclose contacts with Russia when seeking his security clearance, the New York Times reported in April. The White House disclosed in March that Kushner met with Kislyak at Trump Tower in December 2016, in addition to seeing Kislyak when he attended an April 2016 campaign speech in Washington. The White House said the December meeting was to establish a line of communication. Kushner also had phone calls with Kislyak between April and November 2016, Reuters reported. Kushners attorney has said that Kushner had no recollection of the calls as he had participated in thousands of calls in this time period. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia. The White House said this week Trump would nominate Jon Huntsman as his new ambassador to Russia.

(Reuters) - National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers on Saturday rebuffed the prospect for a U.S.-Russia cyber unit, a proposal which has been greeted with incredulity by several senior U.S. lawmakers and which President Donald Trump himself appeared to back down from after initially indicating interest. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democrats emails and distributing online propaganda to help Trump win the election over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump has said that  his campaign did not collude with Russia. A Russian presidential envoy said this week that Moscow and Washington were in talks to create a joint cyber security working group. Asked whether it was a good idea to set up a cyber security cell with the Russians, Rogers told the annual Aspen Security Forum: Im not a policy guy here. .... I would argue now is probably not the best time to be doing this. Trump said earlier this month that he had discussed the idea of creating such a group with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg. Senior Republicans criticized the idea, saying Moscow could not be trusted, and Trump later appeared to back away, saying in a post on Twitter: The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesnt mean I think it can happen. It cant. Widespread concern and confusion about the possible cyber working group reflects the Trump administrations struggles to articulate a clear approach to international cyber security issues amid inconsistent statements by the president and ongoing personnel changes.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement on legislation that allows new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, leading congressional Democrats said on Saturday, in a bill that would limit any potential effort by President Donald Trump to try to lift sanctions against Moscow.      The Countering Irans Destabilizing Activities Act, which was passed by the Senate a month ago, was held up in the House of Representatives after Republicans proposed including North Korea sanctions in the bill. The House is set to vote on Tuesday on a package of bills on sanctions covering Russia, Iran and North Korea, according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthys office. The measure will hold them accountable for their dangerous actions, McCarthy said in a statement Saturday. Under the proposed bill, Trump must submit to Congress a report on proposed actions that would significantly alter U.S. foreign policy in connection with Russia, including easing sanctions or returning diplomatic properties in Maryland and New York that former President Barack Obama ordered vacated in December. Congress would have at least 30 days to hold hearings and then vote to uphold or reject Trumps proposed changes. Many lawmakers hope the bill will send a message to Trump to keep a strong line against Russia.  Trump, who met Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg earlier this month and said it was an honor to meet him, has been criticized for seeking to reset U.S.-Russian relations. His administration has been bogged down by ongoing investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. With the bill, Republicans and Democrats are seeking to punish Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea, a peninsula belong to Ukraine, and for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Putin has denied any meddling in the U.S. democratic process last year. Trump has said that his campaign did not collude with Russia. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Russias outrageous and unacceptable behavior in the 2016 U.S. election and in Europe demand that we have strong statutory sanctions enacted as soon as possible. Even so, she expressed concerns that by including North Korea the legislation could face procedural delays in the Senate. Senior Republican lawmakers did not immediately comment on the latest bill. In Brussels, the European Union sounded an alarm about the U.S. moves to step up sanctions on Russia, urging Washington to coordinate with its Group of 7 partners.  The European Commission, the EUs executive body, warned of possibly wide and indiscriminate unintended consequences, notably on the EUs efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russia. McCarthy and Ed Royce, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement the revised bill helps bolster the energy security of our European allies by maintaining their access to key energy resources outside of Russia. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a strong sanctions bill is essential, and said in a statement that he expects the House and Senate will act on this legislation promptly, on a broad bipartisan basis. Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the agreement was reached after intense negotiations. A nearly united Congress is poised to send President Putin a clear message on behalf of the American people and our allies, and we need President Trump to help us deliver that message, he said in a statement.

In a statement by a spokeswoman after Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress reached a deal that could see new legislation pass, the European Commission warned of possibly wide and indiscriminate unintended consequences, notably on the EUs efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russia. Germany has already warned of possible retaliation if the United States moves to sanction German firms involved with building a new Baltic pipeline for Russian gas.  EU diplomats are concerned that a German-U.S. row over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline being built by Russias state-owned Gazprom could complicate efforts in Brussels to forge an EU consensus on negotiating with Russia over the project. We highly value the unity that is prevailing among international partners in our approach towards Russias action in Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions. This unity is the guarantee of the efficiency and credibility of our measures, the Commission said in its statement. We understand that the Russia/Iran sanctions bill is driven primarily by domestic considerations, it went on, referring to a bill passed in the U.S. Senate last month and to which lawmakers said on Saturday they had unblocked further obstacles. As we have said repeatedly, it is important that any possible new measures are coordinated between international partners to maintain unity among partners on the sanctions that has been underpinning the efforts for full implementation of the Minsk Agreements, the Commission said, referring to an accord struck with Moscow to try to end the conflicts in Ukraine. We are concerned the measures discussed in the U.S. Congress could have unintended consequences, not only when it comes to Transatlantic/G7 unity, but also on EU economic and energy security interests. This impact could be potentially wide and indiscriminate, including when it comes to energy sources diversification efforts. Sanctions are at their most effective when they are coordinated. Currently our sanctions regimes are coordinated. As a result their impact on the ground is increased and through coordination we are able to avoid surprises, manage potential impact on our own economic operators and address collectively efforts to circumvent such measures. Unilateral measures would undermine this, the Commission said.  We therefore call on the U.S. Congress/authorities to engage with the partners, including the EU, to ensure coordination and to avoid any unintended consequences of the measures discussed.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump declared on Saturday that he has complete power to pardon, as his administration confronts ongoing investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. In a series of early morning Twitter messages, Trump aired renewed frustration with his attorney general, the special counsel leading the Russia probe, and Republicans in Congress who are struggling to advance his legislative agenda. But Trumps comment about pardons, tucked into an attack on the media, raised the possibility that he was considering his options if the investigations do not turn out the way he hopes.      Trump did not specify who, if anyone, he might consider pardoning. His tweets appeared to be written in response to a report by The Washington Post this week that Trump and his legal team have examined presidential powers to pardon Trump aides, family members and possibly even himself. Reuters has not confirmed the newspaper accounts. While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS, Trump wrote. The Washington Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported on Friday that Russias ambassador to the United States was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters with Trump adviser Jeff Sessions last year, when Sessions was a U.S. senator.  Sessions now leads the Justice Department as Trumps attorney general. These illegal leaks...must stop, Trump tweeted. At the Senate confirmation hearings for his Cabinet position, Sessions initially failed to disclose his 2016 contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak and later said they were not about the campaign. In March, Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. During an interview with The New York Times this week, Trump lashed out at Sessions, saying he would not have chosen him for attorney general had he known Sessions would recuse himself. Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in last years presidential election but continues to use her as a foil, questioned why Sessions and special counsel Robert Mueller were not investigating former FBI Director James Comey or Clinton, for her email practices as secretary of state. So many people are asking why isnt the A.G. or Special Counsel looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 emails deleted..., he tweeted. Scholars have raised questions about the scope of the presidents legal authority in issuing pardons. If Trump moved to pardon himself sometime in the future, the U.S. Supreme Court might have to decide on the constitutionality, some have speculated.  Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing by federal investigators who are probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Mueller is looking into any relationships or contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians during the election. Congressional committees also are exploring Russias influence on the U.S. election. Trump traveled on Saturday to Norfolk, Virginia, where he spoke at a commissioning ceremony for the aircraft carrier the USS Gerald R. Ford, named for the Republican president who held the White House from 1974-1977. In his remarks, Trump made no mention of the Russia controversy, focusing his speech on the need for more robust U.S. military spending. After the trip, Trump retreated to his golf course near Washington and had lunch with his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, policy adviser Stephen Miller and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, a White House official said.  Priebuss presence in the entourage came a day after Trump named a new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, reportedly over Priebuss objections. The weekend trip comes ahead of a busy week of Russia-related activity.   The Senate Judiciary Committee said on Friday that Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort had agreed to negotiate whether to be interviewed by the panel in its Russia investigation. Trump Jr., Manafort and Jared Kushner, the presidents son-in-law and now one of his senior advisers, all met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016. That meeting was held in Trump Tower in New York after the lawyer offered damaging information about Clinton. The White House is also working on Trumps campaign promise to U.S. healthcare system.   In his Saturday tweets, Trump had words for Republican senators who have not been able to agree on a way forward to repeal and replace former President Barack Obamas healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, which has become known as Obamacare and which Trump promised to do away with as president. The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and, after 7 years, vote to Repeal and Replace. Next, Tax Reform and Infrastructure. WIN! he tweeted.

Special Counsel Robert Muellers team is examining Manaforts financial and real estate records in New York as well as his involvement in Ukrainian politics, the officials said.  Between 2006 and 2013, Manafort bought three New York properties, including one in Trump Tower in Manhattan. He paid for them in full and later took out mortgages against them. A former senior U.S. law enforcement official said that tactic is often used as a means to hide the origin of funds gained illegally. Reuters has no independent evidence that Manafort did this.   The sources also did not say whether Mueller has uncovered any evidence to charge Manafort with money laundering, but they said doing so is seen by investigators ascritical in getting his full cooperation in their investigation.  If Muellers team can threaten criminal charges against Manafort, they could use that as leverage to convince him to cooperate, said one of the sources.  Manaforts spokesman, Jason Maloni, said, Paul Manafort is not a cooperating witness. Once again there is no truth to the disinformation put forth by anonymous sources and leakers.  Manafort is seen as a key figure in the investigation because of his senior role in the campaign and his participation in a June 2016 meeting that included the presidents son, Donald Trump Jr., close adviser Jared Kushner and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.  The meeting was called after the lawyer offered damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  Muellers team asked the White House on Friday to preserve all of its communications about that meeting. Mueller is examining contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election as part of a broader investigation into whether Russia tried to sway the election in favor of Trump.  Manafort became Trumps campaign manager in June 2016 but was forced to resign two months later amid reports of his business relationship with the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich.  Manafort previously worked as a consultant to a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine and helped support Yanukovich. According to a financial audit reported by the New York Times, he also once owed $17 million to Russian shell companies. Former Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara was investigating Manaforts real estate dealings before he was fired by Trump in March, and Mueller has now assumed control of that investigation, one of the sources said.  Bharara was not available for comment on his investigation on Friday. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Wall Street financier and Republican fundraiser walked into the White House briefing room on Friday and immediately did what Sean Spicer, the outgoing press secretary, did not do on his first day in January: engage, in a friendly manner, with reporters. Wearing a blue tie and an American flag pin on a dark suit, Scaramucci bantered with correspondents, pledged to be transparent and even made respectful remarks about CNN, the cable network with which Trump and Spicer have sparred repeatedly. He made fun of himself, joking about his short stature and apologizing to Trump from the podium for having called the New York businessman a hack politician in 2015. He brings it up every 15 seconds, all right? Scaramucci said to laughter, referring to the president. I should have never said that about him.So, Mr. President, if youre listening, I personally apologize for the 50th time for saying that. Trump was probably listening. Reporters peppered Scaramucci with questions on press-related issues that have dogged the relationship between the Trump presidency and the journalists that cover it. Did he support having briefings televised? I obviously am committed to being transparent because Im standing here.But Id like to talk that over with the president, he said. He noted that CNN had apologized when it reported something false about him and that he had accepted the apology. There feels like theres a little bit of media bias, and so what we hope we can do is de-escalate that and turn that around.And lets let the message from the president get out there to the American people, he said. He announced the new press secretary to take over from Spicer, who resigned earlier on Friday, would be Sarah Sanders.  Spicers debut at the White House podium in January featured a long scolding of reporters for their portrayal of Trumps Inauguration Day crowd numbers. Asked on Friday whether he agreed with Trumps contention, for which there is no evidence, that 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election, Scaramucci answered carefully. So if the president says it, let me do more research on it, but my guess is that theres probably some level of truth to that, he said.

Scaramucci agreed in January to sell SkyBridge Capital LLC to clear the way for a job working with U.S. President Donald Trump. That role finally materialized on Friday when Trump shook up his administration, prompting the resignation of White House spokesman Sean Spicer. But the sale of SkyBridge has yet to get the green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks. Many of the heads of the government departments and agencies comprising CFIUS are political appointees, and it is chaired by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Scaramucci told Reuters in May that he expected the sale of SkyBridge to get U.S. regulatory approvals in June. A representative of SkyBridge did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Reuters reported this week that CFIUS has become increasingly reluctant to approve deals. The president has the power to veto recommendations made by CFIUS although this has never happened before.

While not a surprise, Spicers departure was abrupt and accompanied other changes in Trumps media and legal teams, as an investigation of possible ties between his campaign and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election widened. After six months in power and still without a major legislative win, Trump shuffled some of his closest staff, parting ways with Spicer after naming Anthony Scaramucci as the new White House communications director. Spicer had been communications director as well as press secretary following the resignation of Mike Dubke as director early last month. A Republican close to the White House told Reuters that Trump settled on Scaramucci, 53, a political supporter and former Goldman Sachs banker, for the head media job on Thursday and met with him on Friday morning to formally offer it to him. A White House official briefed on what happened next said Spicer was told of Scaramuccis hiring and Trump urged Spicer to stay on. But Spicer, 45, said he did not want to stay on under the terms and conditions described to him and quit. A source close to the White House said: Basically Donald Trump likes Scaramucci on TV and saw the communications director job as a way to ... make him a top TV surrogate. The source said Trump wanted Spicer to be press secretary and do much of the communications directors work as well, with Scaramucci holding the ceremonial title with no responsibility. And that was the real challenge. At an early afternoon briefing, Scaramucci, in his debut before the White House press corps, named Sarah Sanders as the new press secretary. She had been Spicers deputy. Known by insiders as Mooch, the new communications director is a Harvard Law School-educated Long Islander who founded a hedge fund after leaving Goldman, and sold it to join the Trump administration.  Spicer, a veteran Washington staffer, was parodied memorably by actress Melissa McCarthy on the Saturday Night Live TV comedy show for his combative encounters with reporters. I am grateful for Seans work on behalf of my administration and the American people, Trump said in a statement. I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities. Just look at his great television ratings. Spicer will stay on the job through August. From the start, Spicer invited controversy, attacking the media in his first appearance as press secretary for reporting what he called inaccurate crowd numbers at Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe, he said, an assertion that quickly drew scorn. In a Twitter post on Friday, Spicer wrote, Its been an honor & privilege to serve @POTUS @realDonaldTrump & this amazing country. I will continue my service through August. Before Trump tapped him for the job of press secretary, Spicer was the Republican National Committees spokesman. He had previously worked in the administration of former President George W. Bush. During that time, he dressed up in an Easter Bunny costume for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Spicer and other Trump aides shook up White House dealings with the media, including cutting back daily televised news briefings and replacing them with audio briefings only. Scaramucci told reporters, I love the president. ... Its an honor to be here. Asked how he was going to right the White House ship, Scaramucci said there was nothing to fix.  The ship is going in the right direction. I like the team. Let me rephrase that: I love the team, he said. Separately, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possible Trump-Russia ties, has asked White House officials to preserve any records of a meeting last year between the presidents eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer, a source with knowledge of the request said on Friday. The spokesman for Trumps outside legal team, Mark Corallo, resigned. His departure came amid media reports that the role of Marc Kasowitz, who had been leading the team, was being reduced. On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions brushed off sharp criticism from Trump, saying he loved his job and planned to stay in it. Trump took a broad swipe at his administrations top law officers this week in a New York Times interview, saying he would not have appointed Sessions as attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself. White House unrest was not limited to communications and legal staff, said two officials familiar with the situation. Trump has ignored the recommendations of national security adviser H.R. McMaster and his senior director for Russia, Fiona Hill, on dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said McMaster is frustrated by continuing debate about sending more U.S. forces to Afghanistan. One official said tension persists between McMaster and chief White House strategist Steve Bannon and chief speechwriter Stephen Miller. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Following a turbulent half-year run as White House press secretary, Spicer is leaving the building with a final burst of drama after rejecting what amounted to a downsizing of his role. Until he got swept up in Trumps orbit, Spicer had been a party functionary for the Republican National Committee, well known and respected among Washington political operatives and reporters but with no national profile. As Trumps frontman at televised White House news briefings, however, the 45-year-old achieved a certain fame for defending the president at all costs through a variety of crises that have beset Trumps young presidency. He became instantly recognizable around the country and an inspiration for social media memes. His live televised briefings drew big audiences for cable TV. Spicer was lampooned on NBCs Saturday Night Live, with Melissa McCarthy playing the combative Spicey character, swallowing gum and driving a motorized lectern into actors playing reporters who asked hard questions.  Asked what he thought of the show, Spicer told Fox News in an interview on Friday: I think that there were parts of it that were funny, but theres a lot of it that was over the line. It wasnt funny. It was stupid, or silly, or malicious. Over time, however, Trump felt he was not being defended strongly enough by his communications team and that there were not enough people advocating for him on TV, according to a Republican close to the White House. In a crushing snub, Spicer, a devout Roman Catholic, was kept off the list of White House officials who met Pope Francis when Trump visited the Vatican in May.  With Trump eager to make changes in his communications team, the president began courting Anthony Scaramucci, a New York financial whiz who has been an eloquent defender of Trump in TV interviews. Scaramucci is a prominent Republican fundraiser who advised Trump during his presidential campaign last year after working first on rival Scott Walkers campaign until it fizzled. Trump met Scaramucci on Thursday and talked about making him communications director, and planned a formal job interview and offer on Friday.  Spicer was dubious when told he would continue in the duties of press secretary and communications director with Scaramucci, who is not experienced in the ways of Washington, taking over the ceremonial title, a source close to the White House press operation said. This is a joke, the source said. Trump wanted Scaramucci on television as a surrogate for the White House and wanted to give him more of a formal title. There was simply no understanding by the president that the communications director title comes with lots of responsibilities, not just going on television. When Trump went ahead with the hire on Friday and asked Spicer to stay on, Spicer had had enough, telling the president he was resigning, the source said. After the announcement was made to the White House communications staff at midmorning, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus huddled with Spicer and Scaramucci privately. Spicer told Fox News the president did not want him to go and had been very gracious throughout this process.  I just thought it was in the best interest of our communications department, of our press organization to not have too many cooks in the kitchen, he said. Trump tweeted late on Friday: Sean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright!

(Reuters) - Former CIA director John Brennan on Friday criticized as disgraceful President Donald Trumps efforts to play down U.S. intelligence agencies assessment that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Trumps administration has been dogged by investigations into allegations of Russian interference in last years U.S. presidential election and possible ties with his campaign team. Speaking one day before his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg earlier this month, Trump said he suspected Russian interference in the election but that no one knows for sure. These types of comments are just disgraceful ... and the person who said them should be ashamed of himself, said Brennan, CIA chief under former President Barack Obama, at the Aspen Security Forum. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and several U.S. congressional committees are investigating whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with Trumps campaign to try to swing the race in his favor over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscows actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials have said, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump has said that  his campaign did not collude with Russia. Brennan said he was disappointed by the presidents handling of security issues in his first six months in office. I must say there are disappointments that I see in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing on the international stage that I think pose serious questions about how he is keeping safe our national security, Brennan said. Speaking at the same event in Aspen, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Obama, was also critical of Trumps administration. Asked if Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and top adviser, should have his security clearance canceled for initially failing to list on a disclosure form contacts he had with Russians, Clapper said it should be suspended pending a review. I do think the appropriate thing here is take a pause and at least suspend a clearance until youve had the opportunity to investigate and then decide whether the clearance should be restored or not, Clapper told the same panel. Brennan and Clapper also criticized Trumps remarks in a tweet earlier this year about U.S. spy agencies in which he accused them of practices reminiscent of Nazi Germany.  That (tweet) was a terrible insulting affront not to me or John. We get paid the big bucks to take that. But Im talking about the rank and file, the people in the trenches, men and women, the patriots in the intelligence community and that was completely inappropriate, said Clapper.

Special counsel Robert Mueller sent a document preservation request to the White House, saying the June 2016 meeting that Donald Trump Jr. had at Trump Tower in New York is relevant to his investigation, the source said on Friday. The White House counsels office relayed the request, a routine part of the early phase of any investigation, to other members of the White House staff on Wednesday, the source said. News earlier this month of the meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer whom he was told had damaging information about his fathers presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, fueled questions about the campaigns dealings with Moscow. The Republican president has defended his sons meeting as simple politics. Trumps son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting. The Senate Judiciary Committee has called for Trump Jr. and Manafort to testify next Wednesday at a public hearing in its Russia probe. The committee said in a statement late Friday that Trump Jr. and Manafort had agreed to negotiate with the panel over whether they will be interviewed by committee members and over documents it is seeking. The committee said it had not issued subpoenas for them to appear at Wednesdays hearing but reserved the right to do so. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee said it would interview Kushner on Tuesday. Mueller, appointed by the Justice Department in May, is probing allegations of Russian interference in the election and potential collusion by Trumps campaign, an issue that has engulfed the six-month-old administration. Trump has long expressed frustration with a probe that he has called a political witch hunt, and he has denied any collusion. Moscow has denied it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the November 2016 vote in Trumps favor. Document requests of the type sent by Mueller generally cover emails, text messages, voicemails, notes or records. The counsel is looking for any indication that the president knew the meeting his son had was planned and might have suggested topics for discussion, the source said. Mueller would also be inquiring into whether Trump was briefed on the meeting afterward, as well as what was discussed, the source said. Mueller would be interested, the source said, in topics such as any discussion of U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, possible Russian investments in the United States or elsewhere, or a possible lifting of a Russian ban on Americans adopting Russian children. Russia imposed the adoption ban to retaliate for the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which imposed sanctions on Russian individuals to punish Russia for human rights violations. Russias ambassador to Washington was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters with Trump adviser Jeff Sessions last year, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing current and former U.S. officials. Sessions, who was a U.S. senator at the time and is now the attorney general, initially failed to disclose the contacts with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak and then said they were not about the campaign. Under pressure over having not disclosed the meetings with Kislyak, Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe in March. The recusal angered Trump, who said in a New York Times interview this week that he would not have chosen Sessions for attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself. [nL1N1KB0UN] Newspaper reports said Trumps lawyers are reviewing ways to limit or undermine the special counsel.  The Washington Post and The New York Times on Thursday cited unidentified people familiar with the strategy. A Trump attorney contacted by Reuters, John Dowd, denied the reports and praised Mueller. We think hes a straight, honest guy, Dowd said. Dowd said communications with Mueller were productive and we have confidence hes going to do the right thing. Another Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, told the Times that addressing possible conflicts of interest in Muellers team would be appropriate but declined to comment on specifics. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway referred on Friday to reports that members of Muellers team have made donations to the Democratic Party. People should know what folks paths and motivations and political motivations are, she said in a Fox News interview. According to the Post, Trump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides, family members and even himself in connection with the Russia probe. Trumps lawyers have been discussing the presidents pardoning powers, a second person told the newspaper. Dowd dismissed the pardon report as nonsense. Its just not true, he said. Separately, the spokesman for Trumps legal team, Mark Corallo, confirmed his resignation on Friday. And lead attorney Marc Kasowitz will take on a reduced role on the outside legal team, according to media reports. Other recent changes included the hiring of veteran Washington lawyer Ty Cobb to a White House job to handle responses to the Russia probe.

A U.S. official confirmed to Reuters that Ambassador Sergei Kislyaks accounts of two conversations with Sessions, then a U.S. senator and key foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump, were intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was nothing automatically inappropriate about Sessions, then a U.S. senator as well as a Trump supporter, discussing policy matters or even Trumps thinking about them with a foreign diplomat. The question is whether he crossed the line and discussed classified information or talked about deals like lifting sanctions if the Russians were interested in investing in the U.S. or had dirt on Secretary Clinton, said a second official familiar with the intercepts, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. His memory is another matter. Sessions at first failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said the meetings were not about the Trump campaign.  As Attorney General, he recused himself in March from matters connected to an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign following his admission that he had talked to the Russian envoy. Sessions has denied discussing campaign issues with Russian officials and has said that he only met Kislyak in his role of U.S. senator. The Post cited one U.S. official as saying that Sessions  provided misleading statements that are contradicted by other evidence.  The newspaper reported that a former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had substantive discussions on matters including Trumps positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration. The Washington Post cited a Justice Department spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, as saying: Obviously I cannot comment on the reliability of what anonymous sources describe in a wholly uncorroborated intelligence intercept that the Washington Post has not seen and that has not been provided to me.  The Post said that Sessions did not discuss interference in the election.

The documents show that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, successfully represented the FSBs interests in a legal wrangle over ownership of an upscale property in northwest Moscow between 2005 and 2013. The FSB, successor to the Soviet-era KGB service, was headed by Vladimir Putin before he became Russian president. There is no suggestion that Veselnitskaya is an employee of the Russian government or intelligence services, and she has denied having anything to do with the Kremlin. But the fact she represented the FSB in a court case may raise questions among some U.S. politicians. The Obama administration last year sanctioned the FSB for what it said was its role in hacking the election, something Russia flatly denies. Charles Grassley, Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has raised concerns about why Veselnitskaya gained entry into the United States. Veselnitskaya represented a Russian client accused by U.S. prosecutors of money laundering in a case that was settled in May this year after four years.  Veselnitskaya did not reply to emailed Reuters questions about her work for the FSB. But she later posted a link to it on her Facebook page on Friday. Is it all your proof? You disappointed me, she wrote in a post. Dig in court databases again! Youll be surprised to find among my clients Russian businessmen... as well as citizens and companies that had to defend themselves from accusations from the state...  Veselnitskaya added that she also had U.S. citizens as clients. The FSB did not respond to a request for comment.     Reuters could not find a record of when and by whom the lawsuit - which dates back to at least 2003 - was first lodged. But appeal documents show that Rosimushchestvo, Russias federal government property agency, was involved. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Veselnitskaya and her firm Kamerton Consulting represented military unit 55002 in the property dispute, the documents show. A public list of Russian legal entities shows the FSB, Russias domestic intelligence agency, founded the military unit whose legal address is behind the FSBs own headquarters. Reuters was unable to establish if Veselnitskaya did any other work for the FSB or confirm who now occupies the building at the center of the case. President Donald Trumps eldest son eagerly agreed in June 2016 to meet Veselnitskaya, a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton, according to emails released by Trump Jr. Veselnitskaya has said she is a private lawyer and has never obtained damaging information about Clinton. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, has said she had nothing whatsoever to do with us. Veselnitskaya has also said she is ready to testify to the U.S. Congress to dispel what she called mass hysteria about the meeting with Trump Jr. The case in which Veselnitskaya represented the FSB was complex; appeals courts at least twice ruled in favor of private companies which the FSB wanted to evict.   The FSB took over the disputed office building in mid-2008, a person who worked for Atos-Component, a firm that was evicted as a result, told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. The building was privatized after the 1991 Soviet collapse, but the Russian government said in the lawsuit in which Veselnitskaya represented the FSB that the building had been illegally sold to private firms. The businesses were listed in the court documents, but many of them no longer exist and those that do are little-known firms in the electric components business. Elektronintorg, an electronic components supplier, said on its website that it now occupied the building. Elektronintorg is owned by state conglomerateRostec, run by Sergei Chemezov, who, like Putin, worked for the KGB and served with him in East Germany. When contacted by phone, an unnamed Elektronintorg employee said he was not obliged to speak to Reuters. Rostec, responding to a request for comment, said that Elektronintorg only had a legal address in the building but that its staff were based elsewhere.  When asked which organization was located there, an unidentified man who answered a speakerphone at the main entrance laughed and said: Congratulations. Ask the city administration.

The lawmakers asked that the review include consideration of what effect the $13.7 billion deal could have on access to healthy foods in so-called food deserts where residents may have limited access to fresh groceries.  While we do not oppose the merger at this time, we are concerned about what this merger could mean for African-American communities across the country already suffering from a lack of affordable healthy food choices from grocers, the letter said on Thursday. The letter was signed by U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge and 11 other Democrats, including Senator Cory Booker.  Amazon and Whole Foods hope to expand access to fresh food, said Brian Huseman, Amazons vice president of policy, in a letter to Fudge, also on Thursday.  We agree with you that access to food is an important issue for the country, and we share your goal of improving that access, Huseman said in the letter. Amazon has lobbied to be able to accept food stamps online and is participating in a pilot program. We deliver low-cost, healthy food to zip codes across the country that before Amazon had limited access to a large selection of high quality foods, Huseman wrote to Fudge. Fudges letter was made public by the United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW), which represents many of the unionized grocery workers in the United States. Fudges office confirmed she had sent the letter. Amazons plan announced in June to buy premium grocer Whole Foods roiled the grocery industry and sparked worries the deal could raise prices, reduce the quality of products and hurt employment.  Still, most antitrust experts expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the planned merger. The letter asking for more scrutiny was praised by the UFCW union. Political concerns about Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods are growing for good reason, UFCW President Marc Perrone said on Friday. Amazons monopolistic desire to control the retail market and replace good jobs with automation is not only a direct threat to the hard-working men and women at Whole Foods, its also a direct threat to our economy and consumers.  Amazon has sought to dispute that it would monopolize the grocery industry. Wal-Mart Stores Inc currently controls the largest market share.  We also do not plan job reductions as part of the acquisition, which if approved would result in a company with a combined less than 3 percent of national grocery sales, Huseman wrote.

(Reuters) - Transgender people still face discrimination and threats to their safety in North Carolina despite lawmakers replacing a measure that restricted their access to many public bathrooms, advocacy groups said in a new federal court action on Friday. The law thrust the state into the center of a national debate over equality, privacy and religious freedom last year by requiring transgender people to use restrooms in state-run buildings that matched the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. A new measure, passed in March, helped bring back some business and sports events pulled from the state in protest in the year after it enacted the so-called bathroom bill. But the replacement law lacks clarity, with top state leaders in disagreement about what it means for transgender bathroom access, the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal argue in their amended lawsuit. That leaves transgender people uncertain - even fearful - about which restrooms they can safely use, they said. When legislation fails to protect us, when it leaves us in limbo, it sends a message that our lives are expendable, plaintiff Joaqun Carcao, a transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told reporters. The amended complaint expands the lawsuit filed last year to challenge HB 2, which the states Republican leaders said was needed for public safety. The new law, HB 142, rescinded HB 2 but left many of its harmful effects in place, opponents say. The current law bars state agencies, schools and local governments from regulating government-run restrooms, showers and changing facilities, leaving responsibility for those policies with state lawmakers. It also bans cities in the state from passing their own anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people until 2020. Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat who signed the new law, is now named as a defendant in the lawsuit, replacing former Republican Governor Pat McCrory, whose defeat in the 2016 election is partly blamed on his support for the old law. Cooper has called the replacement law imperfect but necessary to help repair North Carolinas damaged reputation.  The governors ultimate goal is statewide LGBT protections, and he is going to continue working toward that, Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said in a statement on Friday. A battle over bathrooms also flared on Friday in Texas, where lawmakers heard impassioned public testimony about proposals to limit public restroom access to transgender people in that state.

More than 250 civil rights activists, executives and others registered to speak to the Republican-dominated Senate as it began consideration of the measure, the most closely watched item on the states agenda during a 30-day special session. So-called bathroom bills have become a flashpoint of U.S. culture wars, with social conservatives saying they protect public safety and civil rights activists saying the measures allow government-sanctioned bias against transgender people. Ashley Smith, a transgender woman and San Antonio architect, said transgender women suffer more violence than the general public, and a bathroom bill would make her more fearful. Cant you see how this legislation would make the very real problem of assault even worse? she asked members of the Senate Committee on State Affairs. Smith drew wide notice on the internet this week after posting a picture of herself with Republican Governor Greg Abbott, a supporter of the bathroom measure who she suggested had no idea she was transgender. Talk of the bathroom bill has already led to about $66 million in lost convention business, convention officials from Texas top cities told the committee. If the measure is enacted, the state could lose about $1.4 billion from lost conventions, sports contests and other events, they said. The main measure under consideration is Senate Bill 3, which says certain restrooms, showers and changing facilities in places such as public schools must be designated for and used only by persons of the same sex as stated on a persons birth certificate. Supporters were few in number on Friday. The bills sponsor, Republican Senator Lois Kolkhorst, said SB 3 was about about much more than bathrooms. (It) is about finding a balance between the right to declare your gender and the right of a parent to protect their child, she said.  During the regular session that ended in May, the Texas Senate easily passed such a measure. But it died in the states House of Representatives under pressure from pro-business Republicans. Political analysts expect a similar pattern for the special session. A similar law in North Carolina, partially repealed in March, prompted the relocation of major sporting events and economic boycotts that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.

The 80-year-old lawmaker and 2008 Republican presidential nominee, who was elected to a sixth Senate term last November, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer. He is vowing a quick return to the Senate. McCain, a former U.S. Navy pilot who spent 5-1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, is outspoken on a range of issues, from defense spending to immigration to demanding a thorough investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.  Asked how the Senate was different without McCain, his close friend Senator Lindsey Graham said: Its quieter. John is a fighter and Johns into every cause no matter how hard it might be. A Russia hawk, McCain has expressed deep skepticism of Trumps effort to improve ties with Moscow, and emerged, with Graham, as perhaps the most vocal Republican critic in Congress of the presidents foreign policy. He chairs the influential Senate Armed Services Committee. McCain has traveled the globe on trips some analysts say are efforts to soothe the concerns of U.S. allies that fear Trumps America First policy means a retreat from international engagement. I realize that some of President Trumps actions and statements have unsettled Americas friends, McCain said in a speech in Australia in May. They have unsettled many Americans as well. McCain is also known for an independent streak and a willingness to work with Democrats. He has participated in almost every major bipartisan legislative effort in the Senate in recent years, such as the Gang of Eight immigration push in 2013.  In 2015, McCain, who was tortured while a POW, worked with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein to pass legislation banning torture. This week, he called for a bipartisan effort to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system.  While McCain has made clear his desire for more spending on defense, he has criticized what he sees as inefficiencies in U.S. weapons programs. Some analysts said defense contractors might have an easier time with another Armed Services chairman. McCain is McCain, and he has needled people and programs that he does not think are performing, said Mark Cancian, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies International Security program. McCain has criticized defense programs like the Littoral Combat Ship made by Lockheed Martin Co (LMT.N) and Australias Austal Ltd (ASB.AX). LCS has been one thing that has been in his sights, and arguably there has been an effect, Cancian said. To carry out Trumps goal of repealing and replacing former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell needs the backing of at least 50 of the 100 U.S. senators. Republicans control the Senate by a narrow majority of 52 to 48. As McCain weighs treatment options in his home state of Arizona, his absence makes it more difficult for McConnell to muster the support he needs to advance healthcare legislation expected to come to a vote next week. Obviously, I think more people are worried about his health than thinking about the math, but you know, you understand the math, Republican Senator Bob Corker told reporters. Obviously, it makes things difficult. Sarah Binder, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said that with the slim Republican majority, the absence of any senator could be potentially catastrophic for the partys effort to pass its agenda. She said the problem was compounded by McCains absence. His colleagues perceive him as a giant of the Senate, whose expertise and perspective on foreign and military affairs is arguably irreplaceable, Binder said.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain promised on Thursday he would return rapidly to Washington despite his newly diagnosed brain cancer, flashing the fighting spirit that has defined him since he was held in captivity as a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War. McCain, a veteran senator and former Republican presidential candidate known as a strong and sometimes fiercely independent voice on defense and security issues, was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, after surgery last week for a blood clot above his left eye. The news, issued by his office late on Wednesday, drew a wave of support from across the political spectrum, and raised questions about how long McCain would be absent from the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow majority and are eager to notch up some legislative successes for President Donald Trump. I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, Ill be back soon, so stand-by! McCain, 80, wrote on Twitter shortly before issuing a news release through his office related to Syria. McCain was making phone calls from his home in Phoenix, Arizona, to stay abreast of congressional matters. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one McCains closest friends in Congress, said the senator called him three times on Thursday morning. He wanted to discuss healthcare legislation that is at the center of the Senates attention, and a sprawling defense bill McCain would usher through as the Senate Armed Services Committees chairman, Graham said. Graham told reporters McCain admonished him, No more woe is me. He is yelling at me to buck up. Im going to buck up.  The son and grandson of admirals, McCain survived more than five years of captivity during the Vietnam War. As a lawmaker  he has been a strong advocate for the U.S. military as well as being willing to cross the political aisle and work with Democrats. Among Republican lawmakers, he has been one of the most critical of Trump. Well-wishers included Democratic former President Barack Obama and Trump, who called McCain on Thursday to wish him well, the White House said.  Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the flood of bipartisan respect and love for John McCain as he faces this cancer battle reminds us that, after all the meanness, there is a human side to politicians. Count this Democrat in John McCains corner. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and most deadly form of brain and nervous system tumor, typically killing half its victims within a year. Patients rarely survive more than three years. Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy died of the disease in 2009. McCains doctors said he was recovering from surgery well, and praised his underlying health as excellent. His doctors told CNN on Wednesday that he had no sign of neurological impairment before or during his surgery. Treatment options include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. McCains illness has potential policy implications for healthcare legislation and other agenda items in Washington.    Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 seat majority in the Senate, and McCains absence has made it more difficult to gather the 50 votes needed to advance a healthcare bill. He has been recovering at his Arizona home since his initial surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix last week. It was not immediately clear when he would return to Washington. McCain has previously battled back from injuries suffered during his time as a prisoner of war, and has had non-invasive melanomas removed at least three times. McCain, who ran a failed White House race in 2008 against Obama, won a sixth six-year term in the U.S. Senate last November.  If the senator were to retire or die before his term ends in January 2023, the states Republican governor would pick a Republican replacement, who would serve until a special election in November 2018. Whoever was elected would fill out McCains term. Arizonas other senator, Republican Jeff Flake, is up for re-election next year. The states electorate is divided: one-third Republican voters, nearly one-third Democratic and one-third independent. Matt Roberts, spokesman for the Arizona Secretary of States office, said registered independents would soon exceed Republicans. But Republicans tend to turn out to vote on Election Day in stronger numbers than their counterparts. The Southwestern state is the birthplace of former Senator and 1964 presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who some call the father of the Republican conservative movement.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick III in San Francisco ruled that a recent memo from the Justice Department that appeared to narrow the scope of Trumps executive order on sanctuary cities did not remove the need for a court-ordered injunction. Orrick wrote that the memo is not binding and the attorney general can revoke it at any time.  A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment. Trump issued the order in January, shortly after he was inaugurated, directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with U.S. immigration authorities. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing sanctuary movement. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. After Trump issued the sanctuary cities executive order, Californias Santa Clara County - which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities - sued, saying it was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. In a ruling in April, Orrick said Trumps order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. The Justice Department asked Orrick to revisit that ruling, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo which said the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs.  Orrick voiced skepticism at a hearing earlier this month. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday brushed off sharp criticism from President Donald Trump over his recusal from the Justice Departments Russia investigation, saying he loved his job and planned to continue serving. We love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate, Sessions said at a news conference announcing a cyber crime bust. Sessions was flanked by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Acting Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Andrew McCabe, who were both also criticized by the president in an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday. Trump took a broad swipe at his administrations top law officers in the interview, saying he would not have appointed Sessions as attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself. The Republican president also noted Rosensteins connection to Democratic Baltimore and that McCabes wife took money from a leading Democrat during a political campaign. The public lashing came after a turbulent first six months in office during which Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James Comey, then the top official leading the probe into whether Russian meddled in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.  Sessions recused himself in March from the Russia criminal investigation. He did so after failing to disclose at his confirmation hearing that he had held meetings last year with Russias ambassador. Sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else, the Times quoted Trump as saying. White House spokesman Sarah Sanders said later on Thursday that, while Trump was disappointed in the recusal, clearly he has confidence in him or he would not be the attorney general. Sessions was Trumps first supporter in the U.S. Senate and helped shape his political team throughout the campaign and into the transition after the Nov. 8 election. He declined on Thursday to acknowledge Trumps criticism. I have the honor of serving as attorney general. Its something that goes beyond any thought I would have ever had for myself, Sessions said. Similarly, Rosenstein declined to comment when asked about Trumps remarks that there were very few Republicans in Baltimore, where he was a former federal prosecutor. I was proud to be here yesterday, Im proud to be here today, Ill be proud to work here tomorrow, he said. They took only a few questions before a spokesman asked if there were any questions about the departments dismantlement of AlphaBay, a dark web market. Seeing no hands, Sessions left as reporters shouted questions about whether he would resign.   An aide to Sessions said the recent disparaging remarks from Trump are nothing new, given news media reports last month that the president was upset with the attorney general over the Russia recusal. A federal special counsel has been appointed to take over the Russia investigation, and several congressional committees are conducting probes. Next week, Trumps son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, and the presidents eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., are scheduled to testify before Senate panels, as well as former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. The Kremlin says it did not interfere in the election, and Trump has denied any collusion. In the Times interview, the president also took aim at the special counsel appointed to take over the Russia investigation, Robert Mueller, saying Mueller would be crossing a red line if he began investigating Trumps personal finances.  I think thats a violation. Look, this is about Russia, Trump told the Times.  At the White House, Sanders said Trump has no intention of firing Mueller at this time. The Times also reported on Wednesday that Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) has been in contact with federal investigators about Trumps accounts, citing two people briefed on the matter. And the bank was expecting to eventually have to provide information to Mueller, they said. Deutsche Bank, which has loaned the Trump Organization family business millions of dollars for real-estate ventures, late last month rejected demands by Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives to provide details of Trumps finances, citing privacy laws. On Capitol Hill, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved  Trumps pick to replace Comey at the FBI, Christopher Wray. The full Senate was expected to confirm Wray before its August recess. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said at the hearing that Trumps latest comments raised troubling questions about the independence and credibility of the Justice Department. Now what happens next as members close to the president, his own administration, and his family are being asked critical questions? Durbin asked.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - There is at least one approved device and scores of experimental treatments being tested that could improve the odds of longer-term survival for patients with the type of extremely aggressive brain cancer afflicting U.S. Senator John McCain. While the 80-year-old Arizona Republican, who was re-elected to a sixth Senate term in November, recovers from surgery to remove a blood clot found to be associated with the cancer, he and his medical team will explore treatment options. That (recovery) usually takes about 10 to 14 days before starting therapy, said Dr. Maciej Lesniak, chair of neurological surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. McCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a brain cancer with very poor prognosis that took the life of former U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy in 2009. Surgery is performed to remove as much of the tumor as possible, but cancer cells are left behind that infiltrate the brain and quickly grow. The survival rate with standard treatment is generally about 15 months, with only about 25 percent of patients alive after two years. Standard treatment is a combination of 30 doses of radiation administered over six weeks along with the oral chemotherapy Temodar (temozolomide) sold by Merck & Co (MRK.N). After a three-to-four week break, additional four-week cycles of Temodar are given. McCain has vowed to return to his Senate duties soon. Experts said he may well be able to do so.  The treatment is usually very well tolerated, Lesniak said. Generally, people can maintain normal quality of life during therapy including their work in the majority of cases. Doctors interviewed who are not involved in McCains care said further combination therapies were likely needed to sharply improve patient outcomes. Debates over when to begin such  therapies are ongoing. Many people feel we need to push the envelope and look at combination therapy as early as possible in addition to the standard of care, Lesniak said.  There are about 150 clinical trials for glioblastoma under way, most at very early stages, and the majority for patients for whom initial therapy has stopped working. McCain could be a candidate for a trial in newly diagnosed patients.  Current immunotherapies that have shown great promise against melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers are unlikely by themselves to work in glioblastoma because the tumors tend not to present the proper target for those drugs. Glioblastoma tumor cells are incredibly heterogeneous. No two tumor cells are alike, said Dr. John de Groot, professor of neuro-oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, adding that a multi-pronged approach was likely needed. One promising approach being tested in early stage clinical trials by various institutions and companies involve injecting viruses into the tumor to destroy cancer cells and spur an immune system attack. Duke University generated publicity last year with reports of early success using the polio virus against brain cancer. MD Anderson developed a viral therapy that it outlicensed to a company called DNAtrix for further development, de Groot said. A trial at Northwestern is using neural stem cells to help improve the performance of a cancer-fighting virus. Stem cells when loaded with the virus can travel to areas we cant resect to deliver the virus throughout the tumor mass in a more uniform fashion, Lesniak said. In a study published in May in the journal Nature, Duke researchers reported early success with a vaccine that delivers high doses of Temodar to the tumor. Among 11 patients in that study, the median survival was 41.1 months, versus 14.6 months for the standard treatment. Dr. Roger Stupp, co-director of the Northwestern Brain Tumor Institute, who is credited with pioneering the radiation/Temodar combination therapy for glioblastoma, said patients like McCain might be helped by a now-approved device shown to extend survival. Called Optune and sold by Novocure Ltd (NVCR.O), it  delivers an electromagnetic field that interferes with cancer cells ability to divide and survive, said Stupp, who led trials of the device. It involves electrodes placed on the scalp operated by a small battery pack. With Optune worn nearly 24 hours a day, the two-year survival rate in the trial that led to its approval jumped to 43 percent, with some patients living four years or more. My recommendation is to use it early in the disease course, Stupp said.    ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Speaking at a New Balance shoe factory in Massachusetts, Ryan stressed the need to level the playing field for U.S. companies and their foreign competitors but failed to mention the border adjustment tax, or BAT, which has been his main policy for creating a more competitive U.S. manufacturing base. Ryans remarks, coming about a week ahead of an end-of-July deadline for top White House officials and Republican leaders in Congress to agree on a tax reform framework, could indicate that President Donald Trumps promised tax code overhaul is taking on a more orthodox shape after months of closed-door talks. Republicans in the House of Representatives had billed the BAT as a more effective way to pay for tax cuts than closing loopholes, because it would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade by effectively taxing imports while exempting exports from taxation.   We are going to slash the corporate tax rate to level the playing field and the business tax rate for all businesses, Ryan told his audience. So what we need to do is, we need to throw out those complicated loopholes, those deductions, those special interest loopholes, he added.   Ryan said cutting the corporate tax rate from a current 35 percent rate to a 20 percent corporate rate is very realistic. Administration officials have said negotiators realize Trumps proposed 15 percent corporate rate is unlikely without expanding the federal deficit.  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said on Thursday that Republicans should be willing to accept short-term increases on deficits for tax reform to drive economic growth.   Ryan said tax reform would also include accelerating business expensing, double the standard deduction for individuals, and retain popular deductions for charity donations, home mortgages and retirement.  We have basically found where our consensus lies on these major issues, which we think are sort of the key cornerstones of tax reform, the Wisconsin Republican said. His failure to mention border tax adjustment could fuel speculation that House Republicans are moving away from the idea in discussions among the so-called Big Six principals. The six are Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House adviser Gary Cohn and the Republican chairmen of two tax-writing committees.

Trump on Wednesday told the Senates fractured Republican majority to revive a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare that collapsed on Monday after Republicans from both moderate and conservative factions pulled their support. But after a late-night emergency meeting on how to win over holdouts appeared to yield no progress, senators expressed irritation.  It really is starting to feel like a bazaar, $50 billion here, $100 billion there, and I feel like its losing coherency, Senator Bob Corker said. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican who strongly objected to the revised bill, said she didnt even know what we are proceeding to next week and said Trump had contributed to the lack of clarity over the next steps.  Im unclear, having heard the president and read his tweets, exactly which bill he wants to pass and whether he is for just repealing, or repealing and replacing - whether hes for the Senate bill, Collins said. Trump, who had campaigned heavily on a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama, took a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week.  On Tuesday he suggested that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail. But on Wednesday he switched course and demanded that senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they find common ground on healthcare. The repeal and replace bill crafted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would leave 22 million Americans without health insurance coverage by 2026, the nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday. Before Trumps Wednesday lunch with 49 Republican senators, McConnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week, but that appeared doomed with several Republican senators having already said they oppose that approach. The CBO said on Wednesday that 32 million more Americans would lose their insurance coverage by 2026 under a bill that would repeal much of Obamacare without a replacement. That compares with the 20 million who have become insured under Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act is known. The Senates number two Republican, John Cornyn, said he expected a procedural vote on Tuesday to take up a healthcare bill, but said knowing what the healthcare bill will be before the procedural vote is a luxury we dont have. An aide to Cornyn said he was referring to the amendment process that could change the bill once it is on the Senate floor. Its difficult to predict what the final product will look like, the aide said.  Adding to Republicans woes was news late Wednesday that Senator John McCain has aggressive brain cancer. With a narrow 52-48 Republican majority, their fight for votes becomes even more difficult. McCain, a Republican known for his feisty independence, tweeted, ... unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, Ill be back soon, so stand-by! As they sought to break the impasse, senators were discussing changes to Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor that was expanded under Obamacare. One possibility would give states flexibility to use Medicaid funding to help cover healthcare expenses of people who would lose their Medicaid coverage under the Senate bills sharp cuts to the program. Senator Rob Portman, one of the undecideds on the healthcare bill, called the proposal progress. But Collins said she had not heard a Medicaid proposal that would tempt her to vote yes. Republicans say Obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system, but the party is divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts. McConnell revealed little of his next steps but said Republicans were not giving up. The fight to move beyond the status quo of Obamacare was certainly never going to be easy, he told the Senate on Thursday. But weve come a long way, and I look forward to continuing our work together to finally bring relief. The dramatic week at Congress and in the White House was taking its toll.          Im getting a little anxious, Corker said. He said the best approach would be a repeal, with a delayed effective date by which time lawmakers could develop a replacement. Democrats, who are united in their opposition to the Republican efforts and reveled in this weeks deadlock, told Republicans to abandon their healthcare efforts as they appeared no closer to reconciling policy differences after Wednesdays meeting.   Its time for Congress to pivot away from the bills that are going nowhere, said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said Thursday it had withdrawn or removed from active consideration more than 800 proposed regulations that were never finalized during the Obama administration as it works to shrink the federal governments regulatory footprint. In a report, the Trump administration said it had withdrawn 469 planned actions that had been part of the Obama administrations regulatory agenda published last fall. Officials also reconsidered 391 active regulatory proceedings by reclassifying them as long-term or inactive allowing for further careful review, the White House said. The steps to eliminate regulations makes good on a much-repeated Trump campaign promise to promote business-friendly policies. Investors have anticipated the action, helping to push share prices higher on hopes that fewer regulations will boost business growth and lead to higher corporate profits. The Trump administration has identified nearly 300 regulations related to energy production and environmental protection it plans to rescind, review or delay across three agencies  the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior and Energy Departments. Trump had identified several of the regulations as targets in his March executive orders on energy, but they will now undergo a formal rulemaking process to be rescinded or revised. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the administration was addressing that slow cancer that can come from regulatory burdens that we put on our people. In February, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to place regulatory reform task forces and officers within federal agencies in what may be the most far-reaching effort to pare back U.S. red tape in recent decades. Trump has vowed a sweeping cut in U.S. regulations and previously ordered agencies to repeal two rules for every new one adopted. The Interior Department is reviewing an Obama-era rule that directed companies to reduce venting and flaring and methane leaks from oil and gas production on federal and tribal land, according to a White House semi-annual government-wide regulation report. Representatives of the oil and gas industry cheered.  We just got through eight years of a regulatory onslaught, aimed at curtailing oil and gas production. So we are very supportive of the administrations efforts to roll back regulation, said Kathleen Sgamma, head of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas drillers in Western states. She said membership was particularly pleased about the effort to repeal the methane rule, which the industry estimated would have cost about $50,000 per well. Methane is one of the gases scientists say is driving global climate change.  The U.S. Transportation Department said it would review a number of Obama administration proposals that were close to being finalized including making automobile event data recorders mandatory, requiring sounds for electric cars and updating some crash test dummy standards. The government also said it does not plan to complete a number of airline-related regulatory actions within the next year, including new rules required by Congress generally requiring quick automated refunds for any baggage fees when checked luggage is not delivered. The Energy Department listed dozens of energy efficiency standards for commercial and household appliances that it would review. The White House said the regulatory agenda represents the beginning of fundamental regulatory reform and a reorientation toward reducing unnecessary regulatory burden on the American people. But some condemned the plan. Six months into the administration, the only accomplishments the president has had is to rollback, delay and rescind science-based safeguards, said Yogin Kothari of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Todays release of the regulatory agenda confirms just as much. It continues to perpetuate a false narrative that regulations only have costs and no benefits. Among the labeling requirements pushed back are Agriculture Department rules regarding production labeling on natural for meat and poultry as well as the bioengineering disclosure standard. The regulatory agenda calls for the U.S. Labor Department to rescind an Obama-era rule that prohibits restaurants and bars from forcing servers to share their tips with untipped employees such as cooks and dishwashers. That 2011 tip-pooling regulation is also the subject of a legal challenge by the National Restaurant Association, which has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the rule.

The talks are underway ... different proposals are being exchanged, nobody denies the necessity of holding the talks and of having such contacts, Krutskikh said, according to RIA. Svetlana Lukash, a Russian official who was at the recent G20 summit of global leaders in Hamburg, said earlier this month that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump had agreed to discuss cyber security questions, either via the United Nations or as part of a working group.     However, U.S. and European intelligence and security officials told Reuters on Thursday they were not participating in the talks, which they said were confined to mid-level political officials. One of the officials, who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity, said cooperation on cyber security was a pipe dream while Russia continues to deny that it hacked last years U.S. presidential election, as three U.S. intelligence agencies concluded publicly in January. On an Air Force One flight home from Europe last weekend, Thomas Bossert, Trumps top counterterrorism adviser, told reporters it would be premature to suggest the United States  would be talking to Russia about a possible cyber security partnership. A partnership suggests that youve reached a place where you believe that you have a trusted relationship and youve come to some common agreement on ideals and goals and behaviors, he said.  I dont believe that the United States and Russia have come to that point yet in cyberspace, Bossert said. And until we do, we wouldnt have the conversation about partnership. But we had to have a dialogue, and thats where well start. Trump said earlier this month he had discussed the idea of creating such a group with Putin at the Hamburg summit. Senior U.S. Republicans greeted the idea with incredulity, saying Moscow could not be trusted, and Trump later appeared to back away, saying in a post on Twitter: The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesnt mean I think it can happen. It cant. Widespread concern and confusion about the possible cyber working group reflects the Trump administrations struggles to articulate a clear approach to international cyber security issues amid inconsistent statements by the president and ongoing personnel changes.  Chris Painter, a widely respected bureaucrat who led the U.S State Departments international engagement on cyber security, is leaving his post at the end of the month amid media reports that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to shutter Painters entire office. Painter is scheduled to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee next week about cyber diplomacy.

It was a very reasonable document, Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) Chief Executive Lance Fritz said in an interview about a list of priorities released this week by Lighthizer. From our perspective, he (Lighthizer) hit all of the elements that weve heard from the administration and they make sense. Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement if it is not renegotiated in favor of the United States. Talks with Mexico and Canada on revisions to the treaty, which came into effect in 1994, are due to start in mid-August.  The top priority for the talks listed by Lighthizers office was shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. Union Pacifics Fritz said that Lighthizers focus on intellectual property, labor laws and dispute resolution mechanisms all make sense. What makes most sense to us is elements (of Lighthizers priorities) focusing on the streamlining of freight across the border, he added. About 40 percent of Union Pacifics freight volume is based on international trade and about 12 percent is based on cross-border trade with Mexico.  Fritz said that Mexico should continue to be a good driver for Union Pacifics growth.  The CEO spoke to Reuters after Union Pacific posted a better-than-expected second-quarter profit that was lifted in part by a 25-percent jump in coal revenue. Major U.S. railroads have seen a resurgence in coal volumes this year, following two years of precipitous declines as many utilities switched to burning cheaper natural gas and as unseasonable weather resulted in large stockpiles of unburned coal. Union Pacific said on Thursday that coal volumes in the third quarter should be relatively flat versus the same period in 2016. We expect coal to be a bit more stable moving forward and thats dependent on natural gas pricing and to some degree weather, Fritz said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""ASPEN, Colorado (Reuters) - The Trump administration is developing the first comprehensive strategy to defend the United States against disease pandemics and biological attacks by terrorists, the top White House homeland security official said on Thursday. We have not had as a country a comprehensive bio-defense strategy ever, White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert told the annual Aspen Security Forum, in Aspen, Colorado. Its high time we had a bio-defense strategy. The effort involves retired Admiral Tim Ziemer, who oversaw the Obama administrations initiative to fight malaria in Africa, and the White House hopes to publish the new strategy as soon as we can, said Bossert, who provided no further details. Bossert noted that the Bush and Obama administrations took steps to address biological threats after letters containing anthrax spores were sent to two Democratic senators and several news organizations in the weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The spores infected 22 people, five of whom died. But, he added, There have been a lot of fits and starts in our investments. At this point, we need to look clear eyed at the fact that we may have a devastating pandemic influenza or an intentional anthrax attack, said Bossert. He noted recent news reports that scientists in Canada used commercially available genetic material to construct the extinct horse pox virus, a relative of the small pox virus, which claimed tens of millions of lives before being wiped out. Thats (horsepox) not going to kill any of us, but that suggests that somebody might now in the future possess the ability to produce synthetic small pox without a live virus and that scares me to death, he said. The threat of disease pandemics demands global attention, he said. Some experts have criticized the Trump administration for seeking reductions in funding for global health programs that they contend would hurt the countrys ability to prevent and respond to biological threats like pandemics. Bossert, however, said that the administration plans to give full-throated support to the Global Health Security Agenda, a partnership of more than 50 nations and international organizations that works to build countries capacities to prevent and fight infectious diseases.

David Kautter, a former Senate legislative aide and long-time tax policy expert, would play a key role in the Republican push to overhaul the U.S. tax code this year, if confirmed by the 100-seat chamber as assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy.  Im hoping that he can be confirmed by the full Senate in short order, said Senator Orrin Hatch, the finance committees Republican chairman.   No floor vote has been scheduled.   Kautter was most recently a tax partner at the firm RSM, which provides tax and audit services. He was also director of American Universitys Kogod Tax Center and had a long career at the auditing and consulting firm Ernst & Young LLP. Republicans are trying to pursue tax reform along partisan lines though a parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation, which would allow them to pass tax legislation by a simple majority in the Senate. Republicans control the chamber by only a 52-48 margin and would need 60 votes for tax reform without reconciliation. Democrats reject the Republican approach to tax reform, which they say would benefit corporations and the wealthy but do little for middle-class families.     Senator Ron Wyden, the finance panels top Democrat, said he decided to support Kautter because he believed the nominee would work to make tax reform a bipartisan effort between Republicans and Democrats. Bringing both sides together on the tax reform question is the key to a major set of economic reforms that will help us create more good-paying jobs and grow wages for working-class families, Wyden said. It is my hope that Mr. Kautter can help bring Republicans and Democrats together. Democrats initially criticized Kautter for not doing more as national tax director at Ernst & Young to prevent a tax avoidance scandal involving tax shelters for wealthy clients that led to criminal charges more than a decade ago.  Kautter told lawmakers in a hearing this week that he regretted not doing more.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans struggling to agree on healthcare legislation to overhaul Obamacare obeyed U.S. President Donald Trumps orders to try to swiftly reach a deal but were unable to resolve their differences in a long, late-night meeting. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump took Senate Republicans to task for failing to agree on how to dismantle Obamacare, as a new report showed 32 million Americans would lose health insurance if senators opt to repeal the law without a replacement. Trump gathered 49 Republican senators for a White House lunch after a bill to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act collapsed on Monday amid dissent from a handful of the partys conservatives and moderates.  After Trumps exhortation to keep trying, party members met with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price behind closed doors on Wednesday night to try to finally come together on a major Republican promise of the past seven years - undoing former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature legislation, popularly known as Obamacare. There was no immediate breakthrough. We still have some issues that divide us, said Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative who has proposed letting insurers offer cheaper bare-bones plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations.  Republicans attending the late meeting sent their staff away in order to talk frankly and Senator John Kennedy said everyone was negotiating in good faith but he added he did not know if they would reach agreement.  Almost all the other senators rushed off after the meeting without comment. As it was getting underway, the nearly two dozen Republican senators were shaken by news that their colleague, veteran Senator John McCain, had been diagnosed with brain cancer. McCains absence from the Senate makes the job of passing a healthcare bill more difficult because leaders need every Republican vote they can get. Obviously, I think more people are worried about his health than thinking about the math. You understand the math. Obviously it makes things difficult, Senator Bob Corker said as he left the meeting. Trump had taken a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week and suggested on Tuesday that he was fine with  letting Obamacare fail. Then on Wednesday he switched course and demanded senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they find common ground on healthcare. We can repeal, but we should repeal and replace, and we shouldnt leave town until this is complete, Trump said at the meeting. Trump made the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, which he has called a disaster, a central promise of his 2016 campaign. Even with Trumps new push, Republican leaders in the Senate face a difficult task getting moderates and conservatives to agree on an overhaul that can pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week, but several Republican senators have already said they oppose that approach.  Thirty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 if Obamacare is scrapped without an alternative in place, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported on Wednesday, while 17 million would become uninsured next year alone.  At the same time, premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026.  The CBOs estimates were unchanged from a previous report that assessed the impact of a 2015 bill to repeal Obamacare that passed the House of Representatives and Senate and was vetoed by Obama.  Democrats were swift to highlight the CBOs assessment, while Republicans remained silent. President Trump and Republicans have repeatedly promised to lower premiums and increase coverage, yet each proposal they offer would do the opposite, Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said in a statement.     Insurers and hospitals have lobbied against straight repeal, saying the limbo would increase uncertainty and their costs. CBO projects half the country would have no insurers in the individual market by 2020 under the new repeal bill. Thats a true death spiral, tweeted Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group. Republicans say Obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system. But the party is divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to Obamacare, which boosted the number of Americans with health insurance by 20 million through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. Moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito said they opposed McConnells plan for a repeal that would take effect in two years. All three attended the lunch with Trump. With Democrats united in opposition to repeal, McConnell can only lose two votes from the Republicans 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare legislation. Opponents of repeal protested throughout Senate buildings on Wednesday afternoon, leading to 155 arrests, police said. Demonstrators returned in the evening to yell as senators arrived for the meeting. Party fractures also emerged in the House of Representatives. The chamber passed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in May. But on Wednesday, the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Partys conservative wing, filed a petition to vote on a straight repeal. House Speaker Paul Ryans spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said: The House passed an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill we are proud of and we hope the Senate will take similar action.

The annual economic dialogue session in Washington ended with canceled news conferences, no joint statement and no new announcements on U.S. market access to China. The two sides had a frank exchange but failed to agree on most major bilateral trade and economic issues that were important to the United States, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. These included U.S. demands for access to Chinas financial services markets, reducing excess Chinese steel capacity, reductions in auto tariffs, cutting subsidies for state-owned enterprises, ending Chinese requirements for data localization and lifting ownership caps for foreign firms in China, the official said. China acknowledged our shared objective to reduce the trade deficit which both sides will work cooperatively to achieve,     U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a brief statement, highlighting a rare point of consensus. The Chinese embassy in Washington cast the talks in a positive light, saying in a statement that both sides had acknowledged significant progress on the 100-day talks and would to work together to reduce the trade deficit. The two sides will expand areas of cooperation in services and increase trade in services; expand mutual investment, and create a more open, equitable, transparent and convenient investment environment, the embassy said. Both sides agreed that one of the solutions to address the trade imbalance is for the United States to expand exports to China, instead of reducing imports from China, said Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao after the conclusion of the talks. To address the imbalance, China has been urging the United States to remove regulations on export control and increase the exports of high-tech products to China, the official Xinhua news agency cited Zhu as saying.  China will push for this in a one-year action plan for economic cooperation which both sides discussed, Zhu said.  FAR FROM MAR-A-LAGO The session had been billed as a follow-up to Trumps first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-A-Lago, Florida, estate in April when Trump hailed Xis cooperation in curbing the threat from North Korea. Trump said that this would lead to better trade terms for China. The two leaders launched a 100-day economic plan that has produced some industry-specific announcements, including the resumption of American beef sales in China and pledged to grant limited U.S. access to some financial services sectors. But there have been no new initiatives since, and Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Chinas lack of pressure on North Korea. His administration has threatened new sanctions on small Chinese banks and other firms doing business with Pyongyang.  Ross and Mnuchin said the U.S. position on the China trade relationship would be guided by the principles of balance, fairness, and reciprocity on matters of trade will continue to guide the American position so we can give American workers and businesses an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. Chinas delegation leader, Vice Premier Wang Yang, left the Treasury building without speaking to reporters. Earlier, he had warned that confrontation between the two countries would be damaging. Investors interpreted the negative signals from the talks and lack of new trade announcements as making it more likely that Trump would forge ahead with broad steel tariffs or quotas based on a national security review, sending steelmakers shares soaring. Shares of United States Steel Corp closed up 4.8 percent, while AK Steel rose 3.6 percent and Nucor rose 2.2 percent. Trump, asked by a reporter at the White House after the stock market closed whether he would impose steel tariffs, said: Could happen. Potential steel tariffs, which could be announced in the coming weeks, were expected to be a difficult topic in the U.S.-China talks. Ross has blamed massive Chinese excess capacity for a global steel glut that is hurting U.S. producers. Wednesdays deadlock was unsettling for U.S. business groups that had hoped to put more cracks in Beijings market access barriers and obviate more aggressive measures from the White House that could destabilize trade ties. We are disappointed the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue ended at an apparent impasse. It is important for governments to take tangible steps to address long-standing issues and ensure the commercial relationship remains a source of stability in the overall relationship, said Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council.  Even if the U.S. and Chinese governments fail to agree on more substantive trade terms, corporate chief executive officers from the two countries pledged to deepen their cooperation and joint investment efforts. Led by Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman and Alibaba Group CEO Jack Ma, a group of 20 executives said they were committing to increase bilateral trade, including the export of U.S. agricultural goods, liquefied natural gas and consumer products to China. A stable, growing economic relationship between the United States and China is mutually beneficial to the people of our two countries and for the world, Ma and Schwarzman said in a statement.

Then came word that two Republican senators not at the dinner - Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas - had announced their opposition to the healthcare proposals put forward by party leaders in the Senate. The setback on Monday night triggered a last-gasp effort by the president and top aides to keep the legislation from dying. He called 49 Republican senators over to the White House for lunch and a scolding on Wednesday, telling them they needed to settle their differences and that they should postpone their summer recess until a deal was done. For seven years you promised the American people you would repeal Obamacare. People are hurting and frankly inaction is not an option, said Trump, who desperately wants a legislative victory to make good on his campaign promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. It is by no means clear if Trumps pressure can help Republicans overcome sharp differences between moderates who want to preserve health insurance for their constituents and conservatives insisting on lower costs. But after doing little over the past few weeks to win senators support for the controversial legislation, Trump is now staking his reputation on getting them to cut a deal. Senior White House aides said on Wednesday the president sensed the healthcare effort could be salvaged despite the grim outlook. After a series of conversations with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as well as Lee, Senator John Cornyn of Texas and others, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Trump he felt it was possible to keep the effort alive. Trump agreed, based on his own talks with senators, and told aides he was hearing that a lot of people dont want this to be over, an aide said.  Senator Ted Cruz, who has led conservative criticisms of the proposals, was also sounding more positive. So Trump dispatched Vice President Mike Pence and Priebus to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to see if there was room to maneuver, the aides said. Pence and Priebus worked the room, talking to nearly every  senator present and urging them not to concede defeat. The two men reported back to Trump and he decided to invite the Republican senators for lunch, the aides said.  At that lunch, beneath the portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the White Houses State Dining Room, Trump made clear he wanted the senators to go back to the drawing board before heading out on vacation in August. Any senator who doesnt vote to open debate is really saying theyre okay with Obamacare, he told the room. We shouldnt leave town until this is complete, until this bill is on my desk and until we all go over to the Oval Office, Ill sign it and we cancelebrate with the American people. Some of the senators who have opposed parts of the legislative effort were strategically placed around the room. Next to Trump was Senator Dean Heller of Nevada and Lee was next to Pence. Trump referred to Heller with a chuckle, Look, he wants to remain a senator, doesnt he?  The comment drew a wry smile from Heller. After nearly two hours of talks over lunch, the group agreed to meet on Wednesday night to start talks on whether the hurdles could be overcome. But Cruz said after the meeting that they were still divided on some issues. Every Democrat in the Senate is opposed to the repeal of Obamacare, so it can only pass if Republicans are united. Polls show the proposals are unpopular, so some Republican lawmakers fear a backlash. White House aides said they hope an agreement can be worked out by next week.

The three men are the closest associates of the president to be called to speak to lawmakers involved in probing Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Trump, who came into office in January, has been dogged by allegations that his campaign officials were connected to Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of interfering in last years election.  Trump has denied any collusion.  The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Wednesday that it had called Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and  Manafort to testify on July 26 at a hearing. The presidents son released emails earlier this month that showed him eagerly agreeing to meet last year with a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The meeting was also attended by Manafort and Kushner, who is now a senior adviser at the White House. Kushner is scheduled to be interviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, July 24, behind closed doors. Working with and being responsive to the schedules of the committees, we have arranged Mr. Kushners interview with the Senate for July 24, Kushners attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement. He will continue to cooperate and appreciates the opportunity to assist in putting this matter to rest. A special counsel, Robert Mueller, is also conducting an investigation of Russian meddling in the U.S. election and any collusion between Moscow and Trumps campaign.  The issue has overshadowed Trumps tenure in office and irritated the president, who told the New York Times on Wednesday that he would not have appointed ally and former Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself from oversight of the Russia probe. Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else, Trump said in the interview. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, said the committees hearing would enable the panel to begin to get testimony under oath. There has been an enormous amount that has been said publicly but its not under oath, which means that people are free to omit matters or lie with relative impunity, Whitehouse told CNN. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting one of the main investigations of Russias meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion by Trump associates, but the Judiciary committee has been looking into related issues. The public Judiciary hearing on Wednesday will look into rules governing the registration of agents working for foreign governments in the United States and foreign attempts to influence U.S. elections. Chuck Grassley, the committees Republican chairman, has said he wanted to question the Trump associates, but has also raised concerns about why the Obama administration allowed Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the Trump Tower meeting in June, into the United States.  He also has called before the committee and threatened to subpoena Glenn Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, a firm that commissioned former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele to dig up opposition research on Trump, when he was a presidential candidate.

Kevin Brady, the top Republican on tax policy in the House as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans will look at the 3.8 percent Net Investment Income Tax in discussions aimed at unveiling a tax reform plan in September. The levy is a weight on economic growth, he said in an interview with Reuters. Efforts by Republicans to overhaul or repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, collapsed in the Senate on Tuesday in a major setback for Republican President Donald Trump. Given a wholesale repeal or overhaul now seems imperiled, Republicans are looking at other ways to attack a law they have vowed to overturn since it was signed by Democratic former President Barack Obama seven years ago. Brady said tax legislation was unlikely to be able to include the repeal of other Obamacare taxes. Doing so would result in about $1 trillion in additional revenue losses over a decade, cutting into efforts to avoid adding to the federal deficit in the overall tax package, he said.  Will we look at the Net Investment Income Tax provision? Yes, mainly because it is incredibly anti-growth the way it is today, Brady said. But he was cautious about a full repeal of the tax, given the large revenues involved and the fact that some Senate Republicans resisted overturning it as part of the healthcare bill that was under consideration. The tax raises $172.2 billion in revenue over 10 years to fund Obamacare, including health insurance subsidies for individuals.  Its repeal is viewed by critics, including some moderate Republicans, as a tax cut for the wealthy since the tax hits individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year and married couples with more than $250,000 in earnings. Brady said he was most concerned about the investment taxs effect on small businesses.  It doesnt just affect high earners. It goes across a broad spectrum of small business and captures too much of their activity as well. So we will take a look at that, he said. However, he noted, Youve got to ask the question: if it couldnt pass the Senate in healthcare, can it pass the Senate in tax reform?

But in a partial win for Trump, the court gave the government more leeway to enforce a separate ban on refugees that was included in a March 6 executive order the president said was necessary for national security. A federal judge had ruled against the government on the scope of both bans last Thursday, prompting the administration to seek Supreme Court intervention. The high courts mixed decision means that, for now, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and siblings-in-law are not covered by the 90-day travel ban on people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who want to enter the United States. The courts action on refugees could block entry of up to  24,000 refugees who have a connection to a U.S. resettlement agency, according to court papers. The Trump administration has said that even if all 24,000 were able to travel, not all of them would have been able to do so during the 120 days the refugee ban is in effect.  The brief order said the courts decision is temporary while the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considers a separate appeal on the same issue. Three of the conservatives on the court of nine justices noted that they would have granted Trumps request in full. In a statement, the U.S. Department of Justice said it looks forward to presenting its arguments to the 9th Circuit.  Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin, who challenged the bans in court, said in a statement that his office also is preparing arguments for the appeals court on the refugee issue. Chin said the Supreme Court had validated Hawaiis position that the Trump administration over-reached in trying to unilaterally keep families apart from each other. Naureen Shah, senior director of campaigns at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement that the decision on refugees jeopardizes the safety of thousands of people across the world including vulnerable families fleeing war and violence. The Supreme Court also announced on Wednesday that it has scheduled oral arguments on broad questions on the lawfulness of the ban for Oct. 10. The Trump administration last Friday asked the high court to  overturn a decision on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administrations temporary ban on travelers and the 120-day ban on refugees. The latest round in the fight over Trumps executive order began after the Supreme Court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans. Both had been blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court said then that the bans could take effect, but that people with a bona fide relationship to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred.  The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members. Hawaii asked Judge Watson to expand the definition of those who could be admitted and he ruled in favor of the state. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

To their credit, they mobilized quickly and aggressively, and yes, it had an impact, Brady told Reuters. It was a rare instance of a lawmaker acknowledging the impact of industry in lawmaking. The proposed border adjustment tax on U.S. companies that move jobs abroad and import products back into the U.S. market was meant to be a linchpin of a Republican tax overhaul in the House of Representatives.  Brady said leading companies that rely on imports lobbied aggressively, eroding Republican support for the border tax.  While not declaring the proposed border tax dead, Brady acknowledged being open to alternatives that would accomplish the same goals, primarily removing incentives for American companies to move operations overseas. Retailers were united in their response. Led by the Retail Industry Leaders Association, CEOs of Target (TGT.N) and Autozone (AZO.N) and lobbyists for auto manufacturers like Toyota (7203.T) met with members of Congress and the administration.  I have seen no other issue bring the retail industry closer together than this one, said Brian Dodge, spokesman for the association. The threat to retailers was enormous and the response needed to be swift and strong. We are proud of the work we have done and the impact we have had, but we are not done yet, he said. As long as leaders continue to defend the BAT, the threat remains and our fight continues.    The National Retail Federation, a group that includes large and small retail business owners and also helped launch the coalition against the tax, took a group of small business owners to Washington this week to argue against the border tax.  Earlier this year they took 20 CEOs to Washington and have been running television advertisements in home districts of lawmakers they were working to persuade.  In 150 meetings with lawmakers this week, they drove home how the tax would force them to raise prices. Hardest hit would be low and middle-income consumers, especially those on a fixed income, NRF Senior Vice President David French wrote to Brady in a letter on Wednesday. The failure of Republicans to repeal Obamacare, the signature 2010 healthcare overhaul of Democratic former President Barack Obama, has many in Congress now turning their attention to tax. Republican President Donald Trump has vowed to sign a tax overhaul into law this year. Both political parties have voiced support for an overhaul, but expectations of progress have been tempered by their varying approaches, a lack of cooperation on healthcare, and corporate opposition to the House Republican plan. Commenting on the border-adjustment tax, House Speaker Paul Ryan said: I understand its controversial and some people dont like it.  Ryan told The Mike Gallagher Show syndicated radio program on Wednesday: At the end of the day, what matters is we get tax reform that we can all agree to, and so were working toward that consensus ... Were going to get there. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

My understanding is that the invitation has been declined for this year, Sanders told reporters at a briefing.

We would certainly like to be able to continue to do that, Sanders said. The NAACP did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The S&P 1500 steel index .SPCOMSTEEL jumped 2.3 percent to its highest level since early May. U.S. Steel (X.N) rose 4.9 percent, AK Steel (AKS.N) gained 3.6 percent and Nucor (NUE.N) climbed 2.2 percent.    In opening remarks at an annual summer dialogue between Washington and Beijing, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross criticized Chinas $347 billion trade surplus with the United States.      Rosss comments heightened expectations on Wall Street that Trump would follow through on threats to apply new tariffs to remedy a big problem of steel dumping from China and others. Investors are essentially handicapping a probability that Trump will announce a broad-based anti-dumping measure on steel imports, said Longbow Research analyst Christopher Olin. Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a Section 232 review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if  national security is threatened.  Steel producers in the United States, like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel, stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices. But such tariffs would hurt U.S. manufacturers who buy steel. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Philip Gibbs said speculation that the Commerce Department would soon release its section 232 report was helping steel stocks. He added that potential U.S. tariffs on steel could be found illegal by the World Trade Organization. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pressed his unproven claims of voter fraud on Wednesday at the first meeting of a commission he created to study the issue, and implied states that did not share voter data with the panel had something to hide. The panel has faced lacerating criticism from Democrats and voting rights groups that argued it could be a vehicle for changes that would make it harder for lawful voters to cast ballots - and by a number of state governments reluctant to hand over information about their voters to the White House. Despite evidence from state officials from both parties that voter fraud is rare in U.S. elections, Trump has claimed that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the November 2016 election. Every time voter fraud occurs it cancels out the vote of a lawful citizen, he told the commission. Any form of illegal or fraudulent voting, whether by non-citizens or the deceased, and any form of voter suppression or intimidation must be stopped. Trump won the state-by-state Electoral College tally that decides the presidential race, but he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May and assigned Vice President Mike Pence to lead it. The panel will next gather in September, and hold at least four more meetings over nine months. Some members of the panel emphasized that even small numbers of illegal votes could affect the outcome of elections. Bill Gardner, a Democrat who has been involved in almost 500 vote recounts in New Hampshire since becoming its secretary of state in 1976, said he has seen 11 end in a tie, 32 decided by one vote, and 202 by fewer than 10 votes. I am a witness that every vote matters, and it doesnt need to be massive voter fraud to sway the outcome, Gardner said.  Alan King, a Democrat who is a probate judge from Jefferson County in Alabama, said he has not seen evidence of voter fraud - but said local governments need help from Congress to keep up with changing technology. We can talk about elections a lot, but if people cant vote because the machines dont work, weve got a massive, massive problem, said King. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commission could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder to vote. I can tell you, President Trump, that we will be watching your commission, said U.S. Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama, an African-American whose district includes the civil rights landmarks Selma, Montgomery and Birmingham, where, she said, people died, bled and fought for the right to vote. The panel ran headlong into controversy last month when its vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states to turn over voter information. The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. More than 20 states refused outright and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data.  Trump questioned the states refusal, saying, If any state does not want to share this information, one has to wonder what theyre worried about? ... Theres something, there always is. Several federal lawsuits have been filed against the voting commission. The American Civil Liberties Unions lawsuit alleged that the panel failed to comply with federal transparency laws, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund alleged the commission was formed with the intent to discriminate against voters of color. Other lawsuits, including one from the Electronic Privacy Information Center, raised concerns about Americans privacy. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The two leaders held a formal two-hour bilateral meeting on July 7 in which Trump later said Putin denied allegations that he directed efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trumps interactions with the Russian leader were scrutinized closely because of those allegations, which have dominated his first six months in the White House, and Trumps comments as a presidential candidate praising the former KGB spy. Trump and Putin first met at the G20 during a gathering of other leaders, which was shown in a video. They later held the  bilateral meeting, which was attended briefly by a pool of reporters.  In the evening, both men attended a dinner with G20 leaders. Putin was seated next to U.S. first lady Melania Trump. The U.S. president went over to them at the conclusion of the dinner and visited with Putin, the official said. That conversation had not been previously disclosed. There was no second meeting between President Trump and President Putin, just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner. The insinuation that the White House has tried to hide a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd, the official said. In a tweet late on Tuesday, Trump said: Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is sick. All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew! News of the conversation, first reported by Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, could raise renewed concern as Congress and a special counsel investigate allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help Trump, a Republican, win the presidency. Trump says there was no collusion and Russia denies interference in the election. Bremmer said Trump got up from his seat halfway through dinner and spent about an hour talking privately and animatedly with Putin, joined only by Putins own translator. The lack of a U.S. translator raised eyebrows among other leaders at the dinner, said Bremmer, who called it a breach of national security protocol. The White House official said the leaders and their spouses were only permitted to have one translator attend the dinner. Trump sat next to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abes wife. His translator spoke Japanese. When President Trump spoke to President Putin, the two leaders used the Russian translator, since the American translator did not speak Russian, the official said. A U.S. official who was briefed by some of his counterparts about the encounter said some of the leaders who attended the dinner were surprised to see Trump leave his seat and engage Putin in an extended private conversation with no one else from the U.S. side present. No one is sure what their discussion was about, and whether it was purely social or touched on bilateral or international issues, the official said. As part of the investigations into allegations of Moscows meddling, a congressional panel said on Tuesday it wanted to interview Trumps eldest son, his former campaign chairman and all others who were at a June 2016 meeting with Russian nationals. The meeting in Trump Tower in New York has grabbed the spotlight in the saga of possible collusion between Moscow and Trumps campaign as media reports of more participants than originally known have emerged.  Donald Trump Jr., who runs the Trump Organization family business, released emails last week in which he eagerly agreed to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscows official support for his fathers campaign. Any intelligence out there that suggests that somebody is of interest to us, we have to pursue it, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Republican Senator Richard Burr, told reporters. Trump Jr.s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Paul Manafort, Trumps campaign manager from March to August, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On July 10, Trump Jr. posted on Twitter: Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know. MOSCOW-BASED DEVELOPER A man who works for a Moscow-based developer with ties to Trump was identified on Tuesday as the eighth person to attend the Trump Tower meeting. Lawyer Scott Balber confirmed Ike Kaveladzes name to Reuters after CNN reported that his client had been identified by special counsel Robert Muellers prosecutors and was cooperating in their investigation. Balber represented Trump in the New York businessmans 2013 lawsuit against comedian and television host Bill Maher, demanding the $5 million Maher offered to give to charity if Trump could prove his father was not an orangutan. Kaveladzes LinkedIn profile identifies him as vice president of Crocus Group, a company run by Moscow-based developers Aras Agalarov and his son, Emin, an Azerbaijani-Russian pop star. The two have ties to the Trump family and helped set up last years meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Kaveladze was asked to go to the meeting with the understanding he would be a translator for Veselnitskaya, only to find she had brought her own translator with her, Balber told CNN. Balber said he also represented the Agalarovs. Balber said Muellers investigators had not interviewed his client or made contact about the Agalarovs. In addition to Trump Jr., lawyer Veselnitskaya, her translator, and Kaveladze, the meeting was attended by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, Manafort, publicist Rob Goldstone and Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin.

Ramsey County District Court Chief Judge John Guthmann ruled the Democratic governors line-item veto of fiscal 2018-2019 legislative appropriations violated the state constitutions separation of powers clause. Lawmakers sued Dayton last month claiming his veto of nearly $130 million for the Republican-controlled legislature in the two-year budget was unconstitutional. In late June, the judge ordered funding to resume temporarily, pending the outcome of the litigation. Today the court ruled an entire branch of government cannot be eliminated by a stroke of the governors pen, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a Republican, said in a statement. He urged Dayton to accept the verdict. But the governor said he will appeal the ruling to the Minnesota Supreme Court.  As I have said, the tax bill passed last May by Republican legislators jeopardizes Minnesotas structurally balanced budget in the future, Dayton said in a statement.  The governor took the veto action in an effort to win concessions from Republican lawmakers on taxes and other measures.  Guthmann concluded it was improper for the governor to use his line-item veto authority to gain a repeal or modification of unrelated policy legislation by effectively eliminating a co-equal branch of government. Daytons veto also raised credit concerns for the state by leaving $80.1 million of certificates of participation issued in 2014 for a Senate office facility without an appropriation for rental and debt payments next due in November and December.  After the judge ordered funding to resume, S&P on June 30 affirmed Minnesotas AA-plus rating and removed it from a watch list for a potential downgrade.

Representative Robert Latta, a Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, said he would continue to consider changes before the full committee votes on the measure, expected next week. The full U.S. House of Representatives will not take up the bill until it reconvenes in September after the summer recess. The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Automakers would have to show self-driving cars function as intended and contain fail safe features to get exemptions from safety standards but the Transportation Department could not condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications, the draft measure unveiled late Monday said. The issue has taken new urgency because road deaths in the United States rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data showed. Current federal motor vehicle safety rules prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. General Motors Co (GM.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor  Co (F.N),  Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal. California state assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez questioned why Washington would want us here in the states to not look at the safety standards  it should be up to every state. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, said the bill creates a strong but flexible regulatory framework that seeks to avoid a patchwork of different state rules. Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers. Democrats praised the bipartisan proposal but said they want more changes before the full committee takes it up, including potentially adding other auto safety measures. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said it is pleased that the legislation is moving forward, and expect to see areas fine-tuned in the legislation. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the bill needs more changes and must ensure that automakers demonstrate automated vehicles safety and dont put consumers at greater risk in a crash. The group opposes restricting states safety authority without strong federal safety standards in place. The administration of former President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trumps transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months. Separately, Republican Senator John Thune, who is working with Democrats, said Wednesday he hopes to release a draft self-driving car reform bill before the end of July.

The U.S. Trade Representatives office notified South Korea last week of its intent to negotiate amendments to the pact, calling for talks to start in August. Republican President Donald Trump said in April he planned to renegotiate or terminate what he called a horrible trade deal. Since the pact, known as KORUS, went into effect in 2012, the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled to nearly $28 billion last year.  Brady, who chairs the trade- and tax-focused Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives, said the United States should be aggressively stepping into the Asia-Pacific market. Thats not an easy task if youre going to go at trade country-by-country ... This is a question of, do we want American trade values in the world or do we want Chinas trade values? Brady said. Three days after taking office in January, Trump officially withdrew the United States from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, keeping an election campaign promise and emphasizing a preference for bilateral trade deals. Some critics of that move have said it opened a trade policy vacuum in Asia that China would move to fill. Clearly, this administration believes it can achieve more in the bilaterals.

Lawyers for the senator in a court filing on Tuesday pointed to the June 2016 Supreme Court decision that overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. The court found that political activities such as arranging meetings or making calls to officials do not qualify as official acts as defined by bribery statutes. The high courts decision prompted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week to vacate the conviction of Sheldon Silver, the former speaker of the New York State Assembly and one of the states most powerful politicians for decades. U.S. prosecutors have said they will retry him. Other convicted politicians, including former New York State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, have also relied on the McDonnell decision in mounting post-trial appeals. Menendez, who will seek a third six-year term in 2018 despite the indictment, is accused of accepting campaign donations, luxury travel and gifts from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his office to lobby on the doctors behalf. Melgen was convicted in April of an unrelated Medicare scheme in Florida that authorities said robbed the health care program of as much as $105 million. He and Menendez have pleaded not guilty in New Jersey. Menendez lost a previous bid to dismiss the charges, but his argument in that challenge came before the Supreme Court decision on the McDonnell case. Menendezs lawyers argued on Tuesday that the allegations against the senator must be dismissed in light of the Supreme Courts ruling.

Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Senate Banking Committee writing legislation to tackle the rule, said Wednesday he was optimistic that Congress could pass a resolution revoking the new regulation authored by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within weeks. Im going to do all I can to repeal this regulation in the next three weeks of this congressional session, he said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Cotton is drafting legislation that would repeal the CFPBs new ban on mandatory arbitration clauses often found in financial contracts. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can pass legislation repealing any new regulations with a simple majority.  Mandatory arbitration clauses, found across a range of financial contracts, require consumers to resolve any disputes through arbitration instead of joining together in class-action lawsuits. Consumer advocates have hailed the CFPB rulemaking, arguing that the fine print frequently found in financial contracts unfairly bars consumers from seeking that option. If Republican majorities in the House and Senate rally around the bill, they would be able to eliminate the new rule, which the CFPB formally finalized on Tuesday. Cotton said he was working with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo on the bill, and was optimistic it would garner broad support. He went so far as to predict half a dozen or so Democrats in the Senate could join Republicans in eliminating the rule, although Democrats are generally supportive of the CFPBs regulatory work and no Democratic senator has publicly criticized the rule. The House is expected to move first on a repeal bill, passing a measure next week, according to Cotton.  Republican efforts to repeal the regulation via legislation is one of several fronts in an attack on the CFPB initiative. Other financial regulators could consider challenging the rule, and business groups have indicated a legal challenge is on the way as well. The agency has shirked its obligation to properly study the arbitration issue, as it was mandated by Congress, said Lisa Rickard, president of the Chamber of Commerces Institute for Legal Reform.

Reuters reported on April 26 that public pension funds in at least seven U.S. states periodically send millions of dollars to an investment fund that owns the upscale Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium in New York City and pays a Trump company to run it, according to a Reuters review of public records. Two legal advocacy groups sent petitions to half a million of their members and letters urging state officials who oversee the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Common Retirement Fund to reconsider their investments in CIM Fund III, which owns the Trump SoHo.  The money used for this investment comes from mandatory deductions from the paychecks of public employees. These employees are thus forced to indirectly subsidize President Trump beyond the Constitutions mandate of a fixed salary, said the letters from Free Speech for People in Newton, Massachusetts, and Courage Campaign in Los Angeles. Article II of the U.S. Constitution bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments. The fees that public pension funds pay CIM may fall into that category, several constitutional lawyers have told Reuters. The White House in June rejected the allegation that government payments to Trumps businesses violated the Constitution and said partisan politics had motivated lawsuits challenging Trumps continued ownership of his businesses. The advocacy groups urged the pension funds either to divest from the CIM fund or work with other investors to demand that CIM end its relationship with the Trump Organization. CalPERS declined to comment, but CalPERS officials disclosed in response to a public records request that the pension fund paid CIM $1,722,418 in management fees for the first three months of 2017. In a statement, a spokesman for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli noted that the CIM fund was in the process of gradually selling off the properties it owns and said the New York state pension fund has limited rights as an investor and does not make or control CIMs investment choices.  CIM said in a statement that it is committed to creating attractive investment opportunities for its investors and then overseeing those investments to produce the best outcomes possible for the funds it manages. It added that the Trump SoHo was underperforming and said it was working hard to restore its performance before we bring it to market. The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment.   Democratic officials and lawmakers have also raised concerns over the payment chain between the public pension funds and the Trump SoHo.  The public pension funds investments in CIM Fund III were cited in a June lawsuit that the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed against Trump, alleging that government payments to his businesses violated the Constitution. In May, the top Democrat on the Senate committee overseeing pensions asked the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to assess the constitutionality of the payments. The office said it was not authorized to probe presidential actions. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The disarray in the Republican-controlled Senate rattled financial markets as it cast doubt on the chances of getting Trumps other domestic policy priorities, such as tax reform, through a divided Congress. Trump said he was disappointed by the failure and suggested he might let the insurance markets created under Obamacare go under and then, potentially, work with Democrats on a rescue. Were probably in that position where well just let Obamacare fail, Trump told reporters at the White House. We will let Obamacare fail, and then the Democrats are going to come to us. U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a vote on a straight repeal of Obamacare, which would take effect in two years, after it became clear on Monday night that he did not have enough support to pass an overhaul of the healthcare law. He said on Tuesday that the vote would take place early next week. But prospects for the repeal vote appeared doomed with at least three Republican senators voicing opposition. Moderate Republican Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska quickly announced they would not back repeal. With Democrats united in opposition, Republicans can only afford to lose two votes to pass the measure in the Senate, where they have a slim 52-48 majority. I do not think that its going to be constructive to repeal a law that at this point is so interwoven within our healthcare system and then hope that over the next two years we will come up with some kind of replacement, Collins told reporters. The failed effort to replace Obamacare raised new concerns for U.S. health insurers over whether the government would continue to fund billionsof dollars in medical benefit subsidies. Obamacare has boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law. This has been a very, very challenging experience for all of us, McConnell said, adding that the chamber needed to move on to issues like tax reform and a spending package to bolster the countrys infrastructure. As the healthcare bill collapsed in the Senate, leaders in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives unveiled a budget plan putting a proposed tax code overhaul on the same partisan procedural path that led to the anti-Obamacare initiatives chaotic downfall. Republicans had hoped to finish with healthcare before an upcoming August recess so they could tackle a wide-ranging rewrite of the U.S. tax code in September. Separate talks on taxes appear unlikely to reach Trumps pledge to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent.     But their failure exposed the sharp divide within Republicans own ranks, with moderates concerned the healthcare bills Medicaid cuts would take insurance away from millions of low-income Americans while conservatives backed the cuts and wanted even more dramatic changes to Obamacare. The U.S. dollar stumbled to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields fell after the fresh setback to the healthcare bill raised investors doubts about Trumps ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Reaction in the stock market was muted, and analysts said the expectation for business-friendly legislation out of Washington is all but priced out of the stock market. The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trumps agenda to 2018, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  Trump vowed that the healthcare effort was not dead. In an early morning Twitter message, he said, We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard. We will return! Trump had pushed hard to get a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare through the U.S. House of Representatives in May and celebrated the victory with lawmakers on the White House lawn. But with polls showing the Republican bill was unpopular, he later called it mean and did little to convince Republican senators to get a deal. Vice President Mike Pence said Trump supported the move to vote on a straight repeal of Obamacare. Inaction is not an option, Pence said at the National Retail Federation Conference in Washington. Congress needs to step up, Congress needs to do their job, and Congress needs to do their job now. In crafting a replacement, Republicans ran up against Obamacares growing popularity. A Washington Post-ABC News poll published on Sunday showed Americans preferred it over the Republican alternative by a 2-1 margin.   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to start over and work with Democrats. Democratic Senator Patty Murray, the leading Democrat on the Senate health committee, said in an interview with Reuters that a bipartisan effort could help stabilize insurance markets. She said a bipartisan effort to fund cost-sharing subsidies that help cover premiums, deductibles and other medical expenses for about 7 million people who purchase health insurance on the individual market would send a strong message to the market and create some stabilization that is much needed. Within hours of the bills failure, Republican Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander said he will set hearings in the next few weeks on how to stabilize the individual insurance markets. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on the Senate floor that the failure could mean Congress will have to bail out insurance markets probably before the end of 2017. For hospitals, shelving the bill relieves the near-term pressure of massive Medicaid reform, but the long-term plan for federal spending for states Medicaid expansion is now murky.

The healthcare bill under consideration in the U.S. Senate would have settled the funding question, but was scrapped after Republican leaders were unable to rally enough party members to win approval.   Its demise will test the ability of Republicans and Democrats to stabilize an insurance market serving some 10 million Americans in time for 2018.  Republican President Donald Trump has suggested several times that he could eliminate the so-called cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which help pay for consumers out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.  The administration could do so as early as August. Insurers have braced for an end to these payments, in many cases raising proposed premium prices for 2018 more than 20 percent to make up for the lost funding. Insurers said on Tuesdaythey would like Congress to appropriate the funds for these payments. If that does not happen, and the Trump administration takes further measures to undermine Democratic former President Barack Obamas healthcare law, more insurers may pull out of markets for next year ahead of a late September deadline.  That could force consumers to change plans or insurers - or leave them with no options at all. Our members and all Americans need the certainty and security of knowing coverage will be available and affordable for them, said Justine Handelman, senior vice president in the Office of Policy and Representation at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents insurers nationwide.  We have consistently urged that there be immediate, certain funding for the cost-sharing reduction program, which helps those most in need with out-of-pocket costs when they access medical care. Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH.N), which provides Obamacare health plans to more than 1 million people, said the fate of cost-sharing subsidies is one of its top concerns. The Trump administration could take other steps on its own to undermine Obamacare, including refusing to enforce the individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine.      Trump has repeatedly said Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, is collapsing, and on Tuesday suggested letting it fail to force Democrats to work on a healthcare fix. Earlier this year, the administration backed off more strictly enforcing the individual mandate and pulled ads that encouraged people to sign up for health insurance. Uncertainty over the governments next steps on Obamacare weighed on insurer shares on Tuesday, with Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) down 1.4 percent and Aetna Inc (AET.N) off 1.1 percent. UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N), which pulled out of the Obamacare individual insurance business, rose 0.3 percent after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote in the coming days on a full repeal of Obamacare with no replacement, but he did not appear to have the necessary support to push it through. Some Republicans and Democrats say they should attempt a joint fix, but the deep divisions between the two parties were on display over the subsidies on Tuesday. Democratic Senator Patty Murray said that bipartisan work can begin by having Congress fund the cost-sharing subsidies. We know thats what needs to be done, she said in an interview.

While tech companies often lobby Washington on privacy issues, the major firms have been hesitant to enter a fray over a controversial portion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), industry lobbyists, congressional aides and civil liberties advocates said.  Among their concerns is that doing so could jeopardize a trans-Atlantic data transfer pact underpinning billions of dollars in trade in digital services, the sources said. Technology companies and privacy groups have for years complained about the part of FISA known as Section 702 that allows the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to collect and analyze emails and other digital communications of foreigners living overseas. Though targeted at foreigners, the surveillance also collects data on an unknown number of Americans - some privacy advocates have suggested it could be millions - without a search warrant. Section 702 will expire at the end of the year unless the Republican-controlled Congress votes to reauthorize it. The White House, U.S. intelligence agencies and many Republican senators want to renew the law, which they consider vital to national security, without changes and make it permanent. A coalition of Democrats and libertarian-leaning conservatives prefer, however, to amend the law with more privacy safeguards. Reform Government Surveillance, a coalition of tech firms established after the 2013 leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, said reforming the law remains a priority. A spokeswoman declined to comment further but referred to two letters sent earlier this year by technology companies urging Congress to consider changes to the law. Snowden exposed the spy agencys program that collected U.S. phone call metadata in bulk and also the extent of spying under Section 702, embarrassing some U.S. technology firms. The companies, working with privacy rights activists, successfully lobbied Congress two years ago to pass legislation that curtailed the NSAs bulk collection of call records. For example, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page that he had personally called then-President Barack Obama to express frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future. Now, however, Silicon Valleys reduced involvement frustrates civil liberties groups because of a widely held view that Section 702 poses a far greater threat to privacy than the telephone program, which did not harvest actual content. Facebook declined comment. Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. The companies relative inactivity is explained by several legal challenges in Europe to an agreement between the United States and the European Union, known as the Privacy Shield, the sources said. The litigation hinges on whether U.S. surveillance practices afford enough privacy safeguards. A coalition of human rights organizations has urged Europe to suspend Privacy Shield unless Section 702 is substantially reformed. U.S. technology companies have privately bristled at those efforts, three industry lobbyists said, in part because expectations that 702 reforms will pass Congress are low. If you link them and you lose one, you lose both, said one of the lobbyists, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with technology companies.  The lobbyist added that several major firms were more interested in making deals with the Trump administration that could affect their bottom lines, such as tax repatriation, than getting caught in politically charged fights over government surveillance. Another industry lobbyist said Section 702 surveillance is not a C-suite issue that concerns chief executives in Silicon Valley like other issues, including encryption. Companies have also been limited in how they can lobby for changes to the law because no comprehensive reform bill has been introduced yet in Congress, said Alex Abdo, a privacy advocate and staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House Judiciary Committee is not expected to introduce such legislation until after Congress returns from its August recess. The schism between tech companies and privacy groups was on display earlier this year in litigation in Ireland - Facebook argued customer data was sufficiently protected from U.S. spying programs, while an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union testified that more protections were needed. Snowdens leaks showed that Section 702 collects content of digital communications directly from the internet backbone and through a program formerly code named Prism where the NSA gathered data directly from several companies, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The statute also allows the FBI and others to query pools of data collection for U.S. information in what critics have derided as a backdoor search loophole that evades traditional warrant requirements.  The tech industry may become more engaged once the public debate becomes clearer, Abdo said. He added that a stronger position would be enormously helpful to those that want to impose meaningful constraint on NSA surveillance.

The $4 trillion spending blueprint, released by the House of Representatives budget committee, could become a new flashpoint for Republican in-fighting because it links future tax cuts for businesses and individuals with $203 billion in mandatory spending cuts that would reduce benefits for the poor. The Republican push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, collapsed in the Senate late on Monday after a tug-of-war between party moderates who wanted to preserve healthcare benefits for lower-income Americans and conservatives who wanted to scale them back. On Tuesday, House Republicans disagreed over the budget proposal in terms that could foreshadow a replay of the Senate healthcare debacle when lawmakers turn to tax reform. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the budget measure would not get enough conservative votes to pass the House without bigger cuts to programs that the government is required to fund by law. Its still short of what it needs, Meadows told reporters. On the other side, Representative Charlie Dent, a leader of the moderate Tuesday Group, called for an agreement with Democrats to establish higher spending levels for discretionary programs. If we move too much in the mandatory area, then it will make tax reform that much more difficult to get. Its that basic, Dent told Reuters. House and Senate approval for a fiscal 2018 budget agreement would unlock a vital legislative tool called reconciliation that allows Republicans to pass tax legislation in the Senate with a simple majority. But the Senates inability to pass healthcare legislation   even with reconciliation raised questions about how useful the strategy really is.  One corporate lobbyist said some Senate Republicans privately question the reconciliation approach backed by House leaders, saying it appears to be poisoning the well in the Senate by alienating Democrats who might otherwise support tax legislation.  Republicans have only a 52-48 Senate majority and can afford to lose no more than two votes on Republican-only legislation, with Vice President Mike Pence providing the tie-breaking vote. Democrats were delighted by the Republicans failure on healthcare and called for bipartisan discussions. Using a partisan approach for the major issues of our time  healthcare and tax reform  is a prescription for trouble, Senator Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said at a tax reform hearing on Tuesday. Senator Orrin Hatch, the panels Republican chairman, acknowledged that Republicans would also have difficulty passing tax reform legislation, even using reconciliation.  Its going to be difficult to do. Hopefully, we can get that done, Hatch told reporters.  The Senate is under no obligation to accept the House budget language that would ultimately tie tax reform to mandatory spending cuts in the same piece of legislation. Senator John Thune, chairman of the Senate Republican conference, said senators will decide whether to add the same language to their own budget resolution. After six months in power, President Donald Trump has yet to score a major legislative victory, though financial markets have rallied since his election on expectations of pro-business measures, including tax reform and infrastructure spending. Pence, speaking to a gathering of retailers in Washington on Tuesday, reiterated that Trump plans to slash the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. But the failure of the healthcare bill in the Senate created uncertainty in financial markets, with the dollar hitting its lowest level against the euro in more than a year on Tuesday. The healthcare bill not coming through raises some continued concerns about the ability of Washington to push through favorable fiscal policies, said Lisa Kopp, head of traditional investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. The S&P 500 stock market index has gained about 15 percent since Trumps Nov. 8 election, while the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average has posted one record high after another on optimism of a Trump tax reform and other pro-business policies. The budget committee will hold a hearing on the budget resolution on Wednesday. Representative Diane Black, the panels chair, said the measure has the votes to reach the House floor.

With 52 Republican senators in the 100-member chamber, McConnell could lose only two of his colleagues on any bill that was opposed by Democrats and still win with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.  Three times, he failed to muster the 50 supporters needed.  The man who epitomized the party of no in Democrats eyes during Obamas presidency, especially when he slammed the door in February 2016 on Merrick Garlands Supreme Court nomination, fell victim to the no of fellow Republicans. We finally get a chance to repeal and replace, and they dont take advantage of it, Trump, six months into his four-year presidential term, said on Tuesday. Across Washington, there was dismay Republicans could not deliver on a promise they assert helped them to assume control in January of Congress and the White House. I am kind of shocked, said Republican Representative Dave Brat, of the conservative firebrand House Freedom Caucus that has been a thorn in the side of the Republican establishment. His hand weakened, McConnell could be heading into fierce budget battles, a tax reform fight and a storm over legislation avoiding a government debt default that could shake global financial markets. The result has Democrats feeling emboldened 16 months before the next congressional elections. Around town, the sphinxlike McConnell is known as a master of Senate rules, able to outfox opponents, giving nothing away until he can strike at just the right moment. The senators leadership job, a position he yearned for in the years leading up to his 2015 ascension, does not appear to be in jeopardy.  But this rocky run calls into question McConnells reputation as a master tactician and deal-maker that he earned as Republican minority leader under the Democratic Obama. It is a real blow to Republicans in Congress generally and to leadership, said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican.  More of the blame sits with the rank-and-file, Lott said. The problem in Washington today is not lack of leadership. The problem is lack of followership. Had McConnell succeeded, Lott said he would have been considered a magician given the inability of Republicans to coalesce around healthcare legislation for so many years. A Republican operative with ties to McConnell saw a possible silver lining: Failure to pass healthcare could boost chances for tax reform or infrastructure investment if Republicans felt it a more urgent political imperative to rack up a win for Trump before the November 2018 congressional elections. McConnell, a courtly Kentuckian who can appear at pains to speak to reporters nipping at his heels, won accolades in years past for cutting deals with Democrats to keep the government operating and making permanent most of former President George W. Bushs tax cuts. Those deals involved giving voters government services and lower taxes. But Republican healthcare legislation involves taking something away from millions of lower-income people - their medical coverage. In part they (Republicans) misunderstood how difficult it will be to repeal and replace Obamacare, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat, said in a phone interview. Republican rhetoric against Obamacare was so hyperbolic it had to take priority early in Trumps presidency, but senators lacked enthusiasm for legislation, said Daschle, who like Lott lobbies on behalf of healthcare interests.  Once boxed into healthcare, McConnell took another controversial step, one that many Republicans questioned. Instead of developing a healthcare bill in public,  McConnell and his top aides, with the advice of a 13-member group of male senators, called the shots. McConnell said hearings were unnecessary, as healthcare policy had been intensively debated since Obama took office in 2009. He said he was listening to suggestions of all of his 51 fellow Republican senators. Many senators felt disconnected and tensions boiled over. As Monday wore on, matters only got worse for McConnell. Republican Senator Ron Johnson publicly accused him of a real breach in trust in hard-charging back-room negotiations. He threatened to withhold support for the bill. McConnell supporters argued that no matter how he handled the private negotiations, the Republican leader was dealt a difficult hand from the outset. The majority leader is trying to keep all the frogs in the wheelbarrow and its a tough job but hes doing a good job, said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. And then there was Trump. As McConnell struggled, the president was in France last week celebrating Bastille Day before jetting back to the United States to attend a tournament at his New Jersey golf course. He tweeted about his excitement at the tournament, his disgust with fake news and an investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. Trump boasted that the White House is functioning perfectly and I have very little time for watching T.V. Missing, some Senate aides said, was Trump traveling the country in a serious effort to bolster support for McConnells efforts. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The legislation puts California at the forefront of plans by mostly Democratic governors to reduce carbon emissions and adhere to the goals of the Paris climate change agreement even after Republican President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the pact. Brown and other state Democratic leaders have vowed to make California the leader in opposing the environmental policy of Trump, who has rolled back the programs of his predecessor, Barack Obama. The new California legislation emerged from long negotiations, although only a single Republican joined Democrats in voting in favor of the legislative package in the state Senate on Monday afternoon. Hours later, the Assembly voted 55 to 21 to send the legislation to Brown.    Tonight, California stood tall and once again, boldly confronted the existential threat of our time. Republicans and Democrats set aside their difference, came together and took courageous action. Thats what good government looks like, Brown said in a statement. Speaking in opposition, State Senator Andy Vidak said the laws represented a regressive tax that would not make any impact on climate change. We could shut down the entire state of California and it would have no effect on the global climate, Vidak said. The legislation extends Californias cap-and-trade program, which was set to expire in three years, through 2030 and attempts to strengthen it by requiring large industrial facilities to upgrade old equipment with cleaner, more modern technology by 2023.  Californias cap-and-trade plan sets a state limit on emissions of greenhouse gases and lets companies, such as factories and refineries, buy and sell permits to emit carbon dioxide. The system uses market forces to find the most efficient ways to cut pollution, supporters say. The new package seeks to reform the states existing cap-and-trade market by curbing the number of free carbon allowances by 40 percent by 2030 and requiring that offsets be sourced from California, not elsewhere.  Despite holding a supermajority, Democrats had failed in previous attempts to pass new cap-and-trade legislation over opposition from more liberal members of the party who felt it did not go far enough and moderates concerned about the impact on business. Republicans were largely united in opposing the legislation, saying it places unfair burdens on consumers and employers, especially on top of a 12-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax hike passed by state lawmakers earlier this year.

(Reuters) - The California Public Employees Retirement System(CalPERS) on Monday said it was considering making direct investments in private companies, a potential major shift in strategy that would be the first such action by a U.S. public pension fund. The change, discussed at a meeting of CalPERS board in Monterey, would be closely watched by other U.S. public pensions as they look to improve returns on their investments, in part by cutting fees.  The $323 billion pension fund, the largest in the country and a trend setter, has been under increasing pressure to achieve returns closer to the funds assumed rate of return of 7 percent by 2020.  In the fiscal year ended June 30, private equity investment returned 13.9 percent, the second best performer behind public equities, or stock portfolio. The asset class helped to boost the funds total year-end returns to 11.2 percent, exceeding expectations for the first time since 2014. Private equity has been CalPERS best performing asset class in the past two decades and accounts for about $26 billion of its portfolio. But CalPERS mainly invests in private equity funds and has been criticized for accepting the high fees and limited disclosures typically associated with the asset class. The shift in strategy, if adopted, is likely to require a considerable investment in staff and expertise in the years ahead to handle the strategic shift.  CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos told Reuters he would recommend CalPERS explore setting up a separate vehicle for direct investments and expand the current co-investment program. Eliopoulos suggested CalPERS focus on opportunities that do not compete with its current private equity investments, such as owning companies for longer than 10 years, and investing in technology and life science companies. CalPERS has a unique opportunity to be a leader in the co-investment space, Sandra Horbach, U.S. buyouts co-head at The Carlyle Group, told the board on Monday.  CalPERS massive size would make it a formidable player and allow the fund to dictate some investment terms, Horbach said. Most U.S.-based funds shy away from such investments, while Canadian pension funds are considered leaders in the strategy. By its own account, CalPERS has developed somewhat of a negative image among private equity firms as being difficult to work with and slow to make decisions, John Cole, CalPERS investment director, told the board at Mondays meeting. A number of funds have told us that we have become too unpredictable to do business with, and many larger general partners are cutting back the amounts that they are willing to allocate to us in their new funds, Cole said.

The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Automakers would have to show self-driving cars function as intended and contain fail safe features but the Transportation Department could not condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications, the draft measure unveiled late Monday said. Last month, a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a draft plan to allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls and bar states from setting rules that could block their use. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The 30-page draft bill would also require the Transportation Department within two years to adopt rules requiring automakers to add a driver alert to check rear seating in an effort to prevent children from being left behind and consider setting performance standards for headlights. This legislation puts important benchmarks into place that will prioritize consumer safety technologies and enhance mobility opportunities for people across the country, said Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta, who chairs the panel that will vote on the measure Wednesday. Democrats had sought a number of new safety requirements during negotiations over the measure. The bill also includes automakers to take steps to ensure the cybersecurity of self-driving cars. General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal. The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trumps transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months. The issue has taken new urgency after U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data shows.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday launched the first salvo in the renegotiation of the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), saying its top priority for the talks was shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. In a much-anticipated document sent to lawmakers, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he would seek to reduce the trade imbalance by improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico under the three-nation pact.  For the first time in a U.S. trade deal, the administration also said it wants an appropriate provision to deter currency manipulation by trading partners. The move appeared aimed at future trade deals rather than specifically at Canada and Mexico, which are not considered currency manipulators. The 17-page document asserted that no country should manipulate its currency exchange rate to gain an unfair competitive advantage, an often-cited complaint about China in past years. Shortly before the release of the document, President Donald Trump lashed out against trade deals and unfair trade practices, saying he would take more legal and regulatory steps during the next six months to protect American manufacturers.  Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said the U.S. list was part of its internal process although a source familiar with the Canadian governments thinking said the document was not earth shattering. The source said officials from the United States, Mexico and Canada would meet in Washington on Tuesday to discuss logistics of the talks. No date has been announced for the NAFTA talks, but they are expected in mid-August. Mexicos economy ministry said in a statement it would work to achieve a constructive negotiation process that will allow trade and investment flows to increase and consolidates cooperation and economic integration to strengthen North American competitiveness. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior Mexican government official said the list of priorities was not as bad as I was expecting and welcomed that the United States was not pushing to impose punitive tariffs, as Trump has threatened. Trade experts have argued that shrinking the yawning U.S. trade deficit will not be achieved through trade deals but rather by boosting U.S. savings.  The first bullet point shows their preoccupation with bilateral trade deficits and thats unfortunate, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Theres not much that trade policy and trade agreements can do to change those. Thats more of a macroeconomic issue. Among the priorities, Lighthizer said the administration would seek to eliminate a trade dispute mechanism that has largely prohibited the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Canadian and Mexican firms. There was no mention of active disputes between the United States and Canada over softwood lumber and dairy products, but the document targeted a range of agricultural non-tariff barriers, including subsidies and unfair pricing structures, that are currently at the heart of those standoffs. USTR said it would seek to strengthen NAFTAs rules of origin to ensure that the pacts benefits do not go to outside countries and to incentivize the sourcing of U.S. goods. It offered no details on such incentives and did not specify how much of a products components must originate from NAFTA countries. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a group representing U.S. automakers, welcomed the decision to include objectives on the removal of regulatory barriers and the provision on currency manipulation. A spokesman for Ford Motor Co said: Foreign currency manipulation is the 21st century trade barrier, and we strongly support the inclusion of this top-tier issue in the U.S. negotiating objectives for NAFTA. The document also outlined plans to upgrade standards for labor and the environment and govern digital trade. Canada and Mexico have already agreed to upgrade these areas as part of the defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Earlier on Monday, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said NAFTA had been an unequivocal failure and should be completely renegotiated although he stopped short of calling on Trump to abandon the agreement if there was no agreement. We will do everything we can to make this a good agreement and to hold the president at his word and make sure we get a renegotiation, the head of the 12.5-million-strong union umbrella group told a conference call with reporters.  If it comes out that it is not a good deal, no deal is better than a bad deal, Trumka said. NAFTA has quadrupled trade among the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015, but the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico exceeded $63 billion last year.

It was the second time Trump certified Iranian compliance with the agreement since he took office in January, despite criticizing it during the 2016 campaign as the worst deal ever. Trump administration officials, briefing reporters on Monday on the decision, said new economic sanctions against Iran were being prepared over its ballistic missile program and for contributing to regional tensions. Under U.S. law, the State Department must notify Congress every 90 days of Irans compliance with the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Trump had faced a congressionally mandated deadline of Monday to decide. A senior administration official said Iran was judged in compliance of the 2015 nuclear deal but that Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson believed Iran remains one of the most dangerous threats to U.S. interests and to regional stability. The official ticked off a list of accusations about Iranian behavior in the region, including ballistic missile development and proliferation, support for terrorism and militancy, complicity in atrocities committed in Syria and threats to Gulf waterways. The president and the secretary of state judge that these Iranian activities severely undermine the intent of the JCPOA, which was to contribute to regional and international peace and security. As a result, the president, the secretary of state and the entire administration judge that Iran is unquestionably in default of the spirit of the JCPOA, the official said. The landmark deal struck with Iran by the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany is aimed at preventing Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon by imposing time-limited restrictions and strict international monitoring on its nuclear program. In return, Tehran won relief from punishing international economic sanctions. Iran denies seeking nuclear arms. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, concluded in December 2015, however, that Iran worked on the design of a missile-borne nuclear warhead until 2009. While lifting nuclear-linked sanctions, the United States maintains sanctions related to Irans ballistic missile program, human rights record and what Washington charges is its support for international terrorism.  The senior administration official said the Trump administration intended to employ a strategy that would address the totality of Irans malign behavior and not just focus on the Iran nuclear agreement. The administration is also looking at ways to strengthen the nuclear deal and more strictly enforce it, the official said, citing concerns that the deal over time would let Iran openly pursue industrial-scale nuclear fuel enrichment.

A group representing major technology firms including Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) urged the FCC to abandon plans to rescind the rules barring internet service providers from hindering consumer access to web content or offering paid fast lanes. The Internet Association said in its filing with the FCC that dismantling the rules will create significant uncertainty in the market and upset the careful balance that has led to the current virtuous circle of innovation in the broadband ecosystem.  The rollback would harm consumers, added the group, which also represents Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N). Major internet service providers including AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) urged the FCC, however, to reverse the rules enacted during former President Barack Obamas administration, even as they vowed not to hinder internet access. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said the Obama order had injected uncertainty into the marketplace, restricted innovation, and chilled investment. It called the prospect of future rate regulation a toxic approach if the goal is to encourage investment or the entrance of new competitors into the market. Comcast said the order represented an unfortunate, unnecessary, and profoundly unwise wrong-turn for the broadband economy and consumers more broadly. AT&T said the FCC in 2015 grossly exaggerated the need for public-utility-style regulation while ignoring its costs. White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined to weigh in on Monday, noting the FCC was an independent agency. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pais plan to withdraw the former Obama administrations order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities.  Pai has asked that if in the event the FCC reverses that order, whether it has the authority or should keep any regulations limiting internet providers ability to block, throttle or offer  fast lanes to some websites, known as paid prioritization. Pai, who argues the Obama order was unnecessary and harms jobs and investment, has not committed to retaining any rules, but said he favors an open internet. The Internet Association said there was no reliable evidence that investment by providers had fallen. Twelve state attorneys general including from Illinois and California urged the FCC not to overturn the Obama rules, saying that would expose consumers to the risk that their internet access will be interfered with and disrupted. More than 8.4 million public comments have been filed on the proposal. Pai will face questions on Wednesday on the issue at a U.S. Senate hearing. Providers say they strongly support open internet rules and will not block or throttle legal websites even without legal requirements. But some providers have said paid prioritization may make sense at times, citing self-driving cars and healthcare information. The Internet Association said it was open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission. But it said Pais proposal offers no clear alternatives.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

McConnell needs 50 yes votes for passage in a chamber the Republicans control by a 52-48 margin. While John is recovering, the Senate will continue our work on legislative items and nominations, and will defer consideration of the Better Care Act, McConnell said in a statement.  The announcement came after McCains office said he would remain in Arizona next week following a procedure to remove a 2-inch (5-cm) blood clot from above his left eye. Repealing and replacing President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law was a top campaign promise for President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress. But two Republican senators have already declared their opposition to revised legislation unveiled on Thursday. McCain has expressed concern about the healthcare bill but has not said how he would vote.   The 2008 Republican presidential nominee, McCain was resting comfortably at home in good condition after Fridays operation, his office said.

The memo, or cable, from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts overseas on Friday after a U.S. district judge in Hawaii issued a ruling late on Thursday limiting the scope of the administrations temporary ban on refugees and travelers from the six countries. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu found the government cannot bar grandparents and other relatives of United States citizens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from getting visas under the ban. Watson declined to put his ruling on hold pending appeal, meaning it went into effect immediately. The administration has asked the Supreme Court and the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the decision.  The July 14 cable updated the definition of \""close family\"" that are exempt from the temporary travel ban laid down in Trump's March 6 executive order. (The cable can be read at: reut.rs/2uC040y) The cable reversed the State Departments previous, narrow definition of close family and stated that grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, and cousins are eligible for visas. Consulates and embassies do not need to reopen any visa applications refused under the prior, narrower definition of close family members, the cable said. Between March 10 and March 17, Tillerson issued four cables, originally giving instructions on implementing the travel ban,  then rescinding much of his guidance because of court rulings and because it had been issued without approval from the White House Office of Management and Budget. In another reversal, the State Department had originally interpreted the Supreme Courts June 26 ruling to exclude fiancs, saying they do not count as a close family relationship eligible for an exemption to the travel ban. Just before the 90-day travel ban was to take effect on June 29, the State Department said fiancs would be counted as close family. These guys (consular officers) have had enough whiplash over the past six, seven months but they continue to fulfill their role, which is to process visa applications, said Stephen Pattison, a former State Department consular official now working as an immigration attorney. The people who are really getting whiplash are the people in the department who are responsible for formulating the policy, getting it approved and getting it sent out. A State Department official declined to comment on internal communications. We regularly provide updated operational instructions to our embassies and consulates around the world to ensure that our consular officers are using the most up-to-date vetting procedures as they adjudicate visas, the official said on condition of anonymity.  We are processing visa applications for nationals of the six affected countries as directed by the Executive Order and to the extent permitted by court decisions, the official said. Last month the Supreme Court partially revived the March 6 ban that had been blocked by lower courts. It said the ban could take effect, but people with a bona fide relationship to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

A unanimous three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco sided with a lower court decision in finding that rules permitting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to send national security letters under gag orders are appropriate and do not violate the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitutions free speech protections. Content distribution firm Cloudflare and phone network operator CREDO Mobile had sued the government in order to notify customers of five national security letters, or NSLs, received between 2011 and 2013. The FBIs use of NSLs has drawn increased scrutiny as new transparency laws have let companies publish some of the letters, which has shown the agency may have run afoul of rules restricting their use. Andrew Crocker, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which represented the companies in the consolidated case, said no immediate decision whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court had been made. He called the ruling disappointing. The Justice Department declined comment. Several major technology firms, including Microsoft and Twitter, have mounted a variety of legal challenges in recent years to U.S. government restrictions limiting what they can disclose, both to affected users and to the public, about the surveillance requests they receive.  National security letters are a type of government subpoena for communications data sent to service providers. They are usually issued with a gag order, meaning the target is often unaware that records are being accessed, and they do not require a warrant. Tens of thousands of NSLs are issued annually, and some gag orders last indefinitely. Writing for the panel, Judge Sandra Ikuta said the gag orders meet a compelling U.S. government interest, are sufficiently narrow and allow for appropriate judicial review. Ikuta, appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush, said recent changes to the law passed by Congress in 2015 bolstered oversight of NSL use. In June of last year the U.S. Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-backed proposal to expand the kinds of telephone and internet records the FBI could request under an NSL to include senders and recipients of emails, some information about websites a person visits and social media log-in data. The legislation failed, but lawmakers have said they intend to pursue the expansion again. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Republican leaders in the House of Representatives and the Senate are unlikely to allow the budget deficit to grow, so officials said they now hope for a corporate tax at the low end of a 20 percent to 25 percent range. Its going to be truly deficit neutral, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters. Were going for permanence. That means our reforms have to balance in the budget. Six months into Trumps presidency, Republicans who control House, Senate and the White House have yet to agree on important features of a tax code overhaul. Under Senate rules, Republicans who want to take advantage of their simple majority and pass tax legislation without Democratic support must show the new policies will not add to the federal deficit after 10 years. Cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from a current 35 percent would cost more than $2 trillion over a decade, according to independent analysts, and that total would be hard to offset when proposals to raise revenue face broad political opposition. I dont think there are $2 trillion of politically saleable offsets on the corporate side of the ledger, said Rohit Kumar, a former aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who now serves as a principal in the tax policy group at the consulting and accounting firm PwC LLP. Two House Republican proposals could help pay for such a reduction: a border adjustment tax and a proposed elimination of business deduction of debt interest payments. But these face broad opposition from industry and many Republican lawmakers. Administration officials hope the negotiators will agree on a plan by the end of July, convert it to legislation during August, unveil it in September and have Trump sign it into law well before the end of 2017. Independent analysts and lobbyists say a more likely timeline would see the release of tax legislation in October or November and a vote in early 2018.  The negotiators, Brady, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch, have yet to agree on a new corporate tax rate or how to pay for tax cuts. They also have yet to agree on which tax breaks to eliminate or whether to include a controversial border tax on imports. They want to end taxation on the foreign profits of U.S. multinational corporations and must agree on a measure to stop U.S. corporations from moving headquarters and shifting profits overseas. Lobbyists say the group is likely to consider a minimum tax on foreign corporate earnings as an alternative to the border tax.  Some Republicans in Congress acknowledge that it will be a challenge to identify tax code changes that can unite party factions now battling over healthcare and a fiscal 2018 budget that includes a legislative tool crucial for passing tax legislation without Democratic votes. The question is, can we get a framework that has a chance of passage? And the answer to that is, well see, Hatch told reporters after taking part in a principals meeting last week.

The bill, which revamps Illinois school funding system, was passed in May by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly, which has yet to send it to the Republican governor for approval. Rauner said he intends to use his veto to amend parts of the bill that address CPS pensions. That would result in a cut of nearly half of a $293 million funding boost for state aid and pensions CPS would receive in the legislation, freeing up $145 million for other school districts, according to funding data posted on Rauners website.  The point of this school reform bill is to help low-income students across the state, including those in Chicago, get the education they deserve  not to bailout CPS mismanaged teacher pension system, Rauner said in a statement. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for CPS, the nations third-largest public school system. The bill establishes an evidence-based model that ties public school funding to best practices aimed at enhancing student achievement.  The $36 billion fiscal 2018 state budget the legislature enacted earlier this month over Rauners veto prohibits the flow of state money to schools in the absence of an evidence-based funding model. That has raised the possibility some school districts largely dependent on state funding may not be able to open for classes next month. Rauner accused Democratic legislative leaders of holding on to the bill to force a crisis. John Patterson, spokesman for Senate President John Cullerton, said discussions on releasing the legislation were ongoing. Meanwhile, CPS contended Rauners intended action on the bill would exceed the veto power afforded governors under the Illinois Constitution. That is because the amendatory veto as used by Rauner would substantially change the bills intent to make teacher pension funding more equitable. The governors office disputed that assertion. Unlike all other Illinois public school districts, which participate in a state-subsidized teachers retirement system, CPS has its own pension fund, which receives minimal funding from the state. Governor Rauners stunt wont pass legal muster, and instead jeopardizes the opening for dozens of school districts around the state, CPS spokeswoman Emily Bittner said in a statement.

In a much-anticipated document sent to lawmakers ahead of talks expected next month, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the Trump administration aimed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico, the two countries in NAFTA besides the United States. The document asserts that no country should manipulate currency exchange to gain an unfair competitive advantage. The 17-page summary of negotiations for NAFTA offers a glimpse into what a Trump administration trade agenda could look like. Until now, President Donald Trumps agenda has been shaped by campaign rhetoric and tweets. While Canada and Mexico are not considered currency manipulators, the reference in the list of objectives could set a template for future trade deals such as a pending negotiation to modify a five-year-old U.S.-South Korea free trade deal. South Korea is on a U.S. Treasury monitoring list for possible signs of currency manipulation.  Among the priorities, Lighthizer said the administration would seek to eliminate a trade dispute mechanism that has largely prohibited the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Canadian and Mexican firms. It also plans to eliminate a range of non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico. These include subsidies and unfair pricing structures. USTR said it would seek to strengthen NAFTAs rules of origin to ensure that the pacts benefits do not go to outside countries and to incentivize the sourcing of U.S. goods. It offered no details on such incentives and did not specify how much of a products components must originate from within North America. The demands that the Trump administration makes in the NAFTA talks could have far-reaching implications for U.S. trade relations across the globe, with China keen to make inroads with Mexico and Canada if the United States is seen to be retreating. Lighthizer said the negotiations would begin no earlier than Aug. 16, 2017. U.S. labor union leaders and Democratic lawmakers weighed in on the issue early, reminding Trump they expect him to keep 2016 election campaign promises to protect American workers in NAFTA talks. They stopped short of demanding termination of the 1994 trade pact with Canada and Mexico. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, an umbrella organization of unions representing 12.5 million workers, said NAFTA had been an unequivocal failure and should be completely renegotiated. We will do everything we can to make this a good agreement and to hold the president at his word and make sure we get a renegotiation, he told a conference call with reporters. If it comes out that it is not a good deal, no deal is better than a bad deal, Trumka said. NAFTA has quadrupled trade among the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. Over a decade to 2010, however, the United States lost nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs. The U.S. trade balance with Mexico also swung from a small surplus in 1994 to deficits that have exceeded $60 billion for most of the past decade.

I want to make a pledge to each and every one of you: No longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs and drain our wealth, Trump said. He was speaking to a trade show - albeit one with a protectionist bent - organized by the White House to spotlight his efforts to revive the flagging manufacturing sector.  Trumps remarks came as his administration laid out its priorities for revising the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. Trump is also reviewing options to restrict steel imports. Trump did not give details about what his administration would do to protect manufacturers, but he railed against tariffs charged by other countries and unfair trade practices. That includes cracking down on the predatory online sales of foreign goods, which is absolutely killing our shoppers and our shopping centers, he said. If you look at what is going on with shopping centers and stores and jobs and stores, its been very, very tough for them. Theyve have had a very hard time, closing at numbers and records that have never been seen before, he said. It was unclear what Trump meant by stopping predatory online sales, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for more information on that subject. Trump spoke in front of a panoply of iconic American-made products: Gibson guitars, Maryland crab pots, a Delaware-made NASA space suit and Cheerwine soda. Your drivers are very good, Trump said to a representative of Ping, the Arizona-based maker of golf clubs, noting that he had golfed with British pro golfer Lee Westwood, who is a fan. He discussed sales of Sikorsky (LMT.N) helicopters - I have three of them! he said, lifted horseshoes made with Nucor Corp (NUE.N) steel, and strolled past vacuum-sealed Omaha steaks.

Supporter of the legislation have said it is a common-sense measure that protects public safety. Critics call it discriminatory. Texas, the most powerful Republican-controlled state, could lose about $5.6 billion through 2026 and businesses could find it difficult to recruit top talent if such a measure is enacted, according to the states leading employer organization. The distraction of a bathroom bill pulls us away from being competitive as a state, Jeff Moseley, chief executive of the Texas Association of Business, told a rally outside the Capitol.  On this discussion, conservatives can disagree with conservatives, said Moseley, whose group has typically aligned itself with the states Republican leaders. The legislation restricts access to places like bathrooms and locker rooms based on the gender listed on peoples birth certificates and not the gender with which they identify. A similar law in North Carolina, partially repealed in March, prompted the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that was estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. The stakes are higher in Texas, which has an economy larger than Russias. A bill similar to North Carolinas passed the Texas Senate in the regular session and was killed by pro-business Republican leaders in the House, who ran out the clock on the measure. The bathroom bills main backer, Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a social conservative who sets the state Senates legislative agenda, has said economic losses would be inconsequential.

However, eight to 10 Republican U.S. senators have serious concerns about the proposals, moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, who opposes the bill, said on Sunday.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has not yet ruled on that request.

The letter argued that a Trump administration proposal to transfer the responsibilities of the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) to other agencies would undercut U.S. diplomatic leverage in grappling with foreign crises. Among the retired officials who signed the letter were former Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, former Under Secretaries of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns and Wendy Sherman and former Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross. Whether in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kenya, Turkey or South Sudan, the Department of States efforts to address humanitarian crises must include the tightest coordination of diplomatic engagement and emergency assistance, the letter, which was also signed by 18 executives with non-governmental aid agencies, said. We are convinced that the elimination of PRMs assistance functions would have profound and negative implications for the Secretary of States capacity to influence policy issues of key concern to the United States, the letter said. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Tillerson has no preconceived notions about the outcome of the transformation process he has begun at the State Department. She added that Tillerson viewed the work of both the Bureau of Consular Affairs and the PRM as essential to the Departments mission to secure our borders and protect the American people. A memo to the Office of Management and Budget seen by Reuters proposes giving PRMs responsibility for the U.S. Refugee Admission Program, which helps resettle refugees in the United States, to the Department of Homeland Security. The memo, which was first reported by CNN on June 30 and which a former official said was prepared by the White Houses domestic policy council, proposes transferring its other responsibilities elsewhere and eliminating the bureau. The memo and the letter from the former officials appear to be part of a wider struggle over refugee and immigration policy.

Donald Trump Jr. has acknowledged that he met in New York with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya after he was told she might have damaging information about his fathers rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Well, I wonder why the Secret Service, if this was nefarious, why the Secret Service allowed these people in. The president had Secret Service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me, Jay Sekulow, a member of the presidents legal team, said on Sunday on the ABC news program This Week.  In an emailed response to questions about Sekulows comments, Secret Service spokesman Mason Brayman said the younger Trump was not under Secret Service protection at the time of the meeting, which included Trumps son and two senior campaign officials. Donald Trump, Jr. was not a protectee of the USSS in June, 2016. Thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with at that time, the statement said. According to emails released by Trump Jr. last week, he eagerly agreed to meet Veselnitskaya, who he was told was a Russian government lawyer. Veselnitskaya has said she is a private lawyer and denies having Kremlin ties. On Friday, NBC News reported that a lobbyist who was once a Soviet counter-intelligence officer participated in the meeting, which was also attended by Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the presidents former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. The meeting appears to be the most tangible evidence of a connection between Trumps election campaign and Russia, a subject that has prompted investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel. Moscow has denied any interference and the president and Trump Jr. have denied any collusion. Sekulows comments about the Secret Service drew quick criticism, including from Frances Townsend, who advised former Republican President George W. Bush on homeland security. Ok lets try to deflect blame & throw those in @SecretService who protect @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS & family under the bus, she said on Twitter. The Secret Services mission is to provide physical protection for the U.S. president. The agency also protects major presidential candidates. But its role in vetting people who meet with a U.S. president or candidates is limited to ensuring physical safety. Trump himself has said he was unaware of the meeting between his son and the Russian lawyer until a few days ago. The president was not aware about this meeting, did not participate in this meeting, Sekulow told the CBS program Face the Nation. Sekulow added that Trump was not aware of any meetings between his campaign staff and Russians. A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to hurt Clinton and help Trump. They are also investigating potential connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on one of the panels investigating the matter, the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN: The level of credibility from the senior level of this administration really is suspect. Warner said he wanted to hear from everyone who attended the June 2016 meeting. Whether we will be able to get the Russian nationals to come over and testify is an open question, (but) those people that our committee has jurisdiction over, the Americans, I sure as heck want to talk to all of them, Warner said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight to 10 Republican U.S. senators have serious concerns about Republican healthcare legislation to roll back Obamacare, moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, who opposes the bill, said on Sunday. The Senate, which is delaying its consideration of the bill while Arizona Republican Senator John McCain recuperates from surgery to remove a blood clot, will take it up as soon as all senators are available, Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican senator, said. McCains absence casts doubt on whether the Senate would be able to pass legislation to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. Collins is one of two Republican senators who have already said that they would not even vote to open debate on the latest version of the bill released on Thursday, meaning one more defection from the Republican ranks could kill it.. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin. With the Democrats solidly opposed to the legislation, the Republicans can only pass the bill if all their other members back it and if Republican Vice President Mike Pence casts his tie-breaking vote in favor. A Washington Post-ABC News poll published on Sunday showed Americans preferred Obamacare by a 2-1 margin. Approaching six months in office, Trumps overall approval rating has dropped to 36 percent from 42 percent in April.  While Collins said that she did not know if the legislation would ultimately pass, she said as many as 10 Republicans have doubts about it. There are about eight to 10 Republican senators who have serious concerns about this bill, Collins told CNNs State of the Union program, faulting the bill for its major cuts to the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor, which she said would harm rural hospitals and nursing homes. I dont know whether it will pass, but I do know this, we should not be making fundamental changes in a vital safety net program thats been on the books for 50 years - the Medicaid program - without having a single hearing to evaluate what the consequences are going to be, she added. Republican Senator Rand Paul also reiterated his opposition to the bill, which he described as terrible because it retained many of the Obamacare taxes and subsidies. The current system is terrible, Paul said on Fox News Sunday. I dont think Republicans should put their name on this. It is a bad political strategy and it will not fix the problem. The bill unwinds Obamacares Medicaid expansion over three years, from 2021 to 2024. But it goes beyond repealing Obamacare by imposing drastic cuts to Medicaid that deepen in 2025. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would cut Medicaid by nearly $800 billion by 2026, and would cut Medicaid 35 percent come 2036. McCain, who plans to stay in Arizona this week after a procedure to remove a 2-inch (5-cm) blood clot from above his left eye, has expressed concern about the healthcare bill but has not said how he would vote. We need Senator McCain in more ways than one. As soon as we have a full contingent of senators we will have that vote, Cornyn, of Texas, told NBCs Meet the Press program.

The payment to the Law Offices of Alan S. Futerfas, dated June 27, was disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday. It was described as covering legal consulting fees.  Trump Jr. admitted to meeting with a Russian lawyer in New York City during the 2016 presidential campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about his fathers rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The payment was made to Futerfas firm days before the story about the meeting broke, which caused a scramble inside the White House and Trump Tower to contain it.  The disclosures do not say who Futerfas was hired to represent. Spokesmen for Trumps re-election campaign and Futerfas did not respond to requests for comment.  Futerfas was revealed as Trump Jr.s lawyer on Monday after a New York Times report detailed meetings between the presidents eldest son and the Russian lawyer. Futerfas has not said when he was hired.      Separately, the campaign also paid more than $538,000 to Jones Day, the law firm that represented Trumps campaign during the election. The campaign also paid $89,561 for legal consulting to The Trump Corporation, which is owned by the president. The payment was dated June 30th. A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as potential connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and the president and Trump Jr. have denied any collusion. The Federal Election Commission has previously ruled that candidates and federal office holders may spend campaign funds on legal fees incurred because they were a candidate. Trump has also hired a longtime legal adviser, Marc Kasowitz, as outside counsel. His campaign finance disclosure did not list any payments to Kasowitz. The White House confirmed in a statement on Saturday that veteran Washington attorney Ty Cobb will serve as special counsel, and sources familiar with the hiring said Cobb would handle the White Houses response to the Russia-related investigations. Cobb, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, is expected to be an intermediary between the White House and Congress, as well as outside attorneys as the probes continue.  In the second quarter of 2017, Trumps re-election campaign raised about $8 million and spent $4.4 million, according to Saturdays disclosures. Much of the money raised from individuals came in the form of small dollar donations, classed as donations of less than $250. Trump and his campaign have frequently touted the number of small-dollar donors as proof of his widespread support. Trump filed for re-election the day after taking office - allowing his campaign to continue to raise and spend money while he is in office. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. officials halted screening interviews and departed the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday, two weeks short of their scheduled timetable and a day after Washington said the United States had reached its annual refugee intake cap.  U.S. (officials) were scheduled to be on Nauru until July 26 but they left on Friday, one refugee told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he did not want to jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.  In the United States, a senior member of the union that represents refugee officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a Department of Homeland Security agency, told Reuters his own trip to Nauru was not going forward as scheduled.  Jason Marks, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1924, told Reuters his trip has now been pushed back and it was unclear whether it will actually happen. The USCIS said on Saturday that the program would continue but offered no details.  We do not discuss the exact dates of USCIS circuit rides to adjudicate refugees applications. However, we are planning return trips, the agency said in a statement.  It is not uncommon for the dates of tentatively planned refugee circuit ride trips worldwide to change due to a wide variety of factors. The Australian Immigration Department declined to comment on the whereabouts of the U.S. officials or the future of a refugee swap agreement between Australia and the United States that President Donald Trump earlier this year branded a dumb deal. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Sunday the deal was progressing as expected, reiterating the government had assurances from the Trump administration. The quota will roll over again on October 1 as I said, and I expect that the United States will adhere to this agreement, as the president promised, she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  An indefinite postponement of the deal would have significant repercussions for Australias pledge to close a second detention center on Papua New Guineas Manus island on Oct 31. Only 70 refugees, less than 10 percent of the total detainees held in the camp, have completed U.S. processing. Bishop said she did not believe it was the case only 10 percent of refugees had been processed. The U.S. deal looks more and more doubtful, Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said. The U.S. deal was never the solution the Australian government pretended it to be. Former U.S. President Barack Obama agreed a deal with Australia late last year to offer refuge to up to 1,250 asylum seekers, a deal the Trump administration said it would only honor to maintain a strong relationship with Australia and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks. In exchange, Australia has pledged to take Central American refugees from a center in Costa Rica, where the United States has taken in a larger number of people in recent years. The swap is designed, in part, to help Australia close both Manus and Nauru, which are expensive to run and have been widely criticized by the United Nations and others over treatment of detainees. The U.S. government confirmed on Thursday that its refugee intake cap of 50,000 people had been reached with the new intake year not due to begin until Oct. 1. Exemptions could be made for those who have a credible claim to a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States, following a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court last month reviving elements of Trumps travel ban while it considers the legality of the order. Given the risky boat journey the refugees in Manus and Nauru undertook to reach Australia, it is unlikely many of them have strong family ties to the United States, experts said. The majority of the detainees interviewed on both Manus and Nauru by U.S. officials in April are from Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Australias hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing to camps at Manus and on Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Trumps resistance to the refugee deal had strained relations with a key Asia Pacific ally, triggering a fractious phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier this year. Trumps concession and a series of high-level visits by U.S. dignities have since help mend connections between the two countries.  Australia has already offered detainees up to $25,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, an offer few have taken up. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Carter, 92, collapsed while working on Thursday at the Winnipeg construction site for Habitat for Humanity, which promotes affordable home ownership, and was taken to St. Boniface General Hospital for medical treatment and tests. By Friday morning, Carter was smiling as he returned to the building site to help kick off the projects last day. Hours later, he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, 89, attended closing ceremonies at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Manitobas capital, receiving a rousing ovation from the crowd. Dressed in blue jeans, a T-shirt and light-weight jacket, a relaxed, fit-looking Carter climbed a short flight of steps to the stage to salute Habitats members for their contributions. I look upon all the volunteers, in a very sincere way, as human rights heroes, and I thank you for it, he said, and joked that his bringing attention to this Habitat project was completely unintentional. The former first lady told the crowd her husband received a clean bill of health after an extensive battery of tests during his brief hospitalization, including from one test designed to detect heart damage. The results showed there has never been any kind of damage at all to Jimmy Carters heart, she said. I knew he had a good heart. Thursdays health scare generated an outpouring of support for Carter, a Democrat who served in the White House from January 1977 to January 1981 and has lived longer after his term in office than any other president in U.S. history. A high point of his presidency was Carters role in brokering the 1978 Camp David Accords that ushered in peace between Israel and Egypt.  But having left office profoundly unpopular, he is widely regarded as a better former president than he was a president, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his humanitarian work. Carter disclosed in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with a form of skin cancer called melanoma that had spread to his brain and elsewhere and had been spotted during liver surgery. But months later, Carter told the Maranatha Baptist Church, where he teaches Sunday school in his home town of Plains, Georgia, that his latest brain scan showed no sign of the disease. Carter was in Canada for a project to build 150 new homes for needy families, celebrating the countrys 150th independence anniversary. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In a court filing on Friday, the administration asked the justices to overturn Thursdays decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administrations temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries.

The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - A lobbyist who was once a Soviet counter-intelligence officer participated last year in a meeting with senior aides to U.S. President Donald Trump, including his eldest son, and a Russian lawyer, NBC News reported on Friday, adding to allegations of possible connections between Moscow and the November election. NBC News, which did not identify the Russian-American lobbyist, said some U.S. officials suspected him of still having ties to Russian intelligence, something he denied to the network.  The Associated Press said the lobbyist, whom it identified as Rinat Akhmetshin, confirmed that he had attended the June 2016 meeting in New Yorks Trump Tower. A source familiar with the participants of the meeting confirmed to Reuters that Akhmetshin was in the room. The meeting appears to be the most tangible evidence of a connection between Trumps election campaign and Russia, a subject that has prompted investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel. Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former campaign adviser Paul Manafort were also at the meeting, which the presidents eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., agreed to attend because he believed he could get damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. did not mention Akhmetshins presence when he released a series of emails about the meeting earlier this week. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee,said the report about Akhmetshin if accurate, adds another deeply disturbing fact about this secret meeting. Akhmetshin was not available for comment on Friday. There was no answer at the door of his house in Washington. The White House had no immediate comment about the NBC News report of a Russian-American lobbyist at the meeting. Kushners spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Manaforts spokesman Jason Maloni said Manafort had no comment on the meeting. A former Trump campaign adviser, Michael Caputo, told reporters after he testified to the House Intelligence Committee in closed session on Friday that he had no contact with Russians and never heard of anyone in the campaign talking with Russians.    Accusations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the election and colluded with the Trump campaign have dominated the Republican presidents first months in office. Russia denies the allegations, and Trump says there was no collusion. The agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and disseminating false information online. To help the White House deal with Russia-related investigations, Trump is hiring veteran Washington lawyer Ty Cobb, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Cobbs role is separate from Trumps outside legal team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz.  Akhmetshin has been accused in federal and state courts in the United States of engaging in hacking conspiracies, although the allegations were later withdrawn, according to court records.  In 2015, lawyers for the Russian mining company International Mineral Resources claimed in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia that Akhmetshin helped organize the hack, theft and dissemination of private documents. That case was dropped. The same company filed a lawsuit against Akhmetshin in the New York Supreme Court but withdrew it last year.  U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley described Akhmetshin in a letter to the Justice Department in March as a former member of the Russian military intelligence services (GRU) who was working to overturn the 2012 Magnitsky Act of Congress, which blacklists Russians for human rights abuses. The Kremlin has often complained about the act.     Congressional records show that Akhmetshin lobbied Congress last year for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that says it is working to lift laws that prevent U.S. residents from adopting Russian children. Those laws were put in place by Moscow in response to the Magnitsky Act. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he did not know about his sons meeting last year until recently. But in a conversation with reporters later that day, Trump said: In fact, maybe (the meeting) was mentioned at some point, adding that he was not told it was about Clinton.    Trump Jr.s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, said he had talked with a person who came to the meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Trump aides.       He told me specifically he was not working for the Russian government, and in fact laughed when I asked him that question, Futerfas told NBC News. It was not immediately clear if the person he referred to was Akhmetshin. The lawyer said Trump Jr. knew nothing about the mans background at the time of the meeting. The Russian lawyer in the meeting, Veselnitskaya, has said she was not working for Russian authorities, but she told The Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that she was meeting with Russian authorities regularly. She said she shared information about a U.S.-born fund manager who lobbied for passage of the Magnitsky Act with the Russian prosecutor generals office, including with Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, a top official appointed by the Kremlin, the Journal said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump turned up the heat on Friday on fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate to pass a bill dismantling the Obamacare law, but with their retooled healthcare plan drawing fire within the party even one more defection would doom it. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has planned for a vote next week on revised legislation, unveiled on Thursday, and he has his work cut out for him in the coming days to get the 50 yes votes needed for passage. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin and cannot afford to lose more than two from within their ranks because of united Democratic opposition, but two Republican senators already have declared opposition. After all of these years of suffering thru Obamacare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised, Trump, who made gutting Obamacare one of his central campaign promises last year, wrote on Twitter from Paris, where he attended Bastille Day celebrations. The top U.S. doctors group, the American Medical Association, on Friday called the new bill inadequate and said more bipartisan collaboration is needed in the months ahead to improve the delivery and financing of healthcare. Hospital and medical advocacy groups also have criticized the bill. The revised bill does not address the key concerns of physicians and patients regarding proposed Medicaid cuts and inadequate subsidies that will result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage, AMA President Dr. David Barbe said, referring to the government insurance program for the poor and disabled. A major test for McConnells legislation expected early next week is an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which last month forecast that the prior version of the bill would have resulted in 22 million Americans losing  insurance over the next decade. A day after that CBO analysis was issued, McConnell postponed a planned vote on the legislation because of a revolt within his own party, including moderates and hard-line conservatives. While the bills prospects may look precarious, the same could have been said of healthcare legislation that ultimately was passed by the House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called off a vote in March in the face of a rebellion involving the disparate factions of the party but managed to coax enough lawmakers to back it and engineered narrow approval on May 4. Vice President Mike Pence sought to shore up support among the nations governors at a meeting in Rhode Island, but a key Republican governor, Ohios John Kasich, came out strongly against the revised bill, saying its Medicaid cuts were too deep and it does too little to stabilize the insurance market. Kasichs opposition could put pressure on Rob Portman, a  Republican senator from Ohio, who has not yet taken a position on the bill. If the current Senate legislation collapses, some lawmakers have raised the possibility of seeking bipartisan legislation to fix parts of Obamacare but leaving intact the structure of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. There are changes that need to be made to the law, Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told MSNBC, citing a bipartisan appetite to tackle this issue. Moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul already oppose the revised Senate bill. Other Republican senators have either expressed concern or remained noncommittal, including Portman, Mike Lee, Shelley Moore Capito, John McCain, Dean Heller, John Hoeven, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, Ben Sasse, Cory Gardner, Todd Young and Thom Tillis. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy floated an alternative plan. The new version was crafted to satisfy the Republican Partys various elements, including moderates worried about Americans who would be left without medical coverage and hard-line conservatives who demand less government regulation of health insurance. A provision championed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz and aimed at attracting conservatives would let insurers sell cheap, bare-bones insurance policies that would not have to cover broad benefits mandated under Obamacare. But two major health insurance groups, Americas Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, called on McConnell to drop the Cruz proposal, saying it would undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions, raise insurance premiums and destabilize the individual insurance market. The bill retained certain Obamacare taxes on the wealthy that the earlier version would have eliminated, a step moderates could embrace. But it kept the core of the earlier bill, including ending the expansion of Medicaid that was instrumental in enabling Obamacare to expand coverage to 20 million people, and restructuring that social safety-net program. John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said in order to complete work on the bill by the end of next week, Senate leaders would have to try to formally begin debate on Tuesday or Wednesday, a move that requires a majority vote.

In the court filing, the Justice Department said the judges ruling empties the (Supreme) Courts decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just close family members but virtually all family members. The conservative-leaning Supreme Court is not currently in session but the justices can handle emergency requests. The administrations application could be directed either to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. If the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request. The truth here is that the governments interpretation of the Supreme Courts stay order defies common sense, said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union involved in challenging the ban. Thats what the district court correctly found and the attorney generals misleading attacks on its decision cant change that fact. In his decision, Watson harshly criticized the governments definition of close family relations as the antithesis of common sense. Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. In the court filing, the Justice Department said Watsons ruling on refugees would make the Supreme Courts decision on that part of the executive order effectively meaningless. The ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.  The Supreme Courts decision last month revived parts of Trumps March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": "" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With talks to renegotiate the NAFTA trade pact just weeks away, U.S. farm groups and lawmakers from rural states are intensifying lobbying of President Donald Trumps administration with one central message: leave farming out of it.  Trump blames the North American Free Trade Agreement - the worst trade deal ever in his words - for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in Americas favor.  But for U.S. farmers the 23-year old pact secures access to stable, lucrative markets in Mexico and Canada that now account for over a quarter of U.S. farm exports.  Now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for U.S. manufacturers.  Perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced, said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Denver, Colorado.  Another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open-ended trade talks could drive Mexico to alternative suppliers of grains, dairy products, beef and pork.  Mexico became even more crucial after Trumps pullout from a vast Pacific Rim trade pact negotiated under Barack Obama dashed farmers hopes of free access to more markets.  Next week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to outline the administrations goals for the NAFTA talks to Congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make Lighthizers list.  Operating under the umbrella of the U.S. Food and Agriculture Dialogue for Trade, more than 130 commodity groups and agribusiness giants since Trumps inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters, public comments to USTR and face-to-face meetings with top officials who have Trumps ear.  Our first ask is to do no harm, said Cassandra Kuball, the head of the umbrella group.  Lobbyists said that Lighthizer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been receptive, but the wild card is how Trump ultimately will come down on the talks. They also wonder what concessions Mexico will seek from Washington in the talks due to start in mid-August.  Among the groups involved are the American Soybean Association, Corn Refiners Association and National Grain and Feed Association and firms such as Land OLakes, Inc., Tyson Foods(TSN.N), Inc., Louis Dreyfus Company North America, Archer Daniels Midland Co. and others.  For example, U.S. cotton producers, marketers and shippers in mid-June warned the Trump administration that any weakening of NAFTA would threaten the health of the U.S. industry and the jobs of the 125,000 Americans employed by it.  Annual U.S. farm exports to Mexico have grown from about $4 billion in 1994, when NAFTA began, to an estimated $18.5 billion this year. With Canada included, that number is forecast to reach $40 billion, quadrupling under NAFTA.  Republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed Trump in the 2016 election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices.  Pat Roberts, Republican senator from Kansas, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he used an unexpected invitation for a private White House meeting with Trump to plug in agricultures cause in NAFTA and beyond.  He (Trump) wanted to know what was happening in farmland, Roberts said. I told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong, robust, predictable trade policy, its going to make life much more difficult in farm country, Roberts said of the 45-minute meeting in late June.  In May, 18 Republican senators, mainly from pro-Trump farming states, wrote the administration about the tremendous growth in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada as a result of NAFTA.  Efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences, they warned.  Trumps pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with Mexico also vex farm state lawmakers.  What I really need is a good, solid immigration system, South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said. Given his states low unemployment rate of just around 2.8 percent, farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor, he said.  Agriculture Secretary Perdue got a taste of farmers angst when met cattle ranchers in Nebraska on May 20. The event was held shortly after Washington agreed with China to resume beef exports, but some 60 ranchers who gathered at U.S. Senator Deb Fischers Sunny Slope Ranch quickly turned to NAFTA.  If the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in Mexico and Canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out, said Pete McClymont, executive vice president of Nebraska Cattlemen, summarizing the discussion.  While lobbying in Washington, some Republican lawmakers have also met with Mexicos ambassador and U.S. farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by Trumps America First mantra.  The common comment is: why are you here? The problem is not with us. The problem is in Washington. Why are you talking to us? said Tom Sleight, president and CEO of the U.S. Grains Council. The new normal is that feed buyers, millers, grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources, he said.  It will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was. Meantime, some are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.  Daryl Haack, a corn and soybean farmer from Primghar in northwest Iowa, like others fears retaliation from either Canada or Mexico, but is optimistic it will not come to that.  I think President Trump is a negotiator, he said. I think he runs bluffs. A lot of negotiators will do that.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership President Donald Trump quit as part of his pledge to protect American workers from bad trade deals may still serve to shape a revised NAFTA trade pact, U.S. officials and trade experts say. Trump threatened to ditch the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement too, but eventually decided to renegotiate the pact in talks with Mexico and Canada due to begin in mid-August. On Monday U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will offer first insights into the administrations strategy when he presents Congress its objectives for the NAFTA negotiations. Several U.S. administration  officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Lighthizer will outline plans for updating NAFTA rather than seek a major overhaul of the agreement. While the administration has said it hopes to complete NAFTA negotiations by the end of the year, the strategy will not set a timeline, they say. Thus far, the Trump administration offered few specifics, other than expressing its desire to modernize the pact to account for digital trade that was in its infancy in the early 1990s and to tackle festering issues on labor, environment, intellectual property rights and state-owned enterprises.    Since those areas have already been addressed in the TPP negotiated under Democratic President Barack Obama and agreed by Canada and Mexico, the pact provides a useful template that could help speed up the NAFTA negotiations, U.S. officials say. They warn, however, that no final decision has been made on using TPP language. TPP requires members, for example, to allow independent unions, set working hours and safety standards and deter forced labor and has set higher environment standards than any other previous U.S. trade deal.  The pact also set a 70-year copyright term and eight years of patent protection for costly biologic drugs, significantly less than the 12 years applied in the United States. Lawmakers from the U.S. industrial heartland particularly want to see enforceable labor standards that would lift Mexicos chronically low wages, which they blame for U.S. factories migrating south of the border. A lot of the negotiators were just in the room a few years ago doing this stuff. They know where the bodies are buried, said one business executive with knowledge of NAFTA deliberations. Some lawmakers want a more ambitious deal than TPP. Donald Trump promised to get a better deal than TPP, and Americans are going to be deeply disappointed if he doesnt follow through on NAFTA negotiations, said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and an influential voice on trade matters. In particular, Canada and Mexico should be able to agree to U.S. proposals on digital trade and environment that got watered down in the final TPP text, Wyden told Reuters. This is a once-in-a-generation chance to rewrite NAFTA. Trump cant squander this opportunity. The demands the Trump administration makes in the talks  could have far-reaching implications for U.S. trade relations across the globe, with China keen to make inroads with Mexico and Canada if the United States is seen to be pulling back. One area to watch will be the so-called rules of origin that determine how much regional content a product must have to be exempt from tariffs. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has frequently said NAFTA needed to tighten those rules to prevent China from using the trade bloc as a tariff-free back door to the U.S. market. Analysts say any U.S. demands for more specifically U.S. rather than broadly North American content for autos or other manufactured goods would be a tough sell, though Mexico has indicated it could be ready for some concessions to strengthen the regions defenses against Asian competition. Christopher Padilla, former U.S. under secretary for international trade at the U.S. Commerce Department now at IBM, believes that merely tweaking the rules of origin would be enough to satisfy Trumps political agenda, but it still may require companies to alter their supply chains. The clarion call from U.S. business groups in the lead-up to the talks is do no harm. U.S. and international companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars building integrated North American supply networks and Trump rang alarm bells in corporate boardrooms in April when he threatened to terminate the pact. Trump backed off after a furious lobbying effort, but analysts say he may still choose a hard exit if the talks fail to achieve his goal of shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico. NAFTA has quadrupled trade between the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. Over a decade through to 2010, however, the United States lost nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs, a figure that resonates with Trump. U.S. trade balance with Mexico also swung from a small surplus in 1994 to deficits that have exceeded $60 billion for most of the past decade. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2oYClp2) Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the administration would risk derailing the talks if it focused on reducing the trade imbalance with Mexico, like it has threatened to do. Were talking about an imbalance of $60 billion and there is no way under the sun that Mexico can eliminate that or even make a big dent in that without doing some really massive uneconomic distortion of trade flows.

(Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday warned U.S. governors against politically tempting shortcuts as the two countries and Mexico prepare to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). U.S. President Donald Trump has described the 1994 pact as the worst trade deal ever and vowed to change it to the advantage of the United States in talks due to begin later this summer. Trumps stance on the accord has led Trudeaus government to reach out aggressively to U.S. leaders, including one-on-one meetings on Friday with Vice President Mike Pence and the governors of Kentucky, Wisconsin, Rhode Island and Iowa. The meetings are intended to emphasize the importance of the two countries trading relationship. Sometimes getting it right means refusing to take the politically tempting shortcuts, Trudeau told a meeting of the U.S. National Governors Association in Providence, Rhode Island. More trade barriers, more local-content provisions, more preferential access for homegrown players in government procurement, for example, does not help working families over the long term, or even the mid-term. Such policies kill growth. He warned that protectionist postures run the risk of becoming a cycle of tit-for-tat, a race to the bottom, where all sides lose. Pence, who also spoke to the Governors Association, alluded only briefly to the NAFTA talks in his remarks, which focused on this weeks healthcare reform bill proposed by Senate Republicans. We will modernize NAFTA for the 21st century so it is a win-win-win for all our trade partners in North America, Pence, the former governor of Indiana, told the group. We are looking forward to bringing NAFTA into the future in a way that will equally benefit both our countries. In a nod to the concerns about competition with foreign labor that influenced Trumps populist trade stance, Trudeau said that state and national governments needed to do more to ensure that the benefits of trade were felt by a wider slice of the population. We think right upfront about how to make sure that benefits that will come from trade inevitably accrue to more of the population, he said. Trudeau also told reporters on Friday that Trump told him that he did not expect to subject Canadian steel and aluminum to face tariffs on national security grounds. I am optimistic that this important trade, which leads to millions of good jobs on both sides of the border, will continue, Trudeau said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Cobb has been a long-time partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells in Washington and represented people in government during the 1990s Clinton administration. Cobb did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for the law firm declined to comment.  We have no announcement at this time, a White House spokeswoman said. A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential connections between Russian officials and the  campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump. Moscow has denied any interference and the President has denied any collusion. The intelligence agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and spreading false information. Cobb is expected to be an intermediary between the White House and Congress, as well as outside attorneys. Trump met with Cobb about the role last month, Reuters exclusively reported on July 3. Bloomberg News wrote about his hiring earlier on Friday. Cobbs role is separate from Trumps outside legal team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz. Constitutional lawyer and evangelical radio talk show host Jay Sekulow, Washington lawyer John Dowd, and Michael Bowe, a partner at Kasowitzs firm, are all on that team. Cobb, who sports a handlebar mustache, is a distant relative of the famous early 20th century baseball player of the same name.   Washington lawyer Robert Bennett, also of Hogan Lovells, who represented President Bill Clinton in the sexual harassment case filed by Paula Jones, said Cobb knew how to handle a crisis where politics and the law intersected. Given recent developments, they really need him and need to listen to him, said Bennett. In the 1990s, Cobb, 66,represented former Democratic National Committee fundraiser John Huang and former White House aide David Watkins, who was probed over the Clinton White House travel office.  In 2006, Cobb also represented former CIA official Mary McCarthy, who was fired after she was accused of providing classified information to reporters. No charges were brought against McCarthy.  Cobb graduated from Harvard University and earned his law degree at Georgetown. In the 1980s, he was a federal prosecutor in Baltimore, where he led a regional drug and organized crime task force.

The Russia sanctions bill passed the Senate on June 15 by 98-2, but it has not come up for a vote in the House. The chambers Republican leaders initially said there was a technical problem with how the bill was written, but after the Senate altered the bill to fix it, the measure still did not move. On Friday, Republicans suggested reworking the legislation to add new sanctions on North Korea. The Russia sanctions measure passed by the Senate is part of a broader bill that also includes new sanctions on Iran. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he wanted the North Korea sanctions added to the bill. It would be a very strong statement for all of America to get that sanction bill completed and done, and to the presidents desk, the Republican lawmaker said in the House as it wrapped up its activity for the week.  Democrats rejected the suggestion as another tactic by Republicans supporting White House objections to the bill.  This isnt a serious proposal. Its the latest delay tactic, said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The House passed a new package of sanctions on North Korea in May by 419-1, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Republican, said on Thursday his committee would be taking it up soon.  On Friday, Corker said he would be more than glad to consider adding North Korea to the legislation if the House chose to do so. Engel said there was no point in passing North Korea legislation again. The Trump administration objects to a provision in the Russia bill that sets up a process for Congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on Moscow. Seeking a greater influence in foreign policy, Congress has included provisions in a few recent major bills, starting with Corkers 2015 legislation forcing congressional review of President Barack Obamas nuclear deal with Iran. Lawmakers and aides have been negotiating for weeks to try to craft a compromise that would allow the Russia-Iran bill to move forward. On Thursday, they said they thought it could advance soon but on Friday said the North Korea issue made that less likely. [L1N1K42BV] ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In a court filing, the administration asked the justices to overturn Thursdays decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administrations temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The latest round in the fight over Trumps March 6 executive order, which he says is needed for national security reasons, came after the Supreme Court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans, which were blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court said then that the ban could take effect, but that people with a bona fide relationship to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred.  The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted. He ruled for the state late on Thursday. In the court filing, the Justice Department said the judges ruling empties the (Supreme) Courts decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just close family members but virtually all family members. The conservative-leaning Supreme Court is not currently in session but the justices can handle emergency requests. The administrations application could be directed either to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. If the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request. The truth here is that the governments interpretation of the Supreme Courts stay order defies common sense, said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union involved in challenging the ban. Thats what the district court correctly found and the attorney generals misleading attacks on its decision cant change that fact. In his decision, Watson harshly criticized the governments definition of close family relations as the antithesis of common sense. Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. In the court filing, the Justice Department said Watsons ruling on refugees would make the Supreme Courts decision on that part of the executive order effectively meaningless. The ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.  The Supreme Courts decision last month revived parts of Trumps March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the U.S. Constitution. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Eugene Kaspersky, the CEO of the Russian cybersecurity software firm that bears his name, had a big American dream.  He wanted his company to go beyond selling anti-virus software to consumers and small businesses and become a major vendor to the U.S. government - one of the worlds biggest buyers of cybersecurity tools.  Kaspersky set up a U.S. subsidiary, KGSS, in Arlington, Virginia that would be focused on winning that business. He sponsored flashy conferences with high-profile speakers -including Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trumps national security adviser - sought to join U.S. trade groups and even underwrote programming on National Public Radio.  All of this was done to burnish Kasperskys image and help it become an accepted vendor for the U.S. government despite its Russian roots, according to people familiar with the strategy.  But Eugene Kaspersky was never able to overcome lingering suspicions among U.S. intelligence officials that he and his company were, or could become, pawns of Russia's spy agencies. Kaspersky \""has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,\"" the company said.  Kasperskys American ambitions were further eroded by the sharp deterioration in U.S.-Russia relations following Russias invasion of Crimea in 2014, and later when U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had hacked the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Testifying before the U.S. Congress in May,U.S. intelligence chiefs for the first time publicly expressed doubt that Kaspersky products could be trusted.  FBI agents last month interviewed Kaspersky employees, asking whether they reported to Russia-based executives and how much data from American customers could be seen by Russian employees, according to three current and former employees. The FBI declined to comment on Thursday.  On Tuesday, the U.S. General Services Administration, the government agency that manages the federal bureaucracy, removed Kaspersky from a list of approved vendors, saying GSAs mission was to ensure the security of U.S. government systems.  There is also a bill before Congress that would explicitly bar the Defense Department from using any Kaspersky products.  Kaspersky says his company is being targeted for political reasons.  These reckless actions negatively impact global cybersecurity by limiting competition, slowing down technology innovations and ruining the industry and law enforcement agency cooperation required to catch the bad guys, he said in a statement to Reuters.  The Arlington offices of KGSS were empty when a Reuters reporter visited them on Thursday. A Kaspersky spokeswoman said most of the staff, which number less than 10, often work from home.  The U.S. clampdown comes even though officials have offered no public evidence to suggest the company has done anything untoward or that the Russian government is using its software to launch cyber attacks.  Two former employees and a person briefed on the FBI case told Reuters that Kaspersky software has at times inappropriately inspected and removed files from users machines in its hunt for alleged cyber criminals, even when those files were not corrupted by viruses.  Kaspersky Lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations, the Kaspersky spokeswoman said in response in an email.  It is extremely rare for a company to be singled out for federal buying restrictions in the absence of clear evidence of wrongdoing.  This sets a really dangerous precedent where other nations could make similar, unsubstantiated claims against U.S. vendors, said Robert M. Lee, a former cyberwarfare operative for U.S. intelligence and now CEO of cybersecurity startup Dragos.  The Russian government has denounced the Kaspersky crackdown and said it does not rule out retaliatory measures. Officials at U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Russia say they fear they could become targets.  Federal contracting databases reviewed by Reuters show only a few hundred thousand dollars in purchases from Kaspersky, and an employee confirmed the companys federal government revenue was miniscule.  But Kaspersky also sells to federal contractors and third-party software companies that incorporate its technology in their products, so its technology may be more widely used in government than it appears from the contracting databases, U.S. officials say.  Founded in 1997, Kaspersky grew rapidly through the 2000s to become one of the world's leading anti-virus software companies. (Kaspersky's global reach: tmsnrt.rs/2uWTQoV)  But the company was dogged from the start by suspicions about its ties to Russias Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the KGB. Eugene Kaspersky attended a KGB school and the company has acknowledged doing work for the FSB.  As the company grew, Kaspersky was determined to overcome those fears.  We have to be more American than Americans, Kaspersky told Reuters in 2013, when a U.S. goodwill offensive began.  A cornerstone of the effort was a series of KGSS-hosted conferences in Washington where prominent U.S. officials including Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency director, former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden and House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul discussed cybersecurity issues.  The company privately courted U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials by sending experts to brief them on nation-state hacking campaigns uncovered by the firm, according to people present at those meetings.  They came to us and said, We want to change our image, we know people dont trust us, said one former senior Obama administration official who took part in some of those meetings.  But the suspicions never subsided. When the company sought to join one Washington-based technology trade organization, it was politely told it couldnt happen, according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter.  The source said industry group officials had an inside joke: Kaspersky (membership) is like having the Kremlin join.  Not coincidentally, Kasperskys government sales effort never gained traction. In an email to Reuters, the company noted complexities associated with doing business with North Americas government sector.  Privately held Kaspersky said its U.S. revenue, most of which comes from selling anti-virus software to consumers and small businesses, slipped from $164 million in 2014 to about $156 million in 2016.  Some U.S. national security experts say Kaspersky is being treated unfairly. Lee said he has long been bothered by the public shaming of Kaspersky by people who make allegations without presenting evidence.  The U.S. government has the right to choose not to use Kaspersky products for any reason, he said, but the way they are doing it is wrong.  I dont believe in geographic restrictions that say, Because Kaspersky is a Russian-based company, therefore it is bad, said former White House cybersecurity policy coordinator Michael Daniel. You would want your decision to be based on actual corporate bad behavior.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans pushing to overhaul Obamacare largely ignored key players in the debate over insuring the poor: the health insurers and hospitals charged with carrying out the law if it gets approved. Instead, conservative groups such as Heritage Action for America won the ears of Senate Republicans when it came to changing the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled. The snub is fueling health industry opposition to the new plans for Medicaid, and threatens to further frustrate the months-long effort to dismantle Obamacare.  The latest version of the Senate bill, released on Thursday, left the Medicaid overhaul largely unchanged from the radical makeover in the bill from the U.S. House of Representatives. A nonpartisan government agency has estimated an earlier version of the bill would trim nearly $800 billion in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years. While insurers successfully influenced the legislation when it comes to individual insurance markets, the fact that they and hospital groups largely struck out on Medicaid is important because the new provisions shift more costs back to the states and hospitals.  These groups, along with insurers, will be charged with enforcing the new law, so Republicans need their buy-in, health policy experts say.  A health policy means nothing if it cant be implemented and doesnt work, said Andy Slavitt, former administrator under President Barack Obama of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversaw Obamacare. The Republican bill ends Obamacares Medicaid expansion and slashes traditional Medicaid funding, with cuts that deepen beginning in 2025. The U.S. House of Representatives passed its own version of the legislation in May.  A lot of conservatives, Heritage Action included, desperately wanted to hold the line to make sure the Medicaid portion wasnt watered down in the Senate, said Dan Holler, vice president of Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group. It was something we made known to folks up in the Senate.  When Democrats and the White House enacted Obamacare seven years ago, support from healthcare companies helped propel the legislation through Congress. The administration actively courted the health industry, lobbyists and former Obama administration officials said, viewing their support as critical to winning votes. While health insurer and hospital lobbyists said in recent weeks that they have been able to regularly meet with Republican lawmakers, they said their input on the bills Medicaid changes was largely ignored. A representative for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not immediately available for comment. In 2017, the top hospital, doctor and insurer trade groups reported spending a total of more than $13 million on lobbying the federal government through the first quarter of 2017, according to a congressional lobbying database.  One hospital industry lobbyist said there has been no attempt by Republican leadership to have a serious discussion with industry lobbyists or leaders about how to change the bill to win their support.  That has not been the case with the portion of the bill that addresses the individual insurance market. Insurers, including some of the biggest providers of Obamacare individual plans, Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Molina Healthcare (MOH.N), have been asking for changes to specific policies.  For instance, the Senate bill repeals the penalty associated with the individual mandate, the requirement that all people purchase insurance or pay a government fee. In its place, insurers received one of their biggest demands: a provision in the bill that provides incentives for Americans to have continuous insurance coverage and allows insurers to charge them more if they let their policies lapse.  If that back and forth between industry and lawmakers on the individual insurance side ends up winning new conservative votes, lawmakers may be ready to turn the next round of healthcare bill negotiations to Medicaid, said Elizabeth Carpenter, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consultant group to hospitals and insurers The rubber meets the road on the Medicaid provision, Carpenter said.

The vote was 344-81 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets military policy and authorizes up to $696 billion in spending for the Department of Defense. Underscoring bipartisan support for higher defense spending in Congress, 117 Democrats joined 227 Republicans in backing the measure. Only eight Republicans and 73 Democrats voted no. But the measure faces more hurdles before it can become law, notably because it would increase military spending beyond last years $619 billion bill, defying sequestration caps on government spending set in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Trump wants to pay for a military spending increase by slashing nondefense spending. His fellow Republicans control majorities in both the House and Senate, but they will need support from Senate Democrats, who want to increase military spending, for Trumps plans to go into effect. The House NDAA also increases spending on missile defense by 25 percent, adds thousands more active-duty troops to the Army, provides five new ships for the Navy and provides a 2.4 percent salary increase for U.S. troops, their largest pay raise in eight years. And it creates a new Space Corps military service, pushed by lawmakers worried about China and Russias activities in space, but opposed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The Senate will vote on its version of the NDAA later this year, and the two versions must be reconciled before the measure can be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. Trump has not threatened to veto the bill, but his administration listed several problems with it, including opposition to the proposed Space Corps and its failure to authorize new base realignments and closures. During debate on amendments to the NDAA this week, the House rejected a Republican-sponsored amendment that would have ended the Pentagons policy of providing gender-reassignment surgery and other therapy for active-duty transgender service members. Lawmakers also defeated a proposed Republican amendment that would have prevented the Pentagon from implementing climate-change and green energy policies.

With talks due to start next month between the United States, Mexico and Canada, Mexican officials have stressed the need to craft a new deal that would strengthen the region against competitors, particularly in Asia. Trump has threatened to ditch NAFTA if he cannot rework it to the benefit of the United States, arguing it has fueled a trade deficit with Mexico and cost thousands of U.S. jobs. Mexican officials say a revamped NAFTA must further integrate the region and are awaiting U.S. negotiating objectives, due to be published on or around Sunday. They point to sectors like autos, where U.S. inputs make up some 40 percent of the value of products imported into the United States from Mexico, while Chinese exports contain only 4 percent, according to the U.S. Center for Automotive Research.  If we integrate further and make Mexico more competitive versus China ... even if our exports rise, U.S. jobs will rise, because when we export (to the United States), theyre exporting too (via U.S. content), said Jaime Serra, a former trade minister who led the initial NAFTA negotiations for Mexico. However, mindful that Trump needs to be able to claim a more obvious win from the shake-up, they are also looking at rules governing how much of a product is made in the region. NAFTA rules of origin stipulate that to qualify for tariff-free access, some products need to be sourced to a certain degree regionally. Cars, a recurring point of attack for Trump, must meet a threshold of 62.5 percent. Because raising that threshold would not automatically benefit U.S. workers - firms could just expand capacity in Mexico - Trumps trade team want to have some national content rules within the regional framework, Mexican officials say. Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexicos CCE business lobby, which is coordinating the private sectors role in the renegotiation, said they may explore domestic content rules on certain products. Itll be a tricky issue, and well have to see case by case, he said. Kalach declined to say what goods might be eligible. In May, he said a revamped NAFTA might source more work for future product lines from the region. The Mexican electronics industry wants to increase regional production of some components to reduce reliance on Asia, said Cesar Castro, vice president of electronics industry group Canieti. About 70 percent of content in electronic goods exported by Mexico to the United States is sourced from Asia, he said, highlighting products that would have a big slice of Chinese content even if manufactured by U.S. companies. To boost North American output, Canieti is considering a proposal that could see regional content in certain products raised from 5 percent to 50 percent over 10 years, Castro said. If Mexicos arguments fall flat, however, and Trump threatens to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican-made goods, the sizeable U.S. surplus in services with Mexico could end up as a bargaining chip. That could complement Mexican efforts to target the big U.S. agricultural surplus with Mexico, which the Trump administration is already feeling pressure to preserve. Mexico could insist companies such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) build servers in the country, said a former Mexican official familiar with discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity. As the U.S.s second biggest market, its clear we can hit back, said Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister. (Services are worth) more and more every day.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps effort to reshape influential U.S. courts by stocking them with conservative judges faces at least one significant impediment: some of the courts best placed to thwart his agenda have liberal majorities that are likely to stay in place in the short-term. Those courts, including an influential Washington appeals court and two appellate courts that ruled against Trump in cases involving his travel ban, all had an influx of fresh liberal blood under President Barack Obama.  Trump is not going to be able to make any significant dents into the Democrats control of those three (appellate) circuits, said Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. After eight years in office, Obama was able to make enough appointments to leave a strong liberal imprint on the federal courts. When he left the White House in January, nine of the 13 federal appeals courts had a majority of Democratic-appointed judges. The federal appeals courts, divided into 11 geographic regions plus two based in the District of Columbia, often have the final say in major legal disputes. The conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court, which now includes Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch, can overrule appeals court decisions, but hears only a small number of cases, which leaves lower court rulings in place most of the time.  The appeals courts can shape the interpretation of such issues as abortion, religious freedom, voting rights and race.  Appellate court judges serve lifetime terms, and so far Trumps opportunities to appoint new ones have been mostly limited to courts that already lean conservative. Among the courts conservatives would most like to shift are the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, both of which ruled against Trump in cases challenging the Republican presidents executive orders temporarily banning travel to the United States by people from six predominantly Muslim countries. The Supreme Court partially revived the ban last month. The ideological balance of those courts has provided some hope to Trumps legal opponents, including Democratic state attorneys general, who have already sued the administration over the travel ban and other issues. Strategic attorneys general can likely chart a path through Democratic-leaning courts - making it harder on the Trump administration to pursue its agenda through executive action, said Sarah Binder, a scholar the nonpartisan Brookings Institution think tank. Thanks in part to efforts by the Republican-led Senate in the final two years of Obamas presidency to block the Democratic presidents judicial appointments, Trump has 21 appeals court slots to fill, according to the federal judiciarys administrative office. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved two of Trumps appeals court nominees on Thursday. In some of the key courts, new vacancies in the near term are more likely to be in slots currently filled by Republican appointees, so Trumps early appointments will be unlikely to change the court balance. A case in point is the announcement this week by Republican appointee Janice Rogers Brown on the Washington appeals court that she plans to step down.  In Washington, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is often called the second-highest court in the land, in part because it hears a large number of cases concerning major government regulations on issues such as the environment and labor.  Democratic appointees hold a 7-4 advantage among the 11 active judges.  Of the Democratic appointees, Judge David Tatel is 75 and Judge Judith Rogers is 77. The next oldest is Merrick Garland at 64. Obama made four appointments to the court, the oldest of whom is 56. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is also stacked against Trump: out of 25 full-time judges, Democratic presidents appointed 18 and Republican presidents seven. The oldest Democratic appointee, liberal icon Stephen Reinhardt, is 86 years old. The 10 9th Circuit judges appointed by President Bill Clinton who still work full-time range in age from 63 to 72, and none have given any indication they plan to reduce their caseloads.  The court currently has four vacancies, but three of those seats are based in states - California, Oregon and Hawaii - with two Democratic senators who are likely to resist attempts to place extreme conservatives on the court. Those dynamics make it extremely unlikely that Trump will be able to significantly alter the 9th Circuits orientation, Hellman said.  The Virginia-based 4th Circuit has a 10-5 majority of Democratic appointees and no current vacancies. The oldest Democratic appointee is Judge Robert King, who is 77. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, who has advised the White House on judicial nominations, is optimistic about Trumps long-term prospects. It takes time to recalibrate the federal courts, he said.    In the meantime, Leo said, every slot matters, since conservative judges on liberal-majority courts can offer critical dissents in important cases and serve a kind of signaling function to the Supreme Court.

Bush and Bill Clinton told a forum in Dallas on Thursday that they were able to forge mutual bonds of respect and friendship because the other had been gracious in victory and respectful of presidential power. The two did not mention President Donald Trump once during a nearly hour-long discussion where they traded quips and insights. But they offered indirect references that many in the crowd of about 300 people at the George W. Bush Presidential Library took to be references to the current president. He (Clinton) was humble in victory, which is very important in dealing with other people, Bush said at the event to mark a graduation at the Presidential Leadership Scholars program, a partnership among the Bush, Clinton, Lyndon Johnson and George H.W.

You want to be able to say things were better off when I quit, kids had a better future, things were coming together. You dont want to say, God, look at all the people I beat. Current President Trump has come under criticism from Democrats who have said he fires off excessive and unwarranted criticism against his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama and the person he beat in the election, Democrat Hillary Clinton.

The decisions you make have a monumental effect on people, Bush said, adding humility is a key quality for any president. Presidency is often defined by the unexpected. It makes the job interesting, he said. Clinton said: If you dont deal with the incoming fire, it will undermine your ability to do anything else. If all you deal with is incoming fire, you cant keep the promises you made when you were running.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu also opens the door for more refugees and deals Trump a fresh courtroom defeat in a long back-and-forth over an executive order that has gone all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. The state of Hawaii had asked Watson to narrowly interpret a Supreme Court ruling that revived parts of Trumps March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The Supreme Court last month said the ban could take effect, but that anyone from the six countries with a bona fide relationship to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. The Trump administration then interpreted that opinion to allow spouses, parents, children, fiancs and siblings into the country, but barred grandparents and other family members, in a measure Trump called necessary to prevent attacks.  Watson harshly criticized the governments definition of close family relations as the antithesis of common sense in a  ruling that changes the way the ban can now be implemented. Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents. Indeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members, he wrote. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Trumps order is a pretext for illegal discrimination, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said in a statement. Family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough, Chin said. Chin had asked Watson for an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. Hawaii and refugee groups also had argued that resettlement agencies have a bona fide relationship with the refugees they help, sometimes over the course of years. The Justice Department said its rules were properly grounded in immigration law. Watson said the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the U.S. because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation.  Bona fide does not get any more bona fide than that, Watson said.  Melanie Nezer, vice president of global refugee advocacy group HIAS, said the ruling should mean that refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of  50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.  We are thrilled that thousands of people will be reunited with their family members, said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. More than 24,000 additional refugees should be allowed to travel to the U.S. under Watsons order, she estimated.  Watson did not grant everything the state of Hawaii sought, however. He rejected a request to categorically exempt all Iraqis refugee applicants who believe they are at risk due to their work for the U.S. government since March, 2003, as interpreters and translators, for instance. Watson also refused a blanket exemption for those eligible to apply to a refugee program aimed at protecting certain children at risk in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued than in January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of his order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department will require all nations to provide extensive data to help it vet visa applicants and determine whether a traveler poses a terrorist threat, according to a cable obtained by Reuters.  Countries that fail to comply with the new protocols or take steps to do so within 50 days could face travel sanctions.  The cable, sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday,  is a summary of a worldwide review of vetting procedures that was required under U.S. President Donald Trumps revised March 6 executive order that temporarily banned U.S. travel by most citizens from six predominantly Muslim countries. The memo lays out a series of standards the United States will require of other countries, including that they issue, or have active plans to issue, electronic passports and regularly report lost and stolen passports to INTERPOL.  It also directs nations to provide any other identity information requested by Washington for U.S. visa applicants, including biometric or biographic details. The cable sets out requirements for countries to provide data on individuals it knows or has grounds to believe are terrorists as well as criminal record information.  Further, countries are asked not to block the transfer of information about U.S.-bound travelers to the U.S. government and not to designate people for travel watchlists based solely on their political or religious beliefs. This is the first time that the U.S. Government is setting standards for the information that is required from all countries specifically in support of immigration and traveler vetting, the cable said.  The cable can be read here: (reut.rs/2untHTl). The new requirements are the latest in a series of steps the Trump administration says it is taking to better protect the United States from terrorist attack.     However, former officials said much of the information sought is routinely shared between countries, including examples of passports and additional details about particular travelers that may present security concerns.  Some U.S. allies may worry about privacy protections if Washington is seen as seeking information beyond what is already shared, said John Sandweg, a former senior Homeland Security Department official now with the firm Frontier Solutions. I dont think you can ignore the political aspects of the unpopularity of the current administration. That puts political pressure to stand up to the administration, he said. The cable lays out risk factors the U.S. government will consider when evaluating a country. Some of these are controversial and could be difficult for countries to prove to U.S. satisfaction, including ensuring that they are not and do not have the potential to become a terrorist safe haven. Countries are also expected to agree to take back citizens ordered removed from the United States. If they do not provide the information requested, or come up with an adequate plan to, countries could end up on a list to be submitted to Trump for possible sanction, including barring categories of their citizens from entering the United States. The real worries for countries may not come until the results of this review are known, said Leon Rodriguez, the former director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Once they start making decisions I think that is where there is going to be a lot of anxiety, he said, saying delays in visa processing for nations that do not pose much of a threat could start to hurt ordinary business and personal travel. The most controversial of Trumps immigration-related moves are two executive orders, challenged in federal court, which impose a temporary ban on travel to the United States for most citizens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.  While the orders were initially blocked from being enforced, the Supreme Court on June 26 allowed the ban to go into effect for people from the six nations with no strong ties to the United States.  The cable requires countries to act quickly, but stressed that the United States would work with foreign nations to assess if they meet the standards and, if not, to come up with a plan to help them do so. The cable asks that U.S. diplomats underscore that while it is not our goal to impose a ban on immigration benefits, including visas, for citizens of any country, these standards are designed to mitigate risk, and failure to make progress could lead to security measures by the USG, including a presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of certain categories of foreign nationals of non-compliant countries. The cable says the U.S. government has made a preliminary determination that some countries do not meet the new standards and that others are at risk of not meeting them. It does not name these, listing them in a separate, classified cable. The State Department declined comment on the cable, saying it would not discuss internal communications. The U.S. governments national security screening and vetting procedures for visitors are constantly reviewed and refined to improve security and more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States, said a U.S. State Department official on condition of anonymity.

He said he expected the House to make changes that would not affect the bills overall character and to address issues that have worried energy companies, such as a provision that oil firms said could block them out of international exploration projects if Russian firms were also involved. Hoping to send a message to President Donald Trump to maintain a strong line against Moscow, the Senate passed the sanctions on Russia, part of a broader measure also imposing new sanctions on Iran, by 98-2 on June 15. The bill has been mired in the House ever since. The delay has frustrated Democrats, and some of Trumps fellow Republicans, who think the president is so eager to improve relations with Russia that he will not retaliate for Moscows international aggression. This week, Trump has been defending his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Republicans, who control Congress, said the House could not vote on the Senate bill because it violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues originate in the House. Democrats accused Republicans of stalling because of Trump administration concern about a provision setting up a process for Congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on Russia. Seeking a greater influence in foreign policy, Congress has included such review provisions in a few recent major bills, starting with Corkers 2015 legislation forcing congressional review of President Barack Obamas nuclear deal with Iran. Corker said he thought there should be more congressional review of foreign policy.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republican leaders released on Thursday a revised plan to dismantle the Obamacare law, but it drew criticism from senators on both sides of the political divide within the Republican party, indicating a treacherous path for the bill. The bill played to the partys disparate factions by letting insurers sell cheap, bare-bones policies while retaining taxes on the wealthy.  But the immediate outcry illustrated the difficult political terrain that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must navigate. He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature legislative achievement. The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare. They deserve better care. And the time to deliver that to them is next week, McConnell said. In addition to the criticism from some senators, a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas. With Democrats united against it, McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage. But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate. Several senators said they had concerns about the legislation, particularly its Medicaid cuts, including Shelley Moore Capito, Rob Portman and John McCain. And two other Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan. McConnell, a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party, has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week. The continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trumps party will be able to get the job done. Healthcare is Trumps first major legislative initiative. Failure would call into question his partys ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House. The measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes. It retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed, and also keeps Obamacares limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry. The bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down, low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives. These skinny plans would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care, mental health services and addiction treatment, outpatient care, hospitalization, emergency room visits and prescription drugs. Insurer groups, including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, have derided the skinny plans, saying they would raise insurance premiums, destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions. Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons. The new bill provides an additional $70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses. The bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025. Moderate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version. Critics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators, the revised bills core remains unchanged: restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program, taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans, especially older people and the sick. The revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate who had opposed the original bill. It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums  at least 75 percent above the national average. Alaska is the only state with premiums that high, Senate aides said. Hospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach, particularly proposed Medicaid cuts. The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp.  Molina Healthcare, which has more than 1 million customers on the Obamacare individual exchanges and manages Medicaid health programs, said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable.  The American Hospital Association said the new version of the bill retained the unacceptable flaws of the previous version. Instead of merely putting forth an update, we again call on the Senate to put forth an upgrade, Rick Pollack, president of the association, said in a statement. Healthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement, as Wall Street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one. The new bill includes another $45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic, on top of the $2 billion in the earlier version. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 22 million by 2026, is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days. The Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, in large part by expanding Medicaid. The House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote. Any bill passed by the Senate would have to go back to the House for approval. Repealing and replacing Obamacare, which Republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system, was a top campaign promise for Trump, who was monitoring the Senate developments during his visit to Paris. Id say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare, Trump told reporters on his flight to Paris.

But Ross, speaking to reporters following a closed-door meeting with Senate Finance Committee members, declined to put a time frame on the reviews release.

The 79-year-old former steel industry magnate said he spoke to senators about the broad outlines of the Section 232 probe, including its legal basis and objectives, the potential tools for accomplishing those objectives, what are the risks involved in the process. Ross did not provide any details on specific recommendations to Trump, saying the purpose of the meeting was to provide senators with some background within which they can judge their reaction to the report when it comes out.

Carter, 92, became unsteady at the construction site and slumped away from his work area to a chair, according to eyewitnesses, who said he was working for more than an hour on steps of the home, using a drill. Several workers helped him to sit, and he was later taken away by ambulance. His medical issue resulted from dehydration, the Carter Center said in a statement. He had been working on a building project with Habitat for Humanity, a charitable organization promoting affordable home ownership. Carter was taken to St. Boniface General Hospital for treatment, according to the Carter Center, which is based in Atlanta. President Carter told us he is OK and is being taken offsite for observation, Habitat said in a statement, noting he had been working in the hot sun. He encourages everyone to stay hydrated and keep building. Carter, a Democrat who served in the White House from January 1977 to January 1981, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his humanitarian work.     Carter, whose family had a history of cancer, disclosed in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with melanoma, a form of skin cancer, that had spread to his brain and elsewhere and had been spotted during liver surgery. But by December of that year Carter told his church that his latest brain scan showed no sign of the disease. The peanut farmer from Georgia has lived longer after his term in office than any other president in U.S. history. Through his work on global issues, he became widely regarded as a better former president than he was a president, having left office profoundly unpopular. In Canada, Carter had been volunteering with a project to build 150 homes with Habitat for Humanity in honor of the countrys 150th birthday. The organization noted that Carter had requested that others involved with the effort continue their work for the day. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, have traveled around the world working with Habitat since 1984, according to the organization. She was with him at the hospital, the Carter Foundation said.

Ryan made his announcement a week after a CBS News report about the long-standing rules went viral on social media. It prompted a slew of reports, including some falsely accusing Ryan of unfairly targeting women, especially given Washingtons notoriously hot summers. The current dress code has been in place for years, including under Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who was the only woman to serve as House Speaker, from 2007-11. This is nothing new and certainly not something that I devised, Ryan said at a news conference. At the same time, that doesnt mean that enforcement couldnt stand to be a bit modernized. The dress code requires men to wear suit jackets and ties in the House chamber and speakers lobby, which is just outside it, and women are not supposed to wear sleeveless tops or dresses without a sweater or jacket. Neither men nor women are allowed to wear open or athletic footwear. Ryan made clear that all of those standards would not go away. Decorum is important, especially for this institution, he said. And a dress code in the chamber, in the lobby makes sense. But we also dont need to bar otherwise accepted contemporary business attire. So look for a change on that soon. Amid a flurry of news articles, women House members jumped into the fray. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier circulated a flyer urging women lawmakers to wear sleeveless dresses on Sleeveless Friday on July 14, with a photo on the Capitol steps after the days first vote. Republican Representative Martha McSally noted she was wearing an outfit that violated the code as she ended a speech in the House chamber on Wednesday. I want to point out that Im standing here in my professional attire, which happens to be a sleeveless dress and open-toed shoes, McSally said. It was not McSallys first brush with dress codes. In 2001 when she was an Air Force fighter pilot, McSally sued then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld over the militarys policy of requiring military women in Saudi Arabia to wear a head-to-toe abaya when off base. Pelosi took to social media to welcome Ryans statement.  These unwritten rules are in desperate need of updates, she said on Twitter. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, plans to send a letter on Thursday to Donald Trump Jr. to ask him to testify before his committee in a public session, CNN reported.  If he appeared before the panel, Trumps son would be the highest member of the Republican presidents inner circle of relatives and White House aides to testify in Congress about the Russia allegations. Accusations that Moscow interfered in the election and  colluded with the Trump campaign have dominated Trumps first months in office. Russia denies meddling in the campaign, and Trump says there was no collusion. Trump Jr. disclosed this week that he had met with a Russian lawyer last year who was said to be offering damaging information on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. eagerly agreed to meet the lawyer, who he was told was part of Moscows official support for his fathers campaign, according to emails the son released this week. The emails were the most concrete evidence that Trumps campaign might have been willing to accept Russian help to win the election, a subject that has prompted investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and Congress.     Trump said in Paris on Thursday that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a private attorney and not a Russian government lawyer, and that nothing of substance came of the meeting. My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast, he said at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. U.S intelligence agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and disseminating false information online.

On a flight to Paris from Washington, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you dont really have people crossing. But youll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles. Trump also told reporters on the plane it was important that border agents and others should be able to see through the wall so they could be aware of oncoming dangers. As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you dont see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? Its over, Trump said.   One of Trumps major 2016 campaign promises was to build a border wall to fight illegal immigration. His vow that Mexico would pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do, has strained relations between the two neighbors. Trump has since said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first. But almost six months into his presidency, he has so far asked Congress for only $1.6 billion for a project estimated to cost more than $20 billion. The border, which stretches across four U.S. states, already has 600 miles (965 km) of barriers, including fences and walls. Republicans on the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee introduced a bill on Tuesday that funded the $1.6 billion request, but Senate Democrats are likely to oppose it.

Form SF-86, required for government employees working in national security, indicated Sessions has had no immediate contact with any foreign government or its representatives in the past seven years. However, Sessions has said he met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A large portion of the document was left blank. As a United States Senator, the Attorney General met hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign dignitaries and their staff. In filling out the SF-86 form, the Attorney Generals staff consulted with those familiar with the process, as well as the FBI investigator handling the background check, and was instructed not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff connected with his Senate activities, said Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior. Sessions released the form in response to a lawsuit filed by American Oversight, a group that advocates for government transparency and sued DOJ in April after the extent of Sessions contact with the Russian government was called into question.  Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, said the form was evidence that Sessions lied to the FBI investigators overseeing his security clearance. Jeff Sessions is our nations top law enforcement officer, and it is shocking one of his first acts after being named Attorney General was to lie to the FBI on an issue of national security, Evers said.  Sessions recused himself from the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the election after media reports revealed he held undisclosed meetings with Kislyak. Sessions admitted to having the interactions, but said they were held in his capacity as a U.S. senator, a position he occupied for 20 years before becoming attorney general.  Former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May, testified that his agency had information on Sessions that would lead them to believe his continued involvement in the federal probe would be problematic. It was later reported that Sessions had another undisclosed interaction with Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington in April 2016. Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had no recollection of the interaction.  Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now leading the investigation into Russian meddling in the election.

In May, the Trump administration proposed cutting discretionary U.S. Transportation Department spending by 12.7 percent, or $2.4 billion to $16.2 billion.         A House of Representatives Appropriations Committee panel this week approved $17.8 billion in discretionary spending, $1.5 billion above the White House request.         On Thursday, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao addressed a U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican who chairs the panel, said she was disappointed in many proposed cuts. The House panel rejected a White House plan to end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service, which would have cut $630 million of $1.4 billion in annual government support for passenger rail service. The panel also rejected a plan to eliminate $150 million in annual subsidies for commercial air service to rural airports. Many lawmakers also opposed the administrations proposal to privatize the air traffic control system. In June, the Senate Commerce Committee approved proposed changes in Federal Aviation Administration policies. But unlike a House panel, it did not back spinning off air traffic control. The House will vote on the privatization plan as soon as next week. President Donald Trump says the move would modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. The proposal has drawn fire from private plane owners and rural airports. Critics say it would hand control of an important service to special interests and big airlines. Chao said the administration is working to address general aviation concerns. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), United Airlines (UAL.N) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) back the proposal. The Trump budget plan would cut $206 billion in infrastructure spending over 10 years, including $96 billion in planned highway trust fund spending. At the same time, the White House is proposing $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending and plans to unveil details this fall. Chao acknowledged Thursday the highway trust funds must be made up and said the administration is studying other options including a mileage tax. Asked if Trump is considering a gasoline tax hike, Chao said: Nothing is off the table.  A House panel also rejected this week the Trump administration plan to raise airline passenger security fees by $1 to $6.60 per one-way trip, which would generate $530 million for the Transportation Safety Administration.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Senate Republican leaders released an updated version of their healthcare bill on Thursday that would dismantle Obamacare after an attempt to bring an earlier version of the legislation to a vote fell apart amid an intraparty revolt. The new version of the bill did little to assuage concerns of moderate Republicans, who worried that its deep cuts to Medicaid would harm their most vulnerable residents. Two Republican senators said they would not even vote to open debate on the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two of his partys 52 Republicans, with Vice President Mike Pence ready to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senate added a number of changes to the bill in an attempt to win more support. Here are the main provisions of the new version of the bill:  The bill contains an amendment from conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz that would allow insurers to sell stripped-down, low-cost insurance plans that do not comply with Obamacares requirement that insurers cover a set of 10 essential health benefits. Those benefits include maternity and newborn care, mental health services and addiction treatment, outpatient care, hospitalization, emergency room visits and prescription drugs.  Insurers are strongly opposed to the amendment, which they say would raise insurance premiums for sick people, destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions. Senior Republican Senate aides said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would assess a version of the legislation with the amendment, and one without it. The bill retains two key taxes on the wealthy created by Obamacare to help pay for other provisions in the legislation. It keeps a 3.8 percent net investment income surtax for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000, and a 0.9 percent surtax for the Medicare insurance program for the elderly on people with those incomes. It also keeps Obamacares limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry. Those earning between zero and 350 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for tax credits under the proposal, but the credits are generally less generous than those provided under Obamacare. Under Obamacare, those earning between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for tax credits.  As with the earlier version, the bill repeals several Obamacare taxes, including on the pharmaceutical, medical device and health insurance industries. It also repeals a fine on individuals who do not purchase health insurance, as well as a penalty on employers who do not provide health insurance. The bill leaves in place an overhaul of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. Moderate Republicans had been hoping the updated version would soften the cuts, which they said would devastate their most vulnerable residents.  The bill unwinds Obamacares Medicaid expansion over three years, from 2021 to 2024. But it goes beyond repealing Obamacare by imposing drastic cuts to Medicaid that deepen in 2025. The CBO estimated the bill would cut Medicaid by nearly $800 billion by 2026, and would cut Medicaid 35 percent come 2036.  The bill contains an additional $45 billion for the opioid epidemic that has devastated parts of the United States, including West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. That is on top of the $2 billion included in the previous version of the bill.  The legislation also contains an additional $70 billion beyond the $112 billion in the earlier version for states to help insurers keep down rising insurance premiums and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses.

Seated at his Oval Office desk, Trump said he did not fault his son for holding the meeting, writing it off as a decision made in the heat of an upstart, non-traditional campaign. I think many people would have held that meeting, Trump said.  It was a 20-minute meeting, I guess, from what Im hearing, Trump said.

Donald Trump Jr., in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, said: In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently. In the White House interview, the president said he directly asked Russian President Vladimir Putin if he was involved in what U.S. intelligence says was Russian meddling in the presidential campaign and that Putin had insisted he was not. Trump said he spent the first 20 or 25 minutes of his more than two-hour meeting with Putin last Friday in Germany on the election meddling subject. I said, Did you do it? And he said, No, I did not. Absolutely not. I then asked him a second time in a totally different way. He said absolutely not, Trump said. Asked if he believed Putins denial, Trump paused. Look. Something happened and we have to find out what it is, because we cant allow a thing like that to happen to our election process. So something happened and we have to find out what it is, he said. About Putin, he added: Somebody did say if he did do it, you wouldnt have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point. While U.S. intelligence agencies and even members of Trumps Cabinet have said Russia meddled in the election, Trump has wavered on the subject, at times suggesting that other actors might have been involved. Trump equivocated on whether he felt he could trust Putin. He said Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping both look out for their countries interests, as he looks out for U.S. interests. I am not a person who goes around trusting lots of people. But hes the leader of Russia. It is the second most powerful nuclear power on earth. I am the leader of the United States. I love my country. He loves his country, Trump said. As in the past, Trump said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. There was zero coordination. Its the dumbest thing Ive ever heard, he said. The Republican president said Democrats had used the accusations to justify Clintons loss in November, saying: The White House is functioning beautifully despite the hoax made up by the Democrats. Although he and Putin were able to forge a ceasefire agreement in part of Syria, Trump said their interests collided over other issues. He said his U.S. military buildup and drive to increase U.S. energy production were in direct conflict with Putin, whose nation is dependent on energy exports.

ON WHETHER HE WISHED HE HAD KNOWN HIS SON WAS HAVING THE MEETING Look - that campaign ... I actually always thought Id win, to be honest with you, because Ive been winning my whole life, to be honest with you, but we started a campaign as a non-politician, and many people were skeptical. Some werent, some people who know me werent ... but many were skeptical. And it was a wild time. And we would meet with many people. That same meeting: a person comes in, sits, leaves, quickly. It was a 20-minute meeting, I guess, from what Im hearing. Many people, and many political pros, said everybody would do that. If you got a call and said, Listen I have information on Hillary and the DNC, or whatever it was they said, most people are going to take that meeting, I think. I think many people would have held that meeting. And you have to understand, when that took place, this was before Russia fever. There was no Russia fever back then, that was at the beginning of the campaign, more or less. There was no Russia fever. Most of the phony politicians who are Democrats who I watched over the last couple of days  most of those phonies that act holier-than-thou, if the same thing happened to them, they would have taken that meeting in a heartbeat. First question - first 20, 25 minutes - I said, Did you do it? He said, No, I did not, absolutely not. I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, Absolutely not. Somebody did say if he did do it, you wouldnt have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point. Look: Something happened and we have to find out what it is, because we cant allow a thing like that to happen to our election process. So something happened, and we have to find out what it is. We have to find out and get to the bottom of whats going on, because we cant have even the slightest suspicion about our election process. Now, everybody agrees that there was no impact on the votes in this election, which is very important to say, but we have to make sure that nothing could ever happen to our election process. Do I feel I can trust anybody, OK? Im a very suspicious person. I am not a person that goes around trusting lots of people. But hes the leader of Russia. It is the second most powerful nuclear power on earth. I am the leader of the United States. I love my country. He loves his country. Hes for Russia. President Xi  I had a long meeting with him too, 2-1/2 hours, great relationship. Hes for China, Im for the United States. Theyre for their countries. But I do things the way I do things, and its just worked out. But we had a very productive meeting. Including the fact that I think we have a good shot at piece by piece getting Syria to stop fighting. Ultimately Ukraine. And other things, including the destruction of terrorists as we know them. So Im sitting with Putin, and we had a very good - we were there two hours and 15 minutes - we had a very good meeting. One of the things brought up was a ceasefire. I said, Weve got to solve this problem in Syria. And Ukraine by the way. And what happened is we sat down and we worked out a ceasefire, which is by the way, as of 20 minutes ago, totally holding, and thats four days. Four days doesnt sound like a lot, but theyve never had a ceasefire that lasted at all. Thats because Putin told them, as opposed to somebody that nobody ever heard of. Putin and I agreed to it, and we have a four-day ceasefire. That means many lives have already been saved because of four days. But its going to go on for a while, and things are going to go better. I was very tough with President Putin. We have a very important relationship. Its going to be a relationship where lots of lives could be saved, like as an example with the ceasefire, which nobody else could have gotten but me. I campaigned on strong military, strong borders, and low oil prices. Look what Ive done  oil prices have been driven down. Were sending LNG to Poland, massive shipments to Poland. Thats not what Putin wants. And for the military, weve got $56 billion more of equipment than anybody ever thought of, in the last budget. Putin doesnt want that  so why would Putin want me? Its really the one question I wish I would have asked Putin: Were you actually supporting me? Im very big on energy, and thats not good for Russia, because Russia makes its money with energy. That drives the price of energy down. I also am very strong on the military, very, very strong on the military. Im also very strong on cyber. I would bet that inwardly Putin would have been against me. The mood in the White House is fantastic. We have done more in five months than practically any president in history. If you look at Iraq and if you look at Syria and you see the progress weve made with ISIS, its been almost complete. The White House is functioning beautifully. The stock market has hit a new high. Job numbers are the best theyve been in 16 years. We have a Supreme Court judge already confirmed. Energy is doing levels that weve never done before. Our military is doing well. Were knocking the hell out of ISIS, which Obama wasnt. Theres not a thing that were not doing well in. The White House is functioning beautifully, despite the hoax made up by the Democrats. The problem is, I didnt do anything. I didnt do anything. This isnt a question of defense. I didnt do anything. I had no relationship to Russia. So I said, what can the legal team do? The only frustration is that this Russia story is a hoax made up by the Democrats as an excuse for losing an election that they should have won because its almost impossible for a Republican to win the Electoral College. There was zero coordination. Its the dumbest thing Ive ever heard. Theres no coordination, this was a hoax, this was made up by the Democrats. This is the greatest con job in history, where a party sits down the day after they got their ass kicked, and they say, Huh, whats our excuse?

Some Democratic lawmakers want the Federal Election Commission to charge Trump Jr. based on emails in which he eagerly agreed to meet with a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer with damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Clinton.  They argue that his enthusiasm was akin to seeking something of value from a foreigner, which is prohibited under U.S. campaign laws.  Democrat U.S. Representative Grace Meng wrote to the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday asking it to take up a complaint against Trump Jr. that was filed this week by government watchdog group Common Cause.  The group asked the agency to investigate and said there was a troubling pattern of President Trump, members of his family and key advisors acting as if they are above the law.      Judith Ingram, a spokeswoman for the Federal Election Committee, said any complaints it received would be handled confidentially and she declined further comment.    Larry Noble, a former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission who now is senior director of the Campaign Legal Center said he thinks complaints about Trump Jr. have merit and that the agency should investigate. Noble said if the commission rejected or ignored the complaints, outside groups could sue it to try to force an investigation.  The Department of Justice could file criminal charges if there was evidence of wrongdoing by Trump Jr., but such decisions would be left to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating  possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.     The Federal Election Commission consists of six commissioners, traditionally three Republicans and three Democrats, but vacancies have left just one Democrat, an independent and three Republicans.  To begin an investigation against Trump Jr., four of the commissioners would need to consent. If any of the Republicans declined to consent the group would be gridlocked. Former Federal Election Commission Chair Ann Ravel has been a vocal critic of the agency, writing in a report earlier this year that it was deadlocked by partisan division. She cited the agencys refusal to investigate secretly owned shell corporations contributing millions to political groups known as Super PACS, thereby making it impossible to determine the source of the cash. She noted that in 2006 commissioners were deadlocked in  2.9 percent of substantive votes in Matters Under Review that were closed that year. In 2016, the commissioners deadlocked in 30 percent of all substantive votes taken in such matters. In 2006, she wrote, the Commission assessed more than $5.5 million in civil monetary penalties for Matters Under Review. In 2016, it imposed a total of $595,425 in civil monetary penalties for Matters Under Review.  In an opinion piece for The New York Times in February, she wrote, What we are left with is an agency mandated to ensure transparency and disclosure that is actually working to keep the public in the dark. Paul S. Ryan, a lawyer with Common Cause who filed the complaint against Trump Jr., acknowledged that the agencys enforcement power is very weak.  Our best hope ... is going to be Robert Muellers investigation, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The vote was 86 to 12 in the 100-member Senate.  Hagerty, founder of the private equity firm Hagerty Peterson, spent several years in Japan with the Boston Consulting Group and later served in the White House under former President George H.W. Bush. Trumps choice of Hagerty was taken as a sign of the interest in economic ties to Japan by the Republican president, a real estate developer and reality television star, who had never held public office when he was elected in November. North Korea has been worrying and frustrating neighboring countries and U.S. officials with a series of missile tests, more so since Pyongyang last week test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile. Trump has been criticized for being slow to name ambassadors to important U.S. allies like Japan, especially in light of the crisis. There is still no new U.S. ambassador to South Korea. Hagerty succeeds Caroline Kennedy, an attorney and daughter of the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who held the position from 2013 until Trump took office in January 2017.

Trump, who has made few friends in Europe with his rejection of the 2015 Paris agreement and his America First trade stance, met with French President Emmanuel Macron as both leaders sought common ground to reset an awkward relationship. Something could happen with respect to the Paris accords, lets see what happens, Trump told a news conference. If it happens, that will be wonderful, and if it doesnt, thatll be OK too. Trump has said the Paris accord is soft on leading polluters like China and India, putting U.S. industry at risk. I respect the wish to preserve jobs, I think thats compatible with the Paris accord, Macron said at the joint conference. There is no sudden and unexpected change today, otherwise we would have announced it, but there is the shared intention to continue discussing these issues, the French president added.  Trump and Macrons relationship got off to a bumpy start, but both have an incentive to improve relations - Macron hopes to elevate Frances role in global affairs, and Trump, seemingly isolated among world leaders, needs a friend overseas. Trump came to France beset by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, with emails released on Tuesday suggesting his eldest son welcomed an offer of Russian help against his fathers Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Weeks after Macron hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles, Trump will bask in the trappings of the Bastille Day military parade on Friday and commemorations of the entry 100 years ago of U.S. troops into World War One.  Macron welcomed Trump with a warm handshake and smiles, a contrast to the clenched-jaw greeting they shared at their first encounter in May. Emmanuel, nice to see you. This is so beautiful, the U.S. president told Macron as they met at the Hotel des Invalides where Napoleon Bonaparte and other French war heroes are buried. For the 39-year-old Macron, Frances youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, the visit is a chance to use soft diplomacy to win Trumps confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy, which European leaders say lacks direction. Macron views it as counter-productive to isolate the United States on the world stage, and said he and Trump had asked diplomats to draw up in the coming weeks a concrete initiative aimed at preparing the future of Syria. On the Iraq-Syria situation, we have agreed to continue working together, in particular on the building of a roadmap for the post-war period, Macron said. Trump said work was underway to negotiate a ceasefire in a second region of Syria. On Friday, Trump will be guest of honor at Frances July 14 celebrations, a year after a Tunisian man loyal to Islamic State ploughed a truck through revelers on a seafront promenade in Nice, killing more than 80. During the U.S. election campaign, Trump said a wave of militant attacks showed France is no longer France, and reprimanded the then-Socialist government for allegedly bowing its head to jihadists. In bringing Trump to Paris, Macron has stolen a march on Britains embattled Prime Minister Theresa May. Londons offer of a state visit for Trump met fierce domestic criticism and warnings that he would be greeted by mass protests. An Elabe poll showed that 59 percent of French people approved of Macrons decision to invite Trump. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The complaint with the Federal Election Commission was signed by Common Cause, the Campaign Legal Center, Democracy 21 and two campaign lawyers involved with those groups. It identified as respondents the Trump campaign and Trump Jr. Common Cause filed a complaint earlier this week with the agency. Thursdays complaint added three attendees at the meeting: Manafort, who was Trumps campaign manager at the time, Kushner, Trumps son-in-law, and Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting. The complaint takes advantage of information disclosed in email exchanges with Trump, Jr., son of President Donald Trump, that detailed how and why the meeting in 2016 was arranged.  The Federal Election Commission is the only federal agency that can bring civil charges for violations of the campaign finance law. However, because the panel requires bipartisan agreement to move forward on any actions, critics have expressed concern that the agency was unlikely to take action.  Democrat U.S. Representative Grace Meng wrote to the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday asking it to take up Common Causes first complaint against Trump Jr. The organizations said in Thursdays complaint that the emails provided evidence that Trump Jr. violated the law by asking a foreign national for something of value, which they argue the law would define as including the fruits of paid research, hacking, or similar investigatory activity.  The evidence is clear that Don Jr. knew that the offer of opposition campaign research came from the Russian government, and the law is clear that giving such valuable research for free would have been a contribution to the Trump campaign, said Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center. The complaint said that Manafort and Kushner, by attending the meeting knowing the subject matter, are also at fault.   Donald Trump, Jr. and the White House have insisted there was no wrong doing. Democratic lawmakers want the Federal Election Commission to bring civil charges against Donald Trump, Jr., saying the meeting violated the law.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SUPERIOR, Arizona (Reuters) - Rio Tintos proposed Resolution Copper Mine in Arizona would tunnel 7,000 feet underground, where rocks radiate heat from the earths molten core. It would suck up enough water to supply a city and leave a crater a mile and a half wide and 1,000 feet deep. Planned for more than a decade, the project would be a prototype for a looming era of more invasive U.S. mines as companies run out of easy-to-reach deposits, geologists say. It is also the project President Donald Trumps Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, had in mind as he began crafting a hit list of regulations that should be killed to speed industrial permitting. A company shouldnt have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved, Ross told Reuters in a May 9 interview, referring to the mine. The massive project - which would be among the worlds largest copper mines - underscores the dangers of weakening Americas rigorous permitting process at a time mining endeavors are becoming increasingly complex and environmentally risky. And Rosss citation of Resolution as a poster child for suffocating regulation reflects how far the Trump administration is willing to go to advance economic growth. Sorting out the mines potentially negative impacts is anything but simple, and many local residents, along with Native American and environmental groups, say Resolution is exactly the kind of development that cries out for intense public scrutiny - no matter how long it takes. The companies have to mitigate their risks - mitigate what people are losing, said Mila Besich-Lira, the mayor of Superior, the town closest to the project. A federal government review of the project has drawn about 130,000 comments from concerned constituents - more than 10 times the number who gave input on the smaller Rosemont Copper Mine nearby. The Resolution mine would also give the region a big economic boost, employing 1,400 people and injecting $20 billion into public coffers, Rio Tinto (RIO.L) estimates. It could supply the United States with a quarter of its copper, putting this small town at the epicenter of the global metals market. Trump has vowed sweep away regulations he says cost America trillions of dollars with no public benefit. The regulatory review by Ross, due for release as soon as this month, is one of several parallel efforts to slash red tape. Trump has also started dismantling Obama-era climate change regulations through executive orders, for example, and directed agencies to kill two rules for every one they create. In the meantime, Congress could set the tone. A Republican bill introduced early this year - and supported by Rio Tinto - would set a two-and-a-half-year deadline on mine permitting, a standard similar to that seen in Australia and Canada.  Rio Tinto - along with the Australian mining company BHP Billiton (BLT.L), which owns a 45 percent stake in Resolution - says it has spent 16 years and $1.3 billion on the project, including a decade acquiring acreage in the Tonto National Forest overlying the copper deposit. It is now four years into the federal regulatory review to approve new mines, a process that can take seven to 10 years. Victoria Peacey, a senior manager for environmental permitting at Rio Tinto, said the mine up probably wont begin operating for another decade. Rio Tinto acknowledges the vast scope and sensitivity of its plans. There are mines this deep; there are mines this hot; and there are mines this big; but there are no other mines this deep, this hot and this big all together, said Carl Hehnke, a geologist for Resolution. Resolution will take copper from a zone where temperatures run 180 degrees Fahrenheit. With help from remotely controlled machines, miners will set off explosions to shatter sections of the deposit.  The ore will be milled with a combination of sulfuric acid and as much as 6.5 billion gallons of water a year - enough to supply more than half the homes in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. It would eventually render more than 2,400 acres of what is now the Tonto National Forest off limits to visitors.  Under the forest, in a process called block cave mining, Rio Tinto will excavate material from underground, making the material above sink and creating the expected one-and-a-half-mile-wide crater.  That area will include a site considered sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which has been holding annual protests against the project. If Resolutions copper deposit had been discovered under private land  and not a national forest  Rio Tinto might have been spared the federal review and faced only state regulators. Instead, the U.S. Forest Service is leading the study, which will consider jobs, recreation, public health and wildlife. Despite its substantial economic benefits to the nearby town of Superior, where many homes and businesses are boarded up, residents still have their concerns. What am I going to tell my great-grandkids - how this place was totally destroyed? said Anna Jeffries, a Superior resident, during an April 2016 public meeting with Forest Service officials at Superior High School.  Mining industry lobbyists counter that they are only seeking an efficient and reasonable approval process. We are not talking in any way, shape or form about any environmental rollbacks here, said Katie Sweeney, general counsel for the National Mining Association, a trade group. Were talking about bureaucracy. The NMA wants to see deadlines for permitting, along with rules requiring agencies to conduct studies simultaneously rather than consecutively. The NMA and Rio Tinto back the bill - introduced in January by Republican Congressman Mark Amodei of Nevada - that would give regulators the two-and-a-half year deadline to approve or reject mining projects. Mining companies in Canada and Australia applaud similar time limits in those countries, but a May 2016 report by a government watchdog in the Canadian province of British Columbia found Canadas mine regulation had major gaps in resources, planning and tools that led to inadequate inspections and increasing environmental risks. Commerce Secretary Ross told Reuters in a June 23 phone message he believed the U.S. Forest Service was doing a good job in terms of Rio Tinto. But he added, The rest of the process has been so abysmal that Rio Tinto actually testified before the U.S. Congress [about] how bad the process was. Ross and his spokesman did not respond to additional questions seeking examples of problems that occurred between Resolution and permit-issuing agencies. But his office said he was referring to Congressional testimony given by Rio Tintos Managing Director for Copper and Diamonds, Nigel Steward, in March. Steward called the U.S. permitting process inefficient and said it presents a major barrier to the domestic sectors ability to perform to its full potential. Rio Tinto is advocating for more certainty in permitting timelines and improved coordination among agencies involved - along with more money for agencies to ensure that experienced and highly skilled people are devoted to complex technical aspects of permitting, said Todd Malan, Rio Tintos vice president for external affairs and communications for the Americas. While the company supports permitting deadlines, at least one Rio Tinto official acknowledges that it would be hard to address the issues raised by the Resolution mine in less than years. Im not necessarily saying time frames would not be helpful, but three years? ... Thats a tight time frame, said Peacey. While uncertain permitting timeframes raise financial risks for Rio Tinto, she said, the sometimes lengthy process also protects the public. Those are peoples rights, she said.

The 46-year-old Michigan native drew attention on Twitter and his Facebook page to a Kid Rock 18 for U.S. Senate website. It featured a photo of the goateed singer-songwriter wearing a leather jacket, dark glasses and white fedora, seated in a plush, star-spangled chair beside a stuffed deer above the tagline: Are you scared? The site also displays images of a T-shirt, baseball cap and bumper sticker emblazoned with the campaign logo, Kid Rock for US Senate and a box of alternating slogans, including, In Rock We Trust, Party to the People and You Never Met a Politician Quite Like Me. I have a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real ... The answer is an absolute YES, he said on his verified Twitter account. Stay tuned, I will have a major announcement in the near future. Reached by email, the musicians spokesman, Kirt Webster, referred only to Rocks Facebook page, which bore the same message. His music label, Warner Bros Records, also posted a website offering sales of Kid Rock for U.S. Senate merchandise. Born Robert James Ritchie in the Detroit suburb of Romeo, Michigan, he rose to fame in 1998 as his debut album Devil Without a Cause sold some 14 million copies. He gained additional celebrity through his courtship of actress Pamela Anderson and their brief marriage in the 2000s. While no mention was made in Wednesdays online postings about Rocks political affiliation or in which state he would run, he presumably would seek to challenge Michigans Democratic incumbent senator, Debbie Stabenow, who is up for re-election in 2018. The Capitol Hill-based newspaper Roll Call reported that Rocks name surfaced as a possible candidate earlier this month during a state Republican Party convention in Michigan, which Trump carried in the 2016 presidential race, though no official decisions were announced. Stabenow seemed to shrug off the prospect of a political challenge from Rock, saying in a Twitter post: I know we both share a love of music. I concede hes better at playing guitar and Ill keep doing what I do best: fighting for Michigan. According to Roll Call, Rock endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for president in 2012 and initially supported Ben Carson for the Republican nomination in 2016 but switched to Trump when the former reality-TV star became the partys nominee. Afterward, Rock released a line of pro-Trump merchandise, including a T-shirt that read God Guns & Trump.  In April, Kid Rock joined fellow rocker and conservative activist Ted Nugent and former Alaska Governor and onetime Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin for a White House visit and dinner with Trump. Kid Rock would not be the first showbiz figure to make a leap into politics. Besides Trump, he would follow the likes of singer Sonny Bono, who served as a U.S. congressman from California during the 1990s; pro-wrestler and actor Jesse The Body Ventura, elected Minnesota governor in 1998; and comedian Al Franken, now serving his second U.S. Senate term from Minnesota.

In a letter to the lawmakers, the groups said many climate programs are likely to undermine military readiness by diverting scarce resources. The programs in question were initiated by former President Barack Obamas 2015 executive order requiring the military to meet green energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets. The conservative groups are trying to gather support for Republican Representative Warren Davidsons amendment to the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act that would stop the military from implementing the policies. The groups include the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group; Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by the conservative Koch brothers; and Americans for Limited Government. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has long been supportive of programs that reduce troops petroleum dependence. In written testimony to a Senate panel after his confirmation hearing in January, Mattis said climate change can be a driver of instability and is a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of-government response. The House bill includes language from Democratic Representative Jim Langevin that would require the Pentagon to report to Congress on military bases that are most vulnerable from rising seas and other effects of climate change. It is uncertain whether Davidsons or Langevins measures would be in the final House bill. The House is due to vote this week on its version of the defense bill and the Senate version will follow later this year.

When asked about Mattis position on climate, Ebell said he had heard generals say for years that climate change is a risk and Ive never listened to one who seemed to have the slightest clue as to what he was talking about.

Randal Quarles, a former Wall Street lawyer and U.S. Treasury official who now runs an investment firm, was part of a team that invested in troubled or failed banks while he was an executive at private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O). Those investments earned hundreds of millions of dollars for Carlyle, profits that would not have been possible without government support. A spokesman for Quarles did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Carlyle declined to comment. Democrats including Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown have said they intend to scrutinize Quarles ties to Wall Street during his confirmation hearing. Senator Elizabeth Warren described him as straight off the Wall Street assembly line in announcing her opposition in a statement. But both the White House and Congress are controlled by Republicans, who have the ability to approve Trumps nominees with a simple majority after Senate rules were changed in 2013. Under previous rules, the party in power would have needed at least 60 votes. Quarles is viewed by many policy analysts as a business-friendly pick who benefits from having experience in the federal government and his business ties are unlikely to be viewed by senior senators his Wall Street ties as a handicap.  Profiting in the markets isnt a scarlet letter in this Congress, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Trading & Research LLC, in Washington. Before launching The Cynosure Group in 2014, Quarles was a partner and managing director at Carlyle. While there, he played a key role in making a $75 million investment in Boston Private Financial Holdings Inc (BPFH.O), and was also part of a group that decided to jointly acquire failed lender BankUnited Inc (BKU.N) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), alongside private equity peers Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), Centerbridge Partners LP and WL Ross & Co, as well as banker John Kanas. Months after Carlyles equity infusion, Boston Private received a $150 million bailout from the Treasury Department, which it later repaid. Those taxpayer funds helped the firm weather the financial crisis, and allowed Carlyle to sell off its stake over time for a total of $150 million, effectively doubling its money, according to a Reuters review of share sales the firm disclosed in regulatory filings. The FDIC had absorbed BankUniteds losses at an estimated cost of $4.9 billion before selling healthier assets to the private equity consortium for $945 million. BankUnited later went public, with Carlyle selling shares worth around $428 million in portions through 2014, according to Reuters analysis of its disclosures. The tallies do not account for dividends or other undisclosed costs. Carlyle would not provide precise numbers for returns on those investments. Involvement with taxpayer bailouts helped sink the earlier nomination of General Electric Co (GE.N) executive David Nason for the Federal Reserve supervisory position. Nason withdrew from vetting after Republicans criticized him for having structured the bailout program inside the Treasury Department during the Bush administration. But Wilbur Ross, whose WL Ross & Co was part of the consortium that invested in BankUnited alongside Carlyle, successfully became U.S. Commerce Secretary. Quarles history on Wall Street may be a talking point during his confirmation hearings, but it is unlikely to bring down his nomination, lobbyists and financial regulatory lawyers said.

The omission of online ads could be a potential hurdle for those investigating alleged Russian meddling in last years U.S. presidential election, according to the campaign finance lawyers, who are not involved in the probes. Since 1974, the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. The laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate. At issue are laws concerning a category of ads known as electioneering communications that address where a candidate stands on an issue, that spread news stories about a candidate or that attack a candidate without directly calling for his or her defeat. Foreign nationals cannot spend money on electioneering communications but the term under U.S. law applies only to communications made by broadcast, cable or satellite - with no mention of the internet. A related law does bar foreign nationals from expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate in any advertising medium. But as long as online ads do not call on people to vote for a specific candidate, they are not prohibited as a campaign finance matter, said Jan Baran, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents Republican candidates. U.S. Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed in May to investigate alleged Russian interference as well as potential collusion between Moscow and associates of President Donald Trump. The Russian government says it did not meddle and Trump has denied collusion.  Facebook (FB.O), which has become a leading platform for online political ads, has said that it has not found any evidence that Russian agents were buying ads.  Facebook said in April, however, that it had become a battleground for governments seeking to manipulate public opinion in other countries and outlined new measures to combat what it called information operations.  Trumps election campaign spent some $70 million on highly targeted Facebook advertising last year, Brad Parscale, the digital director of the campaign, told Reuters this year. The absence of rules governing online advertising ties the hands of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, said Ann Ravel, a former Democratic appointee to the commission. The law seems to totally exempt it and therefore it is not possible either to reasonably determine who is behind those ads, do an investigation to find out or penalize for that activity, Ravel said. Other laws could come into play in an investigation. The U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act restricts publicity paid for by a foreign government such as Russia.

Seeking to force Republican House leaders to allow a vote, Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee introduced legislation unchanged from what passed the Senate by 98-2 on June 15 but has been stalled ever since. While the new bill is identical to what the Senate passed, it will be labeled as House legislation to avoid a procedural issue that prompted House Republican leaders to send the measure back to the Senate. However, there was no sign of support from Trumps fellow Republicans, who control majorities in both the House and the Senate and control what legislation comes up for a vote. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, dismissed the Democrats action as grandstanding. The measure was introduced by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Representatives Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, and Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Democrats have accused House Republicans of stalling the sanctions package because of Trump administration concern about provisions setting up a process for Congress to approve any  effort by the president to ease sanctions on Russia. Trumps attempts to mend relations with Russia have been hindered by allegations that Moscow interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and colluded with Trumps campaign. Russia denies meddling and Trump says there was no collusion.     The issue has become even more heated since emails released Tuesday showed that Donald Trump Jr, the presidents eldest son, eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential election. Lawmakers and aides said news of that meeting, and the failure to disclose it, added new urgency to the push to pass the Russia package. DILLY-DALLYING House Republican leaders said they had not taken up the original Senate bill because it violated a constitutional requirement that all legislation affecting government revenues originate in the House, known as a blue slip issue. Democrats and some Republicans who backed the bill scoffed, saying the problem could have been quickly remedied. Dilly-dallying around about the blue slip issue was just a ridiculous waste of time. We could have fixed it in five minutes, Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters. The Senate changed the bill to address that issue, but also tweaked it in a way that Democrats said weakened a provision requiring Congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on Russia. The new bill introduced on Wednesday would eliminate that change to allow House Democrats, as well as Republicans, to force a vote on a resolution of disapproval of any effort to ease Russia sanctions. I dont believe that having the presidents party in a position to protect him from any oversight is good policy for our country, Hoyer told reporters. Ryan told a news conference he wants to move a strong bill regarding sanctions on Russia as quickly as possible but that the legislation still faced procedural and policy hurdles. The U.S. energy industry has been lobbying against the bill and some Republican House members, particularly from oil-producing states, have said they might want changes. The Russia sanctions legislation was written as an amendment to a bill imposing new sanctions on Iran over issues including its ballistic missile program. Besides establishing the review process, it puts into law sanctions previously imposed on Moscow via presidential executive order and introduces new sanctions.

Trump Jr. met the woman, lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, on June 9, 2016, after an email exchange with an intermediary.  The emails, tweeted by Trump Jr. on Tuesday, could provide material for Special Counsel Robert Muellers probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.  In one of the emails dated June 3, 2016, Trump Jr. wrote: If its what you say I love it. He released the tweets after the New York Times said it planned to write about their contents and sought his comment. Trump Jr. said in his tweets that nothing came of the meeting. Veselnitskaya told NBC News early on Tuesday she was not affiliated with the Russian government and had passed no information.  In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently, Trump Jr. said in an interview on Fox News. For me, this was opposition research. Collusion itself is not an actual crime under the U.S. criminal code, so prosecutors would look to see if Trump Jr.s conduct ran afoul of a specific law, legal experts said. Moscow has denied interference in the U.S. election, and President Donald Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia. Alan Futerfas, Trump Jr.s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.  One law that might come into play is the Federal Election Campaign Act, which makes it illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. The campaign is also prohibited from soliciting such contributions. A contribution does not have to be monetary in nature, according to Paul S. Ryan, an attorney with watchdog group Common Cause. He said incriminating information about Clinton could be considered a contribution under the act. Ryan said Trump Jr.s enthusiastic response to the offer for information and particularly his proposal in his email to have a follow-up call the next week constituted solicitation.  That to me is an indication, a concession by Donald Trump Jr. that he wants and is requesting this information, Ryan said.  Joshua Douglas, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, said Trump Jr.s emails made it more plausible that there could be a criminal case against him. James Gardner, an election law expert at the University of Buffalo Law School, said the election law was intended to target donations of cash or goods and services. He said he did not believe Trump Jr. would have violated the law if he solicited damaging information about Clinton.  A federal law known as the general conspiracy statute that makes it illegal to conspire to commit a crime against or defraud the United States could also come into play if, for example, Trump Jr. tried to help Russians hack into U.S. computer networks. There was no indication that Trump Jr. did such a thing. Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School who was  associate counsel in the White House Counsels Office under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said he thought Trump Jr.s agreeing to meet with someone to discuss an illegal act would be enough to trigger a conspiracy charge.  Its a very powerful tool, he said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday said he was very much inclined to maintain a court order that blocks President Donald Trumps administration from carrying out a policy designed to threaten federal funds to so-called sanctuary cities. At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, U.S. District Judge William Orrick III said a recent memo from the Justice Department that appeared to narrow the scope of Trumps executive order on sanctuary cities did not remove the need for an injunction. Trump issued the order in January directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities. Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing sanctuary movement. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. The Republican presidents moves to crack down on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court.  After Trump issued the sanctuary cities executive order earlier this year, Santa Clara County - which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities - sued, saying it was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. In a ruling in April, Orrick said Trumps order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. Attorney General Jeff Sessions then issued a memo which formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of Trumps order, saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs. In court on Wednesday, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate said the Sessions memo meant less than a million dollars were now at risk for Santa Clara County and San Francisco, so the injunction was no longer needed. But Orrick said an injunction was still necessary because Trump could always order Sessions to issue new, broader guidance. The attorney general still has the ability to change that memo, Orrick said. The judge said he would also likely reject a Justice Department request to dismiss other claims by Santa Clara and San Francisco.       ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Wray, nominated by Trump on June 7 to replace the fired James Comey as Federal Bureau of Investigation director, sought to stake out independence from the president and protect the agency from partisan political influence. Wray even said it would be highly unlikely he would agree to meet Trump in a one-on-one situation, as Comey reluctantly did. Wray, who seemed headed for U.S. Senate approval to fill the 10-year post, testified during a 4 1/2-hour hour Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing amid an uproar in Washington over 2016 emails released on Tuesday involving the presidents son, Donald Trump Jr. The emails showed the Republican presidents son agreeing last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscows official support for his father. Wray deflected specific questions from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham about the presidents sons emails, saying he had not read them. But Wray said, Any threats or effort to interfere with our election from any nation-state or any non-state actor is the kind of thing the FBI would want to know. Trumps son did not notify the FBI and wrote I love it about the Russians offer of information on Clinton. Trump fired Comey on May 9, igniting a political firestorm, and later cited the Russia thing as his reason. The Justice Department eight days later named Robert Mueller to serve as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race to help Trump win and potential collusion between Moscow and Trump associates. The Russia matter has dogged Trumps first six months in office. Wray said he had no reason to doubt the U.S. intelligence communitys conclusion that Russia interfered in part by hacking and releasing emails damaging to Clinton, a claim Moscow denies. Wray worked at the Justice Department under Republican former President George W. Bush when Comey was deputy attorney general and Mueller was FBI director. Wray also represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in a political scandal. Trump has called the Russia probe a witch hunt. I do not consider Director Mueller to be on a witch hunt, Wray told Graham. Wray said he was very committed to supporting Muellers investigation, calling him a consummate straight shooter and somebody I have enormous respect for. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Wray to inform the committee if you learn about any machinations to tamper with Muellers probe. Understood, Wray responded. Wray said no one at the White House had asked that he pledge loyalty to Trump, as Comey said the president demanded of him on Jan. 26. Wray said he would not give such an assurance if asked. My loyalty is to the Constitution, to the rule of law and to the mission of the FBI. And no one asked me for any kind of loyalty oath at any point during this process, and I sure as heck didnt offer one, Wray said. Comey previously told the same committee Trump pressed him in a one-on-one session to drop the FBI investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynns ties to Russia. Comey said he felt he was fired in a bid by Trump to undercut the Russia probe. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy asked Wray, If the president asks you to do something unlawful or unethical, what do you say? First, I would try to talk him out of it. And if that failed, I would resign, Wray replied. The allegation involving Trump pressing Comey on Feb. 14 over the Flynn probe raised questions about whether Trumps behavior amounted to obstruction of justice, a potential issue in any potential future effort in Congress to impeach the president and remove him from office. Wray sought to differentiate himself from Comey. Wray was asked about Comeys July 2016 news conference announcing that no criminal charges were planned against Clinton over her use of a private email server to handle classified information but faulting her conduct. I cant imagine a situation where as FBI director I would be giving a press conference on an uncharged individual, much less talk in detail about it, Wray testified. Graham questioned Wray about a January report by the U.S. news organization Politico that a Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee had met with Ukrainian embassy officials in Washington in a bid to help Clinton and expose links between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia. Wray said it would be wrong for Ukraine to meddle in the election and Id be happy to dig into it. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

In the mostly rural, heavily Baptist and predominately Trump-supporting terrain, the collective reaction ranges from   ignorance about the Russia investigation, to a belief that some media want to destroy Republican President Donald Trump and his  family, to complete disinterest.  Many of the 20 people interviewed in several Ohio towns were dismissive of the barrage of headlines about a June 2016 meeting between Trumps eldest son Donald Jr. and a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton. The revelation was made when Trump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday amid investigations of U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Moscow sought to help Trump win. Russia has denied allegations of interfering in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russian officials, sometimes dismissing the notion as fake news. In Little Hocking, Ohio, Lisa Walker, 54, runs a small thrift shop. Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the American flag, she says her husband has expressed fears that somebody is going to try and assassinate Trump. She and her husband voted for Trump. She has followed the revelations about the younger Trump on the news. She sees the Russia investigation as proof that people are out to get Trump. I would hope they have better things to do than play games and attack Trump. Similarly, in Jackson and Piketon, Ohio, Donald Trump Jr.s troubles appeared to strengthen support for his father and Trump family members who many in the area see as embattled victims. In Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County, the editor of the Hillsboro Times Gazette, Gary Abernathy, says many people in the county believe the media is trying to destroy Trump. It just plays into the belief here that the media is fixated on all things Russia, said Abernathy, whose newspaper was one of only six in the United States to have endorsed Trump for president during the election campaign. I dont mind Donald Trump being treated critically or aggressively, but not in a way that is an effort to drag him down. Donald Trump Jr. had one 20 minute meeting with a lawyer from Russia and its wall-to-wall coverage. Trump won Highland County with more than 76 percent of the vote, 12 points more than the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won, part of a surge in votes for Trump in many Midwestern rural counties that was a significant factor in his victory. Donald Jr.s meeting stirred more questions and reporting about possible collusion or whether any U.S. laws were broken. Under the U.S. Federal Election Campaign Act, it is illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. Before the latest disclosures, Americans overall were  sharply divided on what to make of reports about Trump and Russia. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June, 50 percent agreed that President Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election while 33 percent disagreed and the remainder were unsure. Republicans, however, mostly expressed the opposite view: 66 percent said they disagreed that Trump or his campaign worked with Russia while 20 percent agreed and the rest were unsure. In the Bob Evans diner in Jackson, three workers from Walmart were sitting down for lunch. They were Trump supporters. Asked about the Russia investigation, they stared back blankly.

The demand from the hardline group could escalate infighting that has prevented Republicans in the House of Representatives from agreeing on a spending blueprint for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. With about three dozen members, the Freedom Caucus can stymie any legislation in the Republican-controlled House.  Passing a budget resolution is vital to the success of a  Republican tax overhaul effort because it would allow a bill to pass the 100-seat Senate with only a simple majority. Otherwise, the legislation would require 60 votes in a chamber where Republicans have only 52 seats. The Freedom Caucus also repeated a call for the House to remain in session during August, saying lawmakers should also address healthcare and an increase in the federal debt ceiling rather than head home to their districts. Budget negotiations have bogged down over the groups efforts to include more than $200 billion of cuts to mandatory spending programs over a decade in any budget resolution, a move opposed by Republican moderates.  President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have promised to deliver a tax reform package this year. But the House budget squabble and hurdles facing healthcare legislation in the Senate have begun to worry business lobbyists about the prospects for success. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter on Wednesday to Senate Republicans calling for tax cuts and other policy changes it said would make businesses more competitive at home and abroad.   If a budget is put forth today, at $200 billion in mandatory spending and without decisions on tax reform, there would not be enough votes to pass it in the House, the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, told a news conference. In comments that paralleled a White House plan released in April, Meadows said tax reform should set a 16 percent corporate tax rate and double the standard deduction for individuals who do not itemize. Trump has called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate, versus the current 35 percent rate.  Freedom Caucus members also want House Republican leaders to abandon an unpopular border adjustment proposal that would tax imports.   Top Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress are trying to agree on a framework for tax reform, and the White House has said a plan could be set by the end of July. But there have been no tangible signs of progress in the closed-door discussions, while lobbyists and some congressional aides say the end-of-July deadline could be too ambitious.

The emails, released by Donald Trump Jr., are the most concrete evidence yet that Trump campaign officials welcomed Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trumps presidency and spurred investigations by the Justice Department and Congress. The messages show that the younger Trump was open to the prospect of very high level and sensitive information from a Russian attorney that a go-between described as part of Russia and its governments support for Mr. Trump ahead of a meeting on June 9, 2016.  \""If it's what you say I love it,\"" Trump Jr. responded. He released the messages on Twitter after the New York Times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him. (bit.ly/2uapeCK and bit.ly/2ua9hwg)     In an interview with Fox News, Trump Jr. said that Trumps campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who denies having Kremlin ties. He said Veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about Clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss Russian sanctions. In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently, he said. For me, this was opposition research. Nevertheless, the correspondence between him and Rob Goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for U.S. investigators probing whether Trumps campaign colluded with the Kremlin. The crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father, Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. on June 3. Russia does not have a crown prosecutor - the equivalent title is prosecutor general. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from Democratic Party officials. The conversation will now turn to whether President Trump was personally involved or not. But the question of the campaigns involvement appears settled now, Cornell Law School professor Jens David Ohlin said in an interview. The answer is yes.  Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Trump Jr. said he did not tell his father about the meeting. He said he may have since had contact with other Russians. Ive probably met with other people from Russia, but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything, he said on Fox News. The news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administrations economic agenda. Stocks and the dollar fell, while U.S. Treasury securities gained ground. Stocks later retraced most of their losses after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to keep lawmakers in Washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare. Along with his younger brother Eric, Trump Jr. oversees the Trump Organization, his fathers real-estate and business empire, and does not have a formal role in the White House. My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency, Trump said in a statement. The White House referred questions to lawyers for Trump and his son. The emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities. He is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents, according to a Senate source, while the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting, said the panels top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff. The American people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the Russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family, Schiff told reporters. On Fox News, Trump Jr. said he was more than happy to cooperate with everyone. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, asked the Trump administration how Veselnitskaya was able to enter the United States even though her authorization had expired. CNN reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, also planned to look into the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence, who has said the campaign had no contacts with Russia, said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting, held before he became Trumps running mate later that summer. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is at times harshly critical of Trump, told reporters: This is very problematic. We cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybodys campaign and say: Wed like to help you. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Sanders told reporters that all other questions on the matter should be referred to either his sons lawyer or the presidents outside counsel.

If its what you say I love it especially later in the summer, Trump Jr. replied in the email exchange after Goldstone said the information offered was part of Russia and its governments support for Mr. Trump. The disclosures could provide ammunition for U.S. investigators probing whether there was collusion between the Kremlin and Trumps Republican presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to hurt Clinton and help Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Sanders said Trump was frustrated by the focus on Russia. The president is, I would say, frustrated with the process of the fact that this continues to be an issue, and he would love for us to be focused on things like ... the economy, on healthcare, on tax reform, on infrastructure, Sanders said. Asked about the fact that the words perjury and treason were now being used in the public conversation about the Trump campaigns contacts with Russians, Sanders said, I think those new words are ridiculous.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fresh off one foreign trip and preparing for another, Donald Trump was enjoying a period of relative calm - until the White House was rocked by a fresh controversy over contacts between the presidents campaign and Russia. For Trump, who has been swept up all year in crises of his own making, this time the target was his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., whose meeting with a Russian lawyer last year led to accusations that the presidents son entertained working with Russians to spread negative information about Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Among Trumps wide-ranging group of outside advisers and former campaign officials, Donald Jr.s meeting with the lawyer on the expectation of gaining access to negative information on Clinton was seen as problematic, a demonstration of the sons political inexperience, but not illegal. You cant shrug this off even though you know hes very likely going to be okay, said an outside Trump adviser, who asked to remain unidentified. This is the presidents namesake and you have to circle the wagons in defense of the presidents son. Theres no question in my mind that every person in the White House has some level of concern about this. Otherwise its malpractice, the adviser said. Inside the White House, the mood was one of heavy acceptance that another political problem had emerged but also of caution as to its significance for a wider probe into Russias meddling in the election and whether there was collusion with the Trump campaign. Benumbed by previous crises from the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey to the appointment of a special prosecutor, White House officials showed no signs of panic and said they were trying to advance the presidents agenda. The new incident erupted as Trump seemingly enjoyed a rare moment of calm. His trip to Warsaw and Hamburg last week went fairly smoothly, although critics accused him of not being tough enough in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, he is to depart to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and to participate in flag-waving Bastille Day ceremonies. Trump himself was described by the White House as frustrated by yet another distraction involving the Russia investigation. He knows that he didnt do anything and he really wants to focus on the good things that are happening and the things he was elected to do, and he doesnt like it when things get in the way, a senior White House official said. The president offered a restrained reaction, not resorting to Twitter to launch a tirade against his critics, but issuing a brief statement praising his high-quality person who showed transparency by releasing the email chain with the lawyer on Tuesday.  There was a sense among former campaign advisers that Donald Trump Jr. had shown his political naivete by agreeing to the meeting. They noted that it took place at a time when Trump had a barebones staff and that his family members, initially reluctant to getting involved in his campaign, were searching to carve out space for themselves. Besides proving that he was gullible and he got snookered, its still not a smoking gun, said one former campaign adviser. Among even Republicans, there was dismay at the turn of events. Conservative author Quin Hillyer wrote in a blog post that Trump should step down for cozying up to Russia. (The blog link is here)  The American people absolutely cannot trust Trumps objectivity about Russian intentions and Russian actions, Hillyer wrote. This is an utterly untenable situation. For the good of the country, Trump must lance the boil, and resign. The outside Trump adviser said the Trump Jr. case unfortunately supports the narrative advanced by Trumps Democratic opponents and propagated by what Trump world feels is a left-leaning news media. Donald Jr. is the nicest of nice guys, genuinely authentic, the adviser said. A lot of us are disappointed that if it had to be somebody, why did it have to be Don Jr.?

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans said Tuesday they will seek to bring their healthcare overhaul to the Senate floor next week after a lengthy intraparty struggle, but it remained unclear whether they had the votes to pass the measure or even what form it would finally take.  With his reputation as a master strategist on the line, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid out a timetable for Senate consideration of legislation to fulfill President Donald Trumps campaign promise to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In a departure from Republican orthodoxy on tax-cutting, the legislation likely will retain some of the taxes that were imposed on the wealthy under Obamacare, Senate sources said. But it was unknown whether a revised version of the bill to be announced on Thursday morning can satisfy both moderates and hard-line conservatives in the Republican majority who voiced opposition to a draft unveiled last month on very different grounds. With Trump urging the Senate to act before taking the August break, McConnell pushed back the Senates planned August recess by two weeks to allow senators more time to tackle the measure that would repeal key parts of Obamacare, as well as pursue other legislative priorities. McConnells announcement drove a turn-around in stock prices in afternoon trading on Wall Street after an earlier sell-off, on hopes that a shortened recess could mean progress on the stalled Republican legislative agenda.  A dark mood lingered among some Republicans over the healthcare subject, with party leaders appearing to act because of the need to dispense with healthcare and turn to other issues, among them increasing the U.S. debt ceiling. I think weve narrowed down now to where we know where the decision points are, and we just have to make those decisions, Senator John Thune, a junior member of the Republican leadership, told reporters. Leaders were still trying to figure out how we get to 50 votes, he said. Republicans, who hold 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate, would need 50 votes to pass the bill, with Vice President Mike Pence providing the tie-breaking vote. I am very pessimistic about the prospects for Republican healthcare legislation, Chuck Grassley, a senior senator, told Fox News on Tuesday. Another Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, was working on his own healthcare proposal and will unveil it this week, a Graham aide said. McConnell said the plan was to vote on the healthcare bill next week, and said he hoped to have a fresh analysis of the bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office at the start of the week. He did not reveal any of the planned changes to the draft, on which he postponed action last month after it failed to gather enough support. But Senate sources said it is likely that two Obamacare taxes on the wealthy will be kept in place - a 3.8 percent net investment tax and a 0.9 percent payroll tax that helps finance Medicare - which would appeal to moderates who have balked at the prospect of cutting taxes for the wealthy while reducing benefits for the poor. Obviously thats the direction I think that a lot of our members want to move, is to keep some of those (taxes) in place and be able to use those revenues to put it into other places in the bill, Thune said, while stressing that no decisions were final. Republicans could also retain Obamacares limit on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry, one Senate source said. It was unclear whether the bill would include a proposal by conservative Republican Ted Cruz that would allow insurers to offer basic low-cost healthcare plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations. Cruz argues it would help to lower premiums, but critics say it would allow insurers to offer skimpier plans that may not cover essential health benefits while also charging more for more comprehensive, Obamacare-compliant plans. The Senate Republican healthcare bill unveiled last month would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal many of Obamacares taxes, end a penalty on individuals who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacares subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Democrats are united in opposition to the bill and at least 10 Republicans have said they oppose the existing draft. The House of Representatives passed its own version in May. Moderate Republicans are uneasy about the millions of people forecast to lose their medical insurance under the draft legislation, and hard-line conservatives say it leaves too much of Obamacare intact. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt the most vulnerable Americans. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is in the early stages of launching a debate about climate change that could air on television  challenging scientists to prove the widespread view that global warming is a serious threat, the head of the agency said. The move comes as the administration of President Donald Trump seeks to roll back a slew of Obama-era regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, and begins a withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement - a global pact to stem planetary warming through emissions cuts. There are lots of questions that have not been asked and answered (about climate change), EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told Reuters in an interview late on Monday.  Who better to do that than a group of scientists... getting together and having a robust discussion for all the world to see, he added without explaining how the scientists would be chosen. Asked if he thought the debate should be televised, Pruitt said: I think so. I think so. I mean, I dont know yet, but you want this to be open to the world. You want this to be on full display. I think the American people would be very interested in consuming that. I think they deserve it. Pruitt, one of the most controversial figures in the Trump administration, has repeatedly expressed doubts about climate change  one of the main points of contention in his narrow confirmation by the Senate.  While acknowledging the planet is warming, Pruitt says he questions the gravity of the problem and the need for regulations that require companies to take costly measures to reduce their carbon footprint. It is a question about how much we contribute to it. How do we measure that with precision? And by the way, are we on an unsustainable path? And is it causing an existential threat? he said in the interview. Since taking up his role at EPA, he has emerged as one of the more prolific Trump cabinet appointees, taking steps to undo more than two dozen regulations, and influencing Trumps decision to pull the United States from the Paris climate change deal, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015. Pruitt rejected global criticism of the United States for pulling out of the climate deal, which Trump has said would have cost America trillions of dollars without benefit. We have nothing to be apologetic about, Pruitt said. It was absolutely a decision of courage and fortitude and truly represented an America First strategy with respect to how we are leading on this issue. Pruitt said the United States had already cut its carbon output to the lowest levels in nearly 25 years without mandates, thanks mainly to increased use of natural gas - which burns cleaner than coal. Pruitt said his desire for the agency to host an ongoing climate change debate was inspired by two articles published in April  one in the Wall Street Journal by theoretical physicist Steve Koonin, who served as undersecretary of energy under Obama  and one by conservative columnist Brett Stephens in the New York Times.  Koonins article made the case that climate science should use the red team-blue team methodology used by the national security community to test assumptions. Stephens article criticized claims of complete certainty in climate science, saying that it traduces the spirit of science. Pruitt said scientists should not scoff at the idea of participating in these debates. If youre going to win and if youre so certain about it, come and do your deal. They shouldnt be scared of the debate and discussion, he said. Pruitt said debate is not necessarily aimed at undermining the 2009 endangerment finding, the scientific determination that carbon dioxide harms human health that formed the basis for the Democratic Obama administrations regulation of greenhouse gases. He said there may be a legal basis to challenge the finding but would prefer Congress weigh in on the matter. In the interview, Pruitt added that he intended to deal very aggressively with automakers that use devices to cheat emissions tests, and would also seek to boost accountability for companies to clean up polluted sites under the Superfund program.  He said EPA was also not ready to decide yet on a change proposed by Trumps special adviser Carl Icahn to the U.S. biofuels program, that would shift the burden of blending biofuels like ethanol into gasoline away from refiners to companies further down the supply chain.

"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt gave Reuters a wide-ranging interview on Monday at his office in Washington, discussing issues from climate science to automobile emissions.  The following is a full transcript of the interview: REUTERS: You have said the EPA will focus on a Back to Basics approach under your leadership. What does this mean for how EPA enforces polluters? You have been critical of the idea of regulation by enforcement. PRUITT: I think what Im speaking about there is a consent decree approach to enforcement, where you use judicial proceedings to actually engage in regulation. Enforcement should be about existing regulations that youre actually enforcing against someone who may be violating that, very much in the prosecutorial manner. As attorney general [in Oklahoma], I lived that. There was a grand jury that I led. Being a prosecutor, I understand very much the importance of prioritization, of enforcing the rule of law, of addressing bad actors. Thats something we are going to do in a meaningful way across the broad spectrum of cases, whether it is in the office of air or the superfund area, or otherwise. REUTERS: Do you want to see states play a bigger role in enforcing polluters, even though some have less of a capacity to do so  financially and personnel wise? PRUITT: I think the states role is really, when you look at this office working with states it should be how do we assist, how do we engage in compliance and assistance with states. The office [at EPA that deals with enforcement] is called OECA, the Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Assistance, so those are the tools we have in the tool box to achieve better outcomes. So what we ought to be doing is working proactively with state DEQs [Departments of Environmental Quality] to get their state implementation plans [for federal regulations] timely submitted, provide assistance and technical support, drive a draft of state implementation plans and then actually work with them on how to achieve through those plans better outcomes and air and water quality. As far as enforcement is concerned we will actually work with states. We actually did that recently with Colorado, there was an oil and gas company that was emitting some 3,000 tons, is that what it was, it was quite a bit, of it was an ozone case. In any event, we joined with Coloradoin that prosecution. So sometimes states will do it, sometimes we will join with them. The importance is, in my view, that with respect to achieving good environmental outcomes, you need to use all of the tools in the toolbox to achieve that  compliance, assistance and enforcement  and use that enforcement in a meaningful impactful way to ensure that actions are addressed in a timely way. REUTERS: Some of the pending settlements that are out there  Harley-Davidson for example  where do they stand? And would you look at some of these previous settlements that were reached during the last days of the Obama administration and revisit them? PRUITT: Well, Im not familiar with I dont know the latest on the Harley Davidson case My review predominantly has been with respect to the consent decrees that were being used to engage in regulation. There is a distinction there. I want to make sure Im saying that clearly. In one instance with respect to enforcement you have a regulation that has already been adopted and a standard that has to be met and a company that is not meeting the standard that was set by regulation. That is enforcement. This is what OECA should be working with the states to address. The part that has not been handled well over the past several years is the part where you have the EPA sued by third party, not an enforcement mechanism, but sued by an NGO, and that NGO is asking the court to compel this agency to take certain steps, either through change in statute or time lines set by statute and then the agency will acquiesce through a consent decree changing the very statutory framework. That is regulation through litigation and that is inconsistent with the authority in my view of this agency. That has nothing to do with enforcement. REUTERS: What are some examples that are egregious? PRUITT: There is a host of consent decrees that Ive inherited that we are evaluating on a case by case basis to see what authority we have to address those. But again, that is not enforcement that is completely under the banner of regulation by litigation. Let me say to you that it is important because Congress has said that as you engage in rulemaking you follow the administrative procedures act, which is you propose a rule, you take comment, you respond to that comment on the record, you make an informed decision and then you finalize the rule. The reason that is important is that is how you build consensus. That is how you hear from people at the state level. That is how you hear from states. That is how you hear from industry. All these various voices are heard in that process and you make a more robust and informed decision. And the merits of the rule, I think, are received better that way. And when you do it through one case, through litigation, and it is passed on to the rest of the country, voices are subverted in that process and it is not good decision-making.  REUTERS: With the cheat devises used by automakers to skirt EPA vehicle emission standards, did you think that some of those penalties were too harsh? PRUITT: Look, what VW and Fiat youve got this Fiat case that is on the horizon as well. The emails and the communications that Im aware of: it was strategic and intentional and should be dealt with very aggressively. They knew very, very well what they did. I wouldnt call what was done too light at all. Im fact, I would tell you that as we look forward what VW did was very, very troublesome and we need to make sure it doesnt happen again. REUTERS: Will you model EPA enforcement after what you did in Oklahoma as attorney general? PRUITT: It is a completely different role that I had as attorney general. In fact, as I said during my confirmation process, the AG is not the enforcement arm at the state level with respect to permitting. That is DEQ. The environmental unit that we set up in the previous administration was not set up to address enforcement. It was actually set up to address a nuisance claim that was filed against a company on poultry waste that we dealt with in other ways with the state of Arkansas. Long and short of it, the role that I have here is very different from the role. As it turned out we were not the front-line enforcer. It was the DEQ and the state regulatory bodies. Now we did provide assistance to them through general counsel, and they provided support and input to them. But as far as a standalone enforcement arm, that was handled by the individual agencies in the state of Oklahoma. Which is different than here [at EPA]. We have a robust, very important role of enforcement here. We are coordinating with the regions, making sure there is consistency across the regionsI tried to explain it during the confirmation hearing. Look at Superfund. People dont usually equate that with enforcement. Under the CERCLA statute [the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980] we have joint and several liability with respect to potential responsible parties, and a large percentage of our portfolio at the Superfund is through responsible parties, private funding. I think the agency has not done the best job historically at holding those private parties accountable for the amount of waste and remediation that needs to take place. We have tremendous authority. Im going to have a very thoughtful and meaningful enforcement response to Superfund to make sure that we are achieving good outcomes for citizens across the country with respect to that entire portfolio of 1,336 or so sites. Again, that is not often thought about in terms of enforcement. We think about air, we think about permitting, but we dont often think about remediation under CERCLA and I think we have got a lot of room for improvement and opportunity to get accountability in that area. Ive got a report on my desk that spent thirty or so days. Im doing the task force recommendations right now, on how to better achieve accountability from enforcement across the board. REUTERS: But the administrations proposed budget for FY2018 proposes severe budget cuts across the board, including to Superfund  PRUITT: But there arent. There arent budget cuts across the board. We have a Continuing Resolution until the end of April that funded us around $8 billion or so, and Congress is going through that process with respect to what the funding levels are going to be on Superfund. So the fact that we have a proposed budget Congress is having that discussion and there havent been any budget cuts taking place at this point and were working with Congress to make sure that there is adequate funding to address both the enforcement side and the Superfund side. REUTERS: When you saw the presidents budget proposal which called for a 31 percent cut to the EPA budget, did it worry you? PRUITT: I think there are certain parts of the agency that there is room for true legitimate cuts, and there are other parts of the agency where that is not the case - as it is in every department. But to take something like Superfund and say that whatever the proposed budget was means that we cant do what we need to do as far as our reform and accountability is just simply not accurate. Most of the challenges Ive seen from the Superfund program have been related to attitude management leadership and less about money. But as I told Congress during the budget and nomination process, if I determine that we need more moneys there, well ask Congress, because thats the priority. Enforcement and Superfund are included in that category. When youre funding [inaudible] million dollars youve got room to cut. But I can tell you this, the core mission of the agency  improving air and water quality, addressing remediation as far as the superfund sites  those types of priorities  REUTERS: There have been reports about the EPA launching what has been called a red team-blue team review of climate change science. Can you tell us more about this? Will this lead to a re-evaluation of the 2009 endangerment finding that carbon dioxide endangers human health? PRUITT: Im thinking about it. Steve Koonin, professor at NYU, did a very exciting piece in the Wall Street Journal called Red Team Blue Team. I scheduled time with Steve in my office the week that article came out. I didnt know it was coming out So Steve and I were meeting about some other things, and we didnt really focus on that, but I took the opportunity to talk to him about it and  were considering it. I think the American people deserve and honest, open, transparent discussion. What do we know? What dont we know? Does it pose an existential threat, what can be done about it? etc There are lots of questions that have not been asked and answered. Who better to do that than a group of scientists? Red team scientists and blue team scientists getting together and having a robust discussion about that for all the world to see. So, Im not a scientist, Im an attorney. That does beg the question because there is a follow-up question to that, which is what can be done about it [climate change] that is statutory and legal? But as Ive shared with senators in the confirmation process, Congress has never responded to this issue. If you ask people that amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, including [former Michigan Democratic] Congressman Dingle, he is endlessly quoted as saying that if you try to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act of 1990 that it would create a glorious mess. So the Clean Air Act was truly set up to address local and regional air pollutants. So, you hear often about the regulation of GHG and CO2, but there has to be a determination of what can be done. What are the tools in the toolbox? If the tools are not in the toolbox to address this issue, I cant, and this agency cant, just simply make it up. We cant re-imagine authority. The past administration tried to do that with its Clean Power Plan. It was extraordinary what the Supreme Court did [in its 2014 ruling on the Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA case. The court backed the EPAs ability to regulate greenhouse gases from mobile and stationary sources but threw out its tailoring rule, which revised the statutory thresholds for requiring federal air permits for greenhouse gases.] It said a lot. It said the authority the previous administration was trying to say that they had in regulating carbon dioxide wasnt there. So there are two parts to this question: what do we know/what dont we know? And two, what is the responsethe statutory response? The red team blue team is intended to be a response that provides answers to the American people the American people deserve, in my view, an open transparent honest discussion about this issue. So we are contemplating being a part of that process. REUTERS: The consensus has been overwhelming that climate change has been caused by human beings PRUITT: Thats not the question. It is not a question about whether the climate is warming. It is not a question about whether human activity contributes to it. It is a question about how much we contribute to it? How do we measure that with precision? And by the way, are we on an unsustainable path? And what harm...is it causing an existential threat? There is another great piece in the New York Times by Brett Stephens, I think it was, that talked about the climate of complete certainty. His whole premise is that there is a basis of consensus we know but the politicians have done what? Created an elasticity approach. Theyve stretched it so far that its reached a point where the credibility is being strained. That article, along with the red-team blue-team, I think those book-end this approach where we have a discussion about that. Some of the blue team scientists  they say oh we are not going to participate in that. Why not? Why dont you want to participate? Its like the New York Yankees according to them. Its like the New York Yankees playing a Little League team. If youre going to win and if youre so certain about it, come and do your deal. They shouldnt be scared of the debate and discussion. Thats what science is all about. Thats what scientific debate is about. Lets get red team scientists in. Lets get blue team scientists in. Lets let them question one another. That would be exciting to see. REUTERS: But what would it look like? PRUITT: Its in its formative stages. The idea is a good idea because its an idea that advances science. It advances discussion. It advances transparency. It advances for the American people to consume and participate through this debate because there is not consensus on this issue. How do we know that? There has been no policy response. Thats why we havent seen Congress act because there has been such a question. Its not a question about whether warming is happening or whether we are contributing to it. Thats not what we are debating. Its how much? To what degree? The precision of measurement. Does it pose a meaningful threat? Is it unsustainable? There is a host of questions that will be asked and answered during the process. Its exciting.  REUTERS: But how would this be brought to the public? Would you put it on television? PRUITT:I think so. I think so. I mean, I dont know yet, but you want this to be open to the world. You want this to be on full display. I think the American people would be very interested in consuming that. I think they deserve it. REUTERS: How do you guarantee the objectivity of scientists? Make sure there are no conflicts of interest? PRUITT: Thats why the red team blue team matters. Steve modeled this after national security and defense [exercises] - they kind of check one another. There is a consumption, an evaluation and interpretation. They will check one another.  REUTERS: Congress hasnt legislated on the endangerment finding. Will this scientific review lead to a review of the endangerment finding? PRUITT: You have the 2007 Massachusetts vs. EPA ruling which most people misinterpret. Mass vs. EPA didnt say to the EPA that you must regulate CO2. What Mass vs. EPA said is that you must make a decision whether you regulate or not. You cant just simply not make a decision. That was whole thing about Mass vs. EPA. And then what happened in post script. What happened post script was in 2009 with the endangerment finding but that was for mobile sources. Thats another thing that important. The endangerment funding was focused on mobile sources cars  and section 111 [of the Clean Air Act] what the [Obama administration] Clean Power Plan dealt with  was stationary sources. And they are separate requirements under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. There are a lot of process/ legal-related issues here that the previous administration didnt comply with. But the endangerment finding is only on the mobile side. When I say Congress hasnt responded, youve had a court case and an endangerment finding and then youve had an agency engage in regulatory response  by the way using tools currently in the Clean Air Act  and failed twice. They tried to respond to the endangerment finding by regulating under section 111 and failed and failed with the UARG decision (with the tailoring rule). So the question is begged  what are the tools in the toolbox? I talked about that in my confirmation hearing. Ive talked about that with individual senators. Its something that Congress has to ask and answer. We have no authority except that which Congress gives us. We cant just simply make it up. The previous administration made it up with WOTUS [the Waters of the United States act]. They re-imagined authority in defining the Waters of the United States to include things that included dry creek beds and puddles. It just went too far and the sixth circuit struck that down or put a stay in place and did the same with CO2. This Supreme Court has been very, very clear that this agency, like any other agency in the federal government, cant simply re-imagine authority and a large authority beyond the statutory text. The scientific review  the red team blue team discussion  is intended to have an open transparent debate about something that is a policy issue that is extremely important in this country that is not taking place. The endangerment finding in 2009 was based on IPCC [United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] information not on the science of this agency. The red team blue team is intended to provide that type of vehicle, mechanism, to have an open debate, discussion. REUTERS: So you might take a look at the endangerment finding? PRUITT: Thats not what this is about. What this is about is exactly what I described. REUTERS: Lets move on to the California waiver, which allows California to set its own more stringent emissions standards for vehicles. Is that something the EPA will review or change? PRUITT: Its not under review right now. REUTERS: Will you review it in the future? PRUITT: The governor of California and I have traded correspondence with respect to Californias role  very important. Congress has recognized it. They were regulating air quality before the Clean Air Act was adopted in 1972, which is why the California waiver exists. Weve reached out to the California governor as part of our CAFE midterm review in 2018. Im hopeful that the state of California, the governor there, will respond with reciprocity and we are working through that process. REUTERS: Are there any meetings taking place now with automakers? PRUITT: I dont know what conversations have taken place between automakers and California. The president and I were in Detroit announcing that the midterm review was going to take place when it should have taken place which is April of 2018, which is 16 months early, which occurred January this year. We restored process there and order there. Were going through the process now and weve reached out to California and believe that it is important to have a holistic discussion with California and were optimistic that they will respond with reciprocity. REUTERS: On the Renewable Fuel Standard- How seriously is the EPA taking the proposal by Trump advisor and billionaire investor Carl Icahn to move the point of obligation? PRUITT: As you know, 18,000 comments were submitted. That was actually the process that began late in the last administration. We are still reviewing those comments. But the RFS is something  look, its a statute that Congress has passed. And Congress  I take seriously the importance of enforcing a statute that Congress has passed and there are some challenges to that statute as you know. there are targets that have been put in prescriptively in the statute such as billions of gallons of cellulosic being blended into the fuel supply when I think the last numbers we had as far as produced numbers are around 190 million thats actually production. Thats a problem and it makes it tough administering the statute. I think whatever waiver authority we use we use it judiciously. Tied to production and actual market demand. Our job is to fulfill the objectives as best as possible of the statute and were going to do that. The RVOs [renewable volume obligations] were supposed to be published every year in November. The past administration didnt do that timely. We are. We are going to have those out in November. Were on path to do that which is very good for people across the country to know what is expected of them. Thats going to be done timely. We just released our proposed volume numbers and the preamble and in the language of the RVOs we talked about production demand market realities with respect to those advanced fuels. We are seeking to do our job there in a very meaningful way. There is a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about the statute and perhaps a bipartisan approach to update the statute because it actually expires in 2022 and so theres a lot of discussion about trying to update the statute. Its well received here and I encourage Congress to continue that. REUTERS: What is your strategy with your legal defense of your moves to undo the Obama era rules? The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last week denied your bid to delay the Obama administrations regulations on methane. PRUITT: There are various authorities. That (methane case) was a case about our authority to stay certain rules. Thats distinct from withdrawing rules. On WOTUS [the Waters of the United States rule] weve actually proposed a withdrawal. I signed that on June 27 on energy dominance week. I think that our section 307 stay that we used there was because we were up against the compliance time and try to use authority that we thought was well established. We are going to respond to that accordingly. But going forward I think it was a case focused on the facts of that particular case. I dont think it says anything to us with respect to authority we have to stay under section 705 of the administrative procedures act or section 307 of the Clean Air Act. Those are well established procedures we have. We will use them accordingly as necessary. Thats what we are doing on the Clean Power Plan. We have a proposed rule to withdraw the CPP. What comes next is yet to be determined but what we do know with regards to that particular rule is that SCOTUS has issued a stay against it which means there is a likelihood of success on the merits as far as it being inconsistent with statutory authority and so its not wise of this agency to use resources to advance the defense of a rule that maybe deficient. We are going to withdraw that and see what our authority is- the tools in the toolbox on that particular issue. REUTERS: On Paris and climate change, polls show younger people are more supportive of U.S leadership on climate change. How do you explain your decision to a younger generation? PRUITT: Thats not what Paris was about. I get what youre saying but heres the deal though. It was not about whether the U.S. is going to continue leading on reducing our CO2 footprint because Paris didnt actually do that. Paris was a bumper sticker. Go back and read the articles about the criticism that was levied on the environmental left. They were very critical and dismissive of the Paris agreement. You know why? Because China didnt have to do anything until 2030 and India conditioned all of their obligations upon receiving two and a half trillion dollars of aid. Russia, India and China contributed 0 dollars to the Green Climate Fund. People have short memories there. We are already at pre 94 levels and we exited Kyoto in 2001 and from 2000 to 2014 we reduced our CO2 foot print by 18 plus percent. Thats better than others across the globe. When people really want action and meaningful outcomes with regards to this, we are doing it. We are at pre-1994 levels. Paris was not in my view  it shouldnt be symbolic or optical with respect to whether progress or no progress is being made in CO2 reduction. REUTERS: What do you think about the argument some major fossil fuel companies like Exxon and Cloud Peak Energy (coal company) made that it is better for the US to remain in the Paris agreement because it gives them a competitive advantage? I dont understand that argument. I just simply dont understand that argument because if they are saying that the technology that is being developed domestically that we are not going to be able to export and other countries will be interested in? Where is the evidence of that? China is still building coal facilities to the tune of almost one a day. They had 800 planned and they have scaled that back. India is going to continue burning coal. What we ought to be doing is exporting technology and innovation to help them do it cleaner. It is not the job of this agency and it shouldnt be the job of any regulatory body to force or pick winners and losers in the energy mix. We need fuel diversity as far as the generation of electricity because you can only get so much natural gas through the pipelines. So if there is an attack on your infrastructure with regards to the pipes and how natural gas is delivered to generate electricity, what do you do? You have to have a solid amount of hydrocarbons  coal stored on site  that allows you to address peak demand. If GDP growth is going to continue at 3 percent, then youve got to have [fuel] diversity- its energy security across the board. Its unwise in business to have one client or two clients. Its unwise in electricity to have one source or two sources. In Oklahoma  18 percent of our electricity is wind generated. This is an all of the above approach and EPA should not get in the business of foisting upon the markets decisions to say dont burn fossil fuels. The past administration was unapologetic. Thats not what regulation should be about. Now Paris? Paris was a bad business deal for this country at the end of the day. It put us at an economic disadvantage. The US has never been about agreeing to targets. In this case, 26 - 28 percent [**the U.S. pledge for emissions reductions under the Paris agreement] in this instance. Every rule that the previous administration adoptedTheir entire climate action plan  fell 40 percent short. It was failed from the very beginning. So why did they go to Paris and agree to 26-28 percent targets? Because it provided exposure domestically. Third party groups  NGOs  could sue this agency and say you need to do more under section 115 of the Clean Air Act [a section of the CAA that enables the United States to work cooperatively with other nations to address trans-boundary air pollution]. So there was legal exposure and we were already leading the world with respect to CO2 reduction. To interpret the president  who said by the way engagement, renegotiate or another agreement  but the Paris agreement is bad for this country and doesnt achieve good environmental outcomes. We have nothing to be apologetic about with regards to what we are already going. It was absolutely a decision of courage and fortitude and truly represented an America First strategy with respect to how we are leading on this issue. Germany is burning more coal. REUTERS: Didnt the US position on Paris isolate the United States at G20? PRUITT: The past administration was all about words. This administration is all about action. Look at the actions this country has taken. We have reduced our greenhouse gas levels to pre 1994 levels primarily through technology and innovation, not through government mandate. We have nothing to be apologetic about with the rest of the world. And if we really want to do something about reducing the CO2 footprint, then hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling need to be exported to China and India and Europe because that has created the greatest reduction in CO2. And nuclear. Why is Germany going away from nuclear? They are abolishing their nuclear portfolio and increasing what? Their CO2 emissions. Why doesnt anyone talk to chancellor Merkel about that? REUTERS: Do you ever talk to your kids about climate change? Do they agree with you? PRUITT: My kids are wonderfully talented individuals and their world view is wonderful. They look at these issues in a smart way and I think they would probably echo the things that I have shared. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The meeting between U.S. President Donald Trumps son and a Russian attorney, and the failure to disclose it, add new urgency to the push to pass a Russian sanctions bill that has been stalled in Congress, lawmakers and aides said on Tuesday. What happened with Donald Trump Jr. just underscores how Russia was operating, said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin said the bill should have been passed because of Russian interference in last years U.S. elections, occupation of parts of Ukraine and Georgia and support of the Syrian government. The Senate backed the sanctions legislation by 98-2 on June 15 but it has been stuck in the House of Representatives, amid partisan squabbling between Republicans and Democrats. Trumps relationship with Russia has been in particularly sharp focus this month because he had his first meeting last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some Democrats had accused Trumps fellow Republicans of stalling the sanctions package at least until after that meeting, to please the president. Republicans denied that. House Republican leaders initially rejected the bill for procedural reasons, prompting the Senate to tweak it. But Democrats then objected to a change by the Senate that they said weakened the bill by making it more difficult for the House to vote on any change in sanctions policy by Trump. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Democrats still were objecting to moving the bill in its current form. But both Republican and Democratic House aides said talks between the two parties were continuing and there was a decent chance for a quick compromise, more so because of the latest revelations about Trumps eldest son. Donald Trump Jr. eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he believed was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton, as part of Moscows official support for his father, according to emails released on Tuesday. It certainly does not help the administration at this point, a senior Republican House aide said. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, predicted that the matter would be cleared up quickly and brought to the floor for a vote this week. The Russia package, written as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, puts into law sanctions previously established through presidential executive order, including some on Russian energy projects and debt financing. It also imposes sanctions on Russians convicted of human rights abuses or cyber attacks and would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. Trump administration officials have been meeting with lawmakers to argue against some parts of the bill, including the requirement that Trump obtain Congress permission before easing any sanctions. They also objected to the fact that many of the sanctions are mandatory, meaning Trump could not waive them for national security reasons. This is more about foreign policy and having the flexibility to negotiate with other countries, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a daily briefing. But many of Trumps fellow Republicans said they wanted to move ahead nonetheless to send a strong message to Russia. Any administration would prefer to conduct foreign policy 100 percent without involvement by Congress. Thats just the way life is, said Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will introduce his own Russia sanctions legislation in the House if the Senate bill remains stalled, a source familiar with his thinking said. Royces thinking was first reported by Politico. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday removed Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab from two lists of approved vendors used by government agencies to purchase technology equipment, amid concerns the cyber security firms products could be used by the Kremlin to gain entry into U.S. networks. The delisting represents the most concrete action taken against Kaspersky following months of mounting suspicion among intelligence officials and lawmakers that the company may be too closely connected to hostile Russian intelligence agencies accused of cyber attacks on the United States. Kaspersky products have been removed from the U.S. General Services Administrations list of vendors for contracts that cover information technology services and digital photographic equipment, an agency spokeswoman said in a statement. The action was taken after review and careful consideration, the spokeswoman said, adding that GSAs priorities are to ensure the integrity and security of U.S. government systems and networks. Government agencies will still be able to use Kaspersky products purchased separate from the GSA contract process. Kasperskys anti-virus software is popular in the United States and around the world, and the firm has been a leading player in the cyber security market for decades.  In a statement, Kaspersky Lab said it had not received any updates from GSA or any other U.S. government agency regarding its vendor status. Kaspersky Lab has no ties to any government, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts, the company said. It added that it had been caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight where each side is attempting to use the company as a pawn in their political game.  The delisting was done the same day that ABC News reported the Trump administration was considering implementing a broader ban that would block agencies from using Kaspersky software. Last month the Senate Armed Services Committee passed a defense spending policy bill that would ban Kaspersky products from use in the military. The move came a day after the FBI interviewed several of the companys U.S. employees at their private homes as part of a counterintelligence investigation into its operations. In May senior U.S. intelligence officials said in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee that they were reviewing government use of software from Kaspersky Lab. Lawmakers raised concerns that Moscow might use the firms products to attack American computer networks, a particularly sensitive issue given allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked and leaked emails of Democratic Party political groups to interfere in the 2016 presidential election campaign. Russia denies the allegations. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is increasingly unlikely to nominate Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen next year for a second term, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is the leading candidate to succeed her, Politico reported on Tuesday, citing four people close to the process. Politico said sources in the White House, the Treasury Department and on Capitol Hill said that if Cohn decides he wants the job, he is likely to get it. Its Garys if he wants it, and I think he wants it, Politico quoted one Republican whom it said was close to the selection process as saying. A few Senate Republicans may express reservations about Cohn but he would probably receive widespread support, a senior congressional Republican aide said, according to Politico.  In response to a query from Reuters, White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said: Gary is focused on his responsibilities at the NEC.  Cohn, a Democrat and former Goldman Sachs president, did not work on Trumps campaign and only got to know him after the November election. Yellen took over from Ben Bernanke as Fed chair in February 2014 with the U.S. economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis still on shaky ground. She has made no secret she puts a priority on growth in jobs and wages and a broad recovery in U.S. household wealth. Yellen begins two days of congressional testimony on Wednesday on the Feds semi-annual report on the state of the U.S. economy. Under her leadership the Fed has pared the massive stimulus it put in place to counteract the 2007-2009 financial crisis and begun raising interest rates. Later this year Yellen expects to begin trimming the Feds $4.5 trillion balance sheet in a gradual and predictable manner.  I do think the Feds trying to set a course toward normalization that wont be knocked out by a new Fed chair, said Eric Stein, co-director of global income at Eaton Vance. Still, Cohn would be a very different kind of leader than Yellen or her immediate predecessor, Ben Bernanke, both of whom hold doctorates in economics.  Cohn began his career at Goldman as a commodities trader in 1990.  He has more knowledge of financial markets than almost any Fed chair would have and less of a monetary policy background, Stein said.  During last years election campaign, Trump accused Yellen of accepting orders from then-President Barack Obama to keep interest rates low for political reasons, and he said he would replace her as Fed chair because she is not a Republican Party member. But in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in April, Trump said Yellen was not toast and that he respected her. A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the Politico story.  Yellen has said she plans to serve out her full four-year term as chair, which runs through Feb. 3.  Cohn would join several other Goldman alumni around the Fed policymaking table, including New York Fed President William Dudley, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans lawmakers on Tuesday started trying to kill a brand-new U.S. rule prohibiting banks and credit card companies from requiring customers who open new accounts to sign an agreement that they will not join a group lawsuit in the event of a dispute. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Monday finalized the new rule banning mandatory arbitration clauses requiring consumers to forego class-action suits and instead settle disputes in negotiations overseen by arbitrators frequently hired by companies. The rule immediately ran into fierce opposition by Wall Street and Republicans who control both Congress and the White House. They have long criticized the consumer agency, which is run by a Democrat, Richard Cordray. Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Banking Committee, has already announced he is drafting a resolution to kill the rule. His fellow Republican Senator Pat Toomey, chair of the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, said he is considering a similar step.  Republican lawmakers plan to eliminate the rule, using a law that allows Congress to undo new regulations with simple majority votes in both chambers and a signature from the president. Analysts and consumer advocates have said the agencys rule may survive the Congressional challenge. Still, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is contemplating a legal challenge and Trump administration officials are also looking at ways to kill the rule. Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst for the investment firm Compass Point Research & Trading, said the rule has a slightly better than 50 percent chance of surviving in Congress. Joe Valenti, who tracks the issue for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said the House of Representatives was unified against the rule, which opponents have argued benefits class-action lawyers, not consumers. It comes down to the Senate, said Valenti, noting that the rule would survive if only three Republicans in that chamber switched sides. That is possible, said Ed Mierzwinksi, the consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups. He noted that Senate Republicans have struggled to gather enough votes for majorities and the calendar is swollen with pressing legislation and confirmation hearings. In addition, Mierzwinksi said, senators may be leery of appearing to side with Wall Street against consumers. He noted that Wells Fargo & Co used clauses in its account-opening agreements to block customers from suing over its phantom account scandal. Supporters of the rule say mandatory arbitration denies citizens their day in court and is rigged in favor of big firms. They say litigants banding together in a class-action lawsuit have a better chance of getting companies to answer publicly for illegal activities and that fears of such a suit can discourage law breaking. The consumer protection agency wrote the rule after conducting a lengthy, multi-year study of the issue. Opponents of the rule say the study is flawed and that arbitration is cheaper and faster than class-action lawsuits and produces better awards for consumers. The Chamber is exploring a prompt legal challenge to the rule, said Matt Webb, senior vice president for its legal reform institute. Another possible challenge could come from the acting comptroller of the currency, Keith Noreika. He is laying groundwork to invoke an untested provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law that allows the council of the countrys top financial regulators to nullify a consumer agency rule if they decide it threatens the safety and soundness of the banking system. Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and former CFPB assistant director, said a lawsuit will probably fail because the law says the agency can restrict arbitration as long as it hews to its study.  He said the Dodd-Frank provision that the comptrollers office is looking at was meant to keep risks to the financial system at bay.  To suggest that this rule would cause a financial crisis is ridiculous on its face, he said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

David Wildstein, who helped the government convict two former Christie associates after he pleaded guilty in 2015, is set to be sentenced in federal court in Newark on Wednesday. Wildstein, 55, admitted overseeing a scheme to shut down access lanes at the busy George Washington Bridge in 2013 to create massive traffic gridlock as punishment for a local Democratic mayor who refused to endorse Christies reelection campaign. U.S. prosecutors charged Wildstein, former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and a former executive of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Bill Baroni, with concocting the plot. The Port Authority supervises operations for the George Washington Bridge, which connects Manhattan and New Jersey and is one of the worlds busiest crossings.     Christie, who has denied any involvement, was not charged. But the fallout dogged his bid for the Republican nomination for president in 2016 and has contributed to his current record-low approval rating of 15 percent in New Jersey. Wildstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2015 and agreed to cooperate with authorities, eventually appearing as the star witness at Kelly and Baronis trial for eight days of testimony. Put simply, were it not for Wildsteins decision to cooperate and disclose the true nature of the lane reductions, there likely would have been no prosecutions related to the bridge scheme, U.S. prosecutors wrote in arguing that Wildstein should receive probation but no prison time. Kelly and Baroni were sentenced to 1-1/2 and two years in prison, respectively. Wildstein testified at trial that he and Baroni joked with Christie about the traffic jams caused by the lane closures as they were occurring, an assertion that Christie and Baroni both denied. He also told jurors that he and Baroni used the Port Authority as a goody bag to dole out favors to local officials in exchange for support for Christies re-election. In a court submission made public on Tuesday, Wildsteins lawyer also requested probation, noting that Wildstein voluntarily met with investigators at the start of their probe. Mr. Wildstein remains alone in taking responsibility for his role in the George Washington Bridge lane realignment issue, even though others were clearly involved, Alan Zegas wrote.

With only three weeks left before a summer recess scheduled to stretch until Sept. 5, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared determined to keep trying to find agreement on a partisan, all-Republican bill. If he cannot, he will be faced with giving up on a seven-year Republican promise to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare - and possibly turning to Democrats for help in fixing problems with U.S. health insurance markets. The Republican legislation would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacares taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacares subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Since the start of 2017, when they took control of the White House, Republicans who also control Congress have been struggling over how to replace former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature legislation - which they see as  government intrusion - with less comprehensive federal healthcare provisions. Conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz favors offering a choice of cheaper healthcare plans that would not have to meet minimum standards established by Obamacare, such as coverage for maternity care and prescription drugs. Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins dismissed that approach on Monday, telling reporters: I believe that it would cause further destabilization of the individual (insurance) market, it would erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions and cause premiums to rise. Earlier on Monday, Trump used Twitter to prod Republican senators to pass a bill, and senior lawmakers, including the Senates No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, said legislation could advance to votes next week in the deeply divided chamber.  I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go! tweeted Trump, who made repealing and replacing Obamacare a central pledge of his 2016 campaign. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved its healthcare bill in May, knowing the Senate would amend it. Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told reporters he was worried about how rural hospitals would be treated in the Senate bill, which is being assembled in secret. He said lawmakers were awaiting an assessment of a retooled Senate bill from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office before making decisions. Senior Republican Orrin Hatch said he did not yet know whether the minimum 50 Republican senators would come together on a bill, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the potential tiebreaking vote. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote to McConnell urging a bipartisan effort to stabilize the health insurance market, noting that McConnell had been quoted recently as saying Congress would need to shore up that market if lawmakers fail to repeal Obamacare. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued data on Monday showing a 38 percent decrease in applications by insurers to sell health plans in the Obamacare individual market in 2018 compared with this year. Scores of protesters voiced opposition to the legislation outside Republican National Committee headquarters and at the offices of some Republican lawmakers, chanting slogans including Trumpcare kills and Healthcare is a human right.  U.S. Capitol Police said 80 people were arrested. (For a graphic on who's covered under Medicaid, click bit.ly/2u3O2Mu) ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The emails, released by Donald Trump Jr., are the most concrete evidence yet that Trump campaign officials welcomed Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trumps presidency and spurred investigations by the Justice Department and Congress. The messages show that the younger Trump was open to the prospect of very high level and sensitive information from a Russian attorney that a go-between described as part of Russia and its governments support for Mr. Trump ahead of a meeting on June 9, 2016.  \""If it's what you say I love it,\"" Trump Jr. responded. He released the messages on Twitter after the New York Times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him. (bit.ly/2uapeCK and bit.ly/2ua9hwg)     In an interview with Fox News, Trump Jr. said that Trumps campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who denies having Kremlin ties. He said Veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about Clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss Russian sanctions. In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently, he said. For me, this was opposition research. Nevertheless, the correspondence between him and Rob Goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for U.S. investigators probing whether Trumps campaign colluded with the Kremlin. The crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father, Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. on June 3. Russia does not have a crown prosecutor - the equivalent title is prosecutor general. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from Democratic Party officials. The conversation will now turn to whether President Trump was personally involved or not. But the question of the campaigns involvement appears settled now, Cornell Law School professor Jens David Ohlin said in an interview. The answer is yes.  Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Trump Jr. said he did not tell his father about the meeting. He said he may have since had contact with other Russians. Ive probably met with other people from Russia, but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything, he said on Fox News. The news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administrations economic agenda. Stocks and the dollar fell, while U.S. Treasury securities gained ground. Stocks later retraced most of their losses after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to keep lawmakers in Washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare. Along with his younger brother Eric, Trump Jr. oversees the Trump Organization, his fathers real-estate and business empire, and does not have a formal role in the White House. My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency, Trump said in a statement. The White House referred questions to lawyers for Trump and his son. The emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities. He is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents, according to a Senate source, while the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting, said the panels top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff. The American people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the Russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family, Schiff told reporters. On Fox News, Trump Jr. said he was more than happy to cooperate with everyone. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, asked the Trump administration how Veselnitskaya was able to enter the United States even though her authorization had expired. CNN reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, also planned to look into the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence, who has said the campaign had no contacts with Russia, said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting, held before he became Trumps running mate later that summer. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is at times harshly critical of Trump, told reporters: This is very problematic.

Citing three people with knowledge of the email, the paper said publicist Rob Goldstone indicated in the message to U.S. President Donald Trumps eldest son that the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information. Trump Jr did not indicate in a statement on Sunday that he had been told the lawyer might be a proxy for the Kremlin. The email is likely to be of interest to investigators examining whether any Trump associates colluded with the Russian government to sway last years election, the Times said. Trump Jr. hired a lawyer on Monday to represent him in the Russia-related investigations as prominent Republicans voiced concern about the meeting between the presidents son and a Russian. Allegations of the Trump campaigns ties to Russia have cast a shadow over the Republican presidents first months in office and sparked investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel, Robert Mueller, into whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with the Trump campaign.  Moscow denies interfering and Trump, who became president on Jan. 20, says there was no collusion. Its a very serious development, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC of the Times report. It all warrants thorough investigation. Everyone who was in that meeting ought to come before our committee. Trump Jr. hired New York lawyer Alan Futerfas, who specializes in criminal defense and whose clients have included alleged organized crime figures, a Russian computer hacker and white-collar criminals. I look forward to assisting Donald Jr. and, quite frankly, there is nothing to all of the media buzz about the June 9th, 2016 meeting, Futerfas told Reuters. That will be proven to be the case. Futerfas would not say when he was retained or whether he played any part in the statements Trump Jr. made during the weekend about his June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, during the presidential election campaign. Trump Jr. said he agreed to meet Veselnitskaya, described by the New York Times as having links to the Kremlin, after being promised damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.     Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Trumps then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also attended, the Times said. It called the encounter the first confirmed private meeting of members of Donald Trumps inner circle with a Russian national during the campaign. A Republican member of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Susan Collins, called on Trump Jr. to testify before the panel, which is looking into accusations of Russian meddling in the election. Our intelligence committee needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting, she told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, said it absolutely wanted to speak to Trump Jr. about the meeting. Warner said he and the Republican committee chairman, Richard Burr, would decide later whether to ask Trump Jr. to testify in public or in a classified setting. Burr would not say if the committee would talk to Trump Jr., but he told reporters the panel would look into the purpose of the meeting, who set it up and how the process unfolded before making a decision on who to interview. The committee will see everybody we think has value, Burr said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said there was nothing inappropriate about the meeting with lawyer Veselnitskaya. Don Junior took a very short meeting from which there was absolutely no follow-up, Sanders told reporters. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday the Kremlin did not know the identity of the Russian lawyer. No, we dont know who it is and, certainly, we cannot track down all movements of all Russian lawyers both within Russia and abroad, Peskov said.                    Goldstone said he arranged the meeting at the request of singer and businessman Emin Agalarov, a Moscow-based client of his.

John Moscow, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, described Futerfas as a top-flight lawyer who is both high-powered and low-key. Here are some facts about Futerfas: He became a top mob defense lawyer early on Miami-born Futerfas joined the law firm of veteran criminal defense lawyer Gerald Shargel after graduating from Yeshiva Universitys Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York in 1987, and quickly became a partner. He left to form his own firm in 1994. In one of his biggest cases from that period, Futerfas won a new trial in 1997 for mob captain Anthony Russo after it was revealed that a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent may have  leaked information to fuel an organized crime war in the early 1990s. He expanded into white-collar cases Futerfas encountered Moscow in the early 2000s case against former Tyco International chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski. Futerfas represented Christine Berry, Kozlowskis art consultant, in the sales tax avoidance investigation that led to the larger case over Kozlowskis corporate looting. In 2010, he represented hedge fund group HFV Management in connection with a wide-ranging probe by the New York attorney generals office into corruption in the states pension fund.  He has also handled cybercrime cases Futerfas is defending Ziv Orenstein, one of three Israelis charged by federal prosecutors with hacking into JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and the Wall Street Journal (NWSA.O), among other rtargets, as part of a massive pump and dump scheme. Orenstein pleaded not guilty.  Another client of Futerfas was Nikita Kuzmin, a Russian national who agreed last year to pay $6.9 million for creating computer malware that made users bank accounts vulnerable to cyber criminals. He worked one summer for a longtime lawyer to Donald Trump In the summer of 1985, while he was in law school, Futerfas worked for lawyer Jay Goldberg, who went on to become Trumps divorce lawyer.  Futerfas said he did not come to Trump Jr. through Goldberg. He studied at Juilliard Futerfas earned his undergraduate degree from the prestigious performing arts school.

The legislative action comes as major automakers are joining forces with auto suppliers and other groups to prod Congress into action. Last month, a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a Republican draft package of 14 bills that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the committee, said on Monday it was likely that legislation would be introduced this week and a formal hearing on the bills would occur next week.  Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta said last month he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. The draft measures would bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from pre-approving self-driving car technologies. Democrats say the NHTSA must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, and the Association of Global Automakers, representing major foreign automakers including Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Corp (005380.KS), are forming the Coalition for Future Mobility to press Congress to act.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattles city council unanimously passed a pioneering income tax on the citys highest earners on Monday, a measure that has become a clarion call for Democrats there even though it is likely to face a swift legal challenge over violating state law. The measure created a 2.25 percent tax rate on individuals earning above $250,000 and married couples jointly earning above $500,000. The tax will add roughly $140 million in new annual revenue and affect fewer than 20,000 residents in the city of more than 660,000, supporters say. The proposal has become a rallying cry for Democrats and activists in the liberal-leaning city who used local opposition to Republican President Donald Trump to advance long sought-after local policies. Washington is one of seven U.S. states without a tax on personal income, and no city in the state has an income tax. Supporters of the Seattle proposal, including Mayor Ed Murray, say the current tax code unfairly burdens poor and middle class residents because it relies on regressive taxes, such as taxes on property and sales transactions. Proponents say new revenue is needed to offset any potential drop in federal funding under the Trump administration. Our goal is to replace our regressive tax system with a new formula for fairness, while ensuring Seattle stands up to President Trumps austere budget that cuts transportation, affordable housing, healthcare, and social services, Murray said by e-mail after the city councils 9-0 vote. Earlier on Monday, Murray told a cheering crowd at a rally outside city hall he would sign the measure into law on Friday and welcomed a legal challenge. The campaign for the new tax on Seattles richest was launched earlier this year by Trump Proof Seattle, a coalition of community activists and residents. Proceeds from the tax could be used to pay for transit services and affordable housing, Murray said. The city has been grappling with soaring housing prices in recent years, fueled in part by the growth of online retailer Amazon.com, which is headquartered in downtown Seattle. Voters in Olympia, the state capital, rejected a similar tax on its highest earners last year. In 2010, Washington state voters rejected a state income tax at the ballot box. Jason Mercier, a director at the conservative Washington Policy Center, said Seattles tax conflicts with state law and court decisions. He said he expects the city to face a swift legal challenge after Murray signs the measure into law. Theres something fundamentally wrong with elected officials passing a tax they know is against state law and the constitution with the hope of being sued and having a judge overturn prior decisions, Mercier said.  State law blocks a county or city from levying a tax on net income, although net income is not defined in the statute. The Washington state Supreme Court has found that income is treated as property under the constitution and therefore has to be taxed uniformly and at no more than 1 percent of its value, Mercier said.

If confirmed by the Senate, Quarles would be the first vice chair of supervision at the Fed, a role created after the 2008 financial crisis but never filled during the Obama administration. Quarles is viewed as an industry-friendly figure who will likely listen to banks that have complained about the impact of regulations implemented since the financial meltdown. His nomination has been widely expected since April. Former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo effectively ran banking supervision until he stepped down in February, overseeing a strict implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and administering rigorous stress tests annually to banks on how prepared they are to withstand unexpected shocks. Quarles currently runs a private investment firm that he founded, the Cynosure Group, from Salt Lake City, Utah. He was previously a partner at private equity firm the Carlyle Group. He was also under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury under President George W. Bush and was the U.S. executive director of the International Monetary Fund. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in March 2016, Quarles and Lawrence Goodman, another former U.S. Treasury official, argued against breaking up big banks because it would risk damaging the wider economy. He has also talked about refining Obama-era financial rules, introduced after the financial crisis. Quarles will be a central figure in pushing the Trump administrations plans to loosen the leash put on Wall Street banks following the crisis.  Trump laid out his plans last month but he needs officials at key regulatory posts to carry out his agenda. He has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies, but only Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress.

There is no issue, except do they want to pass a Russia sanctions bill or not, Senator Bob Corker told reporters at the U.S. Senate. The Senate passed the sanctions measure by 98-2 on June 15, but it has been stalled in the House, where President Donald Trumps fellow Republicans hold a larger majority than in the Senate. House Republican leaders insisted the delay was purely because the bill violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues must originate in the House, not the Senate. They also blamed Democrats for holding it up. Democrats, and some Republicans, scoffed. They said the bill could have been fixed and passed in the House in a matter of minutes. Trump administration officials said they disagree with provisions in the bill requiring the president to get Congress permission before easing any sanctions, and the fact that many of the new sanctions are mandatory, so that the president cannot opt to waive them for national security reasons. Some Republicans have also echoed concerns raised by U.S. energy firms and European governments that the legislation could complicate investment in Russian energy projects, and potentially cost industry jobs. Corker said the bill was written to allow the Trump administration to address energy-related issues. And he said any White House would prefer to conduct foreign policy without Congress, but the administration had not asked him to kill the bill. No one has called me and said, We dont want this legislation to pass. That has never occurred, Corker said. Lawmakers and aides said administration officials had held meetings in Congress in the past few weeks to express their concerns about the measure. The Senate passed the bill a second time by unanimous consent on June 29, with a fix to address the procedural issue, but it has still not been taken up by the House.

Banks blasted the rule, which bars financial firms from forcing customers to agree to settle disputes only through arbitration as a condition of opening new accounts, but consumer advocates said it will make sure wronged customers have their day in court. Mandatory arbitration clauses that block customers from filing or joining a class-action lawsuit appear in contracts for a wide variety of products. The rule was proposed last year under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat who appointed the current director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray. Republicans now control both Congress and the White House, and are already looking into stopping it in its tracks. Just before the CFPB unveiled the final rule, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika wrote Cordray to raise safety and soundness concerns with a draft version he had read and asked the CFPB to share data it used in crafting the rule, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters.  The CFPB did not share the final rule with him ahead of the announcement, according to an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency spokesman. In the letter, Noreika, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, cited a section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that allows his office to set aside possibly unsafe CFPB rules. Eliminating mandatory arbitration could result in less effective consumer protection and remedies, while simply enriching class-action lawyers, he wrote, adding the rule may potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers, while increasing their costs. In the final rule, the bureau requires financial companies to give customers the option of arbitration or of banding together to sue in class actions. Companies must also provide redacted records of claims and awards reached through arbitration, which the CFPB will post on its website beginning in July 2019. Rule critics say class actions are costly, suck up time and result in lower awards for consumers. In recent months, they have worked to undo regulations barring the fine print from contracts for nursing-homes and for-profit colleges. Supporters say Americans have the right to take complaints to court, and group lawsuits are effective in publicly correcting bad corporate behavior. They say arbitrations are secretive and rigged in favor of companies. California may soon allow state residents to sue financial institutions after clauses inserted into Wells Fargo account-opening agreements blocked customers from suing over the banks creation of unauthorized accounts in their names. Calling the new CFPB rule anti-consumer, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Jeb Hensarling said Congress should reject it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which gives lawmakers power to kill newly minted regulations. The Consumer Bankers Association has already begun lobbying lawmakers to use the CRA on the rule, said its president Richard Hunt.  Cordray, too, told reporters on a call he expects Congress to look into nullifying the rule but questioned the level of support for the move. Congress has already banned mandatory arbitration clauses for mortgages and contracts involving members of the military, he said.     Meanwhile, one of Washingtons most powerful lobby groups and CFPB critics, the Chamber of Commerce, said it will consider every approach to address our concerns, which many interpreted as a threat to sue.

Wolf had 10 days from June 30th to either sign or veto the legislation. He chose to let it become law automatically at midnight without his signature. The legislature approved the spending part of the budget June 30th, beating a July 1 deadline by just hours.However, Republicans, who dominate both houses of the legislature, were unable to agree on a way to close the budget gap. In the coming days, it is my hope that the General Assembly will come together to pass a responsible solution to balance our books, Wolf, a Democrat said in a statement. There are many options available to balance the budget in the long-term. The fiscal 2018 budget is about $450 million larger than last year. The budget shortfall is due in large part to revenue collections this fiscal year which were $1.6 billion below expectations. In order to close the gap, the state is considering borrowing $1 billion, to be repaid with money U.S. states still receive every year from their 1998 legal settlement with tobacco companies for health expenses. Republicans have also discussed a wide expansion in casino gambling, and discussed but rejected placing as many as 40,000 video gambling devices around the state. Democrats want a severance tax on oil and gas production that would feed the general fund. That idea has failed to pass in previous years. Every year our Commonwealth borrows money and uses accounting gimmicks to meet our obligations, digging us deeper and deeper into a hole, said Democratic Senator Daylin Leach. We need new sustainable revenue just to keep the lights on and avoid yet another credit downgrade, he said.

Analysts at the three major rating agencies, which rate Illinois one or two notches above junk, declined to comment on the timing of their decisions.  With the help of some Republican votes, the Democratic-controlled Illinois Legislature last Thursday overrode Republican Governor Bruce Rauners vetoes and enacted a $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and a $5 billion income tax increase. The action ended an unprecedented two-year budget impasse that ballooned the states unpaid bill backlog to about $15 billion. Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a Democrat, on Monday unveiled a five-step plan to avoid a junk rating that included Rauner taking steps to issue up to $6 billion of bonds the legislature authorized to begin paying off bills. He also recommended the governor visit credit rating agencies to assure them he intends to implement the budget package. A junk rating would make future bond sales more difficult and expensive. Eleni Demertzis, Rauners spokeswoman, did not answer questions about the borrowing but underscored the governors dissatisfaction with the budget. Even with the tax increase, this budget remains $2 billion out of balance for fiscal year 2018, she said. The best thing we can do is to work collaboratively to pass truly balanced budgets that pay down our debt, reform our pension system, and make the changes necessary to drive economic growth in our state. Moodys cited the budgets substantial implementation risk when the states Baa3 rating was placed on review last week for a possible downgrade to junk. Analyst Ted Hampton said risks include revenue and cost-saving assumptions built in to the budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.  Hampton and S&P analyst Gabriel Petek said they expected Rauner to implement the budget as required by law. John Humphrey, co-head of credit research at Gurtin Municipal Bond Management, said optimism that Illinois finally has a budget should be tempered against the states strained finances and how much execution risk remains. I think Moodys has been pretty clear that they view the states political dysfunction combined with continued unaddressed long-term liabilities, and unfavorable baseline revenue performance as casting some degree of skepticism on the states ability to manage out of the very fragile financial situation they are in, he said.

In an email, the panels designated officer, Andrew Kossack, asked state elections officers to hold on submitting any data, the commission said in court filings.  Several state elections officials confirmed receiving a letter from the panel stating that it would provide further instructions after a federal judge had ruled on a complaint filed by a watchdog group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is seeking a temporary restraining order. Earlier on Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, alleging violations of federal law requiring transparent government. The bipartisan panel, led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, asked the 50 U.S. states for a host of voter data, including birth dates and the last four digits of voters Social Security numbers.  Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance, which many called unnecessary and a violation of privacy.  This has been a misadventure from the get-go, Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, who had refused to give the commission any data, said by phone. In Wisconsin, elections officials halted plans to inform the commission how it could purchase for $12,500 its public voter data, not including Social Security numbers or birth dates.  Were just putting everything on hold, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Arkansas, however, had already sent in a limited batch of publicly available data, according to the office of Secretary of State Mark Martin, In a court document, the government said it would not download the information from Arkansas and would instead delete it. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.         The commission last week said it would meet on July 19 in Washington near the White House. On Monday, critics cheered the move and expressed hope the commission would permanently abandon efforts to collect voter data. The commission has effectively conceded, EPIC President Marc Rotenberg said by phone. State officials from both parties and election experts widely agree that voter fraud is rare. Civil rights groups called the commission a voter suppression tactic by Trump.  The Republican president created the panel in May following his claim, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.

Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. The idea appeared to be a political non-starter. It was immediately scorned by several of Trumps fellow Republicans, who questioned why the United States would work with Russia after Moscows alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Its not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but its pretty close, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBCs Meet the Press program.  Ash Carter, who was U.S. defense secretary until the end of former Democratic President Barack Obamas administration in January, told CNN flatly: This is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary. Trumps advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had recently sought to explain Trumps cyber push. Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump and Putin had agreed to create a cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cyber security together. But Trump returned to Twitter on Sunday to play down the idea, which arose at his talks with Putin at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany.  The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesnt mean I think it can happen. It cant,  Trump said on Twitter.  He then noted that an agreement with Russia for a ceasefire in Syria can & did happen. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Trumps desire to move forward with Russia, but added: There has to be a price to pay. There has been no penalty, McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS Face the Nation program according to a CBS transcript. Vladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election. Trump argued for a rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscows actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trumps suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNNs State of the Union program that Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit. If thats our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow, Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Trump said he strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. He added: We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia! In Trumps first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and de-escalation agreement for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said.     Any joint U.S.-Russia cyber initiative would have been a different matter. Depending how much it veered into military or espionage operations, it could have faced major legal hurdles. Language in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Pentagon, which includes the National Security Agency and the U.S. militarys Cyber Command, from using any funds for bilateral military cooperation with Russia. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, also noted restrictions on sharing information with Russia that would clearly prohibit offering Moscow a sense of U.S. cyber capabilities. Russia would be similarly adverse to revealing its capabilities to the United States, he noted. It just will not happen, McFaul told Reuters.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday the two leaders discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit when they met at the Hamburg G20 summit.  The idea was greeted with incredulity by some senior  Republicans who said Moscow could not be trusted - and the U.S. president later in the day tweeted that he did not think it could happen. The heads of state did talk about such a possibility, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters on Monday. Nothing was promised to each other, he added. What is positive, they stated their readiness to work in this direction. The conversation had been about the possibility of forming such a group, he said. Whether it will be created or not, time will show. Svetlana Lukash, a Russian official who was at the Hamburg summit, told a news conference earlier on Monday Putin and Trumps discussion of cyber security had taken up 40 minutes of their meeting, which lasted more than two hours.    President Putin proposed creating a working group, she said. This does not mean it should start working immediately, virtually tomorrow. She added: The main thing is, this matter was discussed, the United States is ready to consider cooperation in this sphere, and then we will see. Maybe this will be a working group, maybe this will be cooperation on the floor of the United Nations. But in any case, our two countries will need to discuss these questions. This is namely what the presidents agreed upon. She said of the landmark talks between the two men in Hamburg: Nobody, except the participants of that meeting, knows how that proposal was formulated and how President Trump reacted.  Some media reports may have prematurely assumed that the creation of a joint commission on cyber security was already decided, she said. That was a proposal. Probably, he (Trump) is not ready yet for this specific initiative at this stage, Lukash said. Trumps administration has been dogged by investigations into allegations of Russian interference in last years U.S. election and ties with his campaign. Peskov also told reporters on Monday the Kremlin did not know the identity of the Russian lawyer who allegedly met Trumps son, Donald Trump Jr., Trumps election campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, last year.

After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton, the statement said. Clinton was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.  Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information. Trump Jr. said Veselnitskaya then turned the conversation to the adoption of Russian children and a U.S. law blackisting Russians linked to alleged human-rights abuses. President Trump was not aware of and did not attend the meeting, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trumps legal team, said in an emailed statement. Trump Jr. said he was asked to attend the meeting with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign at the request of an acquaintance he knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.

The revelations come after President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the allegations of election meddling during the summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg, Germany.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois first budget after two years is filled with partial outlines to address its debt-ridden pension system and unpaid bill backlog  signs that political fighting and the fiscal mess in the nations fifth-largest state are far from over. At least 15 House and Senate Republicans broke with first-term Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on Thursday and joined with Democrats to override Rauners vetoes of the states first budget package in more than two years.  The $36 billion spending plan relies on a $5 billion tax increase that permanently hikes the flat personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent, up 32 percent from its prior 3.75 percent rate. To address the states nearly $15 billion in unpaid bills, Illinois depends heavily on borrowing. Lawmakers approved $6 billion of 12-year bonds to raise money for repayments. But State Representative Greg Harris, the House Democrats point person on the budget, has acknowledged there is only enough revenue to support half of that borrowing amount.  Illinois will also borrow up to $1.2 billion from various state accounts that have accumulated cash for specific purposes, while sweeping cash from other accounts a government version of looking under couch cushions that is expected to yield $300 million.  Illinois $130 billion pension liability is one of the largest in the nation, and the new budget takes only small steps to address the structural underfunding of Illinois five retirement systems.  The new law gives the state five years to phase in changes retroactive to fiscal 2014 in actuarial or investment return assumptions made by the pension systems for an estimated savings of $892.1 million.  Seemingly small changes in projected investment results can have significant impact on a pension funds actuarial calculations. Last year, when the Illinois Teachers Retirement System reduced its earnings assumption to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, the change caused a $660 million spike in the states fiscal 2018 contribution. The new budget attributes $500 million in savings to the creation of a new tier of pension beneficiaries. But that tier applies largely to newly hired employees, raising questions about how the state expects to book that savings in the current fiscal year. That estimate was lifted straight from the proposed budget presented by Rauner earlier this year. The projection has not been independently verified by legislative leaders, and Rauners office has not responded to requests for an explanation of how the estimate was calculated.  The Illinois Education Association, one of the states largest unions, said it has no evidence that its pensioners would be harmed by the new budgets pension provisions. But the union questioned why lawmakers approved structural changes to pensions without an independent financial analysis.  Its a little bit of a shot in the dark. For something this major, youd think the legislators who are voting on this would want to know this information, said Jim Reed, the unions government relations director. A budget was welcomed as a positive step for Illinois, which still faces fiscal and pension crises. The pension pressures will continue, and Illinois financial challenges will continue, but at least there will be a framework to recognize theres a limit to the liability growth to this state, said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a budget watchdog group. Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank, said the fixes in the new budget do not match up to the challenges faced by Illinois. This is the kind of budget you would pass if you were a state that hit a bump in the road and had a deficit you needed to get rid of over the next two or three years, he said. Its not the kind of budget youd pass if you have $14 billion in unpaid bills and a $130 billion unfunded (pension) liability. The Democrats and Republicans who voted for the budget did so at least in part to prevent Illinois from becoming the first U.S. state in history to see its credit rating fall to junk status. Moodys on Wednesday put Illinois on review for a possible downgrade, but some of the states bonds traded higher on Friday, an apparent sign of optimism about the budget.

In separate television interviews, Graham and Senator John McCain, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, took aim at Tillersons remarks last week that Russia may have got the right approach and the United States the wrong approach to Syria. Russia has backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syrias civil war, while the United States supports rebel groups trying to overthrow him. McCain told CBS Face the Nation that he sometimes regretted backing Tillersons nomination by Republican President Donald Trump and that his comments on Russia being right on Syria made him emotional and upset. I know what the slaughter has been like. I know that the Russians knew that Bashar Assad was going to use chemical weapons. And to say that maybe weve got the wrong approach? he said. Both senators backed the nomination of Tillerson in January, even while expressing concern about his dealings with Russia when he was chief executive of ExxonMobil. (XOM.N) Graham, who visited Afghanistan and Pakistan last week with McCain, accused Tillerson of being AWOL on the two countries and failing to fill key State Department posts. I am so worried about the State Department, Graham said  on NBCs Meet the Press. A State Department official responded to the criticism of Tillerson by saying that a U.S.-Russian-brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria was an example of what the secretary had described as the potential to coordinate with Russia, in spite of unresolved differences, to produce stability and serve our mutual security interests. The official, who did not want to be identified, also said the State Department was taking an active role in a review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy and continued to work with the White House on nominations. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistans U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year.

One prominent Republican lawmaker, Senator John McCain, said he thought the Republican bill would probably fail. My view is that its probably going to be dead, McCain,  said on the CBS program Face the Nation, adding that Republicans, who narrowly control the chamber, would likely need to work with Democrats on a healthcare bill. President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to put pressure on Republicans to stay the course. For years, even as a civilian, I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance! he tweeted.  The Senate bill, which faces unified Democratic opposition, has been further imperiled during the recess, when Republican senators have had to return to their states and face constituents strongly opposed to the measure. Senators return to Washington on Monday. The Senate bill keeps intact much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamas signature legislation, popularly known as Obamacare, but strips away most of its funding. It repeals most Obamacare taxes, overhauls the laws tax credits and ends its Medicaid expansion. It also goes beyond repealing Obamacare by cutting funding for the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled beginning in 2025. At least 10 Republican senators have opposed the bill in its current form, but many more have criticized the legislation or said they are undecided. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said on Sunday the draft bill was undergoing a serious rewrite. Clearly, the draft plan is dead, he said on Fox News. Is the serious rewrite plan dead? I dont know. Ive not seen the serious rewrite plan. Critics have derided the bill as a giveaway to wealthy Americans who would see some tax increases rolled back. Opponents also warn that the legislation would cause millions of poor and sick Americans to lose healthcare coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which assesses the impact of legislation, estimated 22 million people would lose health insurance over the next decade under the Senate bill. In a separate report, it found the proposal would cut government spending on Medicaid by 35 percent come 2036. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said on Fox News on Sunday that Trump expected Congress to pass a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare before lawmakers leave Washington for their August recess. A spokesman for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Senate leadership was continuing to work with Republican senators and the CBO on the legislation, but did not comment on McCains remarks or the bills future. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said on Sunday that failure to pass the bill was not an option and that the Senate effort must focus on lowering premiums. He pointed to an amendment he offered that is being scored by the CBO. Cruzs amendment would allow insurers to offer plans that do not comply with Obamacares mandate that they charge sick and healthy people the same rates and cover a set of essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drugs, as long as they also offer plans that do comply with the regulations. Cruzs amendment has drawn support from conservative senators and groups, who say the amendment will help lower premiums. But moderate Republicans and outside critics say it will erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions and make their insurance unaffordable. McConnell has said he plans to hold a vote on the legislation, which needs the support of at least 50 of the Senates 52 Republicans, before a six-week recess that begins on July 29. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed its version of a bill overhauling healthcare in May. Yet McConnell himself voiced doubts on the Senate bills prospects last week, telling a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky that if Republicans fail to pass a repeal of Obamacare, they may need to work with Democrats to shore up private health insurance markets to keep them from collapsing.

Trump campaigned in last years presidential election on cracking down on China for its trade practices, but he softened his rhetoric after taking office, saying he wanted to work with China on the nuclear issue. When the two leaders first met in April at Trumps Florida resort, they appeared to hit it off. Trump called Xi a good man as he urged him to use Beijings economic clout to force North Korea to curb its nuclear weapons program. Lately, Trump has expressed some impatience on Chinas role in North Korea - particularly after Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast. His administration made new arms sales to Taiwan, imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company and put China on a global human trafficking list. It also accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. The White House is also debating trade actions against Beijing, including tariffs on its steel exports and a few days before the G20 talks, Trump complained that trade between China and North Korea had grown.  But he showed none of that impatience on Saturday, when the leaders met at the invitation of Xi at the tail end of the G20 in Germany. Its an honor to have you as a friend, Trump told Xi, telling him he appreciated actions he had already taken on North Korea. As far as North Korea is concerned, we will have, eventually, success. It may take longer than Id like. It may take longer than youd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other, Trump said. Speaking to reporters later on Air Force One, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump-Xi meeting lasted over an hour-and-a-half, and they had substantive discussions about how to deal with North Korea together. In regards to China, we had very direct discussions about North Korea. We had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation, Mnuchin said.   I think that President Trump made very clear to President Xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress. And I think President Xi gave a very interesting perspective from their standpoint, he added.    For his part, Xi told Trump that stronger China-U.S. ties were conducive to stability and prosperity amid global conflicts, and had made new progress in some areas despite some sensitive issues, Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua. Xi stressed the importance of talks with North Korea, and said Chinas navy will join next years U.S.-led Pacific Rim military exercises. Xinhua said Xi stressed to Trump Chinas position that it adheres to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining peace and stability there. While China has been angered by North Koreas repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises. China has many times talked about its principled position, namely that at the same time as the international community making necessary responses to North Korean acts that go against U.N. Security Council resolutions, they must step up efforts to promote talks and manage and control the situation, Xinhua said, citing Xi. Xi also reiterated Chinas opposition to the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, Xinhua said. China says THAAD threatens its security, despite U.S. and South Korean assurances it is aimed only at defending against North Korea. Both leaders agreed to maintain close communication and coordination on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, Xinhua said. In a statement released on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi and Trump had enhanced mutual understanding about the North Korea issue and confirmed the broad direction of using peaceful means to resolve this issue. Trump also mentioned trade imbalances in his meeting with Xi, calling it a very, very big issue that he would address. I know that China in particular, which is a great trading partner, we will be able to do something that will be equitable and reciprocal, Trump said. Senior officials from both countries will meet in Washington on July 19 to discuss economic and trade issues. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan on June 9, 2016, was the first confirmed private meeting between members of the presidents inner circle and a Russian national, the newspaper reported, citing confidential government records and interviews with people familiar with the documents. Donald Trump Jr. confirmed the get-together in a statement, describing it as a short introductory meeting that focused mainly on the issue of child adoption. He said he also asked Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort to take part in the meeting. A lawyer for Kushner said Trumps son-in-law briefly attended the meeting. A federal special counsel and several congressional committees are investigating possible contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian representatives, as part of a larger probe into allegations that Moscow meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The Times article appeared a day after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the allegations of election meddling during the summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg, Germany.  Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting was held primarily to  discuss a popular program to help Americans adopt Russian children, which the Russian government had ended. But it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up, he said in the statement. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.

As Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows, Gorelick said in a statement. A spokesman for Manafort did not respond to a Reuters query.  The Times said the Russian lawyer at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is known for campaigning against a U.S. law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""HAMBURG (Reuters) - Leaders from the worlds leading economies broke with U.S. President Donald Trump on climate policy at a G20 summit on Saturday, in a rare public admission of disagreement and blow to multilateral cooperation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, keen to show off her skills as a mediator two months before a German election, achieved her primary goal at the meeting in Hamburg, convincing her fellow leaders to support a single communique with pledges on trade, finance, energy and Africa. But the divide between Trump, elected on a pledge to put America First, and the 19 other members of the club, including countries as diverse as Japan, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, was stark. Last month Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark international climate accord clinched two years ago in Paris. In the end, the negotiations on climate reflect dissent  all against the United States of America, Merkel told reporters at the end of the meeting. And the fact that negotiations on trade were extraordinarily difficult is due to specific positions that the United States has taken.  The summit, marred by violent protests that left the streets of Hamburg littered with burning cars and broken shop windows, brought together a volatile mix of leaders at a time of major change in the global geo-political landscape. Trumps shift to a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has left a void in global leadership, unsettling traditional allies in Europe and opening the door to rising powers like China to assume a bigger role. Tensions between Washington and Beijing dominated the run-up to the meeting, with the Trump administration ratcheting up pressure on President Xi Jinping to rein in North Korea and threatening punitive trade measures on steel. TRUMP-PUTIN Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in Hamburg, a hotly anticipated encounter after the former real estate mogul promised a rapprochement with Moscow during his campaign, only to be thwarted by accusations of Russian meddling in the vote and investigations into the Russia ties of Trump associates. Putin said at the conclusion of the summit on Saturday that Trump had quizzed him on the alleged meddling in a meeting that lasted over two hours but seemed to have been satisfied with the Kremlin leaders denials of interference. Trump had accused Russia of destabilizing behavior in Ukraine and Syria before the summit. But in Hamburg he struck a conciliatory tone, describing it as an honor to meet Putin and signaling, through Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that he preferred to focus on future ties and not dwell on the past. It was an extraordinarily important meeting, Tillerson said, describing a very clear positive chemistry between Trump and the former KGB agent. In the final communique, the 19 other leaders took note of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and declared it irreversible. For its part, the United States injected a contentious line saying that it would endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently. French President Emmanuel Macron led a push to soften the U.S. language. There is a clear consensus absent the United States, said Thomas Bernes, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. But that is a problem. Without the largest economy in the world how far can you go?  Jennifer Morgan, executive director at Greenpeace, said the G19 had held the line against Trumps backward decision to withdraw from Paris. On trade, another sticking point, the leaders agreed they would fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments in this regard. The leaders also pledged to work together to foster economic development in Africa, a priority project for Merkel. Merkel chose to host the summit in Hamburg, the port city where she was born, to send a signal about Germanys openness to the world, including its tolerance of peaceful protests. It was held only a few hundred meters from one of Germanys most potent symbols of left-wing resistance, a former theater called the Rote Flora which was taken over by anti-capitalist squatters nearly three decades ago. Over the three days of the summit, radicals looted shops, torched cars and lorries. More than 200 police were injured and some 143 people have been arrested and 122 taken into custody. Some of the worst damage was done as Merkel hosted other leaders at for a concert and lavish dinner at the Elbphilharmonie, a modernist glass concert hall overlooking the Elbe River.  Merkel met police and security force after the summit to thank them, and condemned the unbridled brutality of some of the protestors, but she was forced to answer tough questions about hosting the summit in Hamburg during her closing press conference.

Trumps pledge came during a working session of the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, providing a godsend to the United Nations World Food Programme, the groups executive director, David Beasley, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting. Were facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two, said Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by Trump to head the U.N. agency fighting hunger worldwide. The new funding brings to over $1.8 billion aid promised by the United States for fiscal year 2017 for the crises in the four countries, where the United Nations has estimated more than 30 million people need urgent food assistance. With this new assistance, the United States is providing additional emergency food and nutrition assistance, life-saving medical care, improved sanitation, emergency shelter and protection for those who have been affected by conflict, USAID said in a statement. Rob Jenkins, acting head of the USAIDs bureau of democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance, said of the funding, over $191 million would go to Yemen, $199 million to South Sudan, $121 million to Nigeria and almost $126 million for Somalia. Conflict in all four countries had made it difficult to reach some communities in need of food, he noted. Were in a dire situation right now, said Jenkins, adding that USAID was also concerned with the situation in southern Ethiopia. The situation in southern Ethiopia fortunately does not rise to the dire situation of the other four, but the situation is deteriorating and might very well be catastrophic without additional interventions, he said, adding that Washington had already provided some $252 million this year to Ethiopia, but the needs continue to grow. Beasley said the U.S. funding was about a third of what the WFP estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries in crisis as well as in other areas. The WFP estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst-affected zones stemming from wars and man-made crises, Beasley said. We estimated that if we didnt receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months, he said. Trumps announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the U.S. State Department and other humanitarian missions as part of his America First policy. Beasley said the agency had worked hard with the White House and the U.S. government to secure the funding, but Trump would insist that other countries contributed more as well.

In a court filing late on Friday, Hawaiis attorney general asked a Honolulu judge to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible bona fide relationship with a U.S. person or entity. The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancs and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred.  Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Earlier this week Hawaii had asked a Honolulu judge for a court order clarifying the Supreme Courts ruling to allow grandparents into the United States. The judge, along with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that the lower courts did not have the power to simply clarify the Supreme Courts opinion. However, the 9th Circuit on Friday said the courts could issue an injunction against Trumps policy in the future, if the government misapplied the Supreme Courts ruling to a particular person or entity harmed by the travel ban. Hours after that ruling, Hawaii made such an injunction request in a Honolulu federal court. Hawaii said the state itself, along with resettlement agencies, are harmed by Trumps guidelines because they are prevented from helping refugees move there. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible bona fide relationship with a U.S. person or entity.  The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancs and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. A Honolulu judge this week rejected Hawaiis request to clarify the Supreme Court ruling and narrow the governments implementation of the ban. Hawaii appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying in a filing on Friday that the appeals court has the power to narrow the travel ban while it decides how to interpret the Supreme Courts ruling. A three-judge 9th Circuit panel on Friday rejected that argument and said it did not have jurisdiction to hear Hawaiis appeal.  The 9th Circuit said the Honolulu judge could issue an injunction against the government in the future, if he believed it misapplied the Supreme Courts ruling to a particular person harmed by the travel ban.  But the judge did not have the authority to simply clarify the Supreme Courts instructions now, the appeals court said. In a statement, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said he appreciated that the 9th Circuit ruled so quickly, and that the state will comply. The Justice Department declined to comment.  Justice Department lawyers have argued that its definition of close family hews closely to language found in U.S. immigration law, while Hawaiis attorney generals office said other parts of immigration law include grandparents in that group. The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps commission to investigate possible election fraud will convene this month, a government notice said on Friday, as more U.S. states have refused to hand over at least some voter data. Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May, after claiming without evidence that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election. U.S. civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have called the panel a voter suppression tactic by Trump, a Republican who won the presidential election by securing a majority in the Electoral College tally of delegates even as he lost the popular vote to Clinton by some 3 million votes. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a watchdog group, has filed a lawsuit to block the commissions data request until its privacy impact can be weighed. A hearing in the case was scheduled for Friday afternoon. There is a wide consensus among state officials from both parties and election experts that voter fraud is rare. States rejecting the commissions attempts to gather voter information have called it unnecessary and a violation of privacy. Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance with the commissions requests. Republican Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the commissions vice chairman, said in a statement sent by the White House that 14 states and Washington, D.C., had rejected the request outright.   The commission will meet on July 19 to swear in members, formulate objectives and discuss next steps after asking the 50 states to turn over potentially sensitive voter information, according to a General Services Administration (GSA) notice published in the Federal Register. A June 28 letter from the election panel sought names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories. Matthew Dunlap, Maines Democratic secretary of state and a commission member, on Friday dismissed Trumps claim that millions of voters illegally cast ballots. We just dont see that, he told CNN. People are incredibly law abiding. Although Maine is one state that has pushed back at the commissions request, Dunlap said he hopes the panel can tackle voting issues including ballot access and hacking. A Republican commission member, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, defended the panel, telling CNN on Thursday that fraud with even one vote per precinct ... can change the course of history. A court filing in the Electronic Privacy Information Center case also showed the panel plans to house data on White House computers rather than at the GSA. The Washington Post, which earlier reported the filing, noted GSA would be required to follow specific privacy requirements. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trumps favor. Moscow has dismissed the accusations. Trump has denied any collusion and has questioned the agencies conclusion as well as any Russian role. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Speaking at a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky, McConnell said: If my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur, the Associated Press reported. No action is not an alternative, McConnell was quoted as saying. Weve got the insurance markets imploding all over the country, including in this state. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed McConnells comments as a possible opening that could help achieve a bipartisan solution to fix problems with former President Barack Obamas 2010 healthcare law, dubbed Obamacare. It is encouraging that Senator McConnell today acknowledged that the issues with the (health insurance) exchanges are fixable and opened the door to bipartisan solutions to improve our healthcare system, Schumer said in a statement. Democrats are eager to work with Republicans to stabilize the markets and improve the law, he added. Many of the individual health insurance markets established under Obamacare have struggled, hurt by an unfavorable balance of sick and healthy customers, and some insurers have pulled out because of uncertainty on whether the government will continue to fund cost-sharing subsidies to help individuals pay premiums. Republicans have been fighting to repeal Obamas signature piece of domestic legislation since it was first approved. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress made repeal a central campaign promise last year. But efforts to replace the healthcare law this year have run into difficulties. The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a replacement bill in May. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 23 million people would lose insurance coverage under the House plan, the Senate made clear it would write its own bill rather than voting on the House measure. The Senate unveiled its healthcare measure in late June. That measures fate was uncertain after the CBO predicted that under it 15 million people would lose health insurance in 2018, with the number growing to 22 million as a result of cuts to the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled that would take place in 2025. At least one Republican senator publicly opposed the bill and others were critical of it. McConnell can only afford to lose two Republicans from his 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate and still pass the measure. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois ended its historic budget drought on Thursday after  the House of Representatives enacted the states first complete spending plan since 2015 by overriding the governors vetoes. But the $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion tax hike may not save Illinois from becoming the first-ever U.S. state with a junk credit rating. The Democratic-controlled House mustered some Republican votes to enact a trio of budget and revenue bills into law over Republican Governor Bruce Rauners objection. The Houses action, which was delayed by a nearly two-hour lockdown of the state Capitol in Springfield after a woman threw a white powder into the governors office, followed successful Senate veto override votes on Tuesday.  The spending plan for the fiscal year that began on July 1 ends an unprecedented two-year budget impasse between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature. Rauner pointed to House Speaker Michael Madigan as the architect of the 32 percent permanent increase in the states personal income tax rate, which will rise to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent. His tax-and-spend plan is not balanced, does not cut enough spending or pay down enough debt, and does not help grow jobs or restore confidence in government, Rauner said in a statement, adding that Illinois desperately needs local property tax relief and term limits for elected officials.  Madigan, who next month will becomes the longest-serving House speaker in U.S. history, said he acted in the states interest. The people in this chamber did not do what was easy today, but we did what was right for the future of our state, Madigan said after the House completed veto overrides of the budget and tax package, which ranks as one of the brightest legislative victories of his three decades as speaker. After the security scare, when a woman threw a white powder which was later determined to be harmless into the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor and the House gallery, the bipartisan turning back of Rauners budgetary vetoes came swiftly. For Rauner it was the most significant and humiliating political blow of his 30 months in office. Representative David Harris, who was among the 10 Republicans who voted to overturn the tax hike veto,  rhetorically asked Rauner from the House floor how he willingly could take the state into the financial abyss considering the governors long-established business acumen as a former private equity investor. You are an astute, capable businessman. You understand what the numbers are here, Harris said. You understand the implications of junk-bond status. Is that what we want for the fifth-largest state in the union?  Rauners allies made an effort to defend the governors position to hold out for non-budgetary priorities like a property-tax freeze and changes in how injured workers are compensated by employers, but it was a lost cause. I hope that everybody back home and everybody across this state will rise up, let everyone in this chamber know exactly how they feel after this vote is taken, said Representative John Cabello, a Republican no vote. Illinois has been operating for two fiscal years on stop-gap budgets and spending ordered by courts and mandated by Illinois law. Its unpaid bill backlog has ballooned to $15 billion, leaving state universities, social service and health care providers and scores of vendors starving for cash. Moodys Investors Service, which rates Illinois one notch above junk, placed the state under review on Wednesday for a potential downgrade, saying the budget plan may fall short in addressing the states huge unfunded pension liability and the bill backlog.  The new budget aims to initially reduce the bill pile by only about a third, while banking on a projected $1.5 billion in savings from creating a hybrid retirement plan for new hires and other pension measures. Praise for Thursdays House action flooded in from cash-deprived social-service groups, including the Chicago-based Ounce of Prevention Fund, a group dedicated to fighting childhood poverty whose president is Diana Rauner, the governors wife. We applaud the members of the General Assembly in both parties who took the tough vote to try to end this impasse, the group said in a statement. With a new budget in hand, the Illinois Lottery will immediately seek leave to resume sales of Mega Millions and Powerball tickets after they were suspended in late June, and a shutdown of billions of dollars in state road projects will end, according to state spokespeople.

Shaub has sounded many alarms over the Trump administrations business entanglements. He urged Trump to divest from his business empire rather than turn management of it over to his sons, and chastised the White House for not disciplining presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway after she endorsed a fashion line sold by Ivanka Trump, the presidents daughter. Shaub said in an interview with the Washington Post published Thursday that he was not pressured to leave, but felt that he could not achieve more in the ethics office under the Trump administration. Democratic lawmakers lauded Shaubs service. Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said he looked forward to examining Republican Trumps nominee to replace Shaub. Schumer said he hoped the successor would prevent lobbyists and private interests from rigging the system against working families under the cover of darkness. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Republican chairman of the committee to invite Shaub to testify to the panel about necessary ethical reforms. Some Republican lawmakers, such as Cummingss former Republican counterpart, Jason Chaffetz, had little praise for Shaub during his tenure. Chaffetz rebuked Shaub in a January letter for making public statements about Trumps finances. Shaub will next head the Ethics Practice at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based nonpartisan group dedicated to democratic reform, said Larry Noble, the groups general counsel.  Noble said that the Center learned of Shaubs interest in leaving his government job in the last two weeks and seized the chance to hire him.

Legislatures in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin remain in disagreement about how to close ongoing budget gaps in their states or fund new budget initiatives. We always have some states that go into the new fiscal year without budgets, but the number is a bit high this year, said Eric Kim, a director at Fitch Ratings.  Weak revenues complicated budget negotiations in several states, while idiosyncratic issues pushed others beyond their June 30 deadlines.  The Illinois House was poised to take final budget action on Thursday by attempting to override the governors vetoes of a $36 billion spending plan and $5 billion tax hike approved by the Democratic-controlled legislature over the Fourth of July holiday weekend. A hazardous materials situation in the state Capitol in Springfield delayed the House session, but officials determined the substance was harmless and lawmakers were returning.  If enacted, the budget would mark Illinois first complete budget since 2015. No other U.S. state has lacked a budget for that long. Thirty-three of the 50 U.S. states reported revenues that came in below projections in fiscal year 2017, the highest number of states since the recession decimated budgets in 2010, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. Connecticut and Pennsylvania have the most challenging revenue situations, according to Fitch, as lower-than-anticipated tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them.  Massachusetts, also amid a revenue shortfall, enacted a one-month interim budget for July to provide additional time to negotiate a full-year budget. Wisconsin legislators are working to close a transportation funding shortfall.  Oregons budget process includes multiple bills, most of which have been approved. But the legislature is still debating several measures, including changes to hiring practices. Rhode Island had appeared ready to finalize a budget by June 30, but late last week the state Senate amended a House proposal to phase out an automobile tax, causing the House to halt the budget process.  Many states retain the authority to make debt service payments without enacted budgets. Over the holiday weekend, several states came to last-minute budget agreements.  New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, while governors of Washington state and Alaska signed new operating budgets late last week, hours before deadlines that would have triggered partial government shutdowns.

The meeting of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue will take place in Washington on July 19, and will be the first covering economic and trade issues in a new format for U.S.-China dialogue agreed after a summit between Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in April. Trump pledged repeatedly during his election campaign to take a tough stance on Chinese trade practices deemed unfair to the United States, but his rhetoric softened after a friendlier-than-expected summit with Xi. Shortly after their meeting, Trump said he had told Xi that China would get a better trade deal if it worked to rein in North Korea, whose nuclear and missile programs have become an increasing threat to the United States. Lately though, Trump, who is to meet Xi again on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg this week, has appeared increasingly frustrated that China - North Koreas neighbor and main trading partner - has not taken stronger action. North Korea said it tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday and experts said it appeared to be of a type capable of hitting all of Alaska, prompting renewed U.S. calls for global diplomatic action. The United States has said it will propose new United Nations sanctions in response to the test, but it is unclear whether China and Russia will support these. Unlike Washington, neither Moscow nor Beijing have described the missile used in the test as an ICBM. Trump vowed on Thursday to confront North Korea very strongly after the latest missile test and urged nations to show Pyongyang that there would be consequences for its weapons programs   ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Speaking to reporters in Poland, Trump played down the assessment of his own intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the election by hacking Democrats emails and distributing online propaganda.     I think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure, Trump told a news conference.  Investigations by a special counsel, Robert Mueller, and several U.S. congressional committees are looking into whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with Trumps campaign. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscows actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries.  Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November election, will meet Putin on Friday at a G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg for their first official encounter.  It was not clear whether the Republican president would bring up the issue of election interference when the two men meet.  In a speech in Warsaw, Trump affirmed U.S. commitment to the defense of NATO allies and gently criticized Russia. Trump frequently praised Putin as a strong leader during the election campaign and called for better U.S. relations with Moscow but he has since tempered that rhetoric. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said Trumps remarks in Poland about the election only propagated his own personal fiction.      The Presidents comments today, again casting doubt on whether Russia was behind the blatant interference in our election and suggesting  his own intelligence agencies to the contrary  that nobody really knows, continue to directly undermine U.S. interests, Schiff said in a statement.             Trump cast doubt at his news conference over media reports that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia had meddled in the election.     Let me just start off by saying I heard it was 17 agencies.  I said, boy, thats a lot, do we even have that many intelligence agencies, right?  Lets check it. And we did some very heavy research. It turned out to be three or four. It wasnt 17, Trump said.            The U.S. intelligence report in January accusing Russia of meddling in the U.S. election was issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies.  But the report acknowledges that it is based on an assessment by the CIA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency, which held the key classified information on Russian activities. Trump said the CIA told his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, last August about Russian interference in the election but he did nothing to stop it.     I think what happened is he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election, and he said lets not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way, he would have done something about it, Trump said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday proposed to reduce the volume of biofuel required to be used in gasoline and diesel fuel next year as it signaled the first step toward a potential broader overhaul of its biofuels program. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys proposed total volume marked a slight decline from current levels and was more than 20 percent below targets laid out in a 2007 law. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, requires increased volumes of renewable fuels each year, but the proposal would keep targets for use of conventional biofuels at current levels. The agency has begun preparations to reset future biofuel targets, said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. His proposal was met with praise and calls for broader reform from the petroleum industry and mixed response from biofuels producers. Environmentalists, who have been critical of ethanol, called for Congress to reform the program.       The RFS has become a battlefield between corn and oil interests. The law has been a boon to agriculture, supporting economies across the Midwests Corn Belt.  The EPAs proposed cuts to advanced and cellulosic biofuels will have a chilling effect on the push toward next generation biofuels, said Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley.  Petroleum companies say the biofuel targets are impossible to meet and add billions of dollars in costs. The plan would require companies to blend a total of 19.24 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the countrys fuel supply next year.  The proposal is consistent with market realities focused on actual production and consumer demand while being cognizant of the challenges that exist in bringing advanced biofuels into the marketplace, Pruitt said in a statement. The agency would keep the 2018 target for conventional ethanol at 15 billion gallons, unchanged from 2017, and set the requirement for advanced biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol, at 4.24 billion gallons. These latest volumes confirmed an earlier Reuters report for volumes well below the 26 billion gallons of renewable fuels outlined by Congress in 2007. The law was aimed at cutting U.S. oil imports and boosting the use of renewable fuels. The EPA also requested comments related to concerns that the biofuels requirements increasingly are being met by supplies from Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia. The agency proposed setting the requirements for cellulosic below the current years levels at 238 million gallons and kept biomass-based diesel requirements at 2.1 billion gallons for 2019, unchanged from the levels set for 2018 under former President Barack Obama. Development of cellulosic biofuels has been slower than expected by lawmakers when they set up the program, stymied by regulatory delays and the economic downturn. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil companies, including BP America and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), praised the move to lower the overall requirements but said the proposal did not go far enough. Ethanol groups praised the agency for maintaining the target for conventional ethanol, which is mostly produced from corn in the United States, but were critical of the move to lower the advanced targets. We are concerned that by reducing the cellulosic (requirement), this proposal may weaken the signal to the marketplace, said Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association. Todays proposal underscores the need for the U.S. Congress to take the bull by the horns and reform the Renewable Fuel Standard to protect our clean water, our public health, and our wildlife, said National Wildlife Federation President and CEO Collin OMara.  Prices of U.S. renewable fuel credits rose 4 cents to trade at 75 cents apiece. Biodiesel credits were up 3 cents at $1.145 each, traders said.

The Democratic-controlled House on Thursday will attempt to overturn Republican Governor Bruce Rauners vetoes of spending and tax increase measures aimed at ending the states unprecedented two-year budget impasse. Moodys said it placed Illinois Baa3 rating, which is one step above the junk level, on review for a possible downgrade.  The $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion income tax increase passed by lawmakers over the extended Fourth of July holiday weekend, may fall short in addressing the states financial woes, particularly its huge unfunded pension liability and $15 billion unpaid bill backlog, according to Moodys. On both those fronts, its not yet clear if the legislation being enacted will have a substantial and clear positive effect, said Moodys analyst Ted Hampton. A stalemate between the Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nations fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two-straight fiscal years. Since fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, the House and Senate in bipartisan votes passed budget bills to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Rauner vetoed the bills on Tuesday only to have that action quickly overridden by the Senate, leaving the fate of the budget in the hands of the House.  Prior to Moodys announcement, Rauner said his Democratic opponents should prioritize the opinions of Illinois residents over credit ratings agencies. Dont listen to some Wall Street firm, Rauner told reporters Wednesday at a Chicago event. Thats not what matters. The governor also said he is working to sustain his vetoes. I can tell you this, we are doing everything we can to push that my veto is not overridden, he said.  He lashed out at those who defied his wishes by voting for the Democrats budget package, including 15 House Republicans. What we have is a continuing failure by elected officials in Springfield on both sides of the aisle thats been led by Speaker Madigan for 35 years, Rauner said, referring to House Speaker Michael Madigan. The system is broken. House Republican Leader Jim Durkin told Reuters that he and Rauner are attempting to persuade House Republicans supporters of the Democratic tax hike to reconsider their votes because theres a better deal to be had. But Durkin stopped short of predicting the overrides could be blocked. I think the Democrats, if they want to get it done, find the votes, Durkin said. Ive seen this before. Durkin said he had no plans to take punitive actions against those Republicans for their votes, but predicted its definitely a possibility some will face primary challenges from the Republican Partys anti-tax wing in the 2018 elections. Illinois has relied on court-ordered and state-mandated spending to keep operating. The absence of a fiscal 2018 budget shuttered major transportation projects and forced the state out of the lucrative Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries.

The fiscal 2018 budget plan, which has drawn both Democratic and Republican support in the legislature, does not guarantee funding for public schools to open on time next month. The plan identifies only enough funding to pay down roughly a third of the states record $15 billion unpaid bill backlog.  In addition, no substantial progress was made to reduce Illinois paralyzing $130 billion unfunded pension liability.  The states pension contribution is set to consume more than $7.8 billion of the states $36 billion budget in the fiscal year that began July 1. Illinois on Thursday could end its dubious status as the only state to ever go multiple years without a full operating budget if the Democratic-led legislative chamber overturns the vetoes from Republican Governor Bruce Rauner. One of the bills increases the states personal income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and corporate income tax from 5.25 percent to 7 percent.  Moodys Investors Service issued a warning on Wednesday that even if the House follows identical Senate action Monday and  overrides Rauners vetoes, the nations fifth-largest state risks a credit rating downgrade to junk because of unaddressed fiscal woes. Moodys said the budget plan falls short of adequately addressing pensions and the backlog of unpaid bills. Its not clear to me that they wont quickly find themselves with a comparable backlog and more long-term bonded debt, said Moodys analyst Ted Hampton. Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based government finance watchdog, said the bill does not provide stability. What rating agencies are pointing to, even with the tax increase if the General Assembly overrides the governor and with the spending plan as approved, the state still has severe financial challenges going forward, he said.  Drafters of the budget package inserted language that ties release of billions of dollars for K-12 education to enactment of a school-funding overhaul that Rauner has called a bailout for Chicagos cash-strapped school system. The House and Senate have passed the funding revamp, but Rauner has threatened to veto it. If Republicans and Democrats do not reconcile their differences before the first state payment goes to schools in August, about a dozen financially struggling public school systems might not open for classes next month, said Roger Eddy, executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards. Were talking about children that are going to be affected by this stalemate at this point. That is absolutely not an exaggeration. This is real, and its going to happen, Eddy told Reuters. The budget impasse also resulted in a halt of construction projects and Illinois suspended sales of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets. In another key areathe states $14.7 billion backlog of unpaid billsthe plan authorizes only $6 billion of general obligation bonds, as well as $1.5 billion in borrowings and transfers from other state funds for that purpose. Sufficient money exists only to support $3 billion of $6 billion in authorized bonding, which in turn would generate $2 billion in federal matching Medicaid dollars for unpaid bills. The budget also purports to save $500 million from pension changes, although there were slim details on how those savings would be realized. The pension reform in (the legislation) doesnt look like its really revolutionary or will move the needle in any big way, Hampton said.

The face-to-face talks will be the first between Pena Nieto and Trump as presidents. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray warned not to expect too much. We have to put it in context and not have expectations that are unjustified, Videgaray said. Trumps election and his early days in office strained relations between the two neighbors because of his threats to apply tariffs to Mexican-made goods and a plan to build a wall on the southern U.S. border and force Mexico to pay for it. Trump and Pena Nieto will discuss renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement scheduled for August, as well as cooperation in combating drug cartels and development in Central America, the Foreign Ministry said. Pena Nieto will also talk about the rights of Mexican migrants in the United States, the ministry said. Later on Wednesday, Pena Nieto and Videgaray met with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who was visiting Mexico ahead of the G20 summit along with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. According to a statement from Pena Nietos office, both sides agreed to work together on security and Pena Nieto praised the Trump administrations decision to keep in place a program that allows some immigrants, brought into the country illegally by their parents, to stay. One topic not on the agenda at the encounter in Hamburg is Trumps pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, Videgaray said in an earlier television interview.   In late January, a planned meeting between the two presidents was canceled following a Twitter dispute over Trumps pledge to make Mexico pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do. Trump has since said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first. His administration also toned down threats to pull out of the NAFTA pact with Mexico and Canada. Last August, during Trumps presidential campaign, he accepted an invitation to visit Mexico in what became a public relations disaster for Pena Nieto, who was widely condemned for inviting a man who has united Mexicans like few others in shared disdain.

The Politico-Morning Consult poll found 37 percent of voters said they strongly supported the new U.S. State Department guidelines that would deny visas to citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen who do not have close relatives in the United States. Another 23 percent of voters said they somewhat support the guidelines. The poll was conducted online on Thursday and Friday following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that partly upheld the ban, with 1,989 registered voters taking part. The poll results' margin of error was 2 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way. (Link to the poll: politi.co/2uJLfoO) The survey asked respondents whether they support or oppose the State Departments new guidelines, which say visa applicants from six predominately Muslim countries must prove a close family relationship with a U.S. resident in order to enter the country. It did not mention U.S. President Donald Trump, nor the presidents executive orders on immigration.  The Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that the temporary travel ban could proceed so long as visa applicants with a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States were exempted.  A year before his election, Trump promised voters he would seek a temporary total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. Trump said it was necessary to prevent attacks by Islamist militants, while critics said it was a needlessly discriminatory policy that could inflame prejudice against Muslims in the United States and abroad. The partial ban, which took effect on Thursday, was most strongly supported by Trumps fellow Republicans, 83 percent of whom approved. Even among Democratic voters, only 46 percent said they were opposed.  Forty-one percent of Democrats said they support it, and the remaining 13 percent said they dont know.

KABUL (Reuters) - A bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators visiting Afghanistan on Tuesday called for a new strategy from the Trump administration to turn the tide against an increasingly strong Taliban insurgency and end the longest war in U.S. history. The delegation led by Senator John McCain was in Kabul on a regional trip that included two days in neighboring Pakistan. The visit preceded an expected Trump review later in the month of the strategy for the United States longest war, now in its 16th year, a subject that was largely absent from last years presidential campaign. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistans U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year and has made Afghanistan the second-ranking country in people seeking refugee status abroad last year, behind Syria. McCain said in a Kabul press briefing on Tuesday at NATO-coalition headquarters that none of us would say that we are on a course to success here in Afghanistan. That needs to change and quickly, added McCain, a sharp critic of Trump within their Republican party.   McCain was accompanied by U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse and David Perdue on the regional tour. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said she came to get the view on the ground about what is happening in Afghanistan. We need a strategy in the United States that defines our role in Afghanistan, defines our objective and explains how we can get from here to there, Warren said. U.S. officials have told Reuters that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will present Trump with strategic options for  Afghanistan by mid-July.  Last month, Trump gave Mattis the authority to set American troop levels in Afghanistan, but as commander in chief Trump must sign off on an overall strategy for the war. U.S. security officials have privately said the most likely options will be to increase training and air support by 3,000-5,000 troops for still-inexperienced Afghan security forces, while also tracking down al Qaeda, Islamic State and other global Islamist militants based in Afghanistan.  The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has said several thousand more foreign troops  mostly trainers -  are needed to break a military stalemate with the Taliban. In 2001, a U.S.-backed military intervention in Afghanistan toppled the Taliban regime, whose ultra-hardline interpretation of sharia (Islamic law) banned most women from public life and executed people not seen as sufficiently pious, such as men with beards not considered long enough. More than 15 years later, about 13,000 U.S. and allied troops remain in Afghanistan as part of a training and advising mission in support of an elected government that has increasingly been losing ground to a Taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory.

The move by the Environmental Protection Agency to launch public debates between scientists on climate research, known as red-team, blue-team exercises, would be the first major effort by the Republican administration to challenge the long-standing scientific consensus on human-caused climate change.  Advocates who have petitioned the EPA to reverse the scientific finding underlying U.S. regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions see the proposal to scrutinize mainstream climate science as a first step in that direction. Its a way to survey the landscape before reopening the endangerment finding, said Myron Ebell, head of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, one of the groups that filed a petition with the agency to undo the 2009 scientific determination that formed the basis for the Democratic Obama administrations regulation of greenhouse gases. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had authority under the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from cars if the agency determined they endangered human health.  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has spoken several times about the merits of opening the climate change debate up to the public. The website Climatewire on Friday cited a senior administration official, who said Pruitt plans to launch the back-and-forth scientific critiques formally.  Francis Menton, a lawyer who filed an endangerment finding petition in January on behalf of the Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council, said Pruitt told an event at the Manhattan Institute think tank in New York on Friday that he would launch the debates in the next few months. Menton said he asked Pruitt whether he had made a decision on reopening the endangerment finding. Pruitt said the agency is weighing its options. The review can create a body of scientific work that can be trustworthy and dependable to make regulatory choices and decisions, said Rob Henneke, of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a third group that filed an endangerment finding petition.  Unlike the other two, it has challenged the legality of the endangerment finding, not the science. Environmental groups are confident that Pruitt will not be successful if he tries to undo the endangerment finding because they expect the courts will side with the scientific consensus that human beings cause climate change. Pruitt and the EPA would need to build up a new case that shows carbon dioxide is innocuous and counter the volumes of scientific research that support the finding. If he has any grasp of scientific and legal reality, he would realize that its a fools errand to reverse the endangerment determination, said David Doniger, climate director for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel.  This could be a way for him to keep the right-wing fringe groups occupied and also accomplish the goal of further confusing the public debate, he said. Ebell, who was also the transition leader of the Trump EPA, had previously been critical of Pruitts hesitation to take on the endangerment finding because of the time and staffing it would require.  The Trump administration has not yet appointed second-tier assistant administrators to run different policy divisions of the agency. I think (the red-team, blue-team process) is a logical first step, but I dont think it commits the administrator to anything yet, Ebell said. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The Senate then quickly overrode the vetoes, moving the final override to enact the bills over the governors vetoes to the House.  A stalemate between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nations fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two fiscal years.

Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moodys Investors Service, which rates Illinois at Baa3, one notch above junk, said on Tuesday a continuation of the states budget impasse would not bode well from a credit standpoint.

In his veto message, the governor lashed out at lawmakers for passing budget measures that he said would make Illinois fiscal woes worse. The package of legislation fails to address Illinois fiscal and economic crisis  and in fact, makes it worse in the long run. It does not balance the budget. It does not make nearly sufficient spending reductions, does not pay down our debt, and holds schools hostage to force a Chicago bailout, Rauner said.

Only 54 of the chambers 118 members were present on Tuesday afternoon - too few to conduct business under House rules.

Seventy-one votes are necessary to block Rauners vetoes.

Their Republican governors signed the budget bills after late-night negotiations with their respective state legislatures. New Jersey and Maine were two of nine states that had missed their deadlines for enacting budgets in time for the July 1 start of the fiscal year. Christie signed a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the states largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. All state parks and beaches would be open for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday, the governor said. Christie had remained unapologetic after the Star-Ledger newspaper captured the photos by hiring a plane to fly the New Jersey coastline, showing Christie with family and friends on a state beach on Sunday that was otherwise deserted because of the shutdown. The scandal became a popular topic on social media with images of Christie in his beach chair superimposed into places such as famous beach scenes in the movies From Here to Eternity and Planet of the Apes.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - During his presidential campaign, Republican Donald Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader with whom he would like to reset tense U.S.-Russian relations. But as Trump heads to his first face-to-face meeting as president with Putin on Friday at the G20 summit in Germany, he is under pressure at home to take a tough line with the Kremlin. Allegations of Russian meddling in last years U.S. election have alarmed both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who are pushing to extend tough sanctions placed on Russia following its 2014 annexation of Crimea, a peninsula belonging to Ukraine. Lawmakers including Republican Senator Cory Gardner are also concerned Russia has prolonged the civil war in Syria by backing its President Bashar al-Assad, a strongman whose forces have used chemical weapons against insurgents and civilians. The chaos has fueled instability in the region and a flood of migrants to Europe. President (Trump) needs to make it clear that the continued aggression by Russia around the globe ... is unacceptable, and that they will be held accountable, said Gardner, who was among six lawmakers invited by the White House last month to discuss foreign policy with Trump over dinner. Meanwhile, the appointment of a special counsel who is investigating potential links between the Russian government and members of the Trump campaign has weakened the presidents ability to maneuver with Russia, foreign policy experts say. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded Russia sponsored hacking of Democratic Party groups last year to benefit Trump over his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied those allegations while Trump has repeatedly dismissed the idea of any coordination between his campaign and Russia as a witch hunt. Still, just the optics of Trump meeting with Putin, a former KGB agent, are fraught with risk, foreign policy experts say. If (Trump) smiles, if he wraps his arm around Putin, if he says, Im honored to meet you, were going to find a way forward, ... I think Congress is going to react extremely negatively to that, said Julie Smith, a former national security aide in the Obama administration. Trump has signaled an interest in cooperating with Russia to defeat Islamic State in Syria and to reduce nuclear stockpiles. The White House has been mum on what Trump would be willing to give Russia in exchange for that help. But there has been speculation he could ratchet down sanctions, or even return two Russian diplomatic compounds in Maryland and Long Island. President Barack Obama seized those facilities and expelled 35 Russian diplomats just before he left office as punishment for the election hacks. While some administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, also support engagement, others, such as Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, have taken a hawkish line on Russia. The lack of a unified strategy has left U.S. allies anxious. And it has lowered expectations for American leadership to help resolve crises in Syria and Ukraine, where Russian cooperation would be critical. Trump is like a horse with his front legs tied, said a German diplomat, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. He cant make any big leaps forward on Russia. If he tried people would immediately suspect it was all part of some big conspiracy. Trumps administration is still reviewing its Russia policy, a process that may not be wrapped up for a couple of months, a U.S. official said. Speaking with reporters last week about Trumps upcoming meeting with Putin, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said his boss would like the United States and the entire West to develop a more constructive relationship with Russia. But hes also made clear that we will do what is necessary to confront Russias destabilizing behavior. Trump is just the latest president to grapple with the complicated U.S.-Russia dynamic. George W. Bush and Obama sought to improve the U.S. relationship with Russia early in their administrations only to see relations deteriorate later. Among the concerns for this president is Trumps apparent lack of interest in policy details and his tendency to wing it with foreign leaders.  McMaster told reporters that Trump has no specific agenda for his meeting with Putin and that topics would consist of whatever the president wants to talk about. Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama, said he feared Trump might be headed to the meeting without clear objectives. I hope that he would think about first: what is our objective in Ukraine? What is our objective in Syria? And secondarily, how do I go about achieving that in my meeting with Putin? McFaul said. Other Washington veterans say Trump wont be able to make meaningful progress with Russia on anything until he confronts Putin about the suspected election meddling. (Trump) really has to raise the Russian election hacking last year, and has to say something like, Vladimir, dont do this again. There will be consequences, said Steve Pifer, a long-time State Department official focused on U.S.-Russia relations. So far Trump has shown little inclination to do so, a situation that has heightened speculation about the potential impact from his coming encounter with the Russian leader.    The shadow of all these investigations hangs over this, said Angela Stent,a professor at Georgetown University and former National Intelligence Officer for Russia.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will use fast-growing supplies of U.S. natural gas as a political tool when he meets in Warsaw on Thursday with leaders of a dozen countries that are captive to Russia for their energy needs. In recent years, Moscow has cut off gas shipments during pricing disputes with neighboring countries in winter months. Exports from the United States would help reduce their dependence on Russia. Trump will tell the group that Washington wants to help allies by making it as easy as possible for U.S. companies to ship more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to central and eastern Europe, the White House said. Trump will attend the Three Seas summit - so named because several of its members surround the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas - before the Group of 20 leading economies meet in Germany, where he is slated to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. Among the aims of the Three Seas project is to expand regional energy infrastructure, including LNG import terminals and gas pipelines. Members of the initiative include Poland, Austria, Hungary and Russias neighbors Latvia and Estonia.  Trumps presence will give the project a lift, said James Jones, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. Increased U.S. gas exports to the region would help weaken the impact of Russia using energy as a weapon or bargaining chip, said Jones.      I think the United States can show itself as a benevolent country by exporting energy and by helping countries that dont have adequate supplies become more self-sufficient and less dependent and less threatened, he said. Trumps Russia policy is still taking shape, a process made awkward by investigations into intelligence findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Russia denies the allegations and Trump says his team did not collude with Moscow.  Lawmakers in Trumps Republican Party, many of whom want to see him take a hard line on Russia because of its interference in the election and in crises in Ukraine and Syria, support using gas exports for political leverage. It undermines the strategies of Putin and other strong men who are trying to use the light switch as an element of strategic offense, said Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Kremlin relies on oil and gas revenue to finance the state budget, so taking market share would hurt Moscow. In many ways, the LNG exports by the U.S. is the most threatening U.S. policy to Russia, said Michal Baranowski, director of the Warsaw office of think-tank the German Marshall Fund. The U.S. is expected to become the worlds third-largest exporter of LNG in 2020, just four years after starting up its first export terminal. U.S. exporters have sold most of that gas in long-term contracts, but there are still some volumes on offer, and more export projects on the drawing board. Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), which opened the first U.S. LNG export terminal in 2016, delivered its first cargo to Poland in June. Five more terminals are expected to be online by 2020. Tellurian Inc (TELL.O) has proposed a project with a price tag of as much as $16 billion that it hopes to complete by 2022, in time to compete for long-term contracts to supply Poland that expire the same year and are held by Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM). We would like to be a supplier that competes for that market, Tellurian Chief Executive Meg Gentle told Reuters. A global glut in supply may, however, limit U.S. LNG export growth, regardless of Trumps support. The glut has depressed prices and made it difficult for LNG exporters to turn a profit, said Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Russia has the advantage in Europe due to its proximity and pipeline connections. Europe is going to be the great competitive arena between Russian gas and LNG, said Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice-chairman with IHS Markit analysis firm. Europeans will be watching to see whether Trump clarifies his administrations position on a new pipeline to pump Russian gas to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2. The U.S. Senate in June passed a package of sanctions on Russia, including provisions to penalize Western firms involved in the pipeline. The new sanctions have stalled in the House of Representatives. The U.S. State Department has lobbied against the pipeline as a potential supply chokepoint that would make Europe more vulnerable to disruptions. The threat of sanctions adds to tensions between Washington and Berlin. Germanys government supports the pipeline, and Trumps position on it is a concern for European diplomats.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""NEW YORK (Reuters) - The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump opposed opening the door to grandparents from six Muslim-majority countries on Monday, arguing in a court filing that the governments interpretation of how to implement its temporary travel ban is based on U.S. immigration law. The U.S. Supreme Court in a ruling last Monday revived parts of Trumps March 6 executive order that banned people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, which had been blocked by lower courts. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible bona fide relationship with a U.S. person or entity. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks. But opponents, including states and refugee advocacy groups, sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminates against Muslims. After the Supreme Court ruling, the government said that a bona fide relationship means close family members only: parents, spouses, siblings and children. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from the six countries would still be banned.  The governments definition, hews closely to the categorical determinations articulated by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act, Department of Justice lawyers argued in court papers on Monday.   The governments filing came after the State of Hawaii last week went to U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who originally ruled to block the ban, to seek clarification of the Supreme Courts ruling, arguing the governments definition of bona fide relationship was too narrow. The government said Hawaii, and refugee organizations that filed a friend of the court brief in support of the state, were seeking to apply broader, free-hand rules. The refugee organizations had argued that their work to resettle refugees, a process that can take years of work in coordination with the U.S. government, qualifies as a bona fide relationship with a U.S. entity. Any refugees with such a relationship should be exempt from the three-month ban on refugees included in the executive order, according to the Supreme Court ruling.  But the government said workers with offers of employment with a U.S. company and international students are fundamentally different than refugees receiving help from U.S. resettlement agencies. A refugees relationship with the agency flows from the government, not from an independent relationship between the refugee and the resettlement agency, the government said in its brief. Indeed, resettlement agencies typically do not have any direct contact with the refugees they assure before their arrival in the United States.  Using the organizations interpretation would make the refugee provisions in the executive order largely meaningless, the government said.  U.S. refugee resettlement is continuing as normal until July 6, the State Department has said, around when the 50,000 cap for the fiscal year set by Trumps executive order is likely to be reached.  Late on Thursday, before the ban went into effect, the government reversed its position on fiancs, saying they could also qualify for exceptions. The court filing described a 72-hour scramble to coordinate among multiple government agencies, and issue detailed guidance on how to implement the Supreme Courts ruling.  The roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued on Friday compared to in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order, sparking protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

More than 20 states, including Virginia, Kentucky, California, New York and Massachusetts, have declined to provide some or all of the information that the panel requested, saying it was unnecessary and violated privacy. Republican Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May after making unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in last Novembers election. Calling the request repugnant, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement that his office had advised the State Board of Elections that the commissions request was illegal. The request appears designed only to intimidate voters and to indulge President Trumps fantasy that he won the popular vote, Frosh said. The commission sent a letter to the 50 states asking them to turn over voter information including names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories.  Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler said the presidential commission could purchase the limited information legally available to candidates running for office. Youre not going to play politics with Louisianas voter data, he said in a statement. Delaware Elections Commissioner Elaine Manlove said in an interview with Milfords WXDE-FM radio that her office would not comply since some of the information was confidential. Manlove said she was working with the attorney generals office to see if the request could be denied completely. Trump has blasted the states who have refused to turn over the data. He said in a tweet on Saturday, What are they trying to hide? Trump won the White House through victory in the Electoral College, which tallies wins in states, but he lost the popular vote to Clinton by some 3 million votes. He has claimed he would have won the popular vote had it not been for voter fraud. Civil rights activists say the commission will encourage voter suppression by justifying new barriers to voting, such as requiring identity cards to vote.

Ty Cobb, a white-collar defense lawyer with the firm of Hogan Lovells and a former federal prosecutor, met with Trump about a week ago, another person said. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the administration had no announcement at this time.  Cobb did not respond to requests for comment except to say he was on vacation. Cobb, 66,represented a number of individuals in government investigations during the Clinton administration, including former Democratic National Committee fundraiser John Huang and former White House aide David Watkins. Trump has been seeking a senior-level lawyer to join the office led by White House Counsel Don McGahn to focus on the various Russia investigations, one of the people said. In addition to a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller, several congressional panels are investigating Russias alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion by Trumps campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and Trump has denied any collusion. The role Cobb met with Trump about is separate from the legal team gathering to represent the president personally. That team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, now includes constitutional lawyer and evangelical radio talk show host Jay Sekulow, Washington lawyer John Dowd, and Michael Bowe, a partner at Kasowitzs firm. According to sources familiar with the matter, lawyers from major firms have turned down joining Trumps outside legal team, citing conflicts at their firms and concerns Trump would not listen to them.   Others lawyers have also turned down the role for which Cobb is being considered. William Burck, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, and Emmet Flood, a partner at Williams & Connolly, both turned down the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. Cobb, a distant relative of the famous baseball player of the same name, graduated from Harvard University and earned his law degree at Georgetown. In the 1980s, he was a federal prosecutor in Baltimore, where he led a regional drug and organized crime task force.  Cobb has some experience with leaks, which Trump has repeatedly complained about in relation to the Russia probes. In 2006, Cobb represented former CIA official Mary McCarthy, who was fired after she was accused of providing classified information to reporters. No charges were brought against McCarthy.

Since Trump was elected U.S. president, Russian has been keenly anticipating his first meeting with Putin, hoping it would trigger a reset in U.S.-Russia relations that plunged to post-Cold War lows under Trumps predecessor, Barack Obama. But with Trump embroiled in a row at home over his associates links to Moscow, the encounter with Putin has become a minefield. Too warm a meeting would allow Trumps domestic opponents to accuse him of being a Kremlin stooge. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters the Trump-Putin meeting would happen on the sidelines of the G20 summit, in Hamburg, but it was not yet finalised how it would fit into the summits schedule. We will be looking for certain breaks, windows to hold this, the most important, meeting, Ushakov said. We have a lot of issues, which should be discussed at the highest level ... Thats why this meeting, this first personal contact, is so important. Asked about the agenda for the meeting, Ushakov said: Ive heard the Americans want to raise the issues of terrorism and Syria. It seems to me that would be pretty reasonable. Ushakov said that ties between Russia and the United States were at zero level. The Kremlin aide urged the United States to save us from the need to retaliate against Washington for expelling Russian diplomats and seizing two Russian diplomatic compounds on U.S. soil, one in Maryland and the other on Long Island. Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of the 35 Russians in late December last year, seized the compounds, and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over what he said was their involvement in hacking political groups in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Russian has denied interfering in the U.S. election. Putin said at the time he would not retaliate immediately, in the expectation that relations would improve under Trump.

In Maine, a bipartisan budget committee met in Augusta in hopes of breaking a stalemate between Republican Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers. The shutdown came after LePage threatened to veto a compromise reached by lawmakers in the states $7.055 billion, two-year budget. At New Jerseys statehouse in Trenton, there was little evidence of progress in resolving a fight over a health insurance bill that Republican Governor Chris Christie said must be passed alongside the states budget.  Maine state police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue planned to operate during the shutdown, the states first since 1991, but the majority of 12,000 state employees will be furloughed. New Jersey residents were not so lucky. With the July 4 holiday weekend in full swing, the shutdown there included the closure of Island State Beach Park, one of New Jerseys few free public beaches, and all other state parks.  Although he beach park was closed to the public, Christie took a state helicopter on Saturday to a gubernatorial residence there to be with family and said he would go back on Sunday night.  Thats just the way it goes. Run for governor, and you have can have a residence there, he said when pressed on the issue.  At a news conference on Sunday afternoon, the governor said he had not spoken since Friday to Democratic holdouts.  The impasse could mean a furlough for 30,000 to 35,000 state employees on Monday. In Maine, the stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure voters approved in November for a 3 percent income tax hike on residents earning more than $200,000 a year. It also contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million. LePage has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes. A six-member bipartisan House-Senate budget panel huddled into the evening on Sunday seeking to reach a deal that would win the two-thirds vote needed for passage of an emergency budget bill in both legislative chambers. Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon, said a new compromise could be ready for a vote as early as Monday morning, about the time state employees planned to protest the shutdown at the capitol. A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Sunday. At the center of New Jerseys stalemate was a plan by Christie to shake up the states largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, which he said lacked sufficient transparency and spent too much on salaries.  He threatened to cut $150 million in school funding and other items unless lawmakers adopt his proposal, which would redirect some of Horizons reserves to drug addiction treatment and other services. Christie offered to hear Democrats proposals for breaking the impasse, saying: It should end today, but acknowledged a settlement was unlikely so soon. Christie, a former presidential contender whose reputation was tarnished by the Bridgegate traffic scandal involving some of his closest aides, ranks as the least popular governor in state history. He is in his second and final term. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto and other Democrats have criticized the Horizon bill as bad public policy, insisting that it be considered after the budget is passed. Christie blamed Prieto for the shutdown and vowed on Sunday to stand by the Horizon bill, saying: I got elected by a lot more people than Vinnie Prieto did.

The $5 billion tax package, which passed in a 72-45 vote and drew an immediate veto threat from Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, would boost the personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent from 3.75 percent and the corporate rate to 7 percent from 5.25 percent. It would also close tax loopholes and expand tax credits. The spending plan won passage in a 81-34 vote. Both bills now head to the Democratic-led Senate, which returns to session on Monday, for concurrence votes. The countrys fifth most populous state began an unprecedented third-straight fiscal year on Saturday without a complete budget. A fiscal stalemate between Illinois governor and Democrats who control the legislature has pounded the states credit ratings to a step above junk and ballooned its unpaid bill backlog to $15 billion. The pair of decisive House votes set Democrats on a collision course with Rauner, who vowed to veto the 32 percent personal income tax hike he pinned to House Speaker Michael Madigan.  The legislature could have passed a no reform budget like this one two years ago, Rauner said in a statement. Instead, they allowed Mike Madigan to play his political games, passed phony budgets, racked up our debt and inflicted pain on the most vulnerable. Rauner has insisted for two years that a budget becoupled with a property tax freeze and legislative term limits, among other things. In order for Rauner to match his tough words with results, he will have to persuade at least two of the 15 House Republicans to switch their yes votes in favor of the tax hike legislation. The measure passed the House with one more vote than the threshold necessary to override a gubernatorial veto. In his own statement after the votes, Madigan praised how Republicans and Democrats together took a crucial step toward reaching a compromise that ends the budget crisis by passing a fully funded state budget in a bipartisan way. The tax legislation would give the state a revenue boost to support a full-year budget and start paying down the bill pile that was on track to grow even larger after a federal judge on Friday ordered increased payments on Medicaid provider bills. In giving Democratic supporters the narrow margin to move thelegislation to the state Senate, some House Republicans shed tears during debate, predicted their tax votes could topple them politically in nextyears elections anddelivered a pointed challenge to Rauner to set aside his budgetary preconditions and do what was right for the states fiscal health. I say to the governor, if these bills pass the House and Senate, the revenue bill and expenditure bill, we will have sent you a balanced budget. Have the courage to do what is right and sign the bills, said State Representative David Harris, who was among 15 Republicans to side with Democrats. Bring this madness to an end. Their defiance came after House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, aRauner ally, noted the deal was not negotiated with the governor and did not representan exercise in good faith, given that negotiations involving some of the governors non-budgetary priorities were shunted to the sidelines.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump stepped up his feud with the media on Sunday by tweeting a mock video of himself tackling and repeatedly striking a man with a CNN logo super-imposed in place of his head, followed by a logo saying Fraud News Network.  The video appeared to be a modified version of a 2007 appearance by Trump at World Wrestling Entertainments WrestleMania 23 promotion, in which Trump takes down WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. In Sundays video, McMahons head has been replaced with the CNN logo.  After Trump appears to beat on the CNN effigy, a logo, \""FNN Fraud News Network\"" appears at the bottom of the screen in script similar to that of CNN.  Trump appointed McMahons wife, Linda McMahon, as the head of the Small Business Administration, a Cabinet-level agency. She was active in the management of WWE for many years.  As a presidential candidate and as commander-in-chief, Trump has repeatedly made known his disdain for the media, calling it the enemy of the American people and frequently referring to mainstream news organizations as failing or fake news. He has been particularly scathing of CNN.  The video takes his criticism to a new level and drew criticism from CNN and on social media.  It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters, CNN said in a statement.  Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladimir Putin, dealing with North Korea and working on his health care bill, he is instead involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office, CNN said.  Trump leaves later this week for a trip to Poland and Germany, where he will attend a meeting of Group of 20 leaders including the Russian president.  White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Thomas Bossert said the tweet was not a threat.  I think that no one would perceive that as a threat. I hope they dont, Bossert said on the ABC program This Week.  But I do think that hes beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to, Bossert said.  The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a group that advocates for journalists rights, condemned the presidents tweet and said it glorified physical violence against members of the press.  Bill Kristol, the conservative commentator and editor-at-large of The Weekly Standard, compared Trumps actions to behavior that caused the fall of the Roman Empire.  The speed with which were recapitulating the decline and fall of Rome is impressive. What took Rome centuries were achieving in months, Kristol wrote in a Tweet.  Trumps Sunday tweet followed his scathing and highly personal Twitter attack on two MSNBC anchors last week, which drew condemnation from Republicans, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, and Democrats alike.  Trump, who is spending a long weekend at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey, took to Twitter on Saturday to call the media fake and fraudulent.  At an event honoring veterans at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Saturday evening, he told the crowd that the media had tried to stop him from coming to the White House.  But Im president, and theyre not, he said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL, he wrote on Twitter. What are they trying to hide? More than 20 states, including Virginia, Kentucky, California, New York and Massachusetts, have declined to provide some or all of the information, saying it was unnecessary and violated privacy. This commission was formed to try to find basis for the lie that President Trump put forward that has no foundation, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told Reuters previously in an interview. The Republican president has made unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in last Novembers election. Trumps Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, created in May, sent a letter to 50 states asking them to turn over voter information including names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories. The request from commission Vice Chairman Kris Kobach has caused a backlash from state election officials. Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson said in a statement on Friday that while certain voter information is available to the public, the media, and any other person who requests the information, the information is restricted to name, address and congressional district assignment. Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann had said in a statement that he did not see the letter but would rebuff the commission. They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mississippi is a great state to launch from, he said. Trump won the White House through victory in the Electoral College, which tallies wins in states, but he lost the popular vote to Clinton by some 3 million votes. He has claimed he would have won the popular vote had it not been for voter fraud.

While the House scheduled session on Sunday to take up a revenue package, the Senate is not slated to return until Monday. The nations fifth-largest state has lacked a full operating budget since July 2015 and is under a warning from S&P that it will drop Illinois creditworthiness to the lowest of any state in history if it fails to pass a fiscal 2018 budget that starts to address a chronic structural deficit. Talks between Democrats who control the Illinois House and Republicans had shown signs of progress as both sides rallied behind a $36.5 billion spending blueprint on Friday and were poised to build on that positive movement in a rare Fourth of July holiday weekend legislative session. Instead, tensions broke out on the House floor between House Republican Leader Jim Durkin and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, who initially informed the legislative chamber that no budget votes would be taken on Sunday. Saying well gavel out and return at some point [Sunday] to me does not send a message to Illinoisans that were prepared to bring this to resolution any time soon, said Durkin, the Republican Partys legislative proxy for Governor Bruce Rauner, who has stayed on the sidelines of recent budget negotiations. Madigan walked off the floor a short time later to the shout of Speaker Junk from State Representative Grant Wehrli, a suburban Chicago Republican. By late afternoon, Madigan reversed course and said there indeed would be a vote on a tax-increase package Sunday, neglecting any mention of accompanying votes on a local property tax freeze or workers compensation reforms that are two of Rauners key demands under negotiation. In a statement, Madigan said he was encouraged by the progress in talks with Durkin and vowed to vote Sunday on a revenue package modeled on the bill supported by the governor and House and Senate Republicans. Durkin made clear in his own statement that there is no agreement on a comprehensive budget package that includes reforms and revenue, contradicting Madigan and painting a dim outlook for bipartisan consensus on Sunday. This impasse can only be resolved in a negotiated manner, Durkin said. It is our hope that Democrats will remain at the negotiating table.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - A budget impasse between Maine Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers triggered a shutdown of nonessential state services on Saturday, after the conservative Republican threatened to veto a bipartisan compromise reached by lawmakers. LePage has insisted on a budget with deeper spending cuts than those contemplated by lawmakers and has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes. This is about the future of Maine. The Maine people are taxed enough. I will not tax them anymore and in my budget overall taxes were decreased, LePage said in a statement announcing the partial shutdown, the first in the state since 1991. The governors order for a partial closure of state government went into effect at 12:01 a.m. local time after negotiations stalled over a $7.055 billion, two-year budget. A six-member bipartisan budget committee with lawmakers from the House and Senate had reached a deal on a proposed budget late on Thursday night, but LePage signaled he would veto the package because it included some tax increases. The Republican-controlled Senate passed the package by a 34-1 vote on Friday, and later in the day the Democratic-controlled House approved it by an 87-60 vote. But the margin of approval fell short of the two-thirds threshold needed to override LePages threatened veto. Even if two-thirds of the House voted for approval, state law gives the two-term governor up to 10 days to respond to the legislation, allowing for a partial shutdown during that time.  State police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue will continue to operate during the current shutdown, LePage has said. A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Lawmakers met in the state capital Augusta on Saturday, but they had no formal counterproposal from the governor to consider, said Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon. Right now we are in a very fluid situation where we dont have anything in front of us, Casale said by telephone. The stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure that voters approved in November to impose an additional 3 percent income tax on state residents who earn more than $200,000 a year. But it contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, Casale said, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged Republican senators in a tweet on Friday to repeal Obamacare immediately if they cannot agree on a new plan to replace it, muddying the waters as congressional leaders struggle for consensus on healthcare legislation. Senate Republican leaders had set Friday as the target for rewriting legislation for a simultaneous repeal and replacement of extensive parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the law dubbed Obamacare that expanded health insurance coverage to 20 million people. The deadline seemed unlikely to be met given that most senators had left Washington ahead of next weeks recess, without agreement on a clear direction for the healthcare bill, and Trumps tweet did not appear to gain political traction. Financial markets showed little reaction to Trumps suggestion, with the benchmark S&P 500 index edging about 0.15 percent higher on the day. Shares of most health insurers gained fractionally while hospital stocks were little changed. Trump wrote on Twitter Friday morning, If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!  The White House said later that Trump was still fully committed to pushing the Republican draft healthcare bill through the Senate, although it was looking at every option for repealing and replacing Obamacare. The president hasnt changed his thinking at all, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The current Senate legislation would repeal parts of Obamacare, roll back its expansion of the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor, eliminate most of Obamacares taxes and replace Obamacare insurance subsidies with a system of tax credits to help individuals buy private health insurance. Conservative and moderate Republicans have spent recent days pushing and pulling the bill in opposite directions as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell sought common ground. Moderates want more equity for low-income Americans, while conservatives are fighting to loosen insurance regulations. Shortly before his January inauguration, Trump urged lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time.  Congressional Republicans had considered earlier this year first repealing, then replacing Obamacare, but backed away after some lawmakers protested that that approach could create a gap in insurance coverage for millions. On Friday, Republican Senator Ben Sasse who had suggested that Congress first repeal Obamacare and then replace it, tweeted: Glad you agree, Mr. Pres. Conservative Senator Rand Paul also backed the idea. But others on Capitol Hill sounded annoyed. A senior Senate Republican aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if lawmakers had been able to get the votes for repealing Obamacare first, then replacing it, senators would have done that in January. It doesnt have the votes, and its a waste of valuable time to discuss it. Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, said the lawmaker would not support the strategy. McConnells spokesman declined to comment on Trumps tweet.    A senior House of Representatives Republican, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, said in an interview for CSPANs Newsmakers program that lawmakers goal should continue to be not simply repealing but to start to put into place the elements that can make healthcare affordable.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called for a determined response to North Korea after talks with South Koreas President Moon Jae-in on Friday where he stressed the importance of their alliance but took aim at Seoul over trade and sharing the cost of defense. Trump said the United States was renegotiating what he characterized as a rough trade deal with South Korea agreed to five years ago by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and reiterated that an era of strategic patience over North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile programs had ended. Together we are facing the threat of the reckless and brutal regime in North Korea, Trump said as he stood alongside Moon in the White House Rose Garden. The nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that regime require a determined response. Despite the tough rhetoric, it remains unclear how Trump will find a way forward on North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has warned the consequences of any military solution would be tragic on an unbelievable scale. Trump had pinned his hopes on persuading China, North Koreas neighbor and main trading partner, to do more to rein in Pyongyang, although he has lately grown frustrated that Beijing has not taken stronger action.  Trump called on regional powers to implement sanctions and demand North Korea choose a better path and do it quickly. Moon, who warned of a stern response to any provocations, urged Pyongyang to return promptly to talks. Our two leaders will employ both sanctions and dialogue in a phased and comprehensive approach, Moon said of South Korea and the United States. Trump and Moon have said they are open to renewed dialogue with North Korea but only under circumstances that would lead to Pyongyang giving up its weapons programs. Moon told an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank that moves by North Korea that could create conditions for dialogue could include a freeze on its nuclear and missile tests, or the release of three Americans it is holding in the country. To be successful, talks would have to involve North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and have as their ultimate aim the complete dismantling of North Koreas nuclear program, he added.    Trump sought to woo China since a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April but the honeymoon period appears to be over. On Thursday, the United States targeted a Chinese bank and sanctioned Chinese individuals and a firm for dealing with North Korea and approved a $1.42 billion arms deal with Taiwan - decisions that angered Beijing. South Korea is a long-standing American ally but Trump has spoken harshly about U.S. trade imbalances and threatened to tear up the bilateral trade pact. We will do more to remove barriers to reciprocal trade and market access, Trump said, adding that the two leaders had talked about the thorny trade areas of steel and autos. Trump said he was encouraged by Moons assurances that he would seek a level playing field for American workers and businesses, particularly automakers. A joint statement said the two sides had agreed to work together to reduce over supply of basic materials such as steel and non-tariff barriers. It also said Trump had accepted an invitation from Moon to visit South Korea this year.  Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it was unwise for Trump to air the trade issue so publicly. Public complaints by Trump about unfair trade and inadequate defense spending provide opportunities for China and North Korea to drive a wedge between the allies, she said. Trump also emphasized the need to ensure equitable sharing of costs for defense, returning to a theme he raised during his campaign and brought up with other allies, including NATO countries and Japan. A senior U.S. official said in a briefing before the presidents meeting with Moon that South Korea was in many respects a model ally, given its spending of 2.7 percent of GDP on defense and Moons plan to grow capabilities. We shouldnt view South Korea as somehow laggard on that front, the official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since the U.S.-Korea free trade pact known as KORUS took effect in 2012. The agreement was forecast to boost U.S. exports by $10 billion a year, but in 2016 they were $3 billion lower than in 2011. At the start of Fridays talks, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the largest component of the deficit was automotive trade and many non-tariff barriers to U.S. auto exports to South Korea remained. I think the way to address it is to deal product by product with what we can do to change the export side and what we can do to reduce the bad imports side, he said. Ross said later on Friday that some progress had been made in the talks. The current pact was agreed to despite protests by supporters of Moon, who was then in opposition. But analysts have suggested that given the need to preserve a unified front in the face of a hostile North Korea, there could be compromise on both sides to resolve issues.

The record stalemate between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has put the third-most populous U.S. states credit rating in peril of dropping to junk. House Republicans on Friday helped advance a Democratic-drafted $36.5 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that begins on Saturday, but the deal stalled with negotiations continuing over a revenue package and an assortment of non-budgetary matters sought by Rauner. After a 90-25 test vote on the spending bill, House Speaker Michael Madigan said his legislative chamber will return to session on Saturday, and he sent letters to major bond-rating agencies imploring them not to downgrade the states credit ratings to junk as budget talks continue. The impasse has ballooned the unpaid bill pile to nearly $15 billion as the state operated on spending mandated by state law and courts. Illinois, already the lowest-rated state, risked becoming the first U.S. state to have its credit downgraded to junk. Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moodys Investors Service, which rates Illinois one notch above junk at Baa3 with a negative outlook, said the rating agency wont refrain from changing a rating no matter the reason when its appropriate to take action. S&P, which also rates Illinois one step above junk at BBB-minus, and Fitch Ratings, which has the state at BBB, declined to comment on Madigans letter. Ahead of the House vote, Republican leader Jim Durkin said he and others in his caucus would support the budget bill amendment as a gesture of good faith while talks continue on new taxes and non-budgetary reforms.  We are close, he said on the House floor. We are so close I can taste it.  House budget votes require Republican support to meet a three-fifths majority needed for passage. I think its a good step forward, a step we can build upon. Theres much work yet to be done, Madigan said following the vote. A final affirmative vote by the House on the spending plan would send it back to the Senate for concurrence. The House must still take up a revenue bill increasing personal and corporate income tax rates to raise more money for the cash-strapped state.

The order by Judge Joan Lefkow also stipulated that Illinois send $2 billion to Medicaid providers during the fiscal year that starts on Saturday to pay down the existing $3.1 billion backlog of unpaid bills. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, whose office pays the states bills, said the ruling takes the states finances from horrific to catastrophic and called on state lawmakers to immediately pass a budget. Payments to the states pension funds; state payroll including legislator pay; general state aid to schools and payments to local governments  in some combination  will likely have to be cut, she said in a statement. Payments to the states bond-holders will continue uninterrupted. The decision came as Illinois lawmakers failed to reach consensus on a budget on Friday, leaving a state with the worst credit rating in the nation poised to enter a third-straight fiscal year without a full operating budget. Governor Bruce Rauners office had no comment on the ruling. Lefkow had issued an order on June 7 that concluded Illinois was not complying with federal consent decrees regarding Medicaid. That order allowed attorneys representing Illinois 3 million Medicaid recipients to seek a subsequent order forcing the state to increase payments to managed-care organizations, which in turn pay doctors, hospitals and others. In her latest order, the judge said the state failed to offer a payment plan that would result in substantial compliance with the consent decrees that stemmed from lawsuits filed against Illinois in 1992. Attorneys representing Medicaid recipients said Illinois, which has been allocating only $160 million a month to the healthcare program, will be able to subsequently seek reimbursement for about half of the higher payment from the federal government.  Without these payments, doctors, hospitals, clinics and other key healthcare providers would stop seeing Medicaid patients, or else simply go out of business altogether, Tom Yates of the Legal Council for Health Justice said in a statement. Illinois unprecedented budget impasse between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has ballooned the states unpaid bill pile to about $15 billion.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps administration has dropped plans for an executive order that will require all U.S. food aid to be transported on American ships after members of Congress protested, congressional and aid sources said on Friday. Reuters reported on Thursday that Trump was considering issuing an order that would have increased to 100 percent the current requirement that 50 percent of such aid be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stopped short of confirming information about the order but said he had discussed the issue with Trump and that he understands that the shift would have increased the cost of food aid and caused more people to starve. I had a good conversation today with President Trump, Corker said in a statement emailed to Reuters. As a businessman, he understands that expanding the cargo preference would substantially drive up the cost of food aid and cause more people to starve around the world, Corker said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative originally touted as part of Trumps America First platform might have slowed food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said. Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the worlds largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer. Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of USAIDs Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, welcomed the administrations decision to drop the order.  Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, said that with four potential famines in the world it would have been the worst possible moment to be shifting money out of hungry mouths and into subsidies for big shipping conglomerates. Corker has been pushing for years to reform the U.S. food aid program, including by eliminating the cargo preference. He said in his statement he looked forward to working with Congress and the administration to achieve long overdue reforms. After hearing about the possible executive order, several members of Congress called the White House to express their concern, congressional aides said.  The administrations budget proposal has suggested slashing foreign aid in general while increasing defense spending. That plan was also met with stiff opposition in Congress, as lawmakers argued that soft power options such as food and medical aid and disaster recovery assistance can be effective tools in foreign policy that should not be discounted. Supporters say Trumps initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict.  Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, critics argue, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military. They said the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people.

In a June 30 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, lawmakers from the moderate Tuesday Group said that including hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to mandatory programs could be extremely problematic for tax reform and asked for a budget delay until Senate Republicans finish their debate on healthcare legislation. We fear that if the House persists on pursuing this course, it could imperil tax reform, wrote the lawmakers, who were led by Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. Republicans must pass a 2018 budget resolution to unlock a key legislative tool known as reconciliation, which the party needs to move a tax bill forward without support from Democrats.  But members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus say they will back a spending plan only if it cuts mandatory programs including Medicaid and food stamps, reductions that moderates oppose. House Republicans have made significant progress on budget decisions and these family discussions will continue amongst the conference, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement. The Freedom Caucus and Tuesday Group each represents enough House Republicans to stymie legislation on its own.  Outside organizations including powerful business lobby groups are increasingly worried that the disagreement could lead to a political stand-off that prevents tax reform from occurring. No other reforms under consideration rise to the importance of pro-growth, comprehensive tax reform, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business said in a joint letter to Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday. Republican moderates also worry that adding mandatory cuts to a reconciliation bill would create unpalatable legislation that reduces benefits for the poor while granting tax cuts to corporations and wealthy individuals, according to aides.  The House Budget Committee canceled plans to send a resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, after the chairmen of several other committees rejected efforts to wring $250 billion in mandatory spending from spending.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department on Friday defended its authority to use salary levels to decide who was eligible for overtime pay but distanced itself from an Obama administration rule that greatly expanded the number of qualifying workers. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the Labor Department has continued to fight a challenge to an Obama administration-era rule to raise the pay threshold for overtime eligibility. But it has not endorsed the former administrations move to nearly double that threshold, an increase strongly opposed by business groups.  The Labor Department told a federal appeals court on Friday it had the power to use salaries to set thresholds for mandatory overtime pay, without advocating for the $47,500 maximum salary level set by the department under Obama. The Labor Department is challenging a November decision from a federal judge in Texas that blocked the Obama rule, a decision that the department said could prevent it from setting a new threshold below that set by the Obama administration.  The Obama rule was expected to extend overtime pay eligibility to more than 4 million salaried workers. Nevada and 20 other states sued last year to block the rule. Business groups criticized the increase as too drastic and costly, potentially forcing employers to convert salaried workers to hourly wages. Trumps Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta said during his confirmation hearing in March that the correct threshold might be around $33,000. The Labor Department took initial steps earlier this week to begin developing a new threshold. In its Friday brief to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, the Labor Department made it clear it did not support the salary threshold developed under Obama. But the department told the court it was reluctant to move forward with the rulemaking necessary to set a new threshold as long as its authority was in question. Nevada and the other states have said that the use of a salary threshold to determine overtime eligibility has been controversial for decades, but appeals courts allowed it because it had been set low enough to exempt management workers.  But the Obama administration rule is far more drastic, the states said, expanding overtime pay to tens of thousands of state employees. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, criticized the Labor Departments handling of the appeal, saying in a statement that the administration appears to be preparing to roll back overtime protections for millions of workers.

The government is sending federal agents to Chicago and plans to prosecute firearms cases aggressively, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Fox News when asked about Trumps statement about the plan in an early-morning Twitter post. Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year! Trump wrote on Twitter. The president has regularly singled out Chicagos violent crime problem and in January decried the high crime rate in the third-most populous U.S. city as carnage. In 2016, the number of murders in Chicago exceeded 760, a jump of nearly 60 percent, and was more than New York and Los Angeles combined. There were more than 4,300 shooting victims in the city last year, according to police.  The number of murders, shootings and shooting victims have all decreased slightly this year in the city of 2.7 million. There have been 320 murders, down from 322 over the same period last year. There have been 1,703 shooting victims, down from 1,935, according to police figures.  Sessions said the anti-crime policies in Chicago have not worked and police have been demoralized in many ways. The federal assistance will come in the form of the Chicago Crime Gun Strike Force, a collaboration between the police and the Department of Justices Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).  The group, including police officers, federal agents and intelligence analysts, will work to impede the flow of illegal guns throughout Chicago and target repeat gun offenders.  The Trump Administration will not let the bloodshed go on; we cannot accept these levels of violence, Sessions said in a statement on Friday afternoon. The group became operational on June 1, Sessions said.  It will significantly help our police officers stem the flow of illegal guns and create a culture of accountability for the gangs that drive violence in the city, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a statement. On Monday, the Chicago police announced that the ATFs mobile ballistics lab had arrived in the city to help process shooting scenes.  Six months ago we made it clear that we would welcome additional federal support, and six months later we appreciate the 20 new ATF agents that are now arriving, Adam Collins, a spokesman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, said.  But the progress CPD (Chicago Police Department) has made this year has happened without any of the new resources from the federal government we requested. Chicago is also in the midst of reforming its police department after a federal investigation found officers routinely violated the civil rights of people, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct. Joseph Ferguson, the citys inspector general, called on Chicago officials to agree to a consent decree to oversee changes to the department at a committee meeting on Tuesday  splitting with the mayor, who has said a court-enforced settlement is not necessary for reform. In response to questions about Fergusons comments, Emanuel told reporters on Wednesday that the Justice Department has walked away from doing consent decrees, and so the city has sought a different strategy.  There are multiple roads that allow you to make sure you make the changes and reform, he said.  ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The second-term Republican said repeatedly this week that he would be ready to close down non-essential government services as the July 4 holiday weekend starts if the lawmakers cannot agree on a $7.055 billion two-year budget that would require no new taxes. The deal reached late on Thursday called for $7.1 billion in spending. Im out of ink, LePage told reporters in the state capital of Augusta. There will not be a signature on a budget that increases taxes. The full legislature was due to vote on Friday, the day after a six-member bipartisan budget committee reached a deal that would repeal a measure that voters approved in November to impose an additional 3 percent income tax on state residents who earn more than $200,000 a year. The proposed budget also increases public education funding by $162 million. The leaders of Maines Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and Republican-controlled Senate supported the measure, but it was unclear if they could garner the two-thirds support needed for passage. Even if they do, state law gives the governor 10 days to respond to any budget passed by the legislature. LePage said on Friday that he was ready to wait that long before vetoing any budget that raises taxes. Most of the government would shut during that time. Without a shutdown, I lose all my leverage for negotiation for the next 10 days, LePage said, adding that he did not think lawmakers could reach a budget deal on Friday that he would accept.  State police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue would continue to operate during a shutdown, LePage has said. The states Democratic House speaker urged lawmakers to back the budget deal. In a divided government, compromise is the only option, Speaker Sara Gideon said in a statement. A Maine advocacy group sued the state in federal court on Thursday, seeking an order that would ensure that public assistance payments continue uninterrupted to the 450,000 people, about one in three residents, who receive them. In 1991 Maines government shut down for several weeks due to a budget impasse, and lawmakers reached a deal only after furloughed state workers picketed the capitol.

He appears to have a fragile, impetuous, child-like ego that weve seen over and over again, especially with women, Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBCs Morning Joe, said on the program. He attacks women because he fears women, added co-host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican U.S. congressman. Brzezinski and Scarborough fired back on their program and in an opinion piece in The Washington Post after Trumps Twitter messages on Thursday, which attacked them, particularly Brzezinski, in highly personal terms. Trump called Brzezinski low I.Q. Crazy Mika and alleged that she was bleeding badly from a face-lift when she visited his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida around New Years Eve. He called Scarborough Psycho Joe. Scarborough said Trump packed five or six lies into two tweets, including mischaracterizing their meetings at Mar-a-Lago. Brzezinski said she has never had a face-lift. Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, speaking on ABCs Good Morning America, defended Trumps ability to fight back when he is attacked. She declined to endorse the content of his tweets. Well its incredible to watch people play armchair psychologist, outright ridiculing the presidents physicalities, his mental state, calling him names that you wont want your children to call people on a playground, Conway told Fox News. Trumps tweets, his latest attacks on the U.S. news media, were roundly condemned by lawmakers in both parties and became a distraction as his fellow Republicans in the Senate try to iron out their differences over major healthcare legislation. Brzezinski and Scarborough, who were on friendly terms with Trump in the past but have been critical of him since he took office in January, described White House pressure over a planned negative story about them in the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper.  Trump was friends with David Pecker, chief executive of the National Enquirers parent company, American Media, Inc. The tabloid specializes in scandalous stories about celebrities and has been supportive of Trump.  This year, top White House staff members warned that the National Enquirer was planning to publish a negative article about us unless we begged the president to have the story spiked. We ignored their desperate pleas, they wrote in the Post. Scarborough said on the program he received calls from three top administration officials asking the co-hosts to call Trump and apologize for their coverage of his administration. They told him that if he called and apologized, Trump would get the story killed, Scarborough said. He did not identify the administration officials. The calls kept coming, and kept coming. And they were like Call, you need to call. Please call. Come on, Joe. Just pick up the phone and call him, Scarborough said. Thats blackmail, said MSNBC panelist Donny Deutsch. In a Twitter post on Friday, Trump gave a different account, saying Scarborough called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no! American Media said in a statement we have no knowledge of any discussions between the White House and Joe and Mika about our story, and absolutely no involvement in those discussions. I am very concerned as to what this once again reveals about the president of the United States, Brzezinski, who is engaged to be married to Scarborough, said of Trumps Twitter attacks. President Trump launched personal attacks against us Thursday, but our concerns about his unmoored behavior go far beyond the personal. Americas leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether this man is fit to be president, the co-hosts wrote in the Post column. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

U.S. officials have said President Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inability to restrain North Koreas arms and missile programs.  This week, the United States imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company for helping North Koreas weapons programs, announced a $1.4 billion arms sale for Taiwan, and said it would like sick Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo to be treated elsewhere. It has also placed China on its global list of the worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labor and senior U.S. officials have told Reuters that Washington is considering trade actions against Beijing, including tariffs on steel imports. Trump met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday at the White House and made a point of noting that the United States, India and Japan would be joining together in naval exercises soon in the Indian Ocean, a point that seemed aimed at China. Its a long way from the bromance that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to have at their first summit in April. Trump had made a grand gesture of his desire for warm ties in the meeting at his Florida residence and subsequently called Xi a good man. While China said it was outraged at the arms sales for Taiwan, and upset with the North Korea-related sanctions, it did not make specific threats of retaliation. In 2010, Beijing threatened to sanction U.S. firms that sell weapons to Taiwan after Washington announced a much bigger $6.4 billion arms package. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he hoped the United States can correct its mistakes and get ties back on track so as to avoid cooperation in important areas being impacted. He did not elaborate. Jia Qingguo, dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University and who has advised the government on foreign policy, cautioned against interpreting recent events as indicating a shift in China-U.S. relations, saying it was still too early to tell. We had a good first summit and a good beginning but the relationship in the long run is characterized by not just cooperation but also conflict, Jia said. Arms sales to Taiwan, the South China Sea and East China Sea, and other problems in the relationship will appear. Its a question of how much the two countries will be able to manage these conflicts, whether they can manage them better than the previous administration. Trump and Xi are expected to meet next week on the sidelines of a G20 summit in the Germany city of Hamburg. China has long been cautious about Trump, China-based diplomatic sources say, believing he is unpredictable and needs to be handled with care. How does the Chinese government view Trump? Were still discovering who he is. He often does things we cant predict. Were not clever enough to predict what hell do, said Shen Dingli, a professor at Shanghais elite Fudan University. Trump upset China even before taking office, taking a call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, overturning decades of precedent of no high-level official contacts between the United States and an island China considers to be a wayward province.  While China has worked hard to get Trump to understand the importance of Taiwan to the China-U.S. relationship, it has never seriously expected Washington to stop selling it weapons, provision for which is explicitly made in U.S. law. The U.S. selling weapons to Taiwan is routine, said Shen. Theyre selling much less than before, and thats much better. So I dont think theres anything too terrible about that. Still, the risks around Taiwan are profound.  Chinas Defense Ministry, responding to the U.S. weapons sales, said Taiwan was the most important, most sensitive core issue between the United States and China. The arms sale came hot on the heels of a U.S. Senate committee approving a bill calling for the resumption of port visits to Taiwan by the U.S. Navy for the first time since Washington ditched Taipei and established ties with Beijing in 1979. While Chinas Defense Ministry registered its opposition to the bill on Thursday, spokesman Wu Qian pointed out that as long as they respect each others core concerns, the Chinese and U.S. militaries can be an engine of stability for the two countries. Shi Yinhong, who heads the Center for American Studies at Beijings Renmin University and has advised the government on diplomacy, said it was important people are realistic about the challenges China and the United States face. Perhaps people appraised too highly the Xi-Trump meeting. Although the atmosphere was very good, there were still real problems there, Shi said, referring to the Florida summit. Maybe you can say that China-U.S. relations have gone back to being normal, Shi added. Trump has no patience, and nobody can be surprised that hes pushed certain issues to the fore.

Expectations that Trumps election would bring a thaw in icy relations between Moscow and Washington have been put on hold, with the White House embroiled in a domestic row over Trump associates Russia ties.  The U.S. and Russian leaders are to have their first face-to-face encounter next week at a G20 summit in Hamburg. At a previous moment of heightened tension between Moscow and Washington, in the 1960s, Kissinger acted as a back-channel intermediary, passing messages to the leadership of the Soviet Union on behalf of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The Kremlin on Friday denied that Kissinger, who is visiting Moscow and met Putin behind closed doors on Thursday, was acting as a go-between this time. Speaking at an international affairs conference in Moscow, Kissinger said of the planned Trump-Putin meeting: I believe that at this moment our two countries have a responsibility, and an opportunity, to make significant progress not just by improving relations, but by improving situations around the world through cooperative efforts. Tensions between Russia and the United States ... have happened often before and they have been overcome often before, Kissinger, 94, said. He did not take questions from reporters at the event. Asked if Kissinger was providing a back-channel between the Kremlin and the White House, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: He didnt try. That did not happen. He said the Kissinger-Putin meeting was strictly private and declined to disclose what the two men talked about. In May, Trump granted a White House audience to Kissinger. The U.S. leader said he and Kissinger would talk about Russia, among other issues. Speaking at the same Moscow event as Kissinger on Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the significance of the planned Putin-Trump Hamburg meeting was that the abnormal period in our relations when the leaders only speak by telephone will be overcome.

Illinois, which has gone a record-setting two straight years without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between its Republican governor and Democratic legislature, is poised to start fiscal 2018on Saturday budget-less again. The consequences would be dire for the nations fifth-largest state, which has a $15 billion backlog of unpaid bills. S&P has warned that starting a new fiscal year without a budget that reduces a chronic structural deficit could trigger a downgrade to BB-plus. That would put Illinois on the same financial footing as Azerbaijan, Bulgaria and Portugal. The lack of a budget makes all the difference here, said S&P analyst Gabriel Petek, who voiced concerns about the states ability to control its finances and cash flow. Even the agency that oversees elections is not immune. A top Illinois State Board of Elections official told Reuters the agency faces the loss of certain cyber security protections beginning in September because of an unpaid $9,000 bill. The board is among 21 state election authorities the U.S. Homeland Security Department confirmed were targeted by Russian hackers during the 2016 election. An immediate casualty is the state lottery. For the first time, Illinois suspended sales of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets and announced a delay in payments after Saturday on any prizes exceeding $25,000. The lack of a state budget threatens serious disruption to schools during the next six weeks. Out of Illinois 401 public school systems, 144 expect to have less than 90 days of operating cash at fiscal year-end, said Robert Wolfe, chief financial officer for the Illinois State Board of Education. If there is no budget, it is doubtful we can open our doors on August 15th, said Ralph Grimm, school superintendent in Galesburg, Illinois. Public universities, which have suffered a steep drop in state funding, now fear further erosion in student enrollment, the loss of accreditation, and bruising spending cuts. Lindsay Perez, a suburban Chicago mother, and her 9-year-old daughter Elena, who survives on a Medicaid-funded ventilator, described for reporters on Thursday the horrific situation of losing some of her medical supplies because of the budget crisis. The girl, who was born without a lung, urged politicians to pass a budget. If you could try hard enough, you could do it, she said. Meanwhile, Illinois risks intervention from federal judges overseeing consent decrees requiring the state to fund medical and other services for the disadvantaged. A U.S. judge is weighing how much more Illinois must allocate to pay down $3.1 billion in Medicaid bills to ensure continued medical care for 3 million poor and disabled residents. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, whose office pays the states bills, has pledged to fully cover debt service on bonds, but essential payments for pensions and payroll could face reductions if the judge orders a higher priority for Medicaid. Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan offered reporters a murky response on Thursday when asked if a resolution to the fiscal mess could be struck with Governor Bruce Rauner by the midnight Friday deadline. Oh sure, if everybody is reasonable, Madigan said of a potential breakthrough. It couldve been done two years ago. The long odds that Madigan and Rauner, who posted a Twitter photo of himself at his desk waiting for a balanced budget, could strike a deal appeared to worsen with Thursdays abrupt resignation of Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno, respected by both parties as an expert negotiator.

The House voted 228-195 to pass the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act that would withhold some federal grants to so-called sanctuary city jurisdictions that do not comply with certain federal immigration laws.By a vote of 257-167, the chamber also passed Kates law to increase penalties for illegal immigrants who return to the United States. It is named for Kate Steinle, who was shot dead in San Francisco in 2015. An illegal immigrant who had been deported five times was charged with her murder. I applaud the House for passing two crucial measures to save and protect American lives, Trump said in a statement. These were bills I campaigned on and that are vital to our public safety and national security.   Both bills will need approval from the Senate to become law. Trumps Republicans control both chambers. But Democrats assailed the measures as fear-mongering. Although people who illegally re-enter the country do so to reunite with their families, or to flee violence or persecution, this bill considers them all dangerous criminals who deserve lengthy prison sentences, Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler said during debate on Kates Law. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump demanded action against sanctuary cities, which provide some protection for illegal immigrants under laws that limit how much cooperation local police may have with federal immigration authorities.  The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act prohibits sanctuary cities from adopting policies that restrict police officers from asking individuals about their immigration status or the immigration status of others. Under the laws, illegal immigrants would face mandatory detention for past convictions of an expanded number of offenses, such as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. On Wednesday, Trump promoted both bills at the White House with speeches by parents of young people slain by people who live in, or immigrated to, the United States illegally.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps administration reversed a decision late on Thursday and said fiancs would be considered close family members and therefore allowed to travel to the United States as its revised travel ban took effect. The U.S. State Department concluded upon further review,  fiancs would now be included as close family members, said a State Department official who requested anonymity. The Trump administration had previously decided, on the basis of its interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, that grandparents, grandchildren and fiancs traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. The 90-day ban took effect at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT Friday), along with a 120-day ban on all refugees.  On Monday, the Supreme Court revived parts of Trumps travel ban on people from the six Muslim-majority countries, narrowing the scope of lower court rulings that had blocked parts of a March 6 executive order and allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, who also requested anonymity, said it would be updating its guidance to state that fiancs would not be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. The Supreme Court exempted from the ban travelers and refugees with a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. As an example, the court said those with a close familial relationship with someone in the United States would be covered.  The state of Hawaii asked a federal judge in Honolulu on Thursday evening to determine whether the Trump administration had interpreted the courts decision too narrowly. Hawaii said in a court filing that the U.S. government intended to violate the Supreme Courts instructions by improperly excluding from the United States people who actually have a close family relationship to U.S. persons, echoing criticism from immigrant and refugee groups.  Hawaii called the refusal to recognize grandparents and other relatives as an acceptable family relationship a plain violation of the Supreme Courts command.  Hawaiis Attorney General Doug Chin asked U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who blocked Trumps travel ban in March, to issue an order as soon as possible clarifying how the Supreme Courts ruling should be interpreted. Watson ordered the Justice Department to respond to Hawaiis request by Monday, and said he would allow Hawaii to reply by July 6. A senior U.S. official did not answer directly when asked how barring grandparents or grandchildren would make the United States safer, but instead pointed to Trumps guidance to pause certain travel while we review our security posture. The U.S. government expected things to run smoothly and business as usual at U.S. ports of entry, another senior U.S. official told reporters. A handful of immigration lawyers gathered at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on Thursday in case of any problems. Were going to keep fighting this ban, even if it applies very narrowly, said Sirine Shebaya, a senior staff attorney at Muslim Advocates. Its still a Muslim ban, and its still trying to send a message to a whole community that theyre not welcome here. The administration said refugees who have agreements with resettlement agencies but not close family in the United States would not be exempted from the ban, likely sharply limiting the number of refugees allowed entry in coming months. Hawaii said in its court filing it was preposterous not to consider a formal link with a resettlement agency a qualifying relationship. Refugee resettlement agencies had expected that their formal links with would-be refugees would qualify as bona fide.  The administrations decision likely means that few refugees beyond a 50,000-cap set by Trump would be allowed into the country this year. A U.S. official said that, as of Wednesday evening, 49,009 refugees had been allowed into the country this fiscal year. The State Department said refugees scheduled to arrive through July 6 could still enter. Trump first announced a temporary travel ban on Jan. 27, calling it a counterterrorism measure to allow time to develop  better security vetting. The order caused chaos at airports, as officials scrambled to enforce it before it was blocked by courts. Opponents argued that the measure discriminated against Muslims and that there was no security rationale for it. A revised version of the ban was also halted by courts. The State Department guidance, distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday evening and seen by Reuters, fleshed out the Supreme Courts ruling about people who have a bona fide relationship with an individual or entity in the United States. It defined a close familial relationship as being a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step-siblings and other step-family relations. A department cable said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancs, and any other extended family members were not considered close family. The guidelines also said workers with offers of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer addressing U.S. audiences would be exempt from the ban, but that arrangements such as a hotel reservation would not be considered bona fide relationships.

The Countering Irans Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes the Russia sanctions, passed the Senate in a 98-2 vote on June 15.   Many lawmakers hoped the bill would become law in time to send a strong message to Russian President Vladimir Putin before President Donald Trumps meeting with him in Germany next week.  But the Senate bill stalled when House Republican leaders said it violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting revenues originate in the House, known as a blue slip violation. Lawmakers from the two chambers have bickered about it since. Democrats accused House Republicans of trying to kill the bill to please Trump after administration officials said they had concerns about it. House Republican leaders insisted their objection was solely a procedural one. The speaker has made clear that we will take up sanctions once the House receives it, said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan. The Senate resolved the procedural issue on Thursday. But the delay means the House will not vote until after the G20, because of Congress recess next week. This is now going to be a referendum on the Republican leadership, if they are going to go along with the presidents coddling of Putin and the Russians, then that will have to be their legacy, said Representative Eliot Engel, the top House Foreign Affairs Committee Democrat. Engel and Republican committee chairman Ed Royce have said they want the sanctions passed quickly. Some House Republicans have reservations. Representative Pete Sessions, whose home state of Texas is central to U.S. energy, said he wanted assurances about how the bill would affect businesses. Representative Mark Meadows said he would look at the bill closely after hearing from the Italian, German and British ambassadors, who had energy-related concerns. It could potentially run into trouble. But its too early to tell, Meadows said. The legislation would put into law sanctions previously established via ex-President Barack Obamas executive orders. It includes sanctions on mining and other industries, and targets Russians responsible for cyber attacks or supplying weapons to Syrias government.

The Congressional Budget Office report, requested by Senate Democrats, provides a longer-term look at how the Republican plan would affect Medicaid spending as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell searches for a formula to win over the conservative and moderate elements of his Republican caucus. Republican discussions on Thursday were focused on two proposals. One, by moderates, would keep a 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on high earners investment income, instead of repealing it as Republicans have promised. Another, by conservative Senator Ted Cruz, would let insurers offer skimpier healthcare plans if they also offer a plan choice that is Obamacare compliant. An additional $45 billion over a decade to combat the opioid crisis also is on the table, sources close to the talks told Reuters. The original draft of the Republican bill was opposed by at least nine Republican senators. McConnell can only afford to lose two of 52 Republican votes in the 100-seat Senate to pass the bill. Vice President Mike Pence was on Capitol Hill to push for the bill, meeting with Cruz and moderate Senators Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito and Dean Heller. All opposed the bill in its original form. The two factions did not yet seem in agreement. Senator Lisa Murkowski said discussions were continuing to see whether Cruz proposal could be made more acceptable to moderates like herself. Conservative Senator Pat Toomey said he would be shocked if the Obamacare 3.8 percent tax is not repealed. Republican Governor John Kasich of Ohio, which opted to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, said the CBOs latest assessment further validates his concerns. The bill proposes phasing out Obamacares Medicaid expansion between 2021 and 2024, then making deeper cuts to the program and overhauling it in 2025. The CBO estimated that under current law, Medicaid spending would grow 5.1 percent a year during the next two decades. Under the Republican Senate plan, it projected growth of just 1.9 percent a year through 2026 and about 3.5 percent per year in the subsequent 10 years. The CBO can typically only score legislation in a 10-year window, so the bills longer-term affects had not been assessed until Thursdays report. It had earlier estimated that the Senate bill would strip coverage for 22 million Americans in the next decade. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week at a summit in Germany that brings two world leaders whose political fortunes have become intertwined face-to-face for the first time. Both the Kremlin and the White House announced on Thursday that the pair will meet on the sidelines of the July 7-8 summit of G20 nations in Hamburg. Trumps national security adviser H.R. McMaster downplayed the significance of the meeting, one of nine such side meetings for the U.S. president over two days. It wont be different from our discussions with any other country, really, McMaster said. Theres no specific agenda. Its really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about. The meeting will be fraught with difficulties for Trump.     Allegations that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year and colluded with the Republicans campaign have overshadowed the businessmans unexpected victory and dogged his first five months in office. Russia and the United States are also at odds over Ukraine, NATO expansion and the civil war in Syria where Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad.  The United States backs rebel groups trying to overthrow Assad, and Washington angered Russia by launching missile strikes against a Syrian government air base in April in response to what the United States says was a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians. Trump has frequently called for better ties with Russia but lawmakers in his own Republican Party are urging him to be wary of Moscow. As the president has made clear, hed like the United States and the entire West to develop a more constructive relationship with Russia but he has also made clear that we will do what is necessary to confront Russias destabilizing behavior, McMaster said.     U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia hacked and leaked emails of Democratic Party political groups to help Trump win the 2016 U.S. presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia denies the allegations and Trump says his team did not collude with Moscow.     Several congressional committees as well as the FBI are investigating Russias role in the election and any alleged collusion by Trumps campaign. That makes the optics of the Putin meeting particularly challenging for Trump. If there are big grins on both of their faces, that will be the picture on the front pages of every Western newspaper, as the investigation continues here, said Heather Conley, a former State Department official in the George W. Bush White House. I would think the president would be advised, if there is a meeting, to be very careful with his body language, Conley told Reuters. Trump raised Russian hackles this week when the White House said it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack and warned that Assad and his forces would pay a heavy price if it did so. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned on Wednesday that Moscow would respond proportionately if the United States took measures against Syrian government forces.     But Lavrov added that it would probably not be right if Putin and Trump did not talk at the G20 summit of world economic powers.                Republican Bob Corker, the influential chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, described the planned encounter as just a side meeting but said he hoped Trump would bring up problematic issues with Putin. I would hope what he would do is hand him a list of the issues we have with their country. And I think he may well do that, Corker told Reuters. Putin, who has served as both Russian president and prime minister, has outlasted the previous two U.S. presidents, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Officials from those administrations say American officials initially overestimated their potential areas of cooperation with the Russian leader. Then, through a combination of overconfidence, inattention and occasional clumsiness, Washington contributed to a deep spiral in relations with Moscow, they say. Those relations reached a post-Cold War low under Trumps predecessor, Obama. In the last days of his presidency, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking U.S. political groups in the 2016 election. A proposed new package of sanctions on Russia in the U.S. Congress might also put curbs on Trumps ability to pursue warmer relations with Moscow.  The U.S. Senate reached an agreement on Thursday to resolve a technical issue stalling the sanctions, although the measures fate in the House of Representatives is uncertain.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps administration is preparing an executive order that will require all U.S. food aid to be transported on American ships, according to four sources with knowledge of the deliberations. Currently, 50 percent of such aid must be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. The sources said Trump is considering going as far as doubling that to 100 percent, a move likely to stir opposition from both Republicans and Democrats. An executive order is being drafted by the White House, one source with knowledge of discussions told Reuters, adding that it was being discussed among government lawyers. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative touted as part of Trumps America First platform may slow food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said.  Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the worlds largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer.     Supporters say Trumps initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict. Critics argue the order would create few, if any, jobs. Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military.   The costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people, they say. A spokesman for USAID, which oversees U.S. humanitarian programs, declined to comment, referring the question to the White House.  Natalie Strom, a spokeswoman for the White House said, We dont comment on any potential EOs (executive orders) that may or may not be in the works. Trump has submitted a budget outline that proposed steep cuts in spending on foreign aid, which accounts for just 1 percent of all U.S. spending. Members of Congress from both parties said they opposed that plan. With the world facing four potential famines, and struggles to care for millions displaced by conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, critics have been pushing to eliminate what they see as an unnecessary regulation that already adds $50 million a year to the cost of providing aid. Tom Hart, North America executive director at The One Campaign, a non-profit group co-founded by U2s Bono to fight poverty, said the regulation would hinder getting life-saving food assistance to the people Americans are trying to help.  Millions of people could be denied the food aid they need to survive if the cargo preference requirement is doubled, said Hart. Senator Bob Corker, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been an especially vocal critic of the shipping requirement. He and another committee member, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, have filed legislation to ease the requirement.  After hearing about the potential order, senators from both parties called senior administration officials to let them know this would not be supported in Congress, a Senate aide told Reuters. Theyve been warned, the aide added. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Obama, a Democrat, had hoped that overhauling the U.S. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy. But Republican President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. The Department of Homeland Security earlier this month rescinded a separate Obama-era policy meant to cover illegal immigrant parents that had been blocked by the courts. However, DHS said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy covering Dreamers was still in effect. In a letter on Thursday, the Republican attorneys general asked that DHS abolish the DACA program going forward, while noting that the government did not have to rescind permits that had already been issued.  If the federal government does not withdraw DACA, the attorneys general said they would file a legal challenge to the program in federal court in Texas. A DHS representative referred questions to the U.S. Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The 10 Republican attorneys general who signed the letter represent the states of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Nebraska, Arkansas, South Carolina, Idaho, Tennessee, West Virginia and Kansas.  A larger coalition of 26 Republican AGs had challenged the policy covering illegal immigrant parents.  In a statement, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund said it took encouragement from the diminished number of attorneys general signing onto the DACA letter, and urged Trump not to cave in to the toothless threat of legal action.

Trump, who often decries what he calls fake news in the American media and who this week attacked CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post, took fierce aim on Thursday at the hosts of the MSNBC program Morning Joe, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. The Republican president called Brzezinski, a journalist and daughter of former White House national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, low I.Q. Crazy Mika and said she was bleeding badly from a face-lift when she visited his Mar-A-Lago estate around New Years Eve. He referred to former Republican U.S. Congressman Scarborough as Psycho Joe. Trump is known for his prolific Twitter habit, which includes mocking attacks on critics and rivals, but his tweets on Thursday drew a particularly strong response. Its a sad day for America when the president spends his time bullying, lying and spewing petty personal attacks instead of doing his job, MSNBCs communications office said on Twitter.  The Morning Joe program broadcast live telephone interviews with Trump during the 2016 presidential race, but its hosts have turned increasingly critical of him since he took office in January. On Thursdays show, Brzezinski excoriated the Trump administration and said its officials should not act lobotomized because they are scared of the president. Comcast Corp owns NBCUniversal, MSNBCs parent company. Lawmakers in both parties rebuked Trump. I dont see that as an appropriate comment, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said of Trumps tweets, saying they do not help improve civility in Washington. The tweets represent what is wrong with American politics, not the greatness of America, said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. Republican senator Ben Sasse called Trumps remarks beneath the dignity of your office. Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, on Twitter called Trumps tweets sexist, an assault on the freedom of the press & an insult to all women.    At a briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called it a false narrative to portray Trumps remarks as an attack on a woman rather than on a critic, adding, What about the constant attacks that he receives? Hes not going to sit back and get attacked by the liberal media, Hollywood elites. And when they hit him, hes going to hit back, Sanders said. I dont think its a surprise to anybody that he fights fire with fire. The tweets created an uproar in Washington and a distraction as Republican senators tried to bridge differences within the party and agree on major healthcare legislation. A wealthy businessman and former reality TV star with no previous experience in government, Trump has been quick to respond to criticism of his presidency, lashing out at the media for its coverage of probes into potential collusion between his campaign team and Russia, and other matters. He has sometimes singled out individual journalists, including a high-profile attack while he was running for office on former Fox News and current NBC journalist Megyn Kelly. That included a comment about blood coming out of her wherever, which was widely interpreted as a reference to menstruation. Trump has been criticized in the past for his comments about women. He attacked Kelly after she asked him during a presidential debate about his previous references to some women as fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. Trump apologized last October, just before the election, after a 2005 video surfaced in which he said he could grab women by their genitals whenever he wanted because he was a star. Trump has been critical before of the Morning Joe hosts, but Thursdays attack was especially harsh. Scarborough and Brzezinski are engaged to be married. During the January meeting at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump offered to host their wedding and even to officiate it, the two said in an interview in Vanity Fair published in May.

The foreign ministry said the two leaders would review progress in various aspects of the bilateral relationship, and that more details would be published in due course. In late January, a planned meeting between the presidents was canceled following a Twitter dispute over Trumps pledge to make Mexico pay for the wall.

On Thursday, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee adopted legislation that includes Federal Aviation Administration reforms, but unlike a House panel, does not spin off air traffic control and leaves it with the FAA. The support is not there, said Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the panel. The U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the privatization plan on Tuesday, putting air traffic control under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. President Donald Trump has said the move would modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. The proposal has drawn fire from private plane owners and rural airports. Critics say it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines Co and JetBlue Airways Corp all back the proposal. Congress has until Sept. 30 to reauthorize the FAA, but Republican Senator John Thune, chairman of the committee, said the Senate may not take up the proposal until after the August recess, potentially leaving little time to come up with a compromise measure.  The Senate bill would require new rules prohibiting cancellation, baggage, seat selection and same day change fees that are not reasonable and proportional. Airlines for America, an airline trade group, said it would result in government-mandated price controls and should be rejected. In 2016, U.S. airlines collected $7.1 billion in baggage and reservation change fees. Both measures would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline has since banned the practice. The Senate bill also requires new rules that would mandate  airlines promptly refund passengers for baggage fees or other fees if they do not receive services. The House bill would require the FAA to set minimum seat sizes on U.S. airlines and a minimum distance between rows to protect the safety and health of airline passengers. The average distance between rows of seats has dropped from 35 inches in the 1970s to about 31 inches today, supporters say, and the average width of airline seats has shrunk from 18 inches to about 16-1/2 inches. One contentious issue is training requirements for pilots, and whether certain simulated training hours can be counted. Thune said that two-thirds of U.S. airports are only served by regional carriers and that there is a crisis in trying to attract pilots, while Democrats said the revised rules could lead to unqualified pilots. Both bills would seek to speed approval of some commercial drone use and testing, while studying privacy implications. The measures also require medium- and large-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers and would enshrine a ban on making in-flight mobile phone calls in law. The Senate bill would direct a study of airplane air quality and require a study of whether airlines are shrinking airplane bathrooms to add more seats.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has suggested his agency could hit the debt ceiling in September, and has encouraged Congress to raise the limit before the lawmakers go on their August recess. Republican leaders in Congress have begun having bipartisan discussions on the matter in the House.  The U.S. government has a statutory limit on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from Washington spending more than it collects in taxes. Only Congress can raise that limit.  The updated deadline will do little to diminish the urgency in Congress to act on the debt ceiling. Lawmakers will be still be pressured to tackle the increase before September, when funding the government will become their primary focus. The CBO report pointed to slower-than-expected tax receipts this year, a factor that Mnuchin has cited as a reason to raise the debt ceiling sooner.  Lower tax payments were cited also as a factor in an increase in the deficit estimate. The CBO increased the deficit estimate for the current fiscal year to $693 billion, a $134 billion increase from its January estimate. The report factors in only current law that has been approved by Congress, and does not include proposals that have been made by President Donald Trump in his budget proposal released earlier this year. Congress continues to struggle with completing its hefty to-do list. In addition to raising the debt ceiling, Congress must pass a government spending bill before the end of September or face a government shutdown in October. This aligns the deadlines for the debt limit and the spending bill, creating the potential for them to become intertwined. Congressional leaders have expressed a desire to see the two kept separate to avoid getting the debt ceiling increase caught up in the politics of government spending.  Congress also is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act healthcare law and to overhaul the tax code  two efforts that have stalled and consumed more time than was initially expected. And there still are forces pushing against the effort to find agreement on the debt ceiling, including some Republicans who say an increase in the limit should accompany a cut in spending. And there are Democrats who have warned they will not  contribute votes to legislation increasing the level if tax cuts for the rich add to the deficit.

But now there seems to be an olive branch from Paris. The U.S. leader said on Wednesday he had accepted an invitation from Emmanuel Macron to celebrate July 14 Bastille Day celebrations and 100 years since the U.S. troops entered into World War One. Trump will likely revel in a ceremony laden with pageantry and military pomp, with U.S. soldiers marching down the Champs Elysees boulevard beside French servicemen - a welcome respite from his domestic woes. For Macron, 39, it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trumps confidence as he tries to establish himself as a leading global statesman at a time when decision-making in the White House has become increasingly unpredictable. We dont want the United States to isolate themselves, a Macron aide said recently. Thats what diplomacy is for. Its not to let people sulk in their corner. In the space of six weeks, Frances youngest leader since Napoleon, will have hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Versailles and Trump on Paris most iconic avenue. Macron flattered Putin in May with a meeting at the sumptuous palace of Frances former monarchy, built outside Paris by Louis XIV - the Sun King - to symbolize absolute power. Even so, Macron pulled no punches, accusing Russian state media of lying propaganda during his French election campaign. A French diplomat indicated there would be frank exchanges with Trump too after Macron took a dig in English at Trumps withdrawal from the Paris climate accord when he urged U.S. citizens to help make this planet great again. On climate change its complicated, the diplomat said. But the rest is sufficiently important for him to make this historic trip on July 14. Macron appears to be broadly aligning his foreign policy with U.S. priorities of tackling terrorism while seeking better ties with Russia. The battle against Islamic State, Syrias civil war and Irans nuclear accord are likely talking points. Privately, some French diplomats have lamented the lack of a clear U.S. policy on the long-term political process in Syria and say even setting up a meeting between the French and U.S. foreign ministers is tough.  A White House statement said the two leaders would further build on the strong counter-terrorism cooperation and economic partnership between the two countries. Past words may haunt Trump. It will be his first visit since he declared that a wave of militant attacks showed France was soft on immigration and fighting jihadists.  France is no longer France. They wont like me for saying that but... France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart, the U.S. president said in a campaign speech.  In bringing Trump to Paris, Macron has stolen a march on Britains embattled Prime Minister Theresa May.      Londons offer in February of a state visit for Trump met fierce public resistance, Britons perceiving it as a desperate act by a government in need of a trade deal as it faced tough negotiations on its exit from the European Union. A date has still not been confirmed. In Paris, public opinion appeared divided. You can see that the way Trumps headed isnt going to help things and I think diplomatic channels are the best way to calm things down, said antique dealer Florence Toussaint.

Republican leaders hope to agree on changes to the legislation by Friday so lawmakers can take it up after next weeks Independence Day recess.. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday abandoned plans to seek passage of it this week because Republicans did not have 50 votes to pass the bill. For seven years, Republicans have led a quest to undo the 2010 law known as Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature legislative achievement. Trump made dismantling it a top campaign promise during last years presidential campaign but policy differences within the party have raised doubts Republicans can achieve a repeal. Democrats have unified against the bill and Republicans control the Senate by a slim 52-48 margin, which means McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans. So far at least 10  - including moderates and hard-line conservatives - have expressed opposition to the current bill, although some indicated they would vote for it with certain changes. McConnell, with his reputation as a strategist on the line, met with a procession of Republican senators in his office on Wednesday. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said party leaders will talk to every Republican senator who has concerns about the bill or is undecided. The House of Representatives passed its healthcare bill last month, only after striking a balance between the center of the party and the right wing. Now McConnell must find a similar sweet spot. During a lunch meeting on Wednesday Republicans made presentations on potential fixes. Senator Rand Paul called for jettisoning more parts of Obamacare to get conservatives on board. Senator Mike Rounds suggested keeping a 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on high earners investment income, which the current bill would eliminate. Rounds said the tax could pay for more Americans to receive the tax credits that help pay for health insurance. Senator Bob Corker, who also supports keeping the tax, said one of the issues he was focused on was helping lower-income Americans pay for health plans. My sense is theres a good chance that issue and other issues people are trying to get addressed can be addressed, Corker told reporters. Trump said the bill was moving along well and predicted a great, great surprise but did not elaborate. Maine Senator Susan Collins, a moderate, said it would be very difficult to reach agreement by Friday. Collins and other centrists were put off by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Offices projection on Monday that 22 million people would lose medical insurance under the existing bill. Finishing the legislations revisions by Friday would be optimal, Cornyn said, so the CBO can analyze the new version.. Even then, Democrats could mount a forceful resistance. They have repeatedly said they will not discuss a repeal but have expressed openness to negotiating improvements. The Senates top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, proposed Trump call all 100 senators to Blair House across the street from the White House to craft a bipartisan bill fixing Obamacare but Trump said did not think Schumers offer was serious. McConnell said Democrats had refused to work with us in a serious way to comprehensively address Obamacares failures in the seven years since they passed it. The legislation has triggered protests at the Capitol and police said they arrested 40 people, including cancer survivors, on Wednesday for blocking Senate offices. Obamas 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed without Republican support, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people but Republicans call it a costly government intrusion. The Senate bill rolls back Obamacares expansion of the Medicaid government insurance for the poor and cuts planned Medicaid spending starting in 2025. It also repeals most of Obamacares taxes, ends a penalty for not obtaining insurance and overhauls subsidies that help people buy insurance with tax credits.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""(Reuters) - Maines two most prominent Republicans grabbed headlines this week with political moves that were widely different in style and substance, which some insiders said could risk the partys stature in the northeastern state. U.S. Senator Susan Collins won praise from Democrats for saying she would not vote for a White House-backed healthcare reform bill while Governor Paul LePage revved up his conservative base by saying he was ready for a state government shutdown if legislators did not agree with his calls for budget cuts. The move by Collins, a four-term moderate, was in keeping with Maines reputation for producing independent-minded legislators willing to buck their partys leadership in Washington. That tradition was challenged by LePage, who first ran for office in 2010 on a wave of populist Tea Party support and won two three-way races with less than a majority of the vote. What you see is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican party in Maine, said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the 2014 campaign of LePages Democratic challenger. Is it going to be the belligerent, angry Governor LePage or is it going to be the thorough and pragmatic but still conservative Senator Collins? Republican lobbyist and political operative Lance Dutson largely agreed. Its an ideological tipping point, said Dutson, who worked on Collins 2014 reelection campaign, which she won with 68 percent of the vote. Maine has a tradition of successful third-party candidates, notably independent U.S. Senator Angus King, and has more unaffiliated voters than those registered as either Democrats or Republicans. In the long run, the Collins model has proven itself, Dutson said. You cant be an orthodox Republican and talk only to Republicans like LePage and win as much support. Collins and LePage have publicly disagreed over President Donald Trump, whose brusque style and populist approach is similar to the Maine governors. LePage was an early supporter of Trumps White House campaign. When Collins said last year that she would not vote for the New York real estate developer, LePage told local media he was not a Susan Collins fan. The chair of the states Republican party saw no downside to the diverging style and politics of the two, saying the wide gap represented by the two was an illustration of the partys wide appeal in Maine. Were an inclusive party, we have strong conservatives, libertarians and we have our moderates, but were a party, were a party of reform and we are going to stick together, said Demi Kouzounas, a dentist who was elected as the party chair in January. We support both of them strongly. The gap between the two was as clear in the style of their comments as it was in its substance. Collins said she had serious concerns about the Senate bill backed by Trump as a replacement to the Affordable Healthcare Act, known as Obamacare. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would cause 22 million Americans to lose their healthcare insurance over the next decade, Collins became one of a handful of Senate Republicans to say they could not support the bill in its current form, leading to Tuesdays decision to delay the vote. Also on Tuesday, LePage told a radio interviewer that he was ready to shut down the state government ahead of a holiday weekend that is crucial for businesses catering to tourists, if Democratic lawmakers would not agree to $145 million in spending cuts in the states next two-year budget of roughly $7 billion. Im the worst guy in the world to play chicken with, because I dont veer either way, LePage told WMOV radio. If theres a collision to be had, its coming. The Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the states budget impasse, which is focused on a debate over how to fund the public schools. A government shutdown could further expose Republican rifts and turn more moderate Republicans against LePages tactics, suggested Phil Bartlett, a former state senator who now serves as chairman of the Maine Democratic party. Hes been saved by the fact that cooler minds have prevailed to prevent the worst of his impulses, Bartlett said. But were now seeing that he and the House Republicans seem to be willing to shut down the government. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

By Jessica Damiana JAKARTA (Reuters) - From white water rafting in Bali to visiting temples on Java, former U.S. President Barack Obamas private family holiday is being closely tracked in Indonesia where he spent four years as a child. Obama was six when he moved to Jakarta after his American mother, Ann Dunham, married an Indonesian man following the end of her marriage to Obamas Kenyan father.   I feel proud that my friend became a president, said Sonni Gondokusumo, 56, a former classmate of Obama at the Menteng 01 state elementary school in Jakarta. Gondokusumo showed a class photograph of himself standing behind a young Obama, who was wearing a school beret.  He was a clever boy. Whenever a teacher asked him to solve a problem in front of the class, he could do it, Gondokusomo told Reuters, adding he hoped to meet the former president again. Obama remains popular in the worlds most populous Muslim nation and his trip has been splashed across the media during an extended public holiday to mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. The Rakyat Merdeka newspaper carried a headline Obama loves Indonesia. Obama returned for an official visit as president in 2010 with his wife, Michelle, but this time has brought daughters Malia and Sasha as well. Indonesians are avid social media users and snaps of the former U.S. president walking with his family in rice fields and rafting on Balis Ayung River have gone viral.     Obama kicked off the holiday on the island of Bali, where he stayed at the luxurious Four Seasons Resort Bali near the cultural center of Ubud.  On Wednesday, Obama and his family arrived in the city of Yogyakarta on Java island, and visited the ancient temple of Borobudur.  According to CNN Indonesia, Central Java police deployed 700 officers to secure his visit to Borobudur, a Buddhist temple dating from the 8th and 9th centuries. Obama is due to meet President Joko Widodo on Friday at the palace in Bogor, south of Jakarta, and visit the capital on Saturday. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

The White House said Trump would name Brendan Carr, a Republican who previously served as an adviser to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, to an open seat. Carr currently is general counsel at the FCC and also has worked at the Wiley Rein LLP law firm. Carr did not respond to a request for comment. The five-seat FCC currently has only three members. Earlier this month, Trump nominated Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, to another open seat at the FCC. The U.S. Senate must confirm both Carr and Rosenworcel before they can be seated. Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama, giving Republicans a 2-1 majority on the five-seat commission. The FCC is working to reverse a number of Obama-era regulations, including the former Democratic presidents landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others. Pai, chosen by Trump in January to head the agency, also has said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. Pai also has proposed significant changes to local TV ownership limits and plans other changes to media regulations. Pai praised Carrs appointment. Brendans expertise on wireless policy and public safety will be a tremendous asset to the commission, he said in a statement.   Republican Michael ORielly and Democrat Mignon Clyburn also serve on the commission. Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm ORielly. Republicans denied there was a deal but the standoff had delayed consideration of telecommunications legislation in the Senate. Pai would be forced to leave the commission if he is not reconfirmed by the Senate by the end of the year. Under Pai, the FCC chose not to review AT&T Incs planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.

Senate Republican leaders on Tuesday postponed the vote on the bill, which they hoped would take place before their July 4 recess. According to credit rating agencies Moodys Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, the legislation would negatively impact states because of changes to the core funding of Medicaid and the phasing out of the Medicaid expansion plan. The Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, issued a report on Wednesday estimating state Medicaid spending  would increase by $565 million in 2022 under the proposed  legislation. It also estimated federal funding for Medicaid, which funds medical care for the poor and indigent, would be $102.2 billion lower in that year. The National Governors Association, which on Monday advocated for more time to review the financial impact of the bill, welcomed the delay. Members of the Senate Republicans own party resisted the measure, which the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade and reduce federal outlays for Medicaid by $772 billion over that time. Moodys senior analyst Genevieve Nolan told Reuters the legislation in its current form would be a credit negative for states, mainly because of reduced federal funding for Medicaid. Obviously this bill is ACA (Affordable Care Act) repeal and replace, but even more than that, its Medicaid repeal and replace. Medicaid is a more than 50-year-old program, a  partnership between states and the federal government, and both the Senate bill and the House bill propose really fundamental restructuring of how that program is funded, Eric Kim, Fitchs director of U.S. Public finance, told Reuters. A mix of Republican and Democratic governors criticized or strongly opposed the bill, including Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Connecticuts Office of Policy and Management said in a report on Tuesday the bill could cost the state about $2.9 billion per year by 2026. The report also said the cap to federal payments would force states, including Connecticut, to assume costs, limit benefits, decrease the number of people served or reduce rates to providers.

Comeys relationship with Trump has been central to ongoing investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Lawmakers have raised questions about whether Trump fired Comey on May 9 in order to interfere with the Russia probe. Russia has denied such assertions. Trump, a Republican, has dismissed them as sour grapes voiced by Democrats disappointed by his victory and called them a witch hunt. We have a commitment to get appropriate access to the Comey memos, Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat, told reporters at the Senate. Im pleased. I think its critical information that we have to have as part of our review process. He said he expected to have the memos soon. Warner declined to say much about the progress of the investigation or provide a timeline for when it might be concluded. I would have thought we would have been further along, but I would never have expected the administration to fire Jim Comey. You cant make this stuff up, he said. When asked, he said he expected that Trumps son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, would appear before the committee as promised despite having recently hired a lawyer. Politico first reported that Richard Burr, the committees Republican chairman, said the panel would be obtaining memos Comey wrote documenting his conversations with Trump. Comey testified to the intelligence committee this month that he decided to keep detailed records because he felt so uncomfortable after meetings with the president that he feared Trump might lie about them. The Russia investigations, by Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees, have dogged the first months of Trumps presidency and distracted from his policy goals such as repealing President Barack Obamas healthcare law. Trump has also faced criticism from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats over his administrations failure to do more to investigate charges that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and concerns that it might do so again. Russias our most dangerous adversary in the world today, and if he continues to refuse to act, its a dereliction of the basic duty to defend the country, Nicholas Burns, an undersecretary of state under Republican President George W. Bush, testified to the Senate panel on Wednesday.  At a hearing last week that focused on the U.S. election, a Homeland Security official testified that Russian hackers targeted 21 U.S. state election systems in the 2016 presidential race and that a small number were breached. Warner said the panel had asked officials in 21 states to release information about the hacking. I do not see how Americans are made safer when they do not know which state elections systems Russia tried to hack, he said. The probes have at times come up against Republican concerns about leaks of classified information and unproven assertions by Trump and others that Obamas administration improperly spied on Trump associates. On Wednesday, Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham asked the FBI and Justice Department for copies of applications to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for permission to conduct surveillance related to the election, including any related to the FBIs ongoing Russia investigation.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Flush with cash, political groups outside the White House are aggressively coming to President Donald Trumps aid as he battles low public approval numbers, questions about his election campaigns ties to Russia and a stalled legislative agenda. Through television attack ads and online campaigns normally seen only during the tumult of an election, the groups are helping Trump to strike back against his perceived enemies and boost his agenda, adding to the firepower of his Twitter account and the bully pulpit of the White House. On Tuesday, one of the groups, America First Policies, launched an attack ad against a senator from Trumps own Republican Party who had balked at a Senate plan to overhaul healthcare that would leave millions more Americans uninsured. The attack angered Senate leader Mitch McConnell, who is struggling to rustle up the votes for the plan. It is the first time that a U.S. president has had Super PACs - political action committees that can raise unlimited amounts of money and typically operate during elections - or political non-profits, which do not have to disclose their donors or where they spend their money, actively working to support him after the dust of campaigning has cleared.  The pro-Trump groups are prohibited from coordinating with the White House, which declined to comment for this story. The New York Times reported that McConnell had complained to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus about America First Policies ad. The group later pulled the ad. America First Policies and the other pro-Trump groups were set up to promote Trump and his legislative agenda - healthcare reform, building a wall along the Mexican border, and pushing for lower taxation and deregulation. They are not allied to the Republican Party, which can pose a problem for Republican leaders as Tuesdays attack ad showed. With Trumps approval ratings sagging and his agenda now overshadowed by a federal investigation into his 2016 campaigns ties to Russia, the groups are pouring resources into protecting Trumps image, demonizing his opponents and amplifying his message that he is the victim of a witch-hunt. The establishment is shaken, angry, losing control, begins another new ad by America First Policies, which says on its website that it is a non-profit organization supporting key policy initiatives. Images of the U.S. Capitol, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow flash in the background.  Desperately waging an all-out war to protect their interest, the narrator continues. They lie, they leak, they leech onto power. America First Policies is comprised of more traditionally conservative Republicansand was founded after the election by a close ally of Vice President Mike Pence, Nick Ayers. The group said in a statement their mission was to promote Trumps agenda and that they were not afraid to push House Republicans through grassroots and advertising to support the healthcare overhaul. The groups shift from policy promotion to attack mode, does not surprise Marjorie Hershey, a political science professor at Indiana University. A lot of research tells us that negative ads tend to be more attention-getting than positive ads, and because Super PACs themselves arent on the ballot, they can afford to risk the unsavory reputation that negative advertisers often get, Hershey said.  Strategists and political scientists say it is hard to know if the groups are actually moving public opinion. But the groups point to their fundraising as evidence of their success  much of it raised not from millionaires, but in small donations from voters. Great America Alliance - which was set up as a sister organization to a Super PAC created by Trump supporters Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich - has spent $400,000 on an ad attacking former FBI Director James Comey, the groups director, Eric Beach, told Reuters.     The video tried to discredit Comey, who was fired by Trump over his handling of the Russia probe, the week he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Just another DC insider in it for himself, the ad concludes. The group launched a new ad this week featuring conservative media star Tomi Lahren attacking Robert Mueller, the special counsel now leading the Russia investigation. Mueller is investigating whether Trump may have attempted to obstruct justice by pressuring Comey to drop his inquiry.  On its website the group says its mission is to advocate for a stronger economy, a more secure nation, and a society with less government intrusion and more freedom for American citizens. Asked to reconcile its stated mission with the attack ads, the groups director, Eric Beach, said, Our goal is to really get on the ground and fight back. Our supporters want to get out there and fight ... the mischaracterization of not just Donald Trumps rhetoric but also his policies.  Alison Dagnes, a political science professor at Shippensburg University who specializes in Super PACS, said the well-resourced groups play a key role in spreading Trumps message that what his supporters are reading or seeing in the media is false.  Theyre saying we see whats happening now and you shouldnt believe it. The Committee to Defend the President, another Super PAC, launched an ad calling on supporters to defend Trump. The groups leader, Ted Harvey, said unfair attacks on Trump had forced his group to shift their focus to defending the president instead of promoting his policies.  Certainly, I would rather be talking about policies than talking about made-up lies that the Democrats and the mainstream media cabal have put together to discredit the administration from moving forward on its agenda, said Harvey.

The proposed legislation by Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo and Ranking Member Sherrod Brown would permit Roy Woodall, the independent insurance expert on the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to remain in his job until a replacement can be nominated and confirmed, or for an additional 18 months. The FSOC is a panel of regulators with the power to dub large financial firms, including insurers, as systemic, a tag that carries additional oversight by the Federal Reserve.  The panel has designated a number of insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc, American International Group Inc and Metlife.  Metlife fought the designation in court and won.  The other two still carry the designation, though Prudential is widely expected to seek to have it rescinded. A two-thirds majority vote of FSOCs sitting members is needed to rescind a designation. Woodall, who previously voted against designating Metlife and Prudential, is the only person on the panel with insurance expertise. But his six-year term expires in September.  As there is no federal insurance regulator, Woodall is effectively the most important figure in U.S. regulation of large insurers. The FSOC is composed of heads of federal financial regulators and led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. All of the FSOCs other members are allowed to continue serving in their roles on expired terms, or be temporarily replaced with an acting member if there is a vacancy.  But due to a quirk in the Dodd-Frank law, Woodall cannot be held over or temporarily replaced after his term expires - a problem that could leave a gap on the FSOC. Wednesdays proposed bill will provide much-needed clarity regarding the independent insurance members term, Crapo said.  Brown added that the fix represents a commonsense bipartisan measure. It is also backed by a large list of other Republicans and Democrats on the panel  - a sign it will likely win broad support by lawmakers in Congress.

The blanket 90-day ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - and a 120-day ban on all refugees was completely blocked by lower courts after Trump issued it on March 6, saying it was needed to prevent terrorism attacks.  On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled the bans could proceed, though only for foreigners with no bona fide relationship with an American entity or person, and it did not specify what that meant. The ruling left some in the Middle East wondering if they would be able to enter the United States.

Charles Banks, 49, had faced up to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty in April to one count of wire fraud regarding an investment he urged Duncan to make in a firm called Gameday Entertainment, which Banks headed.  U.S. District Judge Fred Biery also ordered Banks pay $7.5 million to Duncan in restitution. San Antonio Spurs great Duncan, who is now retired, said in a statement he was afraid that without a strong sentence, financial advisers would feel they were free to prey on young, impressionable and suddenly wealthy athletes. Judge Biery, you may not understand how difficult it is for me to be in the public light in this horrible way, as the poster child for a dumb athlete whose financial advisor took his money, Duncan said in a statement read into the court record by prosecutors.  I hate it and am embarrassed by it more than you can imagine. Several NBA players were in the courtroom to support Duncan, including former teammates Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.  After the hearing, Duncan told reporters he was satisfied with the sentence. In a brief statement before sentencing, Banks apologized to Duncan for breaking his trust, by tricking him into agreeing to make loans to a failing sports merchandise company headed by Banks.  According to court documents, Duncans losses totaled $13.5 million in investments and loan guarantees made to Gameday, which went out of business this year. Prosecutors said much of that money went into Banks pockets.Defense lawyers said in court in April that some of that money has been forgiven by the banks that provided the original loans. Banks is also the founder of Terroir Capital, a financial management fund that works in the wine and hospitality industry. Duncan retired at the end of last season after 19 seasons with the Spurs. The scam was discovered when Duncans divorce lawyer consulted a financial planner to put together a property settlement for the basketball stars divorce, court documents said.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues and is now considering possible trade actions against Beijing, three senior administration officials told Reuters. The officials said Trump was looking at options including tariffs on steel imports, which Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross already has said he is considering as part of a national security study of the U.S. steel industry.  Whether Trump would take any steps against China remains unclear. In April, he backed off from a threat to withdraw from NAFTA after he said Canadian and Mexican leaders telephoned him asking him to halt a planned executive order in favor of opening discussions. The officials said there was no consensus on the way forward with China and they did not say what other options were being studied. No decision was expected this week, a senior official said. Chinese steel already is subject to dozens of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy orders. As a result it has only a small share of the U.S. market. Whats guiding this is he ran to protect American industry and American workers, one of the U.S. officials said, referring to Trumps 2016 election promise to take a hard line on trade with China. On North Korea, Trump feels like he gave China a chance to make a difference but has not seen enough results, the official said. The United States has pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing has repeatedly said its influence on North Korea is limited and that it is doing all it can. They did a little, not a lot, the official said. And if hes not going to get what he needs on that, he needs to move ahead on his broader agenda on trade and on North Korea. U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, spoke reporters outside his residence on Wednesday and said the United States hoped to collaborate with China. We need to work together to deal with some of the pressing, difficult issues, such as the threat from North Korea. We want to work together to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, he said.  The death of American university student Otto Warmbier last week, after his release from 17 months of imprisonment in Pyongyang, has further complicated Trumps approach to North Korea, his top national security challenge. Trump signaled his disappointment with Chinas efforts in a  tweet last week: While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried! Trump had made a grand gesture of his desire for warm ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping when he played host to Xi in April at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida. I think China will be stepping up, Trump said at the time.  Since then, however, North Koreas tests of long-range missiles have continued unabated and there have been reports it is preparing for another underground nuclear test. Trump dropped by last Thursday as White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner were meeting Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi, an official said. Chinas inability to make headway on North Korea was one of the topics that was discussed, according to two people familiar with the meeting. In a statement last week, Chinas foreign ministry said Yang had met McMaster and Kushner, but it gave no details. Ministry spokesman Lu Kang did not directly answer a question about that meeting, but said China and the United States had discussed North Korea, among other issues, during a security dialogue Yang attended. Yang also had a separate meeting with Trump. The ministry said last week that Yang told Trump that China was willing to work with all sides, including the United States, to lessen tension on the Korean peninsula and promote an appropriate resolution.  Trump met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday at the White House and made a point of noting that the United States, India and Japan would be joining together in naval exercises soon in the Indian Ocean, a point that seemed aimed at India rival Beijing. Trump also thanked India for joining the United States in imposing new sanctions against North Korea. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""TruthKeeper is a fake news detector bot. Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leaders postponed a vote on a healthcare overhaul on Tuesday after resistance from members of their own party, and President Donald Trump summoned Republican senators to the White House to urge them to break the impasse. The delay put the future of a longtime top Republican priority in doubt amid concerns about the Senate bill from both moderate and conservative Republicans. With Democrats united in their opposition, Republicans can afford to lose only two votes among their own ranks in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been pushing for a vote ahead of the July 4 recess that starts at the end of the week. The legislation would repeal major elements of Obamacare and shrink the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor. Were going to press on, McConnell said after announcing the delay, adding that leaders would keep working to make senators comfortable with the bill. Were optimistic were going to get to a result that is better than the status quo. At the White House meeting with most of the 52 Republican senators, Trump said it was vital to reach agreement on the Senate healthcare measure because Obamacare was melting down.  So were going to talk and were going to see what we can do. Were getting very close, Trump told the senators. But he added, If we dont get it done, its just going to be something that were not going to like, and thats okay. McConnell, whose party has a razor-thin majority in the 100-member Senate, told reporters that Republican leaders would work through the week to win over the 50 senators needed to pass the bill, with a vote planned after the recess. Vice President Mike Pence could provide the crucial vote needed to break a tie. I think we can get 50 votes to yes by the end of the week, Republican Senator Roger Wicker said after the White House meeting. The House of Representatives last month passed its own version of a healthcare bill, but the Senate bill has been criticized from both the left and the right. Moderate Republicans worried millions of people would lose their insurance. Conservatives said the bill does not do enough to erase Obamacare. The bills prospects were not helped by a Congressional Budget Office analysis on Monday saying it would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade, although it would reduce the federal deficit by $321 billion over that period. The report prompted Senator Susan Collins, a Republican moderate, to say she could not support the bill as it stands. At least four conservative Republican senators said they were still opposed after the CBO analysis. Three more Republicans, Rob Portman of Ohio, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, said after the delay was announced that they oppose the current draft. Portman and Capito cited the bills Medicaid cutbacks and how that would hurt efforts to combat the opioid epidemic that has taken a heavy toll in their states. The Medicaid program was expanded under former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. I think giving time to digest is a good thing, Republican Senator Bob Corker said after the delay was announced. U.S. stock prices fell, as the decision to postpone the vote added to investor worries about Trumps ability to deliver on his promises of tax reform and deregulation, as well as changes to the health sector. Those expected changes have driven a rally in U.S. stocks this year. The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 0.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.46 percent. The market likes certainty and now theres uncertainty. What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration? said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions Inc. Passing the measure would be a win for Trump as he seeks to shift attention after weeks of questions over Russias role in last years U.S. presidential election. McConnell has promised since 2010 that Republicans, who view Obamacare as a costly government intrusion, would destroy the law root and branch if they controlled Congress and the White House. Republicans worry a failure to deliver will cost them votes in next years congressional elections. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, it will either have to be approved by the House or the two chambers would reconcile the differences in a conference committee. Otherwise, the House could pass a new version and send it back to the Senate. Lawmakers are expected to leave town by Friday for their July 4 holiday break, which runs all next week. The Senate returns to work on July 10, the House on July 11. Lawmakers then have three weeks in session before their month-long August recess.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power after he helped write a petition known as Charter 08 calling for sweeping political reforms.  He is being treated in a hospital in the northern city of Shenyang for late-stage liver cancer after he was granted medical parole, his lawyer told Reuters on Monday. Branstad said his heart went out to Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the peace prize. We Americans would like to see him have the opportunity for treatment elsewhere if that could be of help, Branstad said in his first remarks to journalists in Beijing since he was confirmed in May as President Donald Trumps top representative to China. And because of the relationship I have with both President Xi and President Trump, I hope I can be a go-between that can help address some of these challenging issues in the future, he said outside the ambassadors residence in leafy central Beijing after arriving earlier on Tuesday. Branstad, a former Iowa governor, has been described by Beijing as an old friend of China. He hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping, then a county-level Communist Party leader, in Iowa in 1985, and again in 2012 when Xi was vice president.  Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2010 for his activism in promoting human rights in China, which responded by freezing diplomatic ties with Norway. They normalized ties last December. The prison bureau of Liaoning province said on Monday that Liu was being treated by eight well-known tumour experts, but Western politicians and rights activists have voiced concern about the quality of treatment. A video of Liu Xia crying and talking about her husbands condition was shared online late on Monday, saying doctors could not perform radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A source close to the family said Liu was being treated using targeted therapy and that he and his wife wanted to return to Beijing for treatment but authorities rejected their request. The U.S. Embassy called for Lius release on Tuesday but declined to comment on whether it was speaking with China about him being transferred to the United States for treatment. The embassy said its main focus was that Liu be released on his own recognizance. Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International, told Reuters late on Tuesday that he had been authorized by several people close to the family to say that Liu Xia had told Chinese authorities she wants her husband to receive medical treatment abroad.  Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times, published by the official Peoples Daily, said there was a precedent for prisoners on medical parole to be allowed overseas for treatment, but that as a Nobel Laureate Liu could motivate more Western public opinion attacks against China than other dissidents. If he is willing to go abroad, that is perhaps partly out of the despair he feels from being marginalized by Chinese society and constitutional order, the newspaper said. China has acknowledged problems of mistreatment in the criminal justice system in the past and has repeatedly vowed to crack down to address them. It has also said other countries should not use individual cases to interfere in Chinas internal affairs. Liu Xiaobo is a Chinese citizen. Why should there be discussions with other countries about the issue of a Chinese citizen who is serving his sentence? Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters at a regular briefing when asked about Branstads remarks. Lu said he believed the ambassador was very clear about his duties to increase mutual understanding and political trust.

The selection of William Emanuel, 75, to fill one of the two vacancies at the agency brings it closer to having a Republican majority, which is expected to undo a series of recent decisions seen as favoring unions. The five-member NLRB oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers.  Emanuel, a Los Angeles-based partner at law firm Littler Mendelson, has worked with Republicans in Congress and major trade groups from an array of industries, and has for decades defended employers in cases before the board. He is a member of the conservative Federalist Society, an influential group of lawyers credited with pushing Trump to nominate U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch to the high court. Emanuel said in a statement that it is an honor to be nominated. Industry groups such as the National Retail Federation and the National Restaurant Association hailed Emanuels nomination, saying he would help repair damage done to businesses by rulings from the NLRB during the Barack Obama administration. Trump last week said he intended to nominate fellow Republican Marvin Kaplan, a lawyer with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, to another vacancy on the board.  The positions require confirmation by the U.S. Senate.  The NLRB has been controlled by Democrats for nearly a decade and they currently have a 2-1 majority. When it has no vacancies, the board typically includes three members from the presidents party and two from the opposing party. Under Trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former President Barack Obama. They include rules designed to speed the union election process and a 2015 decision that made it easier for companies to be held liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees. It was not clear when the Senate could vote on Trumps nominees but several lawyers and other experts said the process could stretch into the fall.

The House Budget Committee canceled plans to send a budget resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, lawmakers said on Tuesday, as conservative Republicans pushed to add hundreds of billions of dollars in mandatory spending cuts to the blueprint. House and Senate passage of a budget resolution is vital to President Donald Trumps pledge to deliver on tax reform this year because the document would free Republicans to circumvent Democratic opposition in the Senate. But the push to cut programs including Medicaid and food stamps, which benefit the poor, could lead to a stalemate. Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress are working separately to agree on a tax bill that can be unveiled in September. No budget, no tax reform, said Representative Mark Walker, who chairs the Republican Study Committee, a group of more than 150 conservative lawmakers. Thats why there should be a sense of urgency to get this done pretty quick. Their aim is to cut mandatory programs that are required by law and viewed as principle drivers of deficit spending. The result could be legislation containing lower taxes for the wealthy and corporations alongside reduced benefits for the poor.  Lawmakers say there is Republican agreement on topline discretionary spending levels of $621.5 billion for defense and $511 billion for non-defense programs. Representative Jim Jordan, a leading member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, is pushing to cut as much as $400 billion over a decade from a range of programs that benefit the poor.

He said the United States would sell India Sea Guardian drones, Apache attack helicopters and C-17 transport aircraft and said that the process to approve the sales was underway as we speak. The White House said after Trumps meeting with Modi that it had offered India the naval variant of the Predator drone made by U.S. defense contractor General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, a deal that would be worth more than $2 billion.  Such a sale of sensitive hardware must be authorized by the State Department before being sent to Congress for review.  As Modi and Trump met on Monday, a Pentagon agency said the State Department had approved the possible sale of a Boeing C-17 transport aircraft with an estimated cost of $366 million. The Apache deal dates back to 2010 when Congress was notified of a $1.4 billion potential sale of 22 Apaches to the Indian Air Force. In 2015, Boeing Co announced the order had been finalized, but did not disclose a price. The first  deliveries are scheduled for 2019.    A source familiar with the deal said the Indian Air Force has some options for additional Apaches and the Indian Army has also expressed interest in the aircraft. The White House said that if completed, the new sales would  increase bilateral defense trade to nearly $19 billion. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic congressmen on Tuesday called on the Trump administration to demand strong labor provisions in its renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement to reverse chronic wage erosion in Mexico. At a public hearing in Washington tied to the imminent trade talks, U.S. representatives Sander Levin and Bill Pascrell, both members of the House Ways and Means Committee, said improved labor rights in Mexico was their top NAFTA priority.      U.S. wages are being driven down by the depressed wages in Mexico, Levin said in testimony. Why? Because the entire Mexican labor system is designed to prevent workers from obtaining their rights and bargaining for better wages and working conditions. Levin, citing a wage figure of about $2 an hour for Mexican auto plant workers versus about $28 for the United States, said that NAFTA must be modernized to ensure that Mexican workers have a true right to collective bargaining, replacing the current Mexican system of labor conciliation and arbitration boards. Negotiated in the early 1990s by the United States, Canada and Mexico, NAFTA lacks enforceable labor provisions. Levin and Pascrell said that new labor standards must have an enforcement mechanism that ensures full implementation of provisions before a new trade deal goes into effect. Pascrell also sharply criticized the Trump administration for failing to spell out clear and specific objectives for the NAFTA renegotiations, which are due to start on Aug. 16. We in Congress  and the American public and the companies and stakeholders that make up the American economy  are completely in the dark when it comes to what the administration intends to do, why, and for whose benefit. Pascrell also called for major reforms to NAFTAs dispute resolution mechanism. Trump administration officials also have criticized the system, which it says is biased against U.S. interests.    The hearings, which also will include testimony from dozens of industry groups and companies on their hopes for the talks, will take place through Wednesday at the International Trade Commission in Washington. The U.S. Trade Representatives office, which will take the lead role in the negotiations, is expected to publish more detailed NAFTA negotiating objectives around mid-July.

Return answer of True or False.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the U.S. Supreme Court navigated a difficult period in which it was short one member for more than a year, justices from across the ideological spectrum often managed to find common ground. That sense of unity promises to be soon put to the test. The nine-justice court ended its 2016-2017 term on Monday with a flurry of rulings. When it resumes work in October, its recently restored conservative majority could become more assertive as the justices tackle big cases on whether the U.S. Constitution lets businesses refuse to serve gay couples for religious reasons, presidential powers and manipulating electoral district boundaries for partisan gain. Neil Gorsuch, Republican President Donald Trumps appointee, joined the court in April, giving conservatives a 5-4 majority. Gorsuch already has established himself as among the most conservative and outspoken justices even before beginning his first full term.  We will certainly see more cases where they are sharply divided, Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro said. While partisan tensions in Washington have deepened since Trump took office in January, the Supreme Court largely remained above the fray. In the 14 months that the court operated with only eight justices following Justice Antonin Scalias death and was divided equally between liberals and conservative, it showed greater unanimity in its decisions than in recent years. During that time, the justices often sidestepped major rulings on divisive issues, resolving several cases narrowly and trying to avoid 4-4 votes that would leave legal questions unresolved.  The court even avoided a sharp ideological split in its decision on Monday on how to handle Trumps contentious order banning people from six Muslim majority countries from entering the United States. The four liberal justices were silent as the court allowed parts of the order to go into effect and agreed to decide the legality of the policy in its next term. The court already has agreed to hear several major cases in which the justices are likely to be divided on ideological lines, including one on the conflict between gay rights and religious freedom concerning a Christian baker from Colorado who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple, citing his religious beliefs. The justices will also weigh whether state legislative districts violate constitutional protections if they are drawn purely to gain partisan advantage in a case involving a Republican-configured electoral map in Wisconsin that could have major consequences for U.S. elections. The travel ban case, Trumps first big Supreme Court battle, is a major test of presidential powers, with Trumps administration arguing that the judiciary should show deference to the president on national security matters. In the term that just ended, the court was able to decide all but two of the cases it heard. On Monday, the justices ordered that those cases, both on immigration-related issues, be re-argued in its next term, when Gorsuch would be able to participate. The action suggests the court was divided 4-4 along ideological grounds on those cases. A review of rulings from the 2016-2017 term compared with previous years shows a higher rate of unanimity, likely prompted by the greater need for compromise without a decisive ninth vote. In 69 cases in which the court issued decisions on the merits, there were no dissenting votes in 41 of them, or 59 percent, according to Kedar Bhatia, who compiles court statistics for the SCOTUSblog website. That compares with 44 percent in the courts previous term and 40 percent in the one prior to that.  With only eight members, I think the court was trying harder to achieve as much agreement as possible, both in the close cases and in the not-so-close ones, said Kannon Shanmugam, a lawyer who regularly argues before the court. While they were shorthanded, the justices took up fewer cases that were likely to divide them ideologically. For example, they took six cases on patent protections, a higher-than-normal number, on an issue in which they usually are unanimous. ""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""True""}]}"
