 Colbert Lays A Catholic Smack Down On Trump Over Pope Francis Fight (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has added Pope Francis to his very long list of people he is feuding with. During an episode of The Late Show with Colbert, Stephen Colbert did a hilarious bit about Trump s latest failure attempt to pander to Christians.The feud came after Pope Francis was quoted as saying that Trump is not a Christian, A person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be and not of building bridges is not a Christian,  Pope Francis said while traveling to Rome from Mexico. When asked if he thought people should or should not vote for Trump, Pope Francis responded saying,  As far as what you said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I am not going to get involved in that. I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that. Trump released an official campaign response, where said that Pope Francis is going to regret not supporting him and his campaign when ISIS attacks the Vatican. During a campaign rally on Thursday Trump had this to say: As I m walking up here, they said,  Mr. Trump, the pope made a statement about you,  and I said,  The pope? What did the pope say? I like the pope   was it good or bad? Because if it was good, I like the pope. If it s bad, I don t like the pope. Colbert mocks Trump during the segment, saying: It s like Jesus said:  Blessed are the poor, unless they said something bad about me   then screw them. Trump is trying to pander to Christians. He really needs them in order to secure his chances at receiving the Republican primary nomination.As I have pointed out before, Trump is making himself look a fool doing it too. It s not just that Trump isn t saying the wrong things to win over Christian voters. He doesn t even appear to understand the basic concepts of Christianity. This was shown Trump publicly stated that he had not asked Jesus Christ for forgiveness.You can the video below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"February 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Remember When David Letterman Hilariously Destroyed Trump’s China Rhetoric? (VIDEO),"During a town hall event in South Carolina, which was televised live on February 18, Donald Trump yet again promised would-be-voters that if he s elected president, he s going to crack down on China.During the town hall, Trump told host Anderson Cooper that if he s elected president he will send cease and desist letters to China and Mexico, telling the two countries to stop  ripping off  the U.S. Yeah, maybe to China, to stop ripping us off. I d be sending them to other countries to stop ripping us off. I d send them to Mexico. And when I say cease-and-desist orders, maybe it d be equivalent. Maybe I ll do it with my mouth. Trump s comments came in response to questions regarding a cease and desist letter sent to his campaign earlier this week, by Republican challenger Ted Cruz.Typical of Trump, instead of addressing the question, he diverted the attention of the crowd away from the issue, talking instead about how the U.S. is being  ripped off  by the evil foreign people his supporters love to hate.The day before the South Carolina town hall, Trump told a different audience, China has been one of the great thefts of all time, what they ve done to the United States. We can t let China continue to get away with what they re doing to our country. While China bashing has been a major theme of the Trump campaign since day one, there s no shortage of evidence to show what a bloviating hypocrite he is on this subject.Back in 2012, former talk-show host David Letterman hilariously humiliated  the Donald  by exposing his China hypocrisy on The Late Show.Just as Trump was about to go off on one of his signature anti-China rants, Letterman started reading the tags from a line of goods sold under Trump s name at Macy s Department Stores.Of course the products are made in places like China and Bangladesh, where workers are paid pennies an hour, to produce goods sold which are then sold at high end department stores in the U.S.If you re one of the many Americans who has longed to see someone just make Trump shut his mouth, then watch the video below.You won t be disappointed:Image via Wikimedia",News,"February 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s A LONG List Of Bernie Sanders’ Accomplishments (WITH CITATIONS),"We ve already discussed Barack Obama s many accomplishments. And, we also did a piece recently discussing Hillary s long list of accolades, as well. It s only fair that we did one for Bernie, too, given the current nature of the Democratic presidential race.So, without further delay, here s an extensive list of Bernie Sanders  accomplishments, and it s A LOT despite some of the rhetoric circulating around the internet stating he s too much of a far-left progressive to get anything passed.Won a championship on the basketball team at his primary school in Brooklyn.Was Captain of his cross-country team, winning a lot of races. In fact, he was so successful he was repeatedly talked about in the school s yearbook the very next year despite having already graduated.Forced the class president at his James Madison High School to raise scholarship money for kids in Korea, after they had been orphaned due to the war there in the 1950 s.Organized a sit-in against segregation when he was still a student in college. This was the first civil rights sit-in in Chicago history. This led to the University of Chicago investigating the discrimination just a week afterward.Defeated the 5-term mayor of Burlington, winning by just ten votes in his bid against Democratic mayor Gorden Paquette.

He also opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Voted against the Patriot Act despite the majority of Congress voting for it (357 to 66). He also sponsored several amendments trying to limit its effects, even getting a proposal passed through the House preventing the government from obtaining a record of the books people buy.Was an open critic of Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan and took him head on insisting he only represented  large and wealthy corporations.  Greenspan later admitted to Congress that his economic ideology regarding risky mortgage loans was flawed.He passed more amendments than any other member during his time in the House.

Was said to have done such an excellent job of bringing all parties to a deal, that it wouldn t have gotten done without Sanders  work.But, most of all, what Bernie has done is inspire Americans. That s what he s doing in this election. His list of accomplishments doesn t include all the times he s stood on the Senate floor giving a passionate speech on why the  big banks need to be broken up.  No, you can t quite quantify things like that.Featured image via Facebook",News,"February 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Loon Versus Loon: Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin Entertainingly Rip Each Other Apart,"Grab your popcorn, everybody! The Tea Party civil war has kicked off with an all-out battle of stupid between Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin.Their feud has raged largely under the radar since September when Beck fired the first salvo by calling the former half-term Alaska Governor a clown for talking to Donald Trump during an anti-Iran rally. I m going to say it,  Beck announced. I don t care what Sarah Palin says any more. Sarah Palin has become a clown. I m embarrassed that I was once for Sarah Palin. Honestly, I m embarrassed  I don t know who she is any more, I don t know what she stands for. I saw a clip of her talking to Donald Trump. What the hell is that? I don t even know who she is any more. As we all know by now, Beck is a HUGE supporter of Republican presidential wannabe Ted Cruz, so of course that means anybody who doesn t support Cruz is dead to Beck. And that included Palin.And when America s village idiot actually endorsed Trump in an incoherent rant that left everybody craving a Yosemite Sam cartoon, Beck went nuclear on Facebook. Sarah Palin. Small Government, lower taxes, fewer regulations and the constitution? Not any more. Big government Sad excuse to abandon principles. Just because things don t go my way, I don t abandon God. Saul Alinsky is wrong. The ends do not justify the means. But wait! There s more!After a week in which Beck appeared with Cruz to get all teary eyed about  Murica and how Cruz will rule the land with God on his right shoulder whispering in his ear what to do, Palin fired back at her former friend on Thursday.Writing on her Facebook page about Beck s love affair with a man she once shared the Tea Party with, Palin went after Beck on several fronts and did not show any mercy whatsoever. Ted Cruz s star spokesman and campaign partner, Glenn Beck, promises he will support a socialist vs. the pro-life, pro-2nd amendment, pro-growth, pro-American GOP front runner  what s conservative about that?  Palin began in reference to Beck saying he would support Bernie Sanders before he ever supports Trump.Then she pointed out that Beck once said that John McCain would have been worse for the country than President Obama.Palina also slammed Beck for proclaiming his hatred of the American victims of the 9/11 terrorists attacks, and then attacked Beck and Cruz for greeting immigrants at the border.In conclusion, Palin wrote:Beck is known for his continuous mocking of Americans who may disagree with his puzzling antics, while crying just last night,  Why mock ME?  what s consistent about that?Beck will go ballistic after reading this post and will ramp up his unjustified attacks against Donald Trump, me, my faith, and you   for acknowledging all this I ve outlined, in his own words  what s smart about that?Here s her full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Ted Cruz s star spokesman and campaign partner, Glenn Beck, promises he will support a socialist vs. the pro-life, Posted by Sarah Palin on Thursday, February 18, 2016Palin just delivered a direct hit on Beck and now we all get to wait for his response, which probably won t be for too long. And we can definitely expect Beck and Palin to continue their feud in the fight for which crazy GOP candidate gets to lose in November to Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.These two were so much happier before they met other crazy people.

 Fiscal Conservative Ted Cruz Just Released His Plan To Destroy America By EXPLODING Our Deficit,"If you ever want to know how STUPID Republicans are when it comes to economics, you don t need to look back over the decades of Republican presidents and their associated financial disasters. All you need to do is find any potential Republican presidential candidate, and examine their tax plan.2016 s crop of candidates does not fail in this. Every single one of them that has come out with a plan has been universally mocked by legitimate economic scholars that use real math because their plans are more unrealistic than a stop-motion monster movie.The latest member of the idiot village to have his tax fantasy completely trashed is Ted Cruz. His  plan  reads like something a failed James Bond villain would try to do in order to destroy the U.S. economy.Here are some of the features included in Cruz s plan.A 10 percent flat income tax rate:Ted wants to replace our seven different tax brackets with one single tax rate of 10 percent. A flat tax always favors the wealthy while hurting the poor. To put it simply, the poor can t afford to have taxes deducted from their income like the rich can. When you pay 10 percent of 1 million dollars you have $900k remaining and you aren t starving. When you pay 10 percent of $15k you re left with $13.5k and you are starving worse because you were already starving at $15k. Don t forget, we would probably have to cut food stamps and other social safety nets because there is no money for them. Add into that the fact you are paying in taxes equal to about what a single individual would get in food stamps per year, while not actually getting food stamps.Elimination of many major taxes:Cruz wants to remove the estate tax (misclassified as a  death tax  by Republicans), alternative minimum tax, payroll tax, corporate taxes, and the Medicare surtax imposed by the Affordable Care Act. If you want a way to underfund the U.S. government to where it could cause a global financial crisis, this would be one of the ways to do it.Impose a VAT tax on businesses:Despite Cruz denying strongly that he is not in favor of a VAT tax, his business tax proposal is exactly that. The Tax Policy Center calls it that, so that s what we are calling it as well and the fact he is afraid to call it what it is shows the absurdity of his plan. A VAT tax will likely reduce wages because employers will no longer be able to deduct the cost of wages from their taxes. This will force employers to pay even less than they are currently. A good way to crush an economy is to hurt the buying power of the consumer base and this would be one of the most efficient ways to do it.Virtually nothing in this plan seems to be realistically paid for:Another very standard feature of Cruz s plan is that it would explode our federal deficit and debt by amazing levels. Estimates put it at over $20 trillion in 2 decades (8.6 in the first decade, 12 in the second). Republicans can t stop complaining about how President Obama has exploded our debt since he had to have the Bush years  numbers on his books. However, he hasn t even come close to the costs Cruz would impose on the nation. It would make us unable to afford functional government.Most tax savings would go to the top 0.1 percent of filers: Top money-looters (I refuse to call them  earners ) would get a post-tax income boost of $2 million   approximately a 29 percent increase. Middle-income people would get an average of about $1,800   coming in at around a 3.2 percent increase, and lowest income filers would get an average of 0.4 percent of their income, or around $46. To put it more simply, if you are ultra wealthy, you could buy several extra middle-class homes per year just to pass the time. If you are poor you could buy about 60 percent of one McDonald s cheeseburger per week, per year with your savings.There s no other word to describe this besides insane, because it s the same thing from every Republican candidate every year, with them expecting different results every time. Democrats MUST vote in large numbers in November. We literally can t afford not to.Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Cosmetic Company Posts Pic Of Black Woman’s Lips, Racist Trolls Explode (IMAGES)","Racism is still very prevalent in America. And not just in the way we usually talk about it, either. Perhaps one of the most pervasive forms of racism is in everyday beauty standards, and it was on full display in the comments section of an Instagram post by MAC Cosmetics. The company was promoting a new shade of lipstick, and they used a black model with dark skin and very full lips to promote the lipstick. Here is an embed of that post:Royal romance at @ohnetitelny #AW16. #MACBackstage #NYFWA photo posted by M A C Cosmetics (@maccosmetics) on Feb 17, 2016 at 6:50pm PSTInnocent enough, right?

Here are just a few of the worst comments, before whoever runs MAC s Instagram account started removing the negativity, courtesy of Attn.com:And, as I said before, those are just a few.

 Unhinged Cruz Accuses Obama Of Being An Atheist Because He Won’t Attend A Racist’s Funeral,"As one of Antonin Scalia s last rulings on the Supreme Court, he made the argument that black students should be discouraged from attending top ranked schools because they probably couldn t keep up. Instead he suggested they be sent to  slower-track schools  like, say, community college or lesser universities so they could shoot for mediocrity. It was an appallingly racist statement, from a sitting Supreme Court Justice no less, and one that flies directly in the face of the lived experience of one of the most successful African Americans of all time: Barack Obama.On the way to the White House, Obama overcame racism and adversity to thrive at two top shelf schools   Harvard and the University of Chicago   and that education helped propel his career into law and eventually politics. It s hard to imagine Obama one day becoming president if he had taken Scalia s advice and settled on a  slower-track  community college.So, it hardly seems surprising that Obama isn t planning on cancelling his packed schedule to attend the funeral of a man, however important, that viewed people of his skin color as less competitive than their white counterparts. It s also a long-standing tradition that either the president or the vice president attend the funeral of a justice. Not both. Biden already announced that he was going.Four out of the past seven funerals for a Supreme Court justice have either had the president or vice president in attendance.Former President George W. Bush attended the funeral for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.Former President Bill Clinton attended the funerals for former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William Brennan but did not attend the funerals for Justices Harry Blackmun or Lewis F. Powell Jr.Former Vice President Al Gore attended the funeral for Justice Thurgood Marshall.So for any other president this wouldn t be a big deal. But it s Obama. And Republicans are Republicans. The freak out has already begun.While Fox News has devoted wall-to-wall outrage directed at Obama for not going to Scalia s funeral (he ll be in Cuba working out the details to zeitgeist shifting thawing of relations with America s once sworn enemy   kind of a big deal), Sen. Ted Cruz managed to amp up the hysteria to 11 while desperately clawing his way to second place in South Carolina.On the campaign trail, Cruz decided that he would accuse Obama of being an atheist. We ve got 11 more months of watching damage to this country. From a lawless and faithless president who is eager to travel to Cuba, but is unwilling even to show up at the funeral of Justice Antonin Scalia. This is a stark change in Cruz s earlier remarks that said it was irresponsible to  speculate on the President s faith.  It does, however, pander to the beliefs of the toxic fanatics at the very heart of the Republican Party. To them, Obama will always be a Kenyan, socialist, Muslim atheist no matter how many times he celebrates Christmas or mentions his faith in speeches.Cruz s shameful remarks come at a time when he is trying to woe many conservative Christians to support his campaign. In fact, his entire base is built on Christian extremists. Suggesting that Obama is a godless heathen is exactly the sort of thing that would get them fired up enough to vote for a sleazeball like Cruz.Ironically, Cruz s remarks come at a time where he and his fellow ideologues are melting down over the fact that the pope called Donald Trump s plan to build a massive cement wall across the entire southern border un-Christian. Conservatives blasted the pope for pointing out the obvious and suggested it was offensive for someone to speculate about another person s faith. In other words, the sheer amount of hypocrisy being generated by the Republican Party could power the sun.But perhaps there is just a twinge of jealousy in this mudslinging knowing that when Obama does go to church he takes us to church.Feature image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Literally Laughs At Stupidity Of Fox News Trying To Explain Taxes (VIDEO),"Sometimes all you can do is laugh at the stupidity of Fox News, which is exactly what Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders just did when discussing taxes for the wealthy and ridiculous wealth inequality.The Democratic presidential candidate appeared on Fox News with Chris Wallace this past Sunday, and one of the things that the Fox host tried to grill Sanders on was to question the claim that the economy is  rigged  for the one percent.Wallace tried to make his point by pointing out that in 1981 the top one percent paid 17% of all federal income taxes, as compared to now where they pay 37%. However, he clearly doesn t understand math, which actually falls right into Sanders  argument that the system is, in fact, rigged for the very wealthy to keep getting wealthier without paying their fair share of taxes.Wallace asks Sanders: If the wealthy have rigged the system, why have they done such a lousy job of it? This is when Bernie literally laughs out loud and responds to the condescending Wallace: Ohhh, Chris. I think you re missing the major point here, and that is, what we have seen in recent years is a huge transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent whose percentage of wealth in America has doubled. We re talking about trillions of dollars going from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent. Wallace then tries to blame President Obama, because of course, but Sanders responds: These are policies that have gone on for a long long time under Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. Now, are we better off today than we were when President Bush left office and we were losing 800,000 jobs a month? Of course we are. But for the last 40 years what we have been seeing is a middle class disappearing, people working longer hours for low wages, and today, as it happens, 58% of all new income is going to the top one percent. That s a rigged economy to my mind, Chris. And if they are earning 58% of all new income, they should be paying 58% of all tax revenue, but they re not. The system is rigged for them to get away with paying less and less with a lower tax burden due to loopholes and deductions those who make FAR less don t get the opportunity to take advantage of.Sanders is exactly right, and good for him for laughing in the face of Fox News. It s about time someone did.Featured image from YouTube",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Actor Martin Sheen Tells Senate GOP To Do Their Jobs When Obama Picks SCOTUS Nominee (AUDIO),"Martin Sheen channeled his President Jed Bartlett character from The West Wing to call upon voters to tell Senate Republicans to obey the Constitution.As conservative groups mobilize and begin spending massive amounts of money to keep Republicans to their word that they will refuse to even hold hearings on any of President Obama s Supreme Court nominees to fill the vacant seat Antonin Scalia leaves behind, People For The American Way is fighting back with a campaign of their own. The strategy is to use Sheen in a series of robocalls designed to urge voters to shame Republican senators from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania into doing their jobs.Specifically, the calls target Senator Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Senator Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania. Our Constitution is very clear about what happens when a vacancy occurs of the Supreme Court,  Sheen says in the call. It says the President shall nominate a new judge and that the Senate will give that nominee a fair consideration. But as you may have heard, Republicans are playing politics with out Constitution and with the Supreme Court. Sheen then goes after Johnson for saying that he doesn t think Senate Republicans should even give a hearing to any nominee.  That s clearly irresponsible and it puts partisanship above the law,  Sheen says before asking voters to call Johnson and tell him to put his  constitutional duties first and give fair consideration to President Obama s nominee. Here s the audio of the Wisconsin robocall via Talking Points Memo.This isn t the first time Martin Sheen has urged voters to stand up for American values. In 2014, he appeared in an ad asking Kentucky voters to elect Alison Lundergan Grimes over Mitch McConnell so that Social Security and Medicare will continue to be safe and made stronger.As we all know, McConnell ended up winning another term in the Senate, which he is now using disgracefully to disobey the Constitution and politicize the Supreme Court instead of doing his job responsibly by holding confirmation hearings for whoever President Obama nominates to fill Scalia s seat.Hopefully, voters won t ignore Sheen s call this time around.

 Cop’s Convict Daughter DEMANDS Public Service Instead Of Jail For Hate Crime,"Kathryn Knott was convicted of a hate crime for helping friends in a gay bashing assault on a same-sex couple on a Philadelphia street in 2014. She is also the daughter of Chalfont Borough Police Chief Karl Knott, which is most likely why she thinks that she deserves special consideration in this case after she blew her chance at no jail time.Knott was offered a plea deal for probation, which her two cohorts accepted, but insisted she was just an innocent bystander to the crime and turned down the deal. Instead, she opted for a trial where surveillance footage proved she was a damned liar. After the trial, she was found guilty and sentenced to 5-10 months of jail time.Of course, this is an unacceptable situation for her, even though she made her choice to reject the plea. Now, she and her lawyers are demanding that her jail sentence is transformed into a public service announcement to  take the infamy of the arrest and maybe heal some wounds.  Her lawyer is arguing that she is being punished for exercising her constitutional right to have a trial, by the harsher sentence being imposed after she refused a plea deal.Let s change this up just a bit. A group of 3 poor, black young adults assaults a heterosexual white couple, beating them up severely, and leaving one with a broken jaw. The same exact sequence of events follows up to the request of one one be let out of jail by doing a PSA. This would be laughed out of court.She helped beat up a gay couple, leaving them traumatized and one with a broken jaw. She had a chance to accept responsibility and take probation. She blew it by rejecting a deal, but because she s a police chief s princess daughter both she and her lawyer think that grown-up consequences don t apply to her. She deserves every damned day of punishment that she gets, and being a white police chief s daughter is not an excuse.Featured image from Philly Declaration",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Photographer Captures Horrific Effects Of Climate Change In One Heartbreaking Photo,"There are many who want to claim that Climate Change is a hoax. They are usually the people spending an insane amount of money to pretend that fossil fuels have no impact on our environment, the politicians receiving the money, as well as the people who are easily convinced by this paid trickery campaign.Then there are those who are grounded in the reality that Climate Change not only exists, but it is one of   if not the most   existential threats to not only the world, but humankind.We ve seen photos of receding ice and polar bears stuck on icebergs, but the reality of Climate Change has never been so real as when you look at what it is actually doing to the wildlife in the Arctic.Photographer Sebastian Copeland captured an image that is as important to see as it is heartbreaking to witness. Here, you ll see a young polar bear who literally starved to death, because according to Copeland, it just didn t have the food it needed to survive due to retreating ice. Thus, the food the bears need, which is necessary for survival, is in short supply and/or difficult to find.Photo by Sebastian Copeland via Huffington PostCopeland s latest book explains: For the state of the ice in general, we re headed into uncharted territory. There s no doubt about it The faster retreat of the sea ice, a bear s favoured spot for seal hunting, leads to longer fasting periods and the demise of more animals from starvation. And the more we ignore the fact that Climate Change exists, the more pictures like this are going to be appearing, because the threat is becoming worse and worse as the years go on.It s not only important that we elect people into office that recognize the impact of Climate Change, but it is imperative to our existence on this planet. We can t stand idly by while our world dies around us, because sooner or later, we re gonna be next.Featured image: Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Attacks Pope’s ‘Disgraceful’ Criticism About His Border Wall,"Donald Trump infuriates even the most compassionate and holy amongst us   like the Pope, for example. When Pope Francis was asked on Thursday how he felt about the Republican front runner, it took every ounce of the religious leader s strength not to erupt.While Francis was in Mexico, a reporter questioned the Pope about Trump s potential for president. Francis brilliantly slammed the racist GOPer, saying that A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. Francis had been referencing Trump s promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border   something that Trump has become infamous for during his campaign, along with his numerous offensive comments about immigrants.When Trump found out about what Francis said about him, he tried to shrug it off, saying, Now it s probably going to be all over the world. Who the hell cares? OK? I don t care. But he cares very much. Thin-skinned and never one to take criticism lightly, Trump fired back at the Pope while at a campaign stop in South Carolina just hours after the pontiff was praying at the border for those who died trying to come to the United States. Trump issued a press release stating that  No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man s religion or faith,  calling Francis  comments  disgraceful.  Trump also added in a few jabs at President Barack Obama. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. Unable to accept that maybe he s just a horrible guy and unequipped to be president, Trump whined that the Mexican government had soiled his reputation and turned the Pope against him so they can  continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border.  Clearly in a huge amount of denial, Trump said: The Pope only heard one side of the story   he didn t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation. Making a case for his offensive approach on immigration, Trump suggested that the Mexican government is  using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.  This echoes comments Trump had made last week, when he spoke against Francis  plans to pray at the border, stating that the Pope was being exploited. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said: I don t think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico. I think Mexico got him to do it because they want to keep the border just the way it is. They re making a fortune, and we re losing. In his press release, The Donald also suggested that the Pope would be sorry for ever doubting him. He said that  if and when  ISIS attacks the Vatican,  I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened. Keep dreaming, Donald.

 Worried About A Trump Presidency? This Canadian Island Will Welcome You With Open Arms (IMAGES),"Ever since Donald Trump announced he was running for president, most Americans pretty much thought it was a joke and brushed it off as Donald being Donald. However, as his poll numbers began to rise, so did people s curiosity with whether he may actually be in it to win it. And now that Trump has won New Hampshire and is still polling high nationwide the probability of a Trump presidency is actually starting to sink in among several American citizens and it is terrifying the living daylights out of them.However, don t fret!

It says: Hi Americans! Donald Trump may become the President of your country! If that happens, and you decide to get the hell out of there, might I suggest moving to Cape Breton Island! And you can find lots of cool things there!   And lots and lots of yummy SEAFOOD!Where is Cape Breton? Not far from New England! You could be there in no time!While this site is technically a joke website set up by radio host Rob Calabrese, people are still reaching out to him in droves.

 This Cruz Supporter Wins The Award For Craziest GOP Voter Of The Year (VIDEO),"Every once in a while, we are introduced to an undeniably bat sh*t crazy Republican. Linda Farley of Kentucky is one of these nut jobs.Farley, a die-hard Republican, was pulled over in West Virginia while driving her  award winning Liberty Van  because the vehicle was all lit up with illegal lights. The patriot mobile has all kinds of insane ramblings on it like  Red is the new green  and  Occupy your brain first. Yep, that really says  Amerika. It looks like she put all of her leftover lawn ornaments on the top of her van, doesn t it?I don t think she understands the meaning of  injustice. Occupy your brain first ? Ohhhhh the irony.I just can t even ..I m so confused. What happened on 9-11-2002? Now that you have seen the just how nutty she is, let s get back to her police stop.In addition to all of the bedazzled sayings on the Liberty Van, it is lit up with Christmas lights. While traveling through West Virginia, the police saw the lights and stopped her. The state, like many others, prohibit the use of blue lights on cars that are not emergency vehicles. Farley was arrested for her illegal lights and believes that her  personal liberty  is in danger because she BROKE THE LAW. She also believes her criminal behavior somehow means  that Hillary Clinton should be in prison.During an interview with InfoWars, the nutter said: If they can arrest grandmas for Christmas lights, definitely she belongs [in jail]. Yes, because that makes perfect sense.When she was asked what exactly she is doing with her super cool van, she responded: I m sick and tired by time we get a primary in Kentucky all the good ones are gone and I have to pick from the lesser of the evils. And I decided, since I m retired and I have this rolling billboard here, that I would try to help out the one that I think is not the lesser of evils. Her  lesser evil  is Senator Ted Cruz. The man who had a starring role in the government shutdown in 2013 (the one that cost Americans billions of dollars) and who was the first to say that he would block anybody President Obama nominates to replace Justice Antonin Scalia. I mean after all the best candidate for President of the United States is definitely someone who hates the government, right? Apparently, in Farley s mind he is and that is why she is  CRUZ n for the Constitution.

 KARMA: Conservative Group’s Plan To Sabotage LGBTQ Dance Hilariously Backfires (IMAGE/VIDEO),"Thanks to a conservative group that tried to ruin an organized dance for LGBTQ teens, thousands of dollars were raised so those very teens could have the night of their lives.The Australian Same Sex Gender Diverse Formal is an annual gala hosted by Minus 18 for LGBTQ teenagers, giving them a place to feel safe and at home without the ridicule that might happen at most school dances. Minus 18 wrote on the event page: Imagine being told by your school that the clothes you feel comfortable wearing to a formal aren t considered  normal  or don t conform to a dress code. Imagine not being allowed to take a partner of the same sex, or being too afraid to attend altogether. It isn t unusual for LGBTQ teens to be bullied or banned when they try to bring a same-sex date or wear attire that doesn t satisfy strict gender norms. The Formal is a place where teens can be themselves and feel comfortable wearing whatever with whomever, without worrying that others will take issue with it. Knowing just how important LGBTQ events are, Minus 18 was also crowdfunding for any students who couldn t afford their $40 tickets to the dance.Unfortunately, some people just can t let others be. The Stop Safe Schools Coalition, a conservative group of bigots that go out of their way to ruin schools and groups that foster safe and inclusive environments for same-sex attracted, intersex, and gender diverse students, staff and families,  decided to try and ruin the gala.Using their 700+ Facebook fans, the right-wing group begged people to buy up as many tickets as possible so that LGBTQ teens wouldn t be able to. The group posted: The more tickets sold to us the more youth we protect. They are non-refundable unfortunately so if you are then unable to attend you can t get your money back or a ticket sold to someone else. Little did they know, that while these homophobes thought they were robbing tickets from LGBTQ teens, they were actually buying them FOR the teens! What The Stop Safe Schools Coalition had actually done was share Minus 18 s crowdfunding campaign   which allowed conservatives to unknowingly making donations to send needy LGBTQ students TO the dance. As one person hilariously pointed out on the Facebook page: You realize that if the conservatives do buy all the tickets, you can just allow registered people on a waiting list in for free? They re effectively subsidizing tickets for those who can t buy one. This is one time where the stupidity of conservatives actually paid off. Thanks to their ignorance, Minus 18 DOUBLED their crowdfunding goal of $15,000 for 500 tickets. Now, thanks to the hate group, $30,000 has been raised and Minus 18 is using the extra money to find a bigger venue so even more teens can come!To see how amazing and important the Same Sex Gender Diverse Formal is for LGBTQ teens, you can watch footage from last year s event below:Featured image from Minus 18",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The GOP Has Made Such A Mockery Of Elections Even Canada Gets To Poke Fun At Us (VIDEO),"Canada is just fun. Our great white neighbor to the north just shed a decade of hate and ignorance in favor of  Prime Minister Centerfold  and a slew of not just leftish but downright liberal political and social reform. In other words, Canada joined the rest of the civilized world in evolving faster than America ever could.They ve had advantages, of course. I can t quite remember exactly who it was but back in the 80s some comedy news person, possibly Stewart Pankin, said that the first words in Canada s National Anthem should be changed to  Oh, America thank God we re next to you  Yes, you can laugh. For much of its existence and in many ways still, that is true. Anything bordering something as massive and internationally strategic as the United States Of America is going to benefit greatly from a relationship that is symbiotic by nature.Still, Canada is doing OK for itself and would like to offer  34 million of the most polite people in the world  as candidates for president. Not any one individually; all of them. They say they ll do it in shifts. Canada has  run for president  before, but failed to pick up enough votes to get by the mandatory tooth-brushing guy.In this perfectly hilarious depiction of what Canada thinks, stereotypes get hit long and hard. The friendly guy in the sweater sporting the majestic eagle and the ever-noble moose is as polite as he is passively condescending. His endearing accent and inherent whiteness come through strong as he questions us about our choices and offers real-world solutions: Yes, the irony at the end would be just hilarious, wouldn t it? Trump has said that his wall will have doors. If Trump is elected president it would only be fitting for Canada to build a solid wall with no doors, because we re obviously 317 million or so .absolutely crazy people. Trump would have to pay for it by his own rules.Luckily for us there truly is no scenario where Donald Trump being President would actually be good for America. One thing is for sure, if the stars align in the manner that puts any Republican in the White House with the current class of crazies  running  our congress, I m moving to Canada.

 Pope Francis TORCHES Trump: ‘A Person Who Thinks Only Of Building Walls’ Is ‘Not A Christian’,"Pope Francis was asked about Donald Trump, and the famously compassionate religious leader could only barely hold back his disgust.Currently, Francis is finishing up an historic visit to Mexico. Needless to say, the issue of Donald Trump inevitably came up. When a reporter asked the pope to weigh in on Trump s potential candidacy, he unloaded on the Republican front-runner. A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. This is not in the gospel. As far as what you said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I am not going to get involved in that. I say only that this man is not Christian if he said things like that. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt. Consider the benefit of the doubt put to rest. Trump has spent the last seven months campaigning heavily on the idea that he can block both Hispanics and Muslims from ever coming to the United States. His policies, such that they are, have been organized around attacking minority groups and advocating for the return of torture. At his essence, Trump s campaign is the exact opposite of Pope Francis  message of tolerance and compassion.Trump holds the distinction of having both pissed off the pope and also the entire country of Mexico. He infamously criticized the Catholic leader by dismissing him as just  a politician.  Francis didn t seem to mind, and in fact turned the tables on the attempted dig. Thank God he said I was a politician, because Aristotle defined the human person as  animal politicus.  So at least I am a human person. As to whether I am a pawn   well, maybe, I don t know. I ll leave that up to your judgment and that of the people. Trump is also deeply unpopular in Mexico following his repeated attacks against the Mexican people. He kicked off his presidential campaign by claiming the Mexican government was sending rapists across the border to sell drugs and attack American women. He s never walked back those ideas. He also claimed he would build a massive concrete wall across the entire southern border   at a cost estimated to be in the billions   and get Mexico to pay for it.The pope s criticisms of Trump come at a time when the candidate is desperately trying to prove that he is a very good Christian   with humiliating results. Trump, who once told shock jock Howard Stern that having unprotected sex with as many women as he had was his personal  Vietnam,  hasn t fooled very many people with this false change of heart.It takes a whole lot to get the pope to spend time taking you down a peg. Trump, for all of his hate speech and vile ideas, falls into that rare category of absolutely deserving it.Featured image via Flickr/Flickr ",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Cries ‘Unprecedented Persecution’ Because Gay People Can Get Married (AUDIO),"Right-wing Christians are always talking about how LGBT people having equal protections under the law will mean the end of Christianity. Well, the Supreme Court s ruling Obegefell v. Hodges, which made marriage equality legal nationwide was the worst fears of bigots everywhere becoming a reality   but not because of any actual anti   Christian elements to the ruling. The ruling simply says that anyone and everyone can marry whatever consenting adult they like. However, many bigoted Christians see the ability of anyone to do anything they don t like is persecution. On that list of morons who think that way is religious conservative and presidential candidate Ted Cruz.Cruz sat down to speak with right-wing radio host Janet Mefford on Thursday, and of course the conversation turned to his bigoted views on LGBT people. First, he bragged about being endorsed by hate groups such as the Family Research Council and The National Organization for marriage. Then, he went on along rant about how marriage equality was  illegitimate,  and how the Obergefell ruling was nothing short of disastrous Here is the quote (emphasis mine): I believe that decision was fundamentally illegitimate, it was lawless, it was unconstitutional and it will not stand. And I would note, that is precisely why Dr. James Dobson has endorsed me in this campaign, it is why Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council has endorsed me in this campaign, it s why the National Organization on Marriage [sic] has endorsed me on this campaign and has said it cannot support Donald Trump or Marco Rubio because if we re not willing to defend marriage, we are giving up the foundational building blocks of the family, we re giving up the Judeo-Christian values that built this great nation. And that is where you are dead wrong, Senator Cruz. This nation was not built upon Christianity. In fact, our Founding Fathers put explicit walls into our founding documents to ensure a complete separation between church and state. If you do not know that basic fact of our history and of our laws, then you have no business being in any public office, much less the presidency.This is what makes Cruz so dangerous. He is determined to turn America in a giant church via the law should he make it to the White House. That is why it is so important to make sure you VOTE BLUE in November 2016.Listen to the audio below, via Right Wing Watch:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247707760  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Pledges To Reveal ‘Who Really Knocked Down The World Trade Center’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump kicked off another round of Republican mind explosions at a campaign stop in South Carolina when he teased the idea that as president he would (illegally) leak a series of damning classified documents about what  really  happened on September 11, 2001.The Republican Party, whose official line is still that George W. Bush was a great president and the Iraq caused 9/11, have begun freaking out over Trump because unlike the other candidates, who are comfortable with that lie, Trump has increasingly criticized the Bush administration for their disastrous foreign policy. Things reached a head at Trump s latest rally.Trump says if he is elected:  you will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center. It wasn t the Iraqis,  he explained.  You may find it s the Saudis. They have papers in there that are very secret,  he also said, referencing the 28 still-classified pages of the 9/11 commission report.  But you will find out. It s been a common belief among both reporters and the public that the classified pages in the 9/11 commission report really do implicate Saudi Arabia as having some involvement in the attacks. Following the attacks, Bush s administration was put in the awkward position of either confronting their Middle Eastern ally (and oil provider) or scapegoating a different Middle Eastern country which they hated. They invaded Iraq.When Trump says he ll prove the Saudis were involved in 9/11 he isn t turning over any stones that haven t already been turned over, but he is reminding America that George W. Bush ran his administration based on a neverending torrent of deceit, false pretenses and fabrications. As such, the only people who still believe that Iraq was responsible for 9/11 are Republicans themselves.It reinforces the fact that the Republican Party has now become completely detached from reality. In a surreal moment at the last Republican debate, Trump   a candidate who has previously mocked a disabled reporter, suggested Muslims be barred from entering the United States, claimed Mexico was sending rapists across the border, advocated for bringing back torture, and any number of other outrageous things   was booed  because he pointed out that the Iraq War was a terrible idea. Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, all right?  said Trump.  George Bush made a mistake, we can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. The crowd didn t like that one.But Trump continued.  They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction   there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction. And the boos got much louder.Republicans cheer Trump when he lies to their faces about Mexicans and boo him when he points out the obvious. Welcome to the modern Republican Party.Feature image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr ",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 YMCA Camp Forces Black Children Through Slavery Reenactment,"A YMCA camp in Jackson, Michigan forced ten-year-old student campers to participate in a disturbing slavery reenactment  activity. During the activity, which took place at night, teachers and camp instructors acted as  slave masters,  forcing 5th grade campers to stand on a makeshift auction block.According to the mother of one student who endured the camp s slavery reenactment: The slave masters (camp instructors and teachers) had certificates which allowed them to pay for the slaves, and the students were required to hold up the certificates when they were bought or sold. The students, who were chased through the dark by their  slave masters  on horseback, were also ordered not to look the adult participants in the eye.Tiffany Birchett, the mother of two Black students who attended the camp last summer, was outraged after learning that her children had been put through this ordeal by camp leaders.She emailed the principal of her daughter s school, Pardee Elementary School in Dearborn Heights, saying: My daughter came home after the camp. She was very disturbed, and she told me what happened. First, I was wondering if this was a ritual that they do to these kids every year they attend the camp. She told me the camp instructors, including some of their teachers, were dancing and happy before they went out to do this slave re-enactment. Birchett told school officials that her 10-year-old daughter, Mikayla, was traumatized by the YMCA camp s slavery reenactment, which is dubbed by the camp as an educational activity called  The Underground Railroad. She went on to say: As the mother of an African American son and daughter, I am dismayed that Pardee Elementary would authorize and condone such an extremely racially insensitive and damaging activity. Likewise, Regina Crutchfield, the mother of a 5th grade student at Jane Addams Elementary in Redford, Michigan, came forward to say that her daughter had been put through the same experience at the YMCA camp, and was similarly traumatized. My daughter said she was scared. One of the guys (camp instructors) re-enacted killing a deputy. They should not do that in front of a 10-year-old, and not when kids are hundreds of miles away from home. If they want to teach black history, they should do that in the classroom. As the Detroit News reports here, both the principal of Pardee Elementary School and the YMCA camp defended the slavery reenactment, which forced Black students like Mikayla Birchett and Crutchfield s daughter, Brooklyn Jones, to relive the trauma of slavery, even as their white, adult leaders celebrated.On February 4, Michigan ACLU Racial Justice Project attorney, Mark Fancher, sent a letter to Kevin Washington, the Black president and CEO of the YMCA USA, demanding a halt to the program.Francher wrote: Not only is the Underground Railroad activity emotionally and intellectually harmful it also creates a racially hostile environment that has legal implications both for the camp in its role as an educational institution or agent of an educational institution, and for the schools that send their students to the camp facility. The same day that the letter was sent out, Francher received a call from the head of YMCA s Camp Storer, saying that the underground railroad activity was  officially discontinued.  The decision was confirmed by the Detroit News.The ACLU issued the following statement, We applaud the YMCA s mature and responsible decision to terminate the Underground Railroad activity. The activity presented a risk of trauma for children who identify with their enslaved ancestors. We encourage further efforts to educate children about slavery but without re-enactments and in consultation with experts. According to the Detroit News, children attending YMCA camps have been forced to endure this experience for more than 20 years.Featured image from Wikipedia",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jeb Bush Rally Becomes Counseling Session As Supporters Give Him Advice To Fix His Struggling Campaign,"A desperate Jeb Bush held a campaign rally at a South Carolina golf course on Wednesday, and all his supporters wanted to do was give him advice on how to fix his struggling campaign.Bush was probably hoping to come out swinging as the South Carolina primary approaches, but his worried fans had different concerns.Like a child being advised on how to deal with being bullied, one Bush supporter named Edward Scott told Bush that he should  raise the bar  and rise above the bullying by Trump because his message is being lost the more Bush gets frazzled by the billionaire mogul. Your message doesn t resonate with the national community.   I was wondering because of your civility if you could raise the bar in the next session and try to be beyond the bully because I think that s who you are and I think they try to knock you off center. It appears you do get knocked off center, like anyone would, because of the insults to your family. I don t think I feel shaken up by the bully,  Bush replied.  I m the only guy going after the guy who I believe is hijacking the party. David Villinger also voiced concern about Trump taking over the race while Bush desperately focuses on attacking him instead of focusing on delivering his own message. I think the campaign has been co-opted by the P.T. Barnum of our time. And I think he is getting you off your good message and all the times that you ve shared with us today. But I think I would encourage you to emphasize those things. Indeed, Jeb Bush is currently polling in a distant fourth place behind Trump, who leads the field with 34 percent while Bush only has under 10 percent.Cruz clocks in at second place with 17 percent and Rubio is a close third place with 16 percent. Clearly, nobody is really all that excited about Jeb.In the end, Jeb Bush not only received advice, he got bad news because South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley endorsed Marco Rubio even after Jeb sent his brother to meet with her. Jeb could only give reporters some parting sarcasm. It s all been decided, apparently. The pundits have already figured it out. We don t have to go vote. I should stop campaigning maybe. And that s probably the best idea Jeb Bush has had throughout his entire campaign.

But he wasn t arrested for trying to join domestic terrorists; he was arrested for his role as ringleader in the 2014 Nevada stand-off in which a group of armed assholes pointed guns at federal agents and threatened to shoot them.On Wednesday, Bundy, along with his idiot sons, was indicted and now faces life in prison:All were charged with conspiracy, carrying a firearm in relation to a violent crime, obstruction of justice, extortion, and assault and threats against federal law enforcement.The charge of assault on a federal law enforcement officer carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. If convicted, the defendants would also have to forfeit at least $3 million worth of property secured through the crimes, the statement said.The most delicious part about this is that the Bundys were so intent on making a media spectacle of their  brave  stance against the federal government that there is hours and hours of footage of them threatening to murder law enforcement and pointing their guns at agents. If they hadn t been so arrogant, they might have been able to plant the seeds of doubt in the minds of the jury. As it is, their eagerness to rally  Murika to a second Civil War has all but guaranteed that Cliven will die in jail and his two sons will be in their 60s and possibly broke by the time they get out.While Bundy rotting in jail will put a smile on many of our faces, it does little to erase the fact that Bundy and his fellow domestic terrorists walked free for over a year for a crime that would have left anyone less white or conservative riddled with bullets. White Right Wing Privilege in this country is out of control. The only reason the Moron Militia thought they could get away with violently seizing a federal building is because of the FBI s lack of action in Nevada. They truly and honestly thought that they could throw their temper tantrum, play Freedom Fighter for a few weeks and then just go home like nothing ever happened. Listening to their press conferences (PRESS CONFERENCES!) and podcasts, they were shocked to their core that they would have to pay for their crimes. Honestly, I m surprised none of them blurted out,  But I m a white conservative! You can t arrest me! This is MY country! Hopefully, Cliven and his followers going to prison will send a clear signal to the rest of the militia movement that their reckless disregard for the rule of law won t be tolerated in America. We should only be so lucky.Featured image via AI archives",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Baby Dolphin Dies After Tourists Pass It Around For Photos (VIDEO/IMAGES),"Last week, a baby dolphin was found on at beach of the Santa Teresita resort, located in Argentina. Tourists saw the baby dolphin and did what tourists do   they took pictures of the poor animal. It turns out that the baby dolphin died because the people on the beach kept out of the water too long.Here is the photo taken by one a person on the beach:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209159500094765&set=a.10201500166576214.1073741829.1537837065&type=3&theaterHere is video footage of the incident:The Wildlife Foundation in Argentina found photos and video of the tourists tormenting the dolphin. They took the opportunity to try to raise awareness about the type of dolphin and what people need to do when they find a dolphin on the beach. They write in a press release: [The]Franciscan or Plata dolphin is one of the smallest dolphins in the world, is between 1.30 and 1.70 m long. His skin, brown tones, reminiscent of the habit of the Franciscan monks, so it gets the common name. Only it is found in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. In our country lives mainly off the coasts of the province of Buenos Aires, where it is very likely that there are less than 30,000 individuals. Franciscan in a vulnerable to extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). No le saques fotos. Ayudalo a volver al agua Estas situaciones pueden llevar a su muerte https://t.co/TUDboTBzdZ pic.twitter.com/feZMG4oFCJ  Vida Silvestre (@Vida_Silvestre) February 17, 2016The fact that this species of dolphin is endangered makes the dolphin s death just that much more tragic. This incident should help the public understand the urgent need to return these dolphins to the sea when they get close to the shore,  the foundation said.  The Franciscana, like other species, cannot remain for much time outside of the water, it has thick skin full of fat which regulates its body temperature, so taking it out of the water rapidly causes it to dehydrate and die. What those people did is absolutely horrendous. Hopefully, this tragedy will raise awareness about what people should do when they encounter beached marine life.

 Donald Trump Just Humiliated Himself By Mistaking Sanders’ Policy Positions For His Own (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s appearance at an MSNBC town hall event Wednesday didn t go very well for him when host Mika Brzezinski played a little game with him. It was simple: she would describe a candidate and Trump would guess who she was speaking about. Pretty simple, right?Brzezinski gave the following description of a candidate: The candidate is considered a political outsider by all the pundits. He s tapping into all the anger of the voters, delivers a populist message. He believes everyone in the country should have healthcare. He advocates for hedge fund managers to pay higher taxes. He s drawing thousands of people at his rallies and bringing in a lot of new voters to the political process, and he s not beholden to any super PAC. Who am I describing? Or any special interests or any donors,  he said, adding.  You re describing Donald Trump. Actually, I was describing Bernie Sanders,  Brzezinski said as the audience burst into laughter. That s good,  Trump conceded. The billionaire, who has spent his career ripping people off, says that there is one area in which they agree   that  our country is being ripped off big-league on trade    though he says Sanders   can t do anything about it because he  doesn t understand  the problem.Trump, of course, doesn t understand much of anything past how to creepily talk openly about how much he wants to f*ck his daughter. His rise in popularity has nothing to do with how much he can accomplish, his knowledge, or anything substantive. Trump s ascension is linked to his talk of building walls, of rounding up Muslims into concentration camps, of banning brown people from entering the country. His supporters are largely uneducated bigots who simply like him because he  speaks his mind    the same thing your irritating right-wing uncle does at holiday dinners.Trump s harnessing of the anger of the Stupid Part of America is very real. Make no mistake about it: he will absolutely be bringing voters to the polls in November. It is important that you register to vote. If your state has enacted voter ID legislation in an effort to disenfranchise certain segments of the population, make sure you obtain all the required documentation to vote   and vote BLUE.Watch Trump embarrass himself below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ben Carson CLEARLY Concerned Over What Plagues Our Communities: Bear Attacks (VIDEO),"In a perfect world, there would be extraordinarily qualified presidential candidates coming from both sides of the aisle. We d have a battle of the minds. Those who differed in matters of political opinion and policy approach, but all respectable choices. Alas, we don t live in a perfect world. Currently, the United States has one major political party with two very respectable candidates, either of which would make a fine choice as Commander-in-Chief, varying only in strategy, but not terribly in ideology. The other major political party is basically made up of rejects from their high school student council who grew up and couldn t get into leadership roles within their home owner s association, so they decided to go in to politics. To be blunt, there is NO good choice for president running for the Republicans. They all make shit up as they go along.Case in point: Ben Carson.When asked a question regarding Christian values as compared to the social values of Republicans, and how they really don t go together, Carson replied: My stance is that, we the people have the responsibility to take care of the indigent in our society.  It s not the government s job.  You can read the constitution all you want, it never says that it is the government s job and I think where we ve gotten confused. In the old days of America when communities were separated by hundreds of miles, why were they able to thrive?  Because if it was harvest time and the farmer was up in the tree picking apples and fell down and broke his leg, everybody pitched in and harvested his crops for him.  If somebody got killed by a bear, everybody took care of their family. Who the hell is getting killed by a bear? Where the hell are they living? And is it a bear, such as one you d find in the forest, or one you d find in the Castro. These are all questions we d like to have answered. Don t leave us hanging like this, Ben. Sure, he s talking about the  old days,  but how far back are we going? If we re talking about the days when the nation was founded, well, we re not exactly living in the same sort of society with the same needs, and we now have different resources available.Carson s broader point seems to be, we don t need government if we can take care of ourselves and our communities. However, the nation is composed of many different types of communities that are all represented in this thing we call government. Which is an organizational structure in this little thing we like to call, civilization. Without which, we would slip into chaos and despair in what some would call Social Darwinism. So, while Carson s story is sweet, and weird, but actually kind of scary, the  everybody   that took care of the family is the community structure. Carson actually makes a very good argument for liberals, and especially Hillary Clinton s  it takes a village  argument.Anyway, watching Carson talk about a bear attack is very entertaining, and you ll likely watch it at least five times. So, enjoy! When asked about social values, Ben Carson reflects on ye olde times, when bear attacks were the norm. pic.twitter.com/eOZH4mR1Jz  Mashable News (@MashableNews) February 18, 2016Video/Featured image from Twitter/Wikimedia",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Americans Tell Senate GOP To Let President Obama Pick Supreme Court Nominee (IMAGE),"Sorry, Republicans. The American people have spoken and you lose.Ever since Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republicans have insisted that President Obama should let whoever wins the 2016 presidential election nominate the new Supreme Court Justice. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even vowed not to even consider anyone Obama picks, which is a complete betrayal of the Constitution and everything Scalia stood for.And the American people overwhelmingly disagree with the GOP.Not only is President Obama serving out the final year of the second term a majority of Americans elected him to serve, a new poll shows that Americans still want him to the job despite what Republicans want.A new Rasmussen poll indicates that Americans not only think President Obama should make the pick, they say Senate Republicans should NOT block any nomination Obama puts forth.All told, 51 percent of Americans say President Obama is still the commander-in-chief, therefore he should get to replace Scalia, while only 43 percent say he shouldn t. An even bigger percentage of people, 53 percent, say Senate Republicans should not stand in his way. Only 35 percent say Senate Republicans should remain the obstructionist assholes they are.Here s a chart showing the poll results via ThinkProgress.The poll represents the opinions of likely voters, which means Republicans should probably reconsider their stance since any political stunt could hurt them on Election Day. People are sick and tired of GOP obstructionism and blocking President Obama from filling a vacant seat on the Supreme Court out of some sick political game won t impress voters at all.But rather than listen to the American people, Republicans will probably ignore them like they did when they listened to Ted Cruz and shut down the government. If Republicans really care about not getting their asses totally handed to them at the voting booth this November, they need to suck it up, respect that President Obama is still their president, and give any nominee he puts forward a fair confirmation hearing. That s what the American people want, that s what the American people should get.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bad News, GOP: Justice Sandra Day O’Connor Backs Obama In Supreme Court Fight","President Obama just received the highest profile supporter for his quest to fulfill his Constitutional duties by nominating a successor to recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia s seat on the Supreme Court. Retired Justice Sandra Day O Connor, the first woman to serve in that capacity, told an interviewer that Obama is right   America needs a Justice. I don t agree (with Republicans),  O Connor said in an interview with Phoenix-based Fox affiliate KSAZ.  We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it. She noted that it s unusual to for a Supreme Court opening to exist in an election year, saying that the proximity to the presidential race  creates too much talk around the thing that isn t necessary. She said Obama should name a replacement for Scalia, an influential conservative member of the nation s high court who was found dead Saturday at age 79.O Connor also told the station that  you just have to pick the best person you can under these circumstances,  adding,  I wish the president well as he makes choices and goes down that line. The retired justice adds to the slowly growing chorus of voices on the right who have begun to peel off of the original assertion that Obama should not be able to appoint Scalia s replacement. Now some Republicans are closer to the Democratic position, arguing that as has been done in the past, a nomination in the president s final year should not be summarily rejected.O Connor was nominated in 1981 by Ronald Reagan, but while appointed by a conservative president over time she came to be seen as a  swing  justice, never exclusively on one side of an issue.For instance, while she voted in the majority in the Bush v Gore election case in 2000, she also voted with the majority in favor of abortion rights and campaign finance reform.O Connor stepped down from the court in 2005, and was replaced by George W. Bush s nominee, Samuel Alito, a hardcore conservative.Featured image via Twitter",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Why Was A Nazi Sympathizer Just Buried At Arlington Cemetery?,"A Nazi sympathizer was recently buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the sacred burial ground for American servicemen and woman and the last resting place for historical figures like John F. Kenney, William Howard Taft, Ted Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy.By contrast, Willis Carto was a notorious Nazi sympathizer who renounced World War II, which he fought in. His service in the Philippines earned him a purple heart and the right to be buried at Arlington, despite the reprehensible views he held until he died.Through a number of initiatives   including the Liberty Lobby, a white supremacist organization Carto founded, and the Institute for Historical Review, a group he started to promote Holocaust denial   Carto enjoyed influence among a marginal but significant population of American bigots especially motivated by anti-Jewish hysteria.At the height of the Liberty Lobby s popularity in the 1980s, there were 400,000 subscribers to its newsletter, according an obituary for Carto in The New York Times.Todd Blodgett, who managed advertising for the Liberty Lobby and spied on Carto for the FBI from 2000 to 2002, said the deceased anti-Semitic leader wanted to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery because of the  irony,  given his pro-Nazi views.Even those who went to Arlington to see Carto buried shared his sick world view. One man told The Huffington Post that Carto  stood up for the best interests of this country and against all the special interests,  and clarified that by these interests he meant Jewish people.Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center described Carto s presence in the cemetery as a  national disgrace  and pointed out that the former soldier  would have been a perfect candidate to be a cabinet member in Hitler s government. Perhaps the absurdity of Carto s burial, next to men and women who fought to defeat the ideals he was a proponent of, will change the military criteria for burial at Arlington. Perhaps, instead of simply taking into account commendations received while in combat, the views and affiliations of prospective Arlington burial subjects throughout their whole lives will have to be considered.The cemetery is a place for war heroes, not Nazi sympathizers.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Marco Rubio Seems To Think Harming Hillary Clinton Is A Funny Idea (VIDEO),"When you re running for office, especially when you re running for President of the United States, you re going to say and do whatever is necessary to get votes to put you into office. However, part of your job as a candidate is to also make sure you are not only holding yourself accountable for the things that you say, but also for what the people in your supporting crowds are saying. For instance, when John McCain stood up for Barack Obama back in the 2008 election when one of his supporters was saying awful things about the then senator.It seems Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) has yet to learn that very important lesson, and it may come back to haunt him. At a recent campaign event in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Rubio was addressing the crowd and telling everyone that if he were to become president he would never close down the military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It was after these remarks that a person in the crowd decided to shout,  WATERBOARD HILLARY!  Which was a clear reference to both the torture that occurred at Guantanamo as well as how some people would like to harm and torture former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Now, Rubio, clearly hearing what had been said because he chuckled, decided to just laugh it off and ignore it. He knew it was bad, because he said he didn t want to make a deal of it as the media was there to record everything. And record they did. They recorded Rubio shrugging the entire thing off instead of asking the man not to say such a terrible thing. Which, in all honestly, would ve made Rubio look like a better human being. However, knowing jerks like Donald Trump are leading in the polls after not only allowing horrible things to be said, but saying horrible things himself, Rubio probably figures his base will enjoy these sort of shenanigans.Needless to say, Rubio shrugging off a call for torture on a former First Lady and Secretary of State as well as a current candidate for president isn t at all surprising, but it doesn t make it any less appalling.Here s the video: Video/Featured image: CNN",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bundy Militant Files $666 BILLION Lawsuit Against Government For ‘Damages From The Works Of The Devil’,"The moment the initial members of the Bundy militants were arrested, effectively ending the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, one thing was for certain: as paranoid, anti-government conspiracy theorists, these people could be counted on for some absolute batsh*t crazy legal defenses. But no one could anticipate the sheer stupidity of their other legal filings.Shawna Cox, the woman who falsely claimed that LaVoy Finicum was executed with his hands in the air when in actuality he was attempting to pull a gun on law enforcement, filed a lawsuit against the big, bad federal government. Cox is seeking a whopping $666,666,666,666.66 in damages because she says the government harmed her in performing  works of the devil    including her attempted execution.KATU reports that Cox, who managed to convince the court to do her a special favor in allowing her to attend Finicum s funeral, quickly found her lawsuit tossed out because her claims are not cognizable in this criminal proceeding and will not be addressed in this case. Cox maintains that she did not interfere with public employees when she and her friends undertook an armed occupation of the Refuge because  it was their choice not to come to work out of guilt,  that federal employees were  secretly extending the boundaries  of Malheur, and says that she is being  maliciously prosecuted by the State and Federal Bar Association members because they do not want to be held accountable for their subversive activities against the people of the United States of America. No one is safe from her wrath. Cox says she will be asking the jury to  render civil and criminal charges against  a number of  public officials,  including  All of the Oregon State Bar members, and public employees who were involved in the persecution, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective council involving the incarceration of the Hammonds, including each and every one of them who violated the separation of powers and held offices in the judiciary and / or legislative and /or executive branches at the same time,  anyone who interfered with the  militia s  attempt to form an illegal and unrecognized Grand Jury to prosecute public officials, and  all involved in the ambush that attempted to execute myself and others and executed LaVoy Finicum. She also says she wants charges against  all state, public, and federal officials involved in organizing and authorizing the ambush execution of myself and others including LaVoy Finicum  as well as  all of the state employees involved in the ambush that attempted to execute myself and others, and resulted in LaVoy Finicum s murder. Cox specifically names Judge Grasty, Senator Cliff Bentz, Harney County Prosecutor Tim Calhoun, Governor Kate Brown, U.S. prosecutors Dwight Holton, Kirk Engdall, Kelley Zusman, S. Amanda Marshall, Judge Hogan, and Judge Ann Aiken as well as  officials who committed crimes against the Hammond family and myself by omissions and misprision [sic] pf felony s [sic],  Sheriff David Ward and Special Agent Katherine Armstrong.She says she is seeking the $666 billion in damages because these individuals subjected her to  damages from the works of the devil. If this seems nuts to you, you re probably right. These armed and crazed individuals declared war on the federal government, openly, and have essentially received a slap on the wrist for their anti-government efforts.Words can not describe the insanity of this woman s claims, so read them for yourself.

 Billionaire SuperPAC Launches Ad Against $15 Min. Wage And Bernie Sanders (VIDEO),"The billionaire class is getting very scared of two things: the fight for 15 movement and Bernie Sanders.The grassroots movement to elect Bernie Sanders and the movement to elect Bernie Sanders are very much fueled by the same thing. A drive to make the United States a nation, that once again, allows for all people to live a dignified life.Here is the ad:Of course, the billionaire class is not having any of that nonsense. That s why the Future 45 Super PAC is running an ad that tries to take out two progressive birds at the same time. The Intercept reports that future 45 is being run by Brian O. Walsh. He is a major player in the conservative dark money network, that works to bash left-wing candidates and issues.Future 45 appears to be primarily funded by two hedge fund managers that are supporting the Republican candidate, Marco Rubio.While this may seem troubling to those who support raising the minimum wage, or those who support Bernie Sanders, or both, this could be taken as a good sign. As Hillary Clinton likes to point out, she has faced a major brunt of negative attack ads from Republican SuperPACs. They fact that they are now attacking Sanders means that they are taking him seriously.I m not exactly sure who the ad for is for, though. The claims in the ad are the usual  raising the minimum wage will kill jobs  nonsense that comes from the right. They attack Sanders, saying that he will raise taxes. They fail to mention who would be paying the vast majority of those taxes   billionaires like the ones who created the ad.  Is Future 45 trying to sway voters to vote for Clinton because she will be much softer on Wall St. than Sanders? Or are they just trying to fill conservatives  heads with talking points for the general election?Either way,  both the Fight for 15 movement and Robin Hood Tax movement, which inspired Sanders  plan to put a micro-tax on Wall St. speculation, are two pragmatic progressive ideas whose time has come.Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives Lose Their MINDS Over Obama Skipping Racist Hatemonger Scalia’s Funeral (SCREENSHOTS),"Politico reports that Barack and Michelle Obama will not be attending the funeral for racist, hate-mongering, recently deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. While it is unlikely that Scalia, who opposed marriage and gender equality, voting protections for African-Americans, affordable healthcare, and everything else the President stands for, would have wanted Obama to be in attendance at his funeral (if nothing else, because of the President s skin color), conservatives are downright furious that the socialist, Communist, anti-Christian, Muslim, atheist, Kenyan dictator will not be in attendance. The president and the First :ady on Friday will travel to the Supreme Court to pay their respects to Justice Scalia as he lies in repose there at the Supreme Court,  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced Wednesday, adding that  Vice President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will attend Justice Scalia s funeral at the Basilica on Saturday. Currently, Scalia s body lies in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court where the public, including President Obama, is invited to pay their respects   something the President and First Lady will certainly do. Unfortunately, this was not enough for the inbred, meth-fueled  informed   readers  at right-wing blog Twitchy.                              Even the  liberal media  got in some jabs. NBC reports:When asked whether Obama s Saturday plans include golfing, Earnest stressed instead that the president believes it is important to honor Scalia s life and service.President Obama is paying his respects to Scalia in the court. The Vice President and his spouse will be in attendance. No one did anything wrong.

 Ted Cruz Absolutely Loses It During This MUST WATCH Press Conference (VIDEO),"During a press conference in South Carolina on Wednesday, Ted Cruz proved that as things heat up in the Republican primary election, the Republican candidates  crazy is being brought to a boiling point.South Carolina is the Republicans  firewall state against anti-establishment candidates. It s the state where candidates such as Donald Trump are supposed to burn out. After Trump s win in New Hampshire, all the candidates are fighting like mad to secure a win in the first southern primary.So, enter Ted Cruz at a press conference where he has to be seen as both more moderate than Trump and also win over his supporters. That s why during the press conference he is forced to posture, saying things like daring Trump to sue him.The real hilarity comes, though, when Ted Cruz does his best to try and lampoon his Not-Trump rival, Marco Rubio. During the press conference, Cruz answers questions from reporters. Cruz both brings up and attempts to dismiss things that he has come under fire for. The whole thing amounts to very long, nearly schizophrenic, rant. Whoever told Ted Cruz to do this, needs to be fired. I don t think that this press conference did anything except possibly make Rubio look much more practical in the eyes of moderate conservatives.Cruz spent a lot of time denying what he calls lies being put forth by Trump and Rubio. Specifically, most of those lies that revolve around allegations that Cruz using push polls in South Carolina. The Washington Post first reported on the push polls that have been very supportive in their calls to voters throughout the state. They appear to be being conducted by Remington Research, a research firm hired by the Cruz campaign.Cruz claims that anyone could be conducting the polls. Which is ludicrous. Especially in light of the fact that Cruz seems to now be trying to paint this as a conspiracy being orchestrated by some combination of Trump, Rubio, and well  anyone Cruz can point his finger at.You can watch the press conference below.Featured image from video screenshot ",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Paul Krugman, Top Economists: Bernie Sanders Is Engaging In ‘Fantasy Economics’","It can be said that Senator Bernie Sanders is one of the most sincere politicians in all of politics. He s ambitious with a gusto for progress that is really unmatched. However, this gusto for pushing forward an economic agenda that is unparalleled by everyone running against him has left several leading economists scratching their heads, including Paul Krugman.In Krugman s recent post in the New York Times he brings up a challenge to the economic thought of both Sanders and Professor Gerald Friedman, who makes the claim that the Vermont Senator s economic plan would make jobs and income soar. Friedman states that real economic growth under Sanders would grow to 5.3% per year. That s as opposed to where we are now, which is at around 2%.Krugman writes: OK, progressives have, rightly, mocked Jeb Bush for claiming that he could double growth to 4 percent. Now people close to Sanders say 5.3??? Even those of us who believe that there s still significant slack in the US labor market are aware that much, probably most, of the decline in labor force participation since 1999 reflects an aging population   prime-working-age LFPR has reclaimed most of the lost ground since the Great Recession, and there s probably a long-term downward trend even there. It s possible that we can get unemployment down under 4 percent, but that s way below any estimates I ve seen of the level of unemployment consistent with moderate inflation. Krugman goes so far as to even say that if this sort of line was being perpetuated by a Republican, it would be described as  deep voodoo.  He continued, saying: Sanders needs to disassociate himself from this kind of fantasy economics right now. And  he concluded by stating that if his campaign disagrees with this assessment, which is backed up by fellow leading economic advisers, we ll be looking at a Trump presidency for sure.In a letter to Sanders and Friedman from  former Chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers for Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton  Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, Christina Romer, and Laura D Andrea Tyson, they state that they  have worked to make the Democratic Party the party of evidence-based economic policy.  Continuing, they wrote: We are concerned to see the Sanders campaign citing extreme claims by Gerald Friedman about the effect of Senator Sanders s economic plan claims that cannot be supported by the economic evidence. Friedman asserts that your plan will have huge beneficial impacts on growth rates, income and employment that exceed even the most grandiose predictions by Republicans about the impact of their tax cut proposals.As much as we wish it were so, no credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes. Making such promises runs against our party s best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic. These claims undermine the credibility of the progressive economic agenda and make it that much more difficult to challenge the unrealistic claims made by Republican candidates. With Goolsbee even going so far as to separately also say,  they ve evolved into magic flying puppies with winning Lotto tickets tied to their collars  when he was commenting on another summation of Sanders  proposals by another progressive analyst.It seems pretty harsh, but it also seems they clearly to want to get their point across.Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Mocks Conservatives That Claim To Be Constitutional Scholars (VIDEO),"President Barack Obama has addressed the ridiculous demands that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans like presidential candidate Ted Cruz have placed on him, insisting that he forego nominating a new Supreme Court justice after the sudden passing of Justice Antonin Scalia.This takedown moment came at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Leaders Summit in California, where Obama sent his  heartfelt condolences  to Scalia s loved ones. When he was asked what he would do if McConnell actually went through with threats to block his SCOTUS nominee, Obama ripped the Republicans a new one by reminding them that it was his constitutional duty to find a replacement, and that it was their constitutional duty to  do their job  and vote on his nominee. He said: The Constitution is pretty clear about what s supposed to happen now: When there s a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the President of the United States is to nominate someone. The senate is to consider that nomination and either they disapprove of that nominee or that nominee is elevated to the Supreme Court.Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. Obama, who is actually a former constitutional law professor, then hilariously mocked the Republican lawmakers who tried to deny his presidential duties with ridiculous interpretations of the U.S. Constitution: I m amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there. We ve almost gotten accustomed to how obstructionist the Senate has become when it comes to nominations. In some ways, this argument is just an extension of what we ve seen in the Senate, generally. Obama voiced his disappointment in the Republicans  resolve to stop him, noting that the Supreme Court is  the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics.  Going forward, Obama suggested that it would be  a good moment for us to rise above  the resistance and obstructionism in Congress.Then, Obama said another thing the GOP wouldn t like   that they were far from discouraging him from fulfilling his responsibility to nominate, in due time, a very well-qualified candidate.  Obama said: If we are following basic precedent, then that nominee will be presented before the committees, the vote will be taken and, ultimately, they will be confirmed. Although Obama didn t reveal who he would choose, the president did assure everyone that We re going to find somebody who is an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law. I m going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat, and any fair-minded person, even somebody who disagrees with my politics, would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court.

 Here’s What The World’s Top Economist Is Saying About Bernie Sanders,"Thomas Piketty, the French economist who started a revolution of thought on income inequality when he wrote Capital in the Twenty-First Century. He is now considered one of the world s top economists. He is now sharing his thoughts on Bernie Sanders and the movement that is driving his campaignPikkety agrees that Bernie Sanders and his supporters have the right idea when it comes to economics. Though the economist suggests that Sanders may be too  white  and too old to win an election.Other than those two caveats, Pikkety gives Bernie Sanders a glowing, if tacit, endorsement, writing that,  In many respects, we are witnessing the end of the politico-ideological cycle opened by the victory of Ronald Reagan at the 1980 elections. Conservatism in the media may have something to do with the reason Pikkety is critical of Sanders  electability with racial and other political minorities. Recent polls show the race between Sanders and Clinton is a dead heat. Polls seem to indicate that the main difference between Clinton supporters and Sanders supporters is generational.Piketty goes on to say that Sanders is reviving the progressive agenda. He writes: Sanders  success today shows that much of America is tired of rising inequality and these so-called political changes, and intends to revive both a progressive agenda and the American tradition of egalitarianism. Hillary Clinton, who fought to the left of Barack Obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance, appears today as if she is defending the status quo, just another heiress of the Reagan-Clinton-Obama political regime.Sanders makes clear he wants to restore progressive taxation and a higher minimum wage ($15 an hour). To this he adds free healthcare and higher education in a country where inequality in access to education has reached unprecedented heights, highlighting a gulf standing between the lives of most Americans, and the soothing meritocratic speeches pronounced by the winners of the system.Meanwhile, the Republican party sinks into a hyper-nationalist, anti-immigrant and anti-Islam discourse (even though Islam isn t a great religious force in the country), and a limitless glorification of the fortune amassed by rich white people. The judges appointed under Reagan and Bush have lifted any legal limitation on the influence of private money in politics, which greatly complicates the task of candidates like Sanders. Since the oh so tragic passing of Justice Antonio Scalia, the Supreme Court may have the votes needed to end Citizen s United. That would be a major gift to future progressive candidates   Berniecrats   who would abstain from SuperPACs.The way that this election is playing out, it appears that we are witnessing a battle of generations be played out more than anything else. Regardless of who takes the nomination in this election, Sanders  supporters are very much the face of the future of the left.Featured image from Gage Skidmore [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox News Gets BURNED By The Monster They Created,"Fox News created a monster, and now he is eating them alive.Over the course of President Obama s presidency, Fox News gleefully welcomed Donald Trump to the studio, whether in person or via telephone to make crazy attacks against him, thus instantly making him a star among the network s conservative viewers.And it seems like the honeymoon between Fox and Trump would never end as Fox initially supported Trump s presidential campaign.But then Trump totally turned against Fox News, particularly host Megyn Kelly, and it s been downhill ever since.As Trump continues to lead in the Republican primary polls by a large margin, he has been able to keep massive support from conservatives while repeatedly attacking Fox News.And the Republican billionaire continued slamming Fox News on Wednesday morning at a rally in South Carolina and on Twitter, where he took aim at Fox for being biased. Fox News is so biased it is disgusting,  Trump wrote, accusing the network of of trying to kill his campaign via negative messaging..@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2016Trump then expanded upon his attack during the rally. I get treated so badly. I was watching Fox this morning. They treat me so badly. Fox treats me, like, worse than anybody. But I get treated badly by the media. I don t even   I don t really understand why. They have pundits on that are just one after another negative, negative, negative. It started where actually nobody   they all thought I wasn t going to run and they said,  he ll never run, he ll never run  and then they look bad and then they just don t stop. Some of them have become much better but I think Fox in particular treats me so badly, it s incredible. Here s the video via YouTube.Because of Trump, it s very possible that Fox s audience is now split on how to feel about the network, which affect ratings. And remember, Fox News only has themselves to blame.

 Long Lost Footage Of Bernie Being Arrested At Civil Rights Protest In 1963 Silences His Critics (VIDEO),"A team of documentary filmmakers made what may be a discovery of intense historical importance while working on a project looking at Chicago school protests through the decades. In extremely rare footage, they think they found a previously unknown recording of a very young Bernie Sanders getting roughly arrested while he staged a protest against school segregation in 1963.It has been public knowledge that Sanders was arrested during his time at the University of Chicago for protesting racism during the Civil Rights Movement. However, for many of his critics, seeing is believing.For reasons that remain baffling, many of Sanders  critics   both on the right and on the left   have spent this election accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of insufficient sincerity when he speaks out against racism and discusses social justice issues. Salon channeled these criticisms in an unevenly cooked thinkpiece on Sanders:Writing recently in Vox, Dara Lind pointed out Sanders  near total blindness to black and Latino issues at his campaign s opening, with almost nothing expressly addressing matters of racial justice to be found in speeches and campaign literature. Sanders is a white politician from the whitest state in the union, and his intense focus on economic populism sounds incomplete in the post-Ferguson moment. Sanders only recently infused his stump speech with matters of racial justice, and despite his rapid and surprising success, a recent NBC/WSJ poll found him to be what the New York Times called a  virtual unknown among black voters.  Sanders will certainly have to do more to gain the much-needed black vote once the campaign leaves the very white Iowa and New Hampshire.But perhaps the reason why so many people seem to believe Sanders has a  total blindness to black and Latino issues  is because he isn t always talking about them, but actually doing something about them   rare for a politician, I know. Being able to see Sanders, a very young man who wasn t trying to pander for votes or win an election, get roughed up by Chicago police officers while fighting for racial justice in his school is a powerful moment. How many other candidates can say the same?It should be noted that 1963 was a pretty scary time for civil rights activists. Protests would routinely end in violence, often at the hands of the police who were tasked with  keeping the peace.  From the footage above, we can see that the police weren t exactly known for their light touch. Just one year after Sanders  arrest, several white activists who traveled to Mississippi to organize voting rights protests were murdered in cold blood. For African-Americans it was even more dangerous. In the Jim Crow South, lynchings and organized terror campaigns by both vigilante groups like the KKK and state-endorsed cops were common. Standing up for what you believed in took an incredible amount of courage.In Chicago, a supposedly  liberal  city in the North, things were still dominated by racism. At the time, segregated public schools had led to massively overpopulated and run down black schools. Rather than integrate, a racist CPS Superintendent named Benjamin Willis threw many black students into sweltering aluminum trailers and passed those metal boxes off as  classrooms.  Critics had another name: Willis Wagons.  It was among these Willis Wagon farms that Sanders was arrested.If the definition of character is what you do when nobody is watching, then the critics of Sanders legacy of civil rights activism have very little ground to complain. Five decades ago Sanders was just a university student who saw injustice and decided to fight against it.Feature image via Vimeo",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bette Midler Uses Cruz And Trump’s Own Insults Against Them In This DELICIOUSLY Vulgar Tweet,"Bette Midler has been busy sticking it to the GOP Clown Car candidates on Twitter. It s easy to do; after all the lot of them are a national embarrassment. The Devine Miss M. just took her Twitter treatment of Clown #1 and Clown #2   Donald Trump and Ted Cruz   to the next level, and this time it was their own words she used to give them yet another much deserved insult. Midler sent out a tweet on Wednesday afternoon that read: Trump called Ted Cruz a  pussy ? Well, Trump s a dick so maybe they should get together and fuck off! Trump called Ted Cruz a ""pussy""? Well, Trump's a dick so maybe they should get together and fuck off!  Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) February 15, 2016What s so awesome about this is that Bette Midler didn t even need to come up with this on her own   Trump and Cruz just handed her all the ammunition she needed, and she took it and fired the perfect shot. Likely, if Trump, at least, has seen this, he is likely foaming at the mouth and seething. That also means he likely is just itching to attack Midler in one of his infamously childish Twitter rants.However, even Trump must know better than to do that.

" Ben Carson STUNS Republicans, Admits Democrats Are Right (AUDIO)","It looks as though Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson didn t thoroughly read his GOP politicking handbook, because if he had, he wouldn t have said what he just did on the radio.While discussing if the president should nominate a new Supreme Court Justice after the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, Carson basically told the folks over on WRNN 99.5 FM in South Carolina that President Obama should nominate someone. He was given the hypothetical question of if there was a Republican president in office would all these candidates be asking them to wait to nominate, and Carson replied,  No, they wouldn t. Continuing, he said: But then again, recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues, so there s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn t be an ideologue also. However, Carson never says that Obama shouldn t nominate anyone. He instead said that Supreme Court Justices should have term limits and not be able to endlessly serve until they either die or choose to retire.Carson is drifting away from the lockstep argument coming from Republicans that Obama should hold off and let the next president nominate. He clearly knows that the president is within his right as Commander-in-Chief to make the choice and pick someone new to put before Congress. He also is seemingly admitting that the Democrats have been right this whole time in their explanation of why the president should be nominating someone new to replace Scalia. He undoubtedly sees the double standard they are throwing Obama s way. That double standard being: it s okay for Republicans to nominate in an election year (like Reagan did), but not Democrats.Truth be told, Republicans are panicking. They know they just lost their most conservative voice on the Supreme Court and his replacement has been left in the hands of the very progressive President Obama. The irony is palpable.You can listen to Carson here:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247271609  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image: Flickr",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Staffer Goes Full-Sharia Law: ‘Separation Of Church And State Is A Myth’ (VIDEO),"In the frenzy over Donald Trump s meteoric rise in the polls, many voters seem to have forgotten that his closest competitor, Sen. Ted Cruz, is equally nutty, just as much of a liar, and possibly even more dangerous.In South Carolina, Cruz s entire campaign rests on appealing to the state s deeply religious conservative population. Unfortunately, he s still losing to Trump by a wide margin   even among evangelicals. As a last-ditch effort, Cruz appears to have tapped his  South Carolina Evangelical Chairman,  a conservative pastor named Mike Gonzalez, to promise Christian Republicans the one thing that Trump won t: An American theocracy.On MSNBC, Gonzalez told host Joy Reid that a Ted Cruz presidency would be based in Christianity. What about the Constitution which strictly prohibits that? Easy, explained Pastor Gonzalez, the separation of Church and State is a lie and Cruz sees that. Well, the reality of it is that this idea of the separation of church and state is a myth. I mean, you bring your faith into the marketplace like you do anything else. So Ted Cruz is a   will be a president not just, you know who is a preacher and pastor in the White House, That s not the idea. I believe all Americans can rally around Ted Cruz because he upholds the constitution. I believe all Americans want to truly uphold the law. Some of the laws Cruz doesn t believe should be upheld: Healthcare reform (he shutdown the government trying to stop it). Gay marriage (he tried to shut down the government trying to stop it). Abortion rights. Welfare programs. The right of a (Democratic) president to pick Supreme Court justices. The list goes on.Reid wasn t buying Gonzalez s crap. Immediately, she pushed back on the idea that the Constitution was cool with Ted Cruz establishing a theocracy. The separation of church and state is not a myth, it s a constitutional fact. It s a fact on the ground. It s a part of our constitutional makeup. The founding fathers were explicit that they did not want to have a national church. Can a candidate like Ted Cruz run on essentially saying he would ignore that part of the constitution, if you re saying he s a president who would actually run on the constitution? As Mediaite s Tommy Christopher pointed out, Cruz has been pretty explicit about the idea that he would run the White House as if it were his personal church. I m a Christian first, I m an American second, I m a conservative third, and I m a Republican fourth, and that s part of the problem, is that there are too many people who don t have that ordering correct. It s becoming clear that the voters supporting Cruz are hoping to fulfill their wish of reversing many of the secular and progressive laws that have been passed in the last few decades (particularly under Obama). As we ve seen with the battle over gay marriage, the issue is never about the rights of other people, but imposing conservative Christian beliefs on everyone in America. For that, Cruz is their man.Watch the scary exchange below.Featured image from MSNBC",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Idaho Republicans Push Bill To Let Teachers Use Bible In Science Class,"Students in Idaho are one vote away from having the Bible shoved down their throats in every subject in school.The Republican-dominated Senate education committee voted to advance Senate Bill 1321, which would permit the use of the Bible by teachers in classrooms across the state for a wide variety of subjects.According to the bill,The Bible is expressly permitted to be used in Idaho public schools for reference purposes to further the study of literature, comparative religion, English and foreign languages, United States and world history, comparative government, law, philosophy, ethics, astronomy, biology, geology, world geography, archaeology, music, sociology, and other topics of study where an understanding of the Bible may be useful or relevant. No student will be required to use any religious texts for reference purposes if the student or parents of the student object.Bill sponsor state Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll said her bill is to protect teachers because they are  scared to use the Bible  in their classrooms.And they should be scared to do so. The Bible has no place in most of the subjects mentioned and would not provide any useful information that would enhance the facts being taught, especially in science classes.The Bible s role in world history is indisputable but reading from the Bible is totally unnecessary to make that point.Clearly, this is an effort by conservative  Christians  to sneak Bible reading into schools to indoctrinate students. And it s unlikely that many students will feel free to object since teachers and other students can be bullies when it comes to religious fervor. There s also the question of whether school officials would actually properly inform students of their rights or whether school officials would actually inform parents that the Bible is being used in their child s classes.Make no mistake, this bill would allow conservative  Christian  teachers to force creationism upon their students in science class as a viable alternative to evolution. It would also allow teachers to tell students that God causes natural disasters to punish us while using the Bible as proof, not to mention the way the Bible could be used in history classes to teach that America was founded as a Christian nation even though the facts say otherwise.The bottom line is that the only institution the Bible belongs in is the church, but clearly, conservatives are so desperate to keep their dying religious beliefs alive that they are willing to blatantly violate separation of church and state to do it, even if it means making Idaho kids the worst educated in America.Featured Image: Berkeley",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Kasich Will Create A Government Agency To Promote Christianity (VIDEO),"Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is promoting his idea to create a new government agency that would promote Christianity around the world.Kasich touted the idea recently during an interview on NBC News.According to Kasich, the agency s job would be to  revive what we used to do when we beamed messages into the former Soviet Union. Kasich went on to say that his new agency would  Beam messages around the world about what it means to have a western ethic, to be part of a Judeo-Christian society. Kasich has managed to remain under the radar thus far in the presidential primaries, thanks to his undeserved reputation as a  moderate republican. The idea that the Ohio governor is somehow less insane than other GOP candidates competing for the party s nomination is simply absurd.Kasich is clearly just as dangerous and extreme as his republican rivals, maybe more so, given his ability to pass himself off as a  middle-of-the-road candidate. In case you have any doubts, listen to Kasich explain his idea for a government-sponsored propaganda agency, which would promote Christianity not only around the world but right here in the United States, as well.Here s video of the interview, via NBC News.Kasich likes to hype himself as a  small government  republican.Yet during this interview, Kasich made it clear that he is dead-serious about creating an agency that would not just expand government, it would authorize government to become the official, worldwide distributor of Christian propaganda.In order to keep government from ever getting involved in the distribution of religious propaganda, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution strictly forbids government from passing any law establishing, prohibiting or promoting any religion.Kasich s idea for creating a government agency that would distribute Christian propaganda, at the expense of taxpayers, is exactly the kind of thing the First Amendment was designed to keep the government from doing.While on the surface, there may seem to be a difference between one republican candidate and the next, don t believe it.Every one of these right wing nuts is intent on turning the U.S. government into the distribution and enforcement arm of the Christian church.John Kasich is no less extreme than Ted Cruz, a Christian Dominionist who wants to seize every aspect of society, from government to education to the media, in order to further his own religious beliefs.And Kasich and Cruz are no more extreme than Marco Rubio, who declared in a recent campaign ad that  our goal is eternity, before going on to quote a bunch of random Bible verses, which he s obviously sure will help get him elected.While all of the 2016 republican candidates may be well-suited to open their own mega-churches or launch a right wing radio program, not a single one of them is fit to become the next president of the United States.Featured image from video screen capture via NBC News",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Supporters Attack Latina Protester, Get Invited On Stage By Trump (VIDEO)","Another person was attacked at a Trump rally in what has become a theme at Trump events since the billionaire businessman threw in his hat for the Republican nomination for the presidency.This time, a young Latina woman had a poster denouncing Trump s stance on immigration ripped out of her hand by two men. The men were praised by Trump for their  courage.  In fact, Trump was so elated that he gleefully recounted the entire attack.   I saw fists start to fly,  Trump said, calling her a  rough cookie.  He then gave praise to the attackers, saying.  I love people with courage. But, it gets crazier than that. After the protester is escorted out of the building (she flipped Trump off with two her two middle fingers), Trump invited the attackers on stage to make speeches. After some cuddling and hugging between Trump and his two heroes, one man took the mic and said: Do not let them intimidate you. They will say anything, they will do anything to keep in power. We don t need who is in there now. We need to get some fresh bunch up there, some fresh blood. As the crowd roared and cheered, the second man, an Iraq war veteran, said: If it wasn t for Mr. Trump right here, I don t think any of us would have the voice that we have. This is the only man who is really going to bring America back. This is not the first time that Trump has praised attacks on protesters. When a protester from Black Lives Matter was roughed up at a Trump rally, Trump defended the actions of his supporters: Maybe he should have been roughed up. It was disgusting what he was doing. In August, when two men inspired by Trump s racism beat and urinated on a Latino man, Trump put a different spin on things: They love this country and they want this country to be great again.

 Bette Midler’s Brilliant Tweet Perfectly Exposes The Sad Irony Of Jeb Bush’s Gun (TWEET),"Let s just say, hypothetically, that Donald Trump is right about something. Let s say that Jeb Bush is a low energy dweeb who nobody seems to want to get behind. Let s assume that Jeb Bush will, in fact, do or say anything to bring his campaign into double digits, with the exception of refraining from that goofy head tilt and nod thing he s got going on.If that were true, Jeb Bush would probably go the route of route of Ted Cruz, whose ripped off  machine gun bacon  stunt gave him a boost with hill folk and other rednecks who just love guns and bacon. If Jeb Bush were to do it, it wouldn t be wearing full camo so the bacon can t see the dangerous predator ready to kill it. At least the noble already-dead beast will not go to waste.Jeb Bush would post a picture of his beloved gun with the caption  America,  because Jeb Bush is a desperate fool at this point who would claim to be getting regular visits from Jesus Christ in a Volkswagen bus if it were trendy:America. pic.twitter.com/TeduJkwQF3  Jeb Bush (@JebBush) February 16, 2016How sad is that?

" ‘Safe’ Nuclear Power Plant Continues To Leak Radioactive Waste, Corporate Greed To Blame","The Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York is under investigation, again, because of yet another leak of tritium, a dangerous waste byproduct:The amount of radioactive tritium leaking from the Indian Point nuclear power plant is growing, officials said Wednesday, prompting Gov. Cuomo to launch a multiagency probe into operations at the troubled plant.New samples from groundwater monitoring wells show 80% higher concentrations of tritium compared with when the leak was first reported Saturday.Cuomo had already ordered the state health and environmental conservation commissioners to investigate the incident. But on Wednesday, he ordered a more sweeping investigation that also includes the Department of Public Service.The private company that runs the plant, unsurprisingly, said that there s no threat to the public but that s what nuclear power plant operators always say even after rates of cancer and birth deformities go up in nearby towns.Entergy spokesman Jerry Nappi said the contaminated water was not going into the nearby Hudson River or sources of drinking water. Some organizations who are longtime opponents of nuclear power will take opportunities to try and frighten the public,  said Nappi.  The fact is this issue did not and cannot impact human health or any aquatic life in the river. Frighten the public indeed. And I m not even going to bring up the ongoing disaster in Fukushima.Advocates for nuclear power say that it is a safe technology and certainly not as dangerous as fossil fuels. But putting aside the massive problem of storing nuclear waste (a problem we have not even come remotely close to solving, by the way), the single greatest danger of nuclear power is what we are seeing at Indian Point: human error and corporate greed.As the energy companies that run these power plants look to squeeze more money out of their facilities, they cut corners. Those cut corners inevitably result in  accidents  that end up irradiating the surrounding environment. Then the power companies throw up their hands and claim it couldn t have been avoided, spend millions to crush lawsuits and give their CEOs giant bonuses for a job well done.This is a similar pattern to what we ve seen at coal mines that suffer avoidable explosions and cave-ins as well as at oil companies that continue to use  bomb trains with little to no regard for the towns they threaten to vaporize. The money lost to these  accidents  is less than the money made by cutting corners so there is every incentive to place the public s health at risk. It s not like the executives live or work near the areas impacted by their greed, after all, so who cares if a few hundred kids get thyroid cancer from a little extra something in their drinking water?Sure, nuclear power CAN be safe when done properly. But as long as  Privatize the gains, socialize the risk  remains the status quo with no possibility of prison time for greedy executives, nuclear power will remain an existential threat to everyone living anywhere near  safe  power plants like Indian Point.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bundy Terrorists Dug Feces-Filled Trench On Sacred Land, Left All Kinds Of Stuff Behind","Now that the Bundy terrorists have been arrested, federal investigators have begun the painstaking task of collecting evidence of crimes committed during the 41 day-long occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.According to Oregonlive, federal officials have discovered numerous explosives, firearms and a large trench, filled with human feces.During the standoff, members of the terrorist group recorded a video of themselves riffling through boxes of Native American artifacts. As you likely remember, the terrorists claimed that the federal government was  disrespecting Native American culture and heritage,  by storing boxes of artifacts in the basement of one of the buildings on the refuge.While the video made by the militants was meant to convince the public that the group cared about the history and culture of the Paiute people, according to federal officials, the terrorists excavated a road  on or adjacent to grounds containing sensitive artifacts. They also dug a trench in the same area, and then shit in it.According to Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan Knight and Geoffrey Barrow, the FBI Evidence Response Team has found a  significant amount  of human feces located on or near these sacred grounds.In a memo released on Tuesday, officials said the FBI crime unit continues to gather evidence of additional crimes committed by the terrorists on  a particularly sensitive cultural site,  where the group also chose to set up their outdoor camp.Federal investigators released the information in response to requests by defense attorneys, who are representing the Bundy terrorists, asking the government to  preserve evidence in the case. Oregonlive also reports that,The government further will make all evidence seized in the investigation available for inspection at the FBI field office in Portland, prosecutors said.Would that include evidence from the trench of human feces the militants left behind?A better idea might be to box it all up and send it directly to the terrorists in their jail cells, in lieu of snacks.Image credit from DonkeyHotey via Flckr",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 History Professor Shuts Down Ted Cruz’s Lies About Supreme Court History With Facts,"Ted Cruz is having a rough week, and now he just received a failing grade from a history professor.Ever since Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia passed away on Saturday, Cruz has peddled the same lie over and over that  it has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don t do this in an election year. It s an obvious attempt by Cruz and Republicans to keep President Obama from nominating a qualified individual that Senate Republicans would have to consider in confirmation hearings.As a former clerk for the Supreme Court, you would think that Ted Cruz would know the history of the high court, but he clearly doesn t make the grade.And history professor Mark Byrnes at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina agrees.In an article written for History News Network, Byrnes mercilessly fact-checked Cruz  claim suggesting that it s an American tradition that the Senate does not confirm judicial nominees during an election year.Since Ted Cruz is always singing the praises of the Founding Fathers, Byrnes began by revealing that John Adams and George Washington both nominated Supreme Court Justices during their final months in office.According to Byrnes,In the final year of his presidency, George Washington had two nominations to the Supreme Court approved by the Senate. It was an election year and he was not running for reelection. It doesn t get more  original intent  than that.Adams  case is even more relevant because he nominated John Marshall for Chief Justice in January 1801 after being defeated in the 1800 Election by Thomas Jefferson mere months before leaving office. Adams was a lame duck in the truest sense of the term he was serving out the remainder of his term after being repudiated by the voters. Yet he did not hesitate to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, and Marshall was confirmed by a lame duck Senate,  Byrnes wrote.Adams could easily have left the Supreme Court vacancy for Jefferson who had already been elected, after all, and would take office in a matter of weeks and didn t. That seems as clear as it could be. The founders saw no impediment to a president in the final year or even in the final weeks of the presidency successfully appointing new justices to the Supreme Court.Byrnes then tacked Cruz s claim about the last 80 years, and of course, Cruz fails history again as Byrnes absolutely laid waste the alternative history in the Texas Senator s head.The facts are pretty simple. In the last 80 years there has only been one instance in which a president was in a position to nominate a justice in an election year and did not have the nominee confirmed. In 1968, LBJ s nomination of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice to succeed Earl Warren (and of Homer Thornberry to take the seat held by Fortas) was blocked in the Senate, but not because of some alleged  tradition.  Certainly there were Senators who wanted the next president to name a new justice. But the opposition to Fortas had everything to do with the specific nominee and specific objections to him (particularly charges of cronyism and inappropriate financial dealings). To the best of my knowledge, no one cited Cruz s  tradition  to say it was not appropriate for Johnson to nominate someone, or that it would have been inappropriate to confirm anyone.A second instance took place 28 years earlier. In 1940, FDR nominated Frank Murphy in January of that election year and he was confirmed that same month. There was no  tradition  blocking that election-year appointment. (This also shows that Cruz got the math wrong this happened 76 years ago, not 80.)So, there were two instances similar to the current situation in the last 80 years. In one case the nomination was rejected and in the other it wasn t. To Ted Cruz, this constitutes  a long tradition that you don t do this. In conclusion, Byrnes blasted Republicans for being cowards by hiding behind this  phony tradition,  and rightfully so. President Obama is still the commander-in-chief no matter how much Republicans pretend that he isn t. And they have a constitutional duty to give any Obama nominee an up or down vote. Because anything less would betray everything the Founding Fathers stood for.

" I Let A Pit Bull Near My Baby, And This Is What Happened (IMAGES)","This is a two-year-old American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT). Her name is Akamara.This is a human baby. His name is Siegmund.Siegmund first met Akamara the day after he was born. We NEVER leave Siegmund alone with Akamara   after all, she s dangerous to him. She might quite literally snuggle him to death! Here s what happens:She gets pretty sad about it, but she s only allowed to put her head near him, and only with eyes on her at all times. He s just too small and she s too insistently snuggly.She really wants to lay on that pillow.Nothing to see here, just a ferocious pit bull trying to cuddle with a two-day-old baby.He s almost two weeks old now, and she s getting pretty impatient about it. Why isn t he petting her? Why will he not play tug?Akamara really can t help but cuddle the baby. It s her instinct! Little known to most people, but American Pit Bull Terriers   one of several breeds commonly referred to under the broad title  pit bulls    are nanny dogs. As the United Kennel Club (UKC), which recognizes and classifies APBTs as a breed, states in their breed standard:  APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. They make bad guard dogs, by the way   they re too friendly. Friendlier than you d believe. The American Temperament Test Society rates them higher than many common family breeds, such as golden retrievers!

Pit bulls are favored for a number of reasons, but that s not their fault, and it certainly isn t due to their temperament. It s because they bite hard, and when you factor in their size, they bite extremely hard.You can take a territorial, defensive dog   a normal personality type across most breeds, which requires socialization and training as a pup to deter aggression   and turn them into a fighter. It s criminal, but possible. And those dogs, if rescued, may suffer from PTSD or other mental trauma that increases the chances of an attack, especially if rescued by an inexperienced or unprepared owner. But it s not the breed. It s the choice by dog fighters to use the breed. Even if you restrict the breed, they ll find another.If it came down to it, dogfighters would probably pit chihuahuas against each other. It s the sport and the blood. It s the breeders and fighters, not the dogs. We don t put city-wide bans on cars that can go over 50 mph because a few people are souping them up and racing them. We arrest the racers and take their misused cars away.Akamara is a rescue, but a victim of only neglect. I got her at six months old with mange, no inoculations, and a desperate need for attention. Her immune system was extremely deficient due to mange and allergies, and she s struggled with secondary ear infections her entire young life. I would not advise rescuing an adult dog with unknown history in a house with children.Just remember, this isn t what most pit bulls look like:This is:",News,"February 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Is Too Far Left To Get Anything Done? This ONE FACT Puts That Lie To Bed,"There s a myth running afoul within Democratic and Republican circles (but mostly among Democrats) that Bernie Sanders is  too progressive  to actually get anything accomplished in Washington if elected president. To drive this point home, some on the campaign trail are pointing to his record of accomplishments on Capital Hill, noting that he has only had three (yes   3) bills passed into law that he s sponsored over 25 years in Congress. Doesn t sound like that great of a record, does it? Yet   what they fail to mention is that his record of successes is almost IDENTICAL to Hillary Clinton s. In fact, Sanders has a higher success rate.We back this up with proven numbers. Go to Congress.gov. You can look up every single bill that present (and past) members of Congress have ever sponsored/co-sponsored during their entire time as elected representatives of the people.Bernie Sanders sponsored 780 bills. He also co-sponsored 5,430 bills. Out of his sponsored bills, only three became law, meaning his success rate = .38 percent. Once you factor in his sponsored bills with his co-sponsored bills, his success rate isn t all that much improved. Out of 6,210 bills, only 206 became law.That brings his total success rate to 3.3 percent.Hillary sponsored 703 laws and guess what, only 3 became law (the same as Bernie). That gives her a success rate of .42 percent. That s barely above Sanders. But   take a look at what happens when you factor in her co-sponsored bills. Out of the 3,379 bills she supported, only 77 became law.That gives her a total success rate of 2.2 percent.That s below Sanders, but, we ll just go ahead and say they re nearly identical.So, as we were saying, there s a myth going around that Sanders can t get anything done because he s too far left, but as you can see, his record of accomplishments in Congress isn t that far off from Hillary s (at least according to the official Congressional record). If this isn t absolute proof, then we don t know what is.The truth is, it s not that far-left progressives can t get anything done in Washington, it s that Congress is set up in a way that makes it virtually impossible for anyone to get anything passed. That s the way it s supposed to be (by design). That s why Bernie has continuously said on the campaign trail that it s absolutely imperative that people become more involved (and vote), otherwise, they won t see the change they re hoping for, no matter if he (or anyone else for that matter) is elected president. This nonsense about him being  too progressive to get anything passed  needs to stop, no matter who you support for the nomination.Featured image via Bernie Sanders",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 PRESIDENTIAL? Trump Used Influence To Vouch For Repeat Felon Because They Were Friends,"When Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign, he infamously blamed Mexican immigrants for bringing crime to America. Specifically, he accused them of being rapists and for trafficking drugs to the United States. He also has blamed the epidemic of heroin addiction on the southern border, as part of his campaign to blame many of society s ills on minorities (including blacks and Muslims).But unlike the vast majority of Latino immigrants who work hard and follow the law, Trump is on record vouching for the character of a convicted cocaine trafficker. The Smoking Gun obtained the documents showing Trump engaged in the questionable defense of a shady character.In advance of Joseph Weichselbaum s November 1987 sentencing by a U.S. District Court judge, Trump wrote that the drug trafficker was  conscientious, forthright, diligent and a credit to the community. At the time Trump wrote his character reference letter, Weichselbaum, then in his mid-40s, was already a twice-convicted felon. In addition to his 1986 plea to federal cocaine distribution and income tax charges, Weichselbaum s rap sheet included prior convictions for grand theft auto and the embezzlement of more than $130,000 from a Brooklyn manufacturing firm where he worked for a decade.The site reports that the drug trafficker provided services to Trump at the time, shuttling high rolling casino clients on his helicopter to Trump s casinos in Atlantic City (before they went belly-up and bankrupt, of course). His firm also  maintained, stored, and provided pilots for Trump s personal $10 million Super Puma helicopter. Weichselbaum isn t even the only lawbreaking helicopter owner who rubbed shoulders with the current Republican presidential front runner. The Smoking Gun notes another Trump pal:John Staluppi, a Colombo crime family member, was an owner of Dillinger Charter Services, which flew gamblers into Atlantic City on behalf of Trump and other casino licensees.Like other unseemly news, the diehard Trump fans who have handed him the current edge in GOP delegates are unlikely to be concerned about their idol s indiscretions. But stories like this are sure to be fodder for Democrats and their allies in the fall, as they don t fear a tongue-lashing from Trump like Bush, Cruz, and their acolytes seem to fear.Featured image via Flickr/The Smoking Gun",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama BURNED Trump With The Truth About His Campaign And Chance Of Winning (VIDEO),"President Obama was asked during a press conference what his thoughts were on the likelihood of a Donald Trump presidency. Pulling no punches, he laid out exactly why Donald Trump will never be president: I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president, and the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people, and I think they recognize that being president is a serious job. It s not hosting a talk show or a reality show, it s not promotion, it s not marketing, it s hard. And a lot of people count on us getting it right, and it s not a matter of pandering and doing whatever gets you in the news on a given day. Source: The HillWhile President Obama maintained his normally cool demeanor and smooth delivery, he still managed to deliver what can only be described as a hell of a sick burn to Trump and the people that support his carnival barker shenanigans. Trump has no qualifications for being president, and Obama knows it. Most of the American people know it. His only supporters are about a third of the Republican fringe who run on pure emotion and are otherwise clueless about civics, and how government works.President Obama didn t restrict his criticism only to Trump. He also took the opportunity to dig hard at Marco Rubio with a blistering comment about his flip flopping in order to pander to the  Trump  effect: The other countries around the world, they kind of count on the United States being on the side of science and reason and common sense. There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change, that thinks it s serious. Well that s a problem.

 Obama FINALLY Eliminates Funding For Abstinence-Only Sex Ed,"President Obama s new budget will eliminate all government funding for abstinence-only sex education.For too long the federal government has been using tax dollars to support abstinence-only sex education programs, in spite of the fact that an overwhelming amount of evidence shows that such programs do not work.The federal government first began funding these programs in 1981, under then-president Ronald Reagan. According to the Sexuality Information and Education Center of America (SIECUS), between 1996 until 2006 funding for these programs  grew exponentially. All told, over the past 25 years, Congress has spent more than $1.5 billion on failed abstinence-only programs.In spite of the shocking amount of money invested in these program, the evidence tells us that they do nothing to reduce the rate of teen pregnancy and abortion, nor do they help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted disease. In fact, the opposite is true.For example,An independent study commissioned by the Minnesota Department of Health found that sexual activity doubled among junior high school participants in the state s Education Now and Babies Later (ENABL) program at three schools between 2001 and 2002. The number of participants who said they would  probably  have sex during high school almost doubled as well.As Addicting Info reported here the rate of teen pregnancy in states that require comprehensive-sex education has been declining steadily for the past several years.At the same time, the rate of teen pregnancy in conservative states, where abstinence-only sex education is allowed and even mandated, remains embarrassingly high.As we also reported here, as of 2014, the state with the highest number of teen pregnancies was New Mexico, followed by Mississippi, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. All of these states have shamelessly backwards laws regarding sex education, which mandate sex-education programs stress abstinence and  the importance of sex only during marriage. The liberal states of New Hampshire, Vermont, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Maine had the lowest numbers of teen pregnancies in the nation during the same year.President Obama s decision to eliminate federal funding for programs that have been proven ineffective when it comes to reducing teen pregnancy, abortion and STD s will not only save Americans the $10 million upfront cost of these programs.Teen pregnancy costs the U.S. approximately $9.4 billion.Eliminating federal funding for abstinence-only sex education programs will encourage schools to choose curriculum that is science-based and fact-based.As more schools move toward putting this type of curriculum in place, rather than relying on the fantasy-based abstinence-only model that conservatives endorse, the rate of teen pregnancy and teen abortion will finally begin to decline in red states, along with the number of teens who are exposed to sexually transmitted disease.In the long run, the decision to eliminate funding for failed abstinence-only programs will save teen lives, all while saving taxpayers billions of dollars.Image from Wikipedia",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" After Jeb Tweets Pic Of His New Gun, His Pandering Earns Him Deplorable New Follower (IMAGE)","Desperate times call for desperate measures, or something like that, and that s exactly what floundering Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has resorted to.In what could be considered the lamest attempt ever to pander to the right wing, who loves their guns more than, well, pretty much anything, Jeb Bush decided he would tweet out a pic of his brand new fancy gun with his name engraved on it with the caption,  America.  Honestly, if you haven t vomited by now, prepare yourself, because in a moment, you just may.America. pic.twitter.com/TeduJkwQF3  Jeb Bush (@JebBush) February 16, 2016It wasn t long after Jeb tweeted this image that he likely got exactly what he was aiming for (pun intended). He received a follow from the National Rifle Association on Twitter. Apparently, they weren t following him already, and Jeb knew that if he had any hope of doing well in the South, he d have to up his gun-toting game. And it worked.Check out the interaction that was captured via Tweetdeck:Tweetdeck via TheTrace.orgSweet that we can watch that romance bloom in real-time, huh?As it turns out, it was revealed last fall that Bush, while having an A+ rating with the NRA, didn t actually own a firearm. However, all that has changed now with the tweet of the candidate s manhood new gun. And of course, he had it engraved. Although, I wouldn t put it past his mom to have put his name on it for him, as she likely did on his underwear when he went away to camp as a teenager.Apparently, this sort of pandering knows no boundaries, and it has paid off for the former governor of Florida with his new deplorable follower who prefers endless amounts of gun sales with no restrictions over common sense reform and saving lives. You know, we all have our priorities, the NRA s just happens to be profit motivated, and now Jeb has fallen in lockstep behind them.

 This Is Why Obama Is Already Winning The War To Replace Scalia,"The kneejerk response of Republicans to the death of Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia was a blanket statement refusing even a basic hearing for a replacement candidate submitted by President Obama, despite his Constitutional duty to do so.Now, only a few days later there are signs that the right s solidarity is turning to Jell-O before the eyes of the world.A series of statements from senior Republicans contradicted their own previously expressed views and seemed to question whether rank-and-file Republicans were completely on board with the plan from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to do nothing on a Supreme Court nominee this year and let the next president make the nomination.Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) told Iowa radio reporters that he had not determined whether to have hearings before the Judiciary Committee, which he chairs.  I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decision,  Grassley, the committee chairman, said.To add insult to injury, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), told a conservative radio host that  we fall into the trap if we just simply say  Sight unseen,  we fall into the trap of being obstructionist. President Obama amped up the pressure in his press conference on Tuesday, noting that he would be proceeding with a nominee and that the Senate had ample time to consider his submission and give him or her a fair up or down vote in front of the full Senate.As the conservative ranks get worn down, the left has expressed solidarity despite the testy primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Both candidates have made public remarks indicating that it is President Obama s right to make a nomination, and for that candidate to get a vote.Conservatives who insist on continued obstruction of a vacant Supreme Court seat will have to prepare themselves for at least nine months of public pressure asking why they refuse to fully staff America s highest court   or as seems to already be happening, giving in bit by bit.Featured image via Flickr",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The Oregonian Calls Out Racist Commenters, Racist Commenters Explode (IMAGES)","Racism is pretty prevalent on the interwebs. Generally, if an article even mentions something to do with Black culture, the racists are out in force. This happened so frequently on articles regarding hip-hop and the like on the Oregonian, which is, by the way, the west coast s largest paper, that one of their writers decided to address the problem of racism in their comments sections.The piece, entitled  Dear Readers: Stop Being Racist About Hip Hop, rips the racists in the comments sections to shreds. The writer of the article, David Greenwald, first talks about how he is no longer shocked at the racism he encounters, even on the supposedly liberal west coast, then goes on to treat his readers to a sampling of the racism in his comments sections, and even in his email inbox:I got an email over the weekend about our recent Kanye West stories. No subject. It didn t need one.  This is news?  the reader wrote.  About some n  rapping?  Every time the Oregonian covers hip-hop music, a rich and beautiful American art form invented to share the pain and joys and narratives of inner-city black lives over 30 years ago, readers comment with hatred. Here, from Monday night alone, enjoy a few choice notes about Kendrick Lamar, the most important musician currently working in American music and new winner of five glimmering Grammy awards: Best  rap album? That, my friends, is a world class oxymoron,  Yardbird tells us. Not since Kanye West, has an individual with so little talent, been so worshiped and idolized by so many. Even a superstar like Adelle has been sucked into this clown s,  Music,'  DonRon adds. Adele is spelled with one  L : she is also a blues singer who owes everything to the African-American creativity that birthed hip-hop.And that s just for starters. Greenwald then goes on to try to educate the ignoramuses that make up so much of his readership on the beauty and riches that hip-hop culture has given America. However, at the end of the day, he says he understands that he cannot school people determined to be so ignorant. He ends the piece by saying: If you dismiss hip-hop culture, if you paint it all with the same ignorant brush, if you say  hip-hop masterpiece  is an oxymoron, if Beyonc  and Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West are just too black: you are a racist and you are wrong, and this will be the last time I write for you. And good for him. Unsurprisingly, the very racists who need to take what Mr. Greenwald is saying into account completely missed the point of the article, and responded with   gasp!   more racism. First, there were the ones whose response was to disparage the writer and the work of the hip hop artists, all the while using racist language:Then, of course, there was that one person who just had to pop out and declare themselves an expert on all things black because he once knew a black person:And of course, those are just what is there as of this writing, with the article being quite new. I am sure the ugly and ignorance will continue. Unfortunately, though, at the end of the day, the very people who needed to hear David Greenwald s message have turned a deaf ear, and will remain as ignorant as they were prior to reading his brilliant piece.Featured image from video screen capture from The Oregonian",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Zombie Reagan BLASTS Modern GOP For Obstructing Nominee (VIDEO),"Republicans have been vowing to honor the memory of recently-deceased racist hatemonger, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, by blocking any and all nominees Obama might put forward to replace him, no matter who they are. While Scalia himself  would disagree with  the intrusion of politics into the judicial appointment process,  Ted Cruz promises to filibuster any nominee and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will use every tool at his disposal to block nominations until after the election, when they hope a Republican is in office (good luck with that, guys).While Republicans often invoke Ronald Reagan as they struggle to excuse most of their actions, they are similarly ignoring the former President s opinion on the matter. In 1988, Saint Ronnie made it clear while urging the Senate to confirm Anthony M. Kennedy that he doesn t quite agree with childishly blocking nominations, either:In the year ahead, we re not going to be on the defensive, shoring up problems and answering our critics. We are moving forward, and I have no doubt that when we look back 1988 will be a year of great accomplishment toward our goals. This is the year when Judge Anthony Kennedy will be confirmed and the Supreme Court will again be brought up to full strength. The Federal judiciary is too important to be made a political football. I would hope, and the American people should expect, not only for Judge Kennedy s confirmation but for the Senate to get to work and act on 27 other judicial nominations that have been left in limbo for quite awhile now.That s right   Republicans are so desperate to deny Obama a judicial nomination that they are willing to ignore tradition, the wishes of the person they are supposedly honoring in this destructive and asinine action, and even the words of their messiah.Watch the remarks from Saint Ronnie s January 25, 1985 State of the Union Address below:Watch Ronald Reagan urge the Senate to confirm Justice Kennedy during an election year.

 A Federal Reserve President Just Said Something That Will TERRIFY ‘Too Big To Fail’ Banks (VIDEO),"The era of  too big to fail  might actually be coming to an end. Not because of legislators railing against it constantly, or because of economic experts educating us as to why it s a bad idea. We ve been having this for years now, and the problem has only grown worse.Now there is actually some muscle in the fight, and it s going to scare the hell out of the big banks that have enjoyed having their greed go unchallenged for decades. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President, Neel Kashkari, has come out against the idea of  too big to fail  being allowed to continue and grow worse.A movement from within the Federal Reserve to break up big banks could actually work, due to how closely the Fed is intertwined with them. It isn t like the same old game of Democrats railing against the system, and Republicans doing everything they can to protect the banks  ability to abuse it. Kashkari made a strong comparison of reigning in the big banks to managing a nuclear reactor: The cost to society of letting a reactor melt down is astronomical. Given that cost, governments will do whatever they can to stabilize the reactor before they lose control. Source: BloombergKashkari said that the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank will be collecting public and financial industry input, then formulating proposals to address the problems with our current banking system. All options are on the table from breaking up the big banks into  less connected, less important entities,  forcing banks to hold large amounts of capital instead of gambling it on wall street   which would make them virtually incapable of failing, and using tax methods to discourage banks from taking huge risks with regular people s money.It s worth noting that Kashkari is no left-wing democratic socialist. He is a Republican who was the senior advisor to George W. Bush s treasury secretary and managed the $700 billion TARP bank bailout. Even he knows that the status-quo is unsustainable, and if a problem happens again it will be even worse.With Republicans busy being apologists for American banking cartels, and doing everything they can to make it legal for them to steal the nation away from its people, the response from Kashkari is exactly what we need. Banks can t buy the Federal Reserve for a few tens of thousands in campaign donations, which will make it difficult for Republicans to resist.Watch Kashkari s full comments below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Jimmy Kimmel Roasts Jeb Bush’s Campaign Ad Starring George W. Bush,"George W. Bush is back to put the nail in the coffin of his family name and his brother s presidential campaign, with a little help from Jimmy Kimmel.Earlier this month, former President George W. Bush narrated an ad on behalf of his brother Jeb Bush in an effort to put a third Bush in the White House.It certainly appears to be an act of desperation on Jeb Bush s part if he has to resort to asking his brother to campaign for him, especially since W s legacy poisoned the GOP over the last two presidential elections.And as Jeb and George campaign in South Carolina in an effort to pull off a miracle victory in a state where Jeb is currently polling at 10 percent, a full 28 points behind front-runner Donald Trump and 12 points behind Ted Cruz, this appears to be Jeb s last gasp on the campaign trail.And so, Jimmy Kimmel decided to  help  Jeb by releasing his own version of the ad reminding us just how dimwitted George W. Bush was during his eight years in office. America needs help,  a Bush sound-alike begins. Parents can t put food on their families and our children still isn t learning. I know Jeb. I know his good heart. It s inside his body next to other things, like his stomach, which is where his snacks go. I know that and I know that experience in judgement count in the Oval Office, which is the room where the president works at his desk. That s where my little brother would work if he were president. Don t bet on it but don t underestimate Jeb either. He s got a cute little wife and he s a good little guy. And he knows how to open doors for America.

" Zero F*cks Obama Puts Obstructionist GOP On Notice: You Claim To Love Constitution, Then Do Your Job","At a press conference on Tuesday, President Obama could barely hide his frustration towards the would be obstructionists in the Senate who say they will block any potential Supreme Court nominee he suggests for the remainder of his term.When asked by a reporter what he thought about the political move by Republicans to block the process until after the next election, Obama didn t hold back. At times Obama s normally calm rhetorical style gave way to more and more passion as his disbelief in how badly these senators were behaving became apparent. In the past, this has not been viewed as a question. There is no unwritten law that says it can only be done on off years. That s not in the constitutional text. I m amused to hear when people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution, suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there. Republicans have spent the days after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death arguing that Obama should not be allowed to use the next year of his presidency selecting a new nominee. Instead, they have feigned the belief that in the last year in office a president must sit on his hands until the election is over. As Obama points out, this has never been a thing. Notably, as recently as 1988, President Ronald Reagan appointed a new justice during an election year and nobody batted an eye.In a nice little dagger twist, President Obama then put the spotlight back on Republicans who vow to not do their jobs. Rather than allow partisan point scoring get in the way of yet another Democratic process, Obama suggested this could  be a good moment to rise above that  and show America that Congress isn t a complete-and-utter mess. This is the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land. It s the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics. This will be the opportunity for Senators to do their job.Your job doesn t stop until you are voted out or until your term expires. Obama also used the time to make it abundantly clear that he isn t about to be held hostage by the Republican obstructionists either. In one of the most crackling exchanges of the presser, a reporter asked the President if he would be nominating a moderate so that he might be able to appease Republicans and get them to do their jobs. He was not amused. No. No. Where did you get that idea? Obama reaffirmed that he would be selecting a candidate based on their merit and on the belief that they would be the best person for the job, not on whether or not he thought a group of conservative politicians would like the pick.As is typical in President Obama s second term, this was a take-no-prisoners moment. Having watched Republicans openly vow to stop him from accomplishing anything, even if it meant harming the country as collateral damage, his new strategy is not to even try to work with them. Instead, he has begun to call them out at every term. A name-and-shame scorched earth policy that is making it harder and harder for obstructionists to get a free pass to continue poisoning the political process.It s fun to watch.Featured image via NBC News",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Accidentally Applauds Obama’s Protection of Immigrants: ‘I Think It’s Great’ (VIDEO),"Republican front runner Donald Trump loves to tell Americans how great he is at just about anything   but one thing he ll never brag about is how good he is at making himself look like a complete idiot.Trump displayed this not-so-hidden talent perfectly on Monday, when he likely misinterpreted a reporter s question about children born of immigrants  that or the candidate has flip-flopped on one of his policies again. The question was asked during a South Carolina press conference, and the reporter opened by mentioning one of Trump s GOP rivals, fellow candidate Jeb Bush. The reporter began,  You have accused Jeb Bush of being weak on immigration Trump, possessing less manners than a toddler, interrupted the reporter and called Bush  Weak, period. The reporter continued, referring to Obama s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, which protects younger illegal immigrants from deployment: There are over 100,000 young people known as DREAMers who have deferred action given to them Trump cut the reporter off once again, telling the audience that Obama s executive action on the matter was  great    a surprising response considering how hateful the GOP candidate has been to immigrants.When the reporter asked Trump what DREAMers could expect under his presidency, Trump s response got even more bizarre   and it started to look like he didn t understand the reporter s question at all! Never one to admit a mistake, Trump boldly launched into a puzzling rant about  dreamers    although only he knows what he meant by that. He said: I want dreamers to come from this country. You mentioned dreamers; I want dreamers to come from the United States. I want the people in the United States that have children, I want them to have dreams also. You can watch the baffling footage below, via MSNBC.Although Trump does have quite a history of changing his views on policies, it s probably safe to say that he was just too stupid to understand what the reporter was really asking him. Considering all the racist, offensive things that Trump has said about illegal immigrants over the past several months, it s not likely that he had a change of heart   he s just dumb.

 This Republican Actually Supports Obama In Finding Scalia’s Replacement – Here’s Why (VIDEO),"It was only hours after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death was confirmed that Senate Republicans threatened to block any nominee that President Barack Obama might try to fill Scalia s seat with. Most notably, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz have spoken out against the president s obligation to nominate a replacement.But not every Republican is brainless, as one prominent GOPer verified on Monday in an interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo. Alberto Gonzales, the Attorney General under George W. Bush, is speaking out against McConnell and the GOP to throw his support behind Obama. In the interview, Gonzales said: I know there s a big debate going on right now about whether or not Obama should nominate someone. From my perspective having worked at the White House and the Department of Justice, there s just no question in my mind that as president of the United States, you have an obligation to fill a vacancy. Gonzales continued, giving Republicans a not-so-subtle hint to get the hell out of Obama s way and let him do what he was elected to do. I suspect President Obama is going to do his job. And after he does his job and nominating a hopefully qualified individual, the Senate will do its job eventually on its own calendar. The bottom line from my perspective, is the president has to do his job in nominating a qualified individual and then the Senate does it s job in assessing whether or not this person is qualified for a lifetime appointment on the court based upon experience, based upon ideology and based upon integrity. Clearly disappointed in the circus his party has become, Gonzales leveled the GOP and slammed the hypocrisy of his conservative colleagues in trying to prevent Obama from seeking a nominee. He said: If the shoe were on the other foot, and there was a Republican in the White House and democratically controlled Congress, I would expect the Republican president to make a nomination when ready. You can watch Gonzales in action below:One of the GOP s nominee-blocking tactics has been to claim that Obama can t fill a Supreme Court seat in an election year   which is completely false. SCOTUSblog specifically says that there is no tradition of leaving a Supreme Court seat vacant because of an election year: The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election. Whether the Senate Republicans like it or not, Obama is determined to choose a nominee next week.

 MSNBC Shocks Viewers By Announcing Prime Time ‘Town Hall’ Special To Promote Donald Trump,"It s come to this.On Tuesday, MSNBC announced that it would be organizing a live,  prime time  event exclusively starring Donald Trump and hosted by Trump s personal friends Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinksi. Needless to say, both political insiders and MSNBC s viewers are shaking their heads in disbelief.The decision to give Trump free promotional airtime on the network was announced by Morning Joe s Senior Producer Jesse Rodriguez.NEWS: Joe & Mika will moderate a town hall with Donald Trump airing in prime time tomorrow at 8pmET @MSNBC  Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) February 16, 2016The Republican front-runner will seemingly get the stage to himself. MSNBC has so far not announced a single other candidate would be appearing, nor did they suggest any were invited. He will be met with questions lobbed to him by Scarborough, who has used his influence to shill for Trump and may even be helping his campaign from behind the scenes. Recently, Trump thanked Scarborough, one of MSNBC s few conservative pundits, for  supporting  him when the rest of the media had attacked him.When not preparing to question Trump on a  prime time  spectacle, Scarborough spends his time online promoting Trump as a strong leader.Perceived strength in the face of perceived weakness from America's leaders. What do you think? https://t.co/JNwIhgrdN0  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 16, 2016""Donald Trump's strength is strength."" @JoeNBC on #morningjoe. Could it be that simple? Huge SC poll #s today. pic.twitter.com/vw9V6twRxT  Suzy Welch (@SuzyWelch) February 16, 2016This obvious bias has led many fans of MSNBC to wonder what on earth the network is thinking? It also has reporters, used to covering candidates with some semblance of objectivity, scratching their heads.CNN will have all six GOP candidates appear at town halls on Wed and Thurs. Meanwhile, MSNBC s Joe and Mika hosting one Wed with just Trump.  Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) February 16, 2016""this primary season""   not quite the same thing as free airtime for Trump & Kasich on eve of SC primary https://t.co/cb3IwkRb11  Alex Burns (@alexburnsNYT) February 16, 2016Just Trump? https://t.co/CYbcDwWbEn  Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) February 16, 2016As depressing and petty as it sounds, MSNBC may have chosen to promote Trump to spite their archenemy, CNN.MSNBC has spent the last few weeks desperately trying to defend Scarborough amid accusations that he is too cozy with Trump. Things came to a head when CNN reporter Dylan Byers outed Scarborough as having celebrated Trump s New Hampshire victory with the candidate in his hotel room. Notably, CNN plans to run a town hall event featuring two of Trump s biggest rivals, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, on Wednesday, so this may be an alliance between MSNBC and Trump to hurt CNN s ratings by hosting their very own special.Sadly, that means Trump will get carte blanche to spew his vile hate speech to a gushing Scarborough. It s unlikely that Trump would have agreed to appear on the left-leaning network if he thought there was any chance he was going to be pressed to answer difficult questions.For their part, MSNBC says they will balance Trump s  prime time event  with something they call  long form interviews  with other candidates. They point to one they will be airing with Kasich on the same night as Trump s town hall. But they haven t specified when they plan on airing other interviews candidates, nor if those interviews even exist.Cable networks aren t required to give equal time to each candidate (a situation Trump has routinely exploited), but holding a prime time glorified Donald Trump campaign ad is a very bad look for a network that is hoping to appear neutral. It also seems to skirt the line between a campaign donation. In a race where buying television ads can cost a campaign millions of dollars, how fair is it that MSNBC just handed over an hour or two of their most valuable ad space to Trump s campaign?There are already rumblings of a potential boycott, and MSNBC may just discover that there are limits to what its viewers will tolerate.Feature image via MSNBC",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Trump Turn Into Crazy Repeating Parrot As He Threatens To Sue Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"Saturday night s debate saw Donald Trump and Ted Cruz going at each other repeatedly. More specifically, it saw them calling one another liars. Now, Trump has gone on record saying that Cruz is the biggest liar he s ever known. In fact, Trump seems to believe that these alleged lies on the part of Ted Cruz is enough to bring a lawsuit against the Texas Senator. Watch Trump seem to lose his mind as he repeats the same line over and over like a crazy parrot: So we will bring a lawsuit if he doesn t straighten his act out. He s a lying guy, a really lying guy. Some people misrepresent. This guy s just a plain out liar. In fact, I felt better because Marco Rubio called him a liar the other night on stage. I felt so much better. I said good, politician calls a politician? Now I can actually call him a liar.  Well considering that Donald Trump has a pretty tenuous relationship with the truth himself, this isn t really saying a whole lot. That whole field of GOP clowns lies through their teeth for sport, so it s really just hypocrisy at its finest. But hey, at least it s great for entertainment.Watch the video below, as posted to Facebook by Fox News:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt; We will bring a lawsuit if he doesn t straighten his act out [Ted Cruz] is a lying guy.

" Texans Lose Their Damn Minds Over This Flag In Arabic, But Here’s What It Actually Said (IMAGES)","Security concerns were brought up after a black flag with a heart and Arabic writing was spotted on Citizens Tower under construction in Lubbock, Texas. And yes, while it should be of concern that individual(s) trespassed onto private property that was behind a fence, scaled a building, and hung the flag, the broader issue that panicked local officials needs to be brought up. They seemed to lose their damn minds.Here s a picture of the flag on the building:lubbockonline.comAnd if you zoom in:lubbockonline.comNow, with all that is going on in the world surrounding the horrific acts that ISIS is perpetrating, and seeing as their flag is also black with Arabic writing, you can see where maybe these people had a point in being upset. However, not really, because what it really does is prove their utter ignorance, because once the flag is translated it literally reads,  love is for all. Pretty threatening, right? However, it is Texas, so saying  love for all  in Arabic mixes their hatred and fear of Muslims with their hatred and fear of gay people, so really it was the perfect storm of panic for the Texas city.According to Lubbockonline.com: The flag, noticed on the building early Monday, prompted [Mayor Glen] Robertson to write a letter to City Manager James Loomis, requesting Lubbock police notify the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the Lubbock County Sheriff s Office. Oh, for goodness sake. Maybe their first move would ve been to figure out what it said and then go from there, but being the reactive instead of proactive society we are, local officials seemed to slip into full panic-mode straight away. However, Mayor Robertson did have the wherewithal to say: I am also requesting that we take whatever steps are necessary to secure the building and ensure that this does not happen again. I fully understand that we must gather more facts before we make a knee-jerk reaction but I am concerned on several levels. Please keep me informed as we learn more about this situation. Now, seeing that it was just Valentine s Day, and this flag was spotted early on the day after Valentine s Day, and the flag reads,  love is for all,  maybe, just maybe, it was someone spreading a Valentine s Day message of love. However, that could just be a wild guess. Albeit, this was probably not the best way to do it.Don t fret, though. The flag has been removed, along with the love behind it:lubbockonline.comIn all seriousness, whoever hung the flag broke the law and should be charged with criminal trespassing. However, the knee-jerk reaction to want to call Homeland Security because something was written in Arabic, but was really just someone wanting to spread a message of love, still seems a little over the top.

 Stephen Colbert’s Send Off For Antonin Scalia Is Refreshingly Touching (VIDEO),"Stephen Colbert left his Comedy Central  character behind to replace David Letterman on The Late Show, and he has been absolutely phenomenal at it. Therefore, it was inevitable, and only fitting, that he gave an amazing tribute to recently deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.However, unlike what would have likely been expected, Colbert did not mock Scalia. The man was universally despised by many decent human beings due his outrageous homophobia, misogyny, and other various bigotries, but, apparently, there was a good side to him that most of us never got to see. Colbert, instead of using Scalia s death as a point of comedy with which to insult his memory, chose to humanize the man most of us are glad to see go from both the Supreme Court and the planet.Colbert recalled his one meeting with Scalia at a White House Correspondents  Dinner, in which Scalia revealed that he had a dazzling sense of humor. The Late Show host also pointed out that Scalia had an amazing friendship with his fellow, and notoriously liberal, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.I ll never give Scalia or any other awful right-winger a pass on bigoted behavior. However, amidst all of the hatred we are rightfully slinging Scalia s way, and at the glee we feel now that he can no longer sully the Supreme Court with his disgusting ideas, Colbert s tribute was refreshingly touching.Watch the video below:Featured image from YouTube screen capture",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Tweets An All-Out Attack On The GOP’s Promise To Obstruct SCOTUS Nominations (TWEETS),"Hillary Clinton may be favored in the polls to take the Democratic nomination and she may be considered the most likely candidate to be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States and even SHE doesn t want to see the Republicans succeed in obstructing President Obama s constitutional duty to nominate the next associate justice of the Supreme Court.In fact, she got so tired so quickly of all the talk, she decided to tweet an all-out assault on Republican stupidity with an eleven-point argument about why they re idiots, beginning with the obvious:1 Until Jan. 20, 2017, it's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices it's right there in the Constitution. -H pic.twitter.com/AWV47TRaTw  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016There it is, highlighted and everything. The president gets to nominate people regardless of what Mitch McConnell says. Surely Hillary Clinton would love the honor of nominating the next justice herself given the opportunity, but she understands that there is too much at stake. Her epic tweetfest continues:3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016It s not as if the right cares one iota about the fate of immigrants, but the rest of us certainly do. The president s actions are the only positive thing to come out of government on immigration since the snoozefest of Republican control began.5 And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Should the rights of American voters and the decisions of American women be left to a 4-4 tie, these cases could very well revert down to the decisions of lower courts and in these cases, the conservative judges who have allowed such egregious violations of the constitution to move forward.6 These decisions could determine whether we as a nation uphold our principles of liberty and equality, or turn back the clock. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Well said. Turning back the clock has been the Republican agenda for years, so nothing new there, but the ability to stave off the stupidity with a ruling by the highest court in the land is essential.8 I have news for Republicans who would put politics over the Constitution: Refusing to do your duty isn t righteous, it's disgraceful. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016And the truth shall set you free. Republicans have been enjoying long vacations of obstruction for far too long. Even with control of congress, they accomplish nothing but witch-hunt hearings and idiotic legislation they know has no chance of being signed by the president.10 As for complaints that this is an election year: 1988 was an election year, too and Justice Kennedy was confirmed 97-0. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Some simple facts that Republicans will ignore. And finally, in closing:11 So, a message for Senate Republicans: Fill this vacancy. @POTUS will do his job. Do yours. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016On behalf of the sane people of America   Thank you, Secretary Clinton.Featured image from Twitter",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Host Tells Senate Republican To Do His Damn Job (VIDEO),"Republican Senator Orrin Hatch tried to justify not doing his job and Chris Cuomo was having none of it.During an appearance on CNN on Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee member Orrin Hatch attempted to defend the decision of Senate Republicans to refuse to hold confirmation hearings for anyone President Obama nominates to fill the vacant seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away on Saturday.Ever since news broke of Scalia s death, Republicans have made it clear that they won t allow President Obama to fill the empty position on the bench, opting instead to wait a year until whomever is elected president in November takes office, which they hope will be a Republican.But host Chris Cuomo told Hatch that he and his GOP colleagues should do their damn jobs as the Constitution requires, especially since the document conservatives claim they love so much says nothing about a president not being able to pick a judicial nominee during an election year. You don t get to not vote on judges just because it is an election year and final year of someone s presidency. So, that hypocrisy is as play as well,  Cuomo bluntly said.  You don t have to like whom he nominates, but shouldn t you go through the process? Of course, like a good little obstructionist Hatch continued to insist that Republicans don t have to do anything.  No, I don t think there is any real reason to do that,  he said. To which Cuomo asked,  What about the Constitution? Hatch responded by claiming that President Obama has been treated fairly by Senate Republicans, which we all know is a crock of shit considering the record amount of obstructing the GOP has done since President Obama first took office seven years ago. At the end of his response, Hatch revealed the only real reason why Republicans want to wait to replace Scalia. Look, this president s been treated fairly. 40 percent of the federal judiciary up and Republicans have allowed votes on all of those. Now what they are saying is look, we are in a tremendous presidential campaign, there is a lot of bitterness on both sides, let s diffuse this thing and let s put this until the next president of the United States. We ll wait and use discretion, and whoever is the next president will do the job. Now the Democrats of course naturally want this because they want to have a 5-4 majority on the court. Throughout the interview, Hatch claimed that Democrats muddied up the system by not confirming conservative extremist Robert Bork to the high court. However, Cuomo pointed out that Democrats at least held confirmation hearings as required by the Constitution and went through the process. It s just that at the end Bork wasn t confirmed, which is the Senate s right. The Senate does have the power to reject a nominee. So it appears Hatch and his fellow Republicans all have a case of sour grapes because Democrats did their job. As it turned out, Anthony Kennedy ended up being confirmed to the Supreme Court instead of Bork.The bottom line is that Senate Democrats went through the process even though they eventually rejected Bork. Fun fact: six Republicans voted against Bork as well.Cuomo then informed Hatch that a 4-4 court is not a good thing because many cases won t be settled due to constant ties, which would delay a real decision while cases pile up since unresolved cases have to be refiled and argued again. But Hatch thinks a 4-4 court is a good thing. A 4-4 court functions it s functioned in the past. It will function this time. Just on the really controversial issues they will probably put them off for a year. It is not the end of the world. As a matter of fact, it is a smart thing to do. And as he had done multiple times throughout the interview, Hatch brought up the presidential election and how it would somehow be unfair to hold hearings during this time. And when Cuomo mentioned that the Constitution doesn t say anything about not confirming judges during a election year, Hatch claimed the Constitution  gives you every right to defer this. And to make sure that it is done in the best of ways so that both sides have an opportunity to have their person in the presidency and then, you know, if the Democrats win we ll go through this process the way it ought to be gone through. Here s the video via YouTube.Again, Hatch makes a bullshit claim because we all know that if Republicans still control the Senate in 2017, they will continue to throw a temper tantrum and refuse to do their job if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is the president who makes a nomination. In other words, things will be no different than they are right now.Hatch and Senate Republicans are the reasons why our government can t get anything done for this country and now they are threatening to derail the judicial system and break all precedent just because they don t want the Supreme Court to shift away from the extreme conservative ideology that has controlled the Court for decades. This is totally outrageous and the American people need to punish Republicans for this failure to do their jobs. After all, if any normal American worker failed to do their job, they d be fired. So should Senate Republicans.

 WATCH: Rubio Uses Canadian City In ‘It’s Morning Again In America’ Ad,"The dramatic opening of Marco Rubio s new ad, which is titled  It s Morning Again In America,  features a city that isn t even in America. It s in Canada.It didn t take long for the Canadian-based Vancouver Sun to spot footage of the Vancouver skyline, which is clearly featured in the opening footage of Rubio s new ad.As the narrator proclaims  It s morning again in America,  we are treated to a scene that highlights some of Vancouver, Canada s most recognizable landmarks, which includes Harbour Centre, One Wall Centre and the Port Metro Vancouver cranes.The footage is not only of Canada, instead of the United States, but it also features a Canadian Seaspan tugboat. The tugboat appears to be flying the Canadian flag.Watch the video, which was uploaded to YouTube by Marco Rubio, February 14.Marco Rubio wants to be president of the United States, but he can t even find footage of the United States to use in his  It s Morning Again In America  campaign ad?As bad as it seems, it shouldn t really be a surprise.What else would you expect from a presidential candidate who has been dubbed  The Biggest Idiot Running for President? That s quite a distinction, considering the sheer number of idiots hoping to win the GOP nomination this year.Rubio became a household name in 2013, after delivering the GOP s annual response to the President s state of the Union address.While no-one remembers a word then-Senator Rubio said during the speech, the image of him guzzling water from a plastic bottle will never fade from our collective memory.Since then Rubio has won the hearts of republican voters, who appear to love him not just because he is rabidly anti-gay, but also because he repeatedly brags that he is  not a Scientist. With the release of his latest campaign ad, I think it is safe to assume that Marco Rubio is also not a geographer.Featured image from video screen capture, via Marco Rubio on youtube ",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Death Valley ‘Super Bloom’ Marks The Death Of Climate Change Denier Antonin Scalia (VIDEO),"Call it tasteless and inappropriate if you will, but the entire planet is breathing a sigh of relief now that Climate Change denier Antonin Scalia has shed his mortal coil. And what better way to celebrate the end of one of the most persistent obstructions to lowering carbon emissions than a  super bloom in Death Valley one of the hottest spots on the planet?On Monday, the park posted an Instagram video showing thousands of tall yellow flowers vibrating the breeze. We got you a valentine s day present  it s thousands of flowers,  the post read.A report on the website DesertUSA called the area south of Copper Canyon  especially jaw-dropping.  Photos showed fields of yellow against the stark mountains in the background.Millions of beautiful flowers are blooming in a place named after death itself. Message recieve, Gaia. (Credit: Death Valley NP)The conservative wing of the Supreme Court has long stood in the way of taking any kind of action to curb America s carbon footprint. Justice Scalia was the ringleader of the climate science denying circus with breathtakingly stupid comments like this one made in 2007: The issue was simply whether carbon was an environmental pollutant or not,  he said.  I did not think it was ever regarded as that. It is not the Atmospheric Protection Agency. It s the Environmental Protection Agency. That was the basis for my dissent. The atmosphere is not part of our environment? This was a sitting Supreme Court Justice and he knew less about the planet than your average 10 year old. Or rather, he probably knew how stupid he sounded but his pro-corporate agenda was more important than his dignity.To put this in context, if Scalia s kind of  thinking  had been acceptable in the 1980s, The United States would have blocked the Montreal Protocols, ignored the depletion of the Ozone Layer and pretended that the sudden massive increase of skin cancer was perfectly natural. After all, we can t legislate the atmosphere, right?Just to be clear on how intent Scalia was on blocking any kind of Climate Change legislation, he dropped this little gem of ignorance in 2006:James Milkey, assistant attorney general of Massachusetts, corrected Justice Antonin Scalia, saying:  Respectfully, Your Honor, it is not the stratosphere. It s the troposphere. Troposphere, whatever,  Justice Scalia replied.  I told you before I m not a scientist.  Over a brief flutter of laughter from observers, he added,  That s why I don t want to have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth. Scalia also was not a doctor but he was more than eager to give women his expert medical opinion about why they shouldn t be allowed to have abortions or birth control.I m sure his friends and family will miss him but the billions of people most impacted by Climate Change will have a chance to survive now that Corporate America s champion of denial is gone. I m not going to pretend I m not glad Scalia s seat is empty and, apparently, neither is the planet.Here s an Instagram video posted by the Death Valley National Park Service:We got you a valentine s day present  it s thousands of flowers. #YoureWelcome #BestValentineEverA video posted by Death Valley National Park (@deathvalleynps) on Feb 15, 2016 at 6:51am PSTFeatured image via Death Valley National Park Service",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Legally Blind ‘Patriots’ May Freely Carry Guns In This Southern State,"Are you, or is someone you know, a legally blind patriot who really wants to exercise their Second Amendment rights? Well, move on down to Georgia and you can do just that. No, this is not an Onion story.A man in the Southern state is making his friends very, very nervous because he is one of these legally blind patriots who are walking around strapped. David Bunch s friend, Eule Stewart, is outraged that his state allows someone to carry a weapon even after they have been declared visually impaired: I don t see anybody in their right mind giving a blind man a license to tote a gun in public He says that he can see shadows, pretty much, just shadows and movement. Think about that for a moment: Bunch is only able to see SHADOWS and the state of Georgia is like, That s cool, bro. Go ahead and carry this deadly firearm.  He literally would not be able to see if an intruder was coming into his home, or if it was one of his friends stopping by unannounced.What s worse is that the state actually pulled his driver s license because he is unable to see well enough to drive but he is STILL allowed to own a shotgun:Stewart said he offered to help his friend get around after Georgia pulled Bunch s driver s license.In January, Stewart said he drove Bunch to a Dawsonville gun shop to buy a 12-gauge shotgun. He asked me what the gun looked like,  Stewart said.  I said,  Well, it s a nice looking gun. You know, I d like to have a gun like that.  And he said,  I ll take that one. That s right, he couldn t even see the shotgun he was buying!Georgia isn t the only state that puts our lives in danger by allowing people who cannot see to own guns. The blind citizens of Iowa, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan and a few other states also allow it. All of this is possible because there is no federal law banning the visually impaired from carrying and the chances of that changing with the NRA-puppets in control of the Senate and House, are slim to none.As we all know, the GOP isn t the least bit interested in keeping us safe as long as the NRA and gun lobby continue to keep their campaign coffers full.

 38% Of Trump Supporters Wish South Had Won Civil War And Other Disgusting Findings In New Poll,"A new poll conducted in South Carolina on the heels of the state s Republican primary reveals the true extent of hatred from Donald Trump s base   and it is terrifying.Currently, Trump is expected to easily win South Carolina. His nearest competitor isn t even close. The landslide is so bad that Trump has hardly had to campaign in the state, while others scramble to fight for second place. What makes Trump so popular? A look at the values these voters hold gives us the disturbing answer.Public Policy Polling asked South Carolinians several questions about issues Trump has alluded to on the campaign trail and found that many of them support his most hateful rhetoric. Some even feel he doesn t go far enough.On the question of banning Muslims from entering the United States, one third of Trump s supporters said they would like to add  homosexuals  to the  Can Not Enter  list. No other candidate s supporters came even close to that level of intolerance. But they weren t finished.There s also 62/23 support among Trump voters for creating a national database of Muslims and 40/36 support for shutting down all the mosques in the United States, something no one else s voters back. Only 44% of Trump voters think the practice of Islam should even be legal at all in the United States, to 33% who think it should be illegal. To put all the views toward Muslims in context though, 32% of Trump voters continue to believe the policy of Japanese internment during World War II was a good one The message is clear: Making America Great Again means purging everyone who isn t white and Christian.Trump s supporters also felt that slavery wasn t so bad, either. In fact, 38 percent of them said they wished the South had won the Civil War. Another 38 percent weren t sure. As PPP dryly put it, Trump s were  the only one[s] whose supporters actually wish the South had won.  Needless to say, an overwhelming majority of his fans (70 percent) felt that the Confederate flag should still be flying over the State Capital.And as if all of those wistful call-backs to a time when white people owned black people were just too subtle, a full 16% of Trump s supporters say they think whites are the  superior race    the only candidate to have double digit support for this racist concept.Following Trump s latest snafu (During the debate, he correctly pointed out that George W. Bush had been president during 9/11. A Republican no-no.), there was some speculation that he would suffer in the polls. That appears to not be the case. It is Ted Cruz, in fact, who was found to be the most unlikable candidate in the race. (No surprise there, everyone hates Ted Cruz once they get to know him.) Meanwhile, Trump has actually gained a few points since the debate.It s clear that targeting Trump on any particular gaffe or talking point won t work. Trump s supporters are fanatical, singularly focused, and fueled by intolerance and hatred. Trump can continue to attack his fellow Republicans or their beloved George W. Bush just as long as he doesn t forget to mock and scapegoat minorities as well. His base demands it.It is often said that Trump s popularity is due to his ability to say what others won t. If that s the case, he s saying an awful lot about the toxic underbelly of the Republican Party.Featured image from Flickr/Alex Hanson ",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Can’t Afford Clean Water For Flint, But Israel Demands $50 Billion From U.S. Taxpayers (VIDEO)","In a showdown with the U.S. government, Israel is demanding that its current aid package be drastically increased by an enormous margin. With the current aid agreement of $30 billion over ten years set to expire in 2017, Israel now wants that increased to $50 billion over the next ten years.Where is all this money going to come from? The U.S. taxpayer of course. Instead of using this money to support the poisonous water afflicting Flint, Michigan, we give billions away to a state that perpetuates the most protracted military occupation in modern history, committing countless of human rights violations against the Palestinians.What s insane is that American politicians haven t even paid attention to Flint s water crisis, even though the lead poison in the water may have caused brain damage to thousands of American children who drank it. In a startling display of both disdain and stupidity, Republican senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio didn t even know what was happening in Flint days after the crisis broke. He said: I d love to give you a better answer on it. It s just not an issue we ve been quite frankly fully briefed or apprised of in terms of the role the governor has played and the state has played in Michigan on these sorts of issues. Rubio continued, saying that he s unable to give: A deeply detailed answer on what the right approach should be, other than to tell you that in general I believe the federal government s role in some of these things [is] largely limited unless it involves a federal jurisdictional issue. The comical yet sad aspect of all this is when the Republican presidential candidates ignore Flint, an American city filled with American poisoned children yet grovel to prove their loyalty to Israel, a foreign country and (I must point out again) a terrible violator of Palestinian human rights. The question is why would they grovel on a level that makes it embarrassing to watch as an American? The answer lies in what pro-Israel billionaires can do for you as a politician.For example, Sheldon Edelson, the militantly pro-Israel billionaire, spent tens of millions of dollars supporting Mitt Romney against President Obama in the previous presidential elections because he thought Obama was soft when it came to Israel. Now, Republican candidates are groveling for his support and money. Marco Rubio already has a  supporter in billionaire Norman Braman. He is Rubio s largest campaign donor with an estimated $10-25 million. Braman is staunchly pro-Israel, funding an Israeli settlement in Occupied Palestine. Settlements are illegal under international law and are in contradiction to U.S. foreign policy in the region. If you listen to Rubio s rhetoric on Israel, he s religiously on board with Israel s insanity.So, when all is said and done, these signed, sealed, and delivered politicians who grovel to a foreign government must pay back the support they received during an election year. This comes in the form of robbing tax payers of billions of dollars and ignoring an urgent issue like the Flint water crisis. In all likelihood, Israel will get its billions and our cities and people will continue to be ignored.Watch Video Here:Featured image from Wikimedia Commons.

" MSNBC Anchor Embarrasses GOP Rep, Schools Him On The Constitution (VIDEO)","House Republican Steve King received a lesson on what the Constitution says during an interview with Tamron Hall.The MSNBC host and Iowa Rep. were discussing the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and whether or not President Obama is allowed to nominate someone to fill his vacant seat on the Supreme Court.Hall noted that Republican Senator Chuck Grassley also opposes President Obama picking the next Supreme Court Justice, but pointed out that Grassley s past statement on the subject of nominating and confirming judges in the final months of a presidency is going viral.During the final months of the Bush Administration, Grassley said that  the Senate has never stopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months of a president s term. In addition, Hall informed King that most confirmations only last on average under 80 days in the Senate and there are still over 300 days left in Obama s final year. Hall wanted King to explain why Republicans are running away from their previous position when it comes to doing their constitutional duty and King tried to spin what Grassley said as if the Supreme Court is not part of the judicial branch. You ll find Chuck Schumer in his own words, and others also that contradict themselves, and you re going to see, if people have been in that senate long enough, that they have been on the opposite side of this equation, there will be arguments that are made on both sides of this. But if I heard Chuck Grassley s words right, he said judicial nominees, he didn t say Supreme Court justices. And that s when Hall absolutely embarrassed King by asking him to actually read what the Constitution says. And others would say please see the words correctly in the Constitution, it clearly states the role of the President, and that of the Senate. Hall then ended the interview before King could spill any more bullshit out of his mouth.Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans are always bragging about how much they love the Constitution, but just like the Bible, they apparently have never read it.If Steve King needs a refresher on what the Constitution says, I suggest he read Article II Section 2 which reads:[The President] shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law: but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.

 U.S. Government Jailing People For Not Paying Back Student Loans (VIDEO),"The enormous debt students incur for college is already a huge burden for millions of Americans and the stress of financial debt can be daunting. Well now it can get even worse. The U.S. government is arresting borrowers who fail to pay back their student loans.This happened to Paul Aker, who was arrested for failing to pay back a $1,500 loan he took out in 1987. He says that seven U.S. marshals showed up to his home with guns and combat gear and dragged him to jail. From there, he was taken to court where he was forced to sign a repayment plan in front of a judge. Aker said: It was mind boggling, I couldn t believe it. I was standing before the court with no rights read to me, no legal representation, and I d been told that I owe $1,500, just couldn t believe it. The private sector is now able to use the government to force citizens to pay back loans. In this case, US marshals were used on behalf of debt collectors. US congressman Gene Green of Texas said:  Our federal resources, our US marshals and federal court system are being used by the private sector. A few years ago, Congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this. Private loan companies often charge enormous interest rates that plunge young Americans into perpetual debt slavery for a lifetime. It s crazy to think that they re now able to use the resources of the federal government to come after Americans who often don t have the financial resources to pay back loans.Thanks to the U.S. Congress, this has all been made possible.Watch Video Here: Featured image From YouTube Screen Capture.",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rachel Maddow’s Brilliant Breakdown Of The Coming Battle Over Scalia’s Seat Is Terrifying (VIDEO),"The unexpected passing of Justice Antonin Scalia has added yet another layer to the incompetence Republicans display when it comes to governing. This time, however, it s not about a spending issue or an executive order they don t like; there s no looming shutdown or invented ebola crisis. This time, the GOP is threatening the very core of our democracy.Rachel Maddow is without a doubt one of the most brilliant and influential political minds of our time. Her thoughts are insightful and her opinions intertwined with logic and reason. In other words, she s the Anti-Hannity or O Reilly, Limbaugh, Beck or any other of a host of propagandists spewing the lie of the day.In this segment, Maddow breaks down why Republican obstruction of an Obama Supreme Court nominee is not only incredibly arrogant, it s also very dangerous for us as a nation. Our democracy is built on a government of three branches. When one of those branches can t function because of the ongoing threat of a tie, anything from abortion law to gun control and yes, even the outcome of a presidential election could hang in the balance.Watch Rachel Maddow make a case for just how dangerous it is to go into a national election with a vacant seat on the Supreme Court:Many of us wake up in a cold sweat after nightmares of the outcome of the 2000 election. The Supreme Court was ultimately left to decide the fate of American politics for the next four years and the result was disastrous. But, there was a result.What would happen if there was a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court after a state like Florida was contested? The decision would then revert back to the lower court s decision, which had already been accepted for review by the higher court.The resulting circle of legal quagmire could leave us facing severe consequences, especially when Republicans figure out they can send their appeals strategically to lower court judges they know will side with them automatically.Without the 9th seat on the Supreme Court filled we can expect legal battles to arise in districts where there should be none, simply because the judges of that circuit will be able to negate the wishes of the people with no recourse from the high court.And the kooks of the right think Obama had a good reason to have Scalia assassinated?Featured image from screen capture ",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Lesbian Couple’s Valentine’s Day Ruined By A**hole Chef Who Thinks They Need A Man (IMAGE),"It s infuriating that there are still men who act like total pigs.Ellie Parker only wanted to have a wonderful first Valentine s Day with her girlfriend. So she took her to Asahi Japanese Steakhouse in Lafayette, Indiana. They had expected good service and good food to make their evening special and memorable. But it only became memorable for all the wrong reasons.She explained on Facebook that she and her girlfriend attended dinner with a group and the chef came out to their table to to cook the food right there in front of them, which is pretty cool. Not cool is what the chef did next. He proceeded to ask the women at the table if they were with their boyfriend or husband, and then acted completely rude when Parker said she was with her girlfriend.That s when the chef crossed the line from professional to creepy asshole. He not only told both women that they needed a man, he inquired as to whether he could be that man as if he could turn the lesbian couple straight.But Parker describes the incident much better. I m not normally one to complain on social media, but the service I had at dinner tonight warrants a little complaining. I took my girlfriend out to Asahi for our first Valentine s Day together. Our chef came to grill our food for us and was asking everyone if the person with them was their boyfriend or husband. He got to my girlfriend and I and asked where our valentines were. We told him we were each other s valentines. We were holding hands mind you. Clearly a couple. He proceeds to say  well it is legal, but it s such a waste to not have a man.  Later he continues to insult our relationship by saying he could come home with us to  heat things up.  I am appalled that I would receive this kind of treatment. I cannot believe I paid over $50 to have my relationship insulted and sexualized. At the end of dinner, Parker wrote on the receipt  Don t tell lesbians they need a man on Valentine s Day.  Apparently, the restaurant was so embarrassed that they gave them their money back.Here s an image of the receipt via Parker s Facebook page.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;I m not normally one to complain on social media, but the service I had at dinner tonight warrants a little complaining .Posted by Ellie Parker on Sunday, February 14, 2016Frankly, Asahi should either fire the chef or at the very least force him to take sensitivity classes because this is about as unprofessional as it gets.

 Catholic Church: It Is Not ‘Necessary’ For Bishops To Report Child Sex Abuse To Police,"The Catholic Church has a decades long   and likely even longer than that   history of covering up child sexual abuse. They even looked the other way when child pornography was found within the walls of the Vatican itself. And now, despite Pope Francis s declarations that he would put a stop to this, recent actions and statements by the Church strongly contradict that.Times Live reports that a set of guidelines drawn up to train newly ordained bishops says the following: According to the state of civil laws of each country where reporting is obligatory, it is not necessarily the duty of the bishop to report suspects to authorities, the police or state prosecutors in the moment when they are made aware of crimes or sinful deeds. So, in other words, these people are telling their new bishops that they don t have to go to the cops if they find out someone in their charge is molesting kids. That is in sharp contrast to Pope Francis s earlier statement, which said: Everything possible must be done to rid the church of the scourge of the sexual abuse. Well, your words are high-minded, Pope Francis, but the guidelines regarding this issue are not. Nothing has changed. You people might be pretending to be concerned about the continued victimization of the children within your parishes and under the charge of your priests and bishops, but you aren t, really. All you care about is the church s image, and getting butts in the pews and cash in the collection plates.There is absolutely no defending this one. They are, essentially, grooming new bishops to continue covering up these heinous crimes, and hiding behind religious freedom and privileged communication to do so.Word to the wise, parents: the LAST people you should ever trust your children with without question are these priests and bishops. There s no telling what will happen to them.Featured image from Donkey Hotey on Flickr",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Patriot’s ‘Stand For Freedom’ Thwarted By Evil Socialist Ceiling Fan (VIDEO),"One man s  stand for freedom  ended disastrously when he forgot to look up.

 Watch: MSNBC’s Chris Hayes Apologizes On Air For Releasing Deceptively Edited Anti-Clinton Video,"MSNBC s Chris Hayes has consistently proven to be a strong voice in the liberal movement. Alongside Rachel Maddow, he is one of MSNBC s most gifted bullshit detectors, capable of sounding the alarm around Republican lies and nonsense wherever it might occur. That s why it was so disappointing to see him fall into the low-brow dredge of trying to stir up a  Clinton hates Obama  false narrative to help fan the flames of Democratic in-fighting this election season.On Friday, Hayes used a segment on MSNBC s All In with Chris Hayes to go after Bill Clinton for sounding  off-message  and out of sync with his wife s campaign. His show ran a clip of the former president speaking at a recent Hillary rally, and quoted him as saying that the current president (that would be Barack Obama) isn t a  change maker. Hayes: If that s Clinton s winning strategy, she might want to make sure her husband is in the loop. Bill seemed to go a bit off-message last night in Tennessee while campaigning for his wife.Clinton: She s always making something good happen. She s the best change maker I ve ever known. A lot of people say, you don t understand. It s different now. It s rigged. Yeah, it s rigged because you don t have a president who is a change maker.Sounds bad right?Well actually, as legions of disappointed fans pointed out to Hayes throughout the weekend on social media, the clip Hayes showed was painfully out of context. If MSNBC s editing team had kept it rolling for just a few seconds longer, audiences would have seen that Clinton was channeling President Obama s naysayers, and not speaking for himself. Just one sentence later, Clinton quite literally ends with a pro-Obama crescendo that has the entire audience applauding.By Monday Hayes seems to have read the writing on the wall (or the mentions in his Twitter feed) and issued an on-air apology and played the entire clip that debunked his  off-message  narrative.Bill Clinton s supposed criticism of Obama fall apart when you see him add  But the President has done a better job than he has gotten credit for, and don t you forget it! Hayes couldn t help but half-defend his indefensible editing saying it was still arguably true,  but concluded by agreeing with his critics. In cutting off that clip, we didn t allow you the chance to make that judgment for yourself in the full light of context. We shouldn t have done that. In full light of the context, the entire point of the segment falls apart. The better option would have simply been to not run the  story  at all. During this divisive time, people are angry enough as it is. They don t need manufactured scandals to feed the ugliness.Feature image via MSNBC",News,"February 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mitch McConnell SLAMS His Own SCOTUS-Obstructing Ways In ‘Kentucky Law Journal’,"After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, many people have offered up their opinions on what should happen in regards to who should replace him. It is the president s constitutional duty to nominate someone for the role, however several Republicans have voiced their dissent, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).Directly after the announcement of Scalia s passing, McConnell wrote on Facebook a message of condolence for his family alongside this remark. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President. However, according to Sarah Burgess on Twitter, McConnell contradicts his own current views. In the 1970-71 Kentucky Law Journal, McConnell wrote: At the outset, the Senate should discount the philosophy of the nominee. In our politically centrist society, it is highly unlikely that any Executive would nominate a man of such extreme views of the right of the left as to be disturbing to the Senate. However, a nomination, for example, of a Communist or a member of the American Nazi Parly, would have to be considered an exception to the recommendation that the Senate leave ideological considerations to the discretion of the Executive. Political and philosophical considerations were often a factor in the nineteenth century and arguably in the Parker, Haynsworth and Carswell cases also, but this is not proper and tends to degrade the Court and dilute the constitutionally proper authority of the Executive in this area. The President is presumably elected by the people to carry out a program and altering the ideological directions of the Supreme Court would seem to be a perfectly legitimate part of a Presidential platform. To that end, the Constitution gives to him the power to nominate. As mentioned earlier, if the power to nominate had been given to the Senate, as was considered during the debates at the Constitutional Convention, then it would be proper for the Senate to consider political philosophy. The proper role of the Senate is to advise and consent to the particular nomination, and thus, as the Constitution puts it,  to appoint.  This taken within the context of modern times should mean an examination only into the qualifications of the President s nominee. According to himself, McConnell would have to agree President Obama is within his full right and duty as Commander-in-Chief to nominate someone who he deems appropriate for the role of Supreme Court Justice. Even if that means  altering the ideological directions of the Supreme Court.  He should still see that to be  perfectly legitimate. However, with the times being as they are during an election year, you can see why Republicans are terrified of an Obama nominee, because the implications would be huge surrounding several cases, including cases surrounding voting rights.To say the least, it s not surprising that McConnell is a giant hypocrite contradicting even himself and his own view of the law. Hopefully he ll come to his senses sooner rather than later.Featured image: Flickr",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Clinton Hilariously Smacks Down Obnoxious Trump Supporter As Only He Can (VIDEO),"While at a campaign event in Riviera Beach Florida, Bill Clinton was speaking about his wife, Hillary, and letting everyone know why they should choose her in the upcoming election. However, from the crowd came shouts of protest from a lone Donald Trump supporter who stood with a Trump campaign sign smirking and looking very proud of himself.What this protester didn t realize was coming was the fact that the former president is used to being attacked from every angle. He will have a comeback and retort to everything thrown his way. So that protester soon had his condescending smirk wiped off his face by an epic verbal smack down that he likely was not expecting.The Trump supporter was shouting You took his money!  in reference to the Clinton s taking Trump s money for their foundation. This is when Clinton responded without even blinking an eye: I certainly did. I took his money for my foundation and used it better than he s using it now. However, the Trump minion still stood there with his smug little smile waving his sign around for all to see. And as the crowd grew restless at this obnoxious display, Clinton took on this creep head on. Referencing Trump, he said: I remember when he called me to say how terrible the Republicans had been to Hillary and me and how unfair they were and what a brilliant job Hillary did as a senator. By the way, a lot of them called me about that, which is why they spent the last three years trying to tear her down because they know if they nominate her they are going to have to eat the words they said. However, the former president wasn t done. As the Secret Service finally led the Trump lackey away, Clinton said: If you want to build a wall along the Rio Grande and spend $13 million, then you should follow him like Moses into the Promised Land. BURRRNNN! Clinton basically told the guy that Trump is full of crap and is selling him on racist promises he simply won t be able to deliver.The lesson to be learned from all of this?

 Trump Supporter Blows Up Fox Segment By Attacking Panelist’s ‘Big Boobs’ (VIDEO),"Fox News never disappoints when it operates more like a derange reality TV show than a news network. On Monday, a Mornings with Maria segment went off the rails when Trump supporter and reality TV star Omarosa Manigault flipped out on left-leaning Fox contributor Tamara Holder and targeted her  big boobs    leaving even host Maria Bartiromo in shock and trying to maintain control.This special moment was prefaced with a discussion about Trump s recent criticism of George W. Bush s performance regarding the 9/11 terror attacks and Iraq war. When Holder commented that she wished the Republican front-runner would talk more about Black Lives Matter or improving inner cities instead of trying to politicize the 9/11 attacks, former Apprentice star Manigault forgot where she was and brought the drama full force to live television.In arguing that the topic should stay on Trump s criticism of the Iraq war, Manigault s blind rage got the best of her and she focused on Holder s breast size as things got heated. You can watch what happened below:Holder had just corrected Manigault s pronunciation of her first name when the disgruntled ex-TV personality shot back: It s the same difference, boo. You want to come on with big boobs, then you deal with the pronunciation of your name. Bartiromo, almost in a state of shock, interrupted and asked, Wait a second, why are you bringing up Tamara s boobs? Manigault explained, Because she started going back talking about,  Oh, you were a Democrat and you supported Hillary Clinton.  If you want to get personal, we can get personal. Holder struggled to understand Manigault s reasoning and asked, Wait, how does who you support have to do with the size of my boobs? Considering that this is how I was born. I mean, I m sorry. Manigault refused to ease up and said, I m sorry, I should have called you a boob. Can we talk about Donald Trump? I mean, what else can you expect from a Trump supporter? It s been proven throughout Trump s campaign that his loyal fans are just as sexist, racist and all-around offensive and he is   in short, they love him because he IS them. Trump has a long history of making sexist, misogynistic comments about women   and Manigault simply embodied those values in this segment.As much of a train wreck as this was, Bartiromo wasn t all that embarrassed that this happened on her show, because she retweeted an article about the inappropriate segment soon after it was published.Featured image is a screenshot via Raw Story",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Liberal Media’ Scrubs Clip Of Chuck Todd Saying Something Mean About Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"We often hear about the  liberal media s  attempts to swing everything to the left. This myth of media bias is often repeated on Fox News, on right-wing blogs, and basically anywhere conservatives gather. The  liberal media,  according to them, seeks to destroy everything good and pure   like the right to discriminate against  the gays  and  the blacks,  and impose a Christofascist theocracy on our nation. According to legend, the most  liberal  of the 24-hour news networks is MSNBC.Unfortunately, even MSNBC seems to be shifting to the Right lately. On Monday, the news network deleted a clip that was unfavorable to, of all people, Ted Cruz.The clip in question was from Sunday s edition of Meet the Press, and featured host Chuck Todd expressing nothing short of disgust as Cruz spoke. In the clip, as Cruz compares recently-deceased hatemonger and Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, to Ronald Reagan. Todd can be heard, almost imperceptibly, muttering  Oh god  as Cruz makes the comparison:CRUZ: And, Chuck, just as Ronald Reagan was to the Presidency, so Antonin Scalia was to the Supreme Court. He had that big an impact.TODD: Oh God.CRUZ: And I think his passing yesterday really underscores the stakes of this election.After reports began to circulate, MSNBC could  have   being the  liberal media  and all   published a statement explaining that, yes, Todd was a bit astonished by the stupidity of Cruz s statement, even considering how terrible Reagan was (let s face it: Scalia was much, much worse). Instead, they pulled the clip. The only reason, the only reason this would have happened would be to protect Cruz from embarrassment. This is the clip, with audio enhanced to make the phrase clear:According to Mediaite,  MSNBC has re-aired the clip, and only now, they have scrubbed Todd s aside from the conversation.  The new clip does, indeed, seem to be missing the words  Oh, god. This revisionism, sadly, paints MSNBC in a bad light. As a news organization, they have a responsibility to report the truth. In this case, they removed audio from a report in order to save themselves some trouble.The Right loves to paint MSNBC as dishonest. In this case, they were.Tell MSNBC it is not OK to dishonestly edit their reports by clicking this link. The last thing we need is another Fox News.Watch the new clip below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders’ Takedown Of Donald Trump’s ‘Greatness’ Is Absolutely Hysterical (VIDEO),"Senator Bernie Sanders had the crowd roaring with laughter during a campaign rally in Nevada on Sunday as he mocked a certain GOPer mercilessly.The victim of Sanders  flawless sense of humor was none other than Republican front runner Donald Trump, who has been known to boast about how great he is at every endeavor he s ever tried his hand at. Not a day goes by that Trump isn t shoving his ego down the throats of Americans, with ridiculous claims that he will be the  greatest jobs president  or  the best thing that ever happened to women. Sanders used Trump s inflated sense of self against him, turning the business mogul into some comic relief for his supporters.As soon as Sanders mentioned Trump s name, the audience was booing the GOP candidate despite Sanders  attempts to calm them down. But he knows just how to lift the mood and the entire audience was soon laughing as Sanders said, We know that Donald Trump is the greatest everything in the world. There is nothing that this man is not  the greatest  at. And one of his major scientific contributions in recent years has been to proclaim that climate change is a hoax. Now, for Republican candidates, this is not an unusual idea, but [Trump] added something to it, being the brilliant scientist that he is: That this hoax was created by the Chinese! This made Sanders  supporters giggle, as he noted how strange it was that Trump didn t blame climate change on immigrants or Muslims   two minorities that Trump loves to blame for basically anything. You can watch Sanders  hilarious takedown of the GOPer below:Obviously, Trump is nothing close to a scientist, but that doesn t stop him from blabbering on about his extensive  knowledge  of the subject. Even though Trump later tried to distance himself from the tweets where he d said China was responsible for climate change, there are plenty other examples that show Trump doesn t know a damn thing about the subject   after all, he d once said that climate change was a hoax because of extreme winter weather!Trump is a complete idiot, and perhaps one of the things he s really the greatest at is showing just how ridiculous he and his fellow conservatives are.

 Top SCOTUS Insider Knows The ‘Most Likely’ Choice To Replace Scalia,"Conservatives are busy mourning the death of Antonin Scalia, and coming up with ways to make sure that no one President Obama picks will make it through to the court. Well, if they are angry and scheming right now, this next prediction will have the right positively fuming.According to NBC News, Tom Goldstein, the Supreme Court expert who is the mastermind behind SCOTUSblog, is predicting that President Obama will nominate current Attorney General Loretta Lynch to replace the recently deceased Scalia. Calling Lynch a  very serious possibility,  Goldstein went on to say: The fact that Lynch was vetted so recently for attorney general also makes it practical for the president to nominate her in relatively short order. Goldstein s predictions are in sharp contrast to those of Robert Reich, who believes that the pick would be Judge Sri Srinivasan, who has been nominated to a lower Court of Appeals by President Obama. However, it seems that Goldstein s prediction makes much more sense, both practically and politically.This nomination could be a political windfall for the left, and a disaster for the right. With so many Republicans vowing to refuse to allow any of Obama s nominees onto the court, their image problem when it comes to race will not be helped if they refuse to confirm Lynch. After all, she would be the first black woman to make it to the Supreme Court, and they would look like a bunch of racists and misogynists. Further, according to Goldstein, Lynch s history as a career prosecutor makes it very difficult to paint her as excessively liberal. Essentially, a Loretta Lynch nomination does everything the left needs it to do, and completely paints the GOP obstructionists into a corner. They already have serious problems with racial minorities, and with the way they treated the Loretta Lynch confirmation for the position of Attorney General, they can t afford to treat her badly again. People already called that racism and misogyny out for what it was, and if they want to maintain any kind of semblance of respect when it comes to race issues and minority communities, they will not block Lynch a second time. Goldstein s points on the issues a Lynch nomination poses for the GOP were nothing short of perfect: I think the administration would relish the prospect of Republicans either refusing to give Lynch a vote or seeming to treat her unfairly in the confirmation process. Either eventuality would motivate both black and women voters. Oh, I surely hope that this is true. Talk about a great way for President Obama to stick it to the GOP on his way out.Featured image from White House Flickr",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Stephen King Sums Up This Entire Presidential Election In One Glorious Tweet,"It can be said that this current election cycle has been one of the most bizarre ever in the history of the United States. Sure, there have been nasty elections in the past that include those who notoriously mudsling, spread lies, and try to do anything to win. However, this election? This election may take the cake.To perfectly sum up this election, one person has tweeted something that is beyond perfect. One can only assume this tweet was aimed at this current presidential process, because it speaks flawlessly to the tone of what we ve all been witnessing.In one perfectly glorious tweet, Stephen King says: The stupidest, ugliest Presidential campaign in my entire life.

 NBC Host SLAMS Rubio’s Ignorance On SCOTUS: ‘Do Presidential Terms End After 3 Years?’ (VIDEO),"It looks as though Republicans are hellbent on obstructing President Obama from doing his constitutional responsibility of nominating a new Justice to the Supreme Court to replace the recently departed Justice Antonin Scalia. They keep touting the line that we should wait until the next president is elected, that way the people can weigh in on who they d like as a replacement, not quite realizing the people did weigh in (twice) when they elected and reelected President Obama. However, they know that Justice Scalia was the most conservative voice on the Court and knowing that Obama has the chance to nominate a liberal terrifies them to no end.No greater example of this fear was demonstrated than by Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio while on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. Rubio said: We have an obligation to do it, but not now. This term of the Supreme Court, they just started it. But it s not all year long. The court can function with eight justices, it does it all the time, especially when justices have to recuse themselves. For example, Kagan had to recuse herself early in her term because she had just left the administration.We re going to have an election in November where this vacancy is going to be an item of debate and voters are going to get their weigh in. So I just don t think it s wise. And there s precedent for this, for a president nearing the last few months of his administration, to put someone on the court that may be there for 30 years. If you squint, you ll be able to see Rubio reach down his pants to pull that statement out of his ass. And knowing that line is absolute poppycock, and listening to Rubio try to justify himself, Chuck Todd snaps back: Do presidential terms end after three years? That s what I don t understand, is why not go through the advice and consent? You don t have to approve it. You can reject it. That s what happened in  68. But why not go through this process?  And BOOM goes the dynamite. Todd was quite visibly perplexed and couldn t quite seem to be able to wrap his head around the fact that Rubio was actually saying the words that were coming out of his mouth.However, Rubio wasn t done. Squirming in his Underoos after that question, he said: There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating. You basically say, at this point, with a few months left in your term, no accountability from the ballot box on the appointment you re going to make   on a lifetime appointment. But Todd interrupts this malarkey: We re Eleven months .! Declaring the amount of time left in Obama s term as Commander-in-Chief, and insinuating the president has every right to nominate someone new.Squirming some more, Rubio keeps denying the fact that Obama has every right to nominate a new Justice, because he thinks that he s going to be president and he wants to nominate a conservative just like Scalia.What Rubio needs to understand is, President Obama can, should and will nominate someone to replace Scalia. Republicans are showing their fear and it s ugly. They are proving they are  constitutionalists  until they actually have to abide by the constitution, as per usual.Let s hope Obama nominates someone amazing, and nominates them soon.Watch the interaction here: Video: NBC Featured image: Screen Capture",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas Newspapers Humiliate Ted Cruz By Endorsing ANYONE But Him For President,"Ted Cruz is so hated that even his home state newspapers will endorse anyone but him and what they had to say about him is absolutely embarrassing.Despite being the only presidential candidate from the Lone Star State, the three major newspapers in Texas refused to endorse the Tea Party Senator, citing his dangerous agenda.According to the San Antonio Express-News, The freshman senator has demonstrated a frightening willingness to push the American economy to the brink of disaster to pursue his ideological agenda   even when he clearly does not have the votes to get his way The freshman senator s methodical run for the White House is obviously well-planned, but Cruz s self-centered approach has thoroughly alienated even his Republican Senate colleagues. And that is obviously a recipe for a weak, unsuccessful administration. He lacks the temperament to be president.Instead, the newspaper reluctantly endorsed Jeb Bush, writing that he s  not the flashiest candidate in the crowded Republican presidential field. And he lacks the mischievous charm that his older brother, George W. Bush, used to navigate his way through campaign obstacles. That really sounds like a ringing endorsement, doesn t it?The Dallas Morning News also rejected Cruz, writing in their endorsement of  crusty  and  irritable  Ohio Governor John Kasich that, As much as we d like to see a Texan in the White House, we fear that Cruz s brand of politics is more about disruption than governing and threatens to take the Republican Party to a dark place. As we ve written before, continuing obstructionist paths might excite primary voters, but it won t benefit the nation or the conservative cause. The Houston Chronicle echoed their rival newspapers, piling on the criticism of Ted Cruz while joining the San Antonio Express-News by endorsing Bush as well. He may not be a great candidate,  the Chronicle conceded,  but he would be a great nominee   and a capable president,  the paper continued in an obviously desperate bid to endorse anyone but Cruz, whom they slammed as  disastrous for the Republican Party, disastrous for the nation. Jeb Bush and John Kasich are currently polling in single digits nationally as Cruz and Trump continue to lead the field with their brand of conservative lunacy that appeals to a large swath of right-wing voters who just want to light a match and watch the country burn.But it s truly hilarious that even Texas newspapers don t have the stomach to endorse to Cruz. It should be embarrassing for him, but he hates the free press so he probably doesn t care. Hopefully voters will care enough to stop supporting him.Featured Image: Nation of Change",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You’re Going To Want To Read Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Tribute To Her ‘Best Buddy’ Scalia,"All over the world you ll see unlikely pairings; an elephant that is best friends with a dog, or a horse that befriends a duck, or a tiger that loves his monkey. And then there s Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the recently departed Justice Antonin Scalia. Two people who on paper should loathe one another, because quite frankly, they couldn t be more opposite in political viewpoints. Ginsburg the liberal and Scalia the staunch conservative. Yet, they were close friends during their tenure together on the United States Supreme Court, and even before that as well.As every Justice wrote a statement after the passing of Scalia, all very moving and paying tribute to the conservative, one stood out among all the others   Justice Ginsburg s. As you read it, you can tell she was thinking back on memories of times they spent together and it is actually quite touching. She refers to their friendship as  best buddies. Toward the end of the opera Scalia/Ginsburg, tenor Scalia and soprano Ginsburg sing a duet:  We are different, we are one,  different in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve. From our years together at the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We disagreed now and then, but when I wrote for the Court and received a Scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial circulation. Justice Scalia nailed all the weak spots the  applesauce  and  argle bargle and gave me just what I needed to strengthen the majority opinion. He was a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit, with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh. The press referred to his  energetic fervor,   astringent intellect,   peppery prose,   acumen,  and  affability,  all apt descriptions. He was eminently quotable, his pungent opinions so clearly stated that his words never slipped from the reader s grasp.Justice Scalia once described as the peak of his days on the bench an evening at the Opera Ball when he joined two Washington National Opera tenors at the piano for a medley of songs. He called it the famous Three Tenors performance. He was, indeed, a magnificent performer. It was my great good fortune to have known him as working colleague and treasured friend. The opera she s referring to  Scalia/Ginsburg  noted their relationship, and in the song  We are different, we are one  it shows that despite their differences in almost every way opinion-wise, they were still there together on the Supreme Court. Respecting one another s opinions, albeit perhaps not agreeing. They were friends.What Ginsburg s statement shows is that despite all that may divide us, there is far more that can bring us together. We need to acknowledge these otherwise unlikely  best buddies  and respect their bond. She is undoubtedly very sad after his passing, and after reading her statement, you can t help but look at Scalia in a different light than one may have originally perceived. This is a note from a friend to another friend after their passing, and it has to be appreciated.Featured image: Flickr/Wikimedia",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Sorry, Not Sorry: Here Are Some Of The Funniest Responses To Scalia’s Death (IMAGES)","Ordinarily we would not celebrate the death of another human being, but some people are just so awful that they make us want to run into the streets and jump for joy when they finally bite the dust. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was one of those people. While the Republican Party is mourning his death, liberals aren t doing any such thing. Sure, we feel sympathy for his family because they lost a loved one, but that s where it ends.Antonin Scalia spent his career on the Supreme Court violating the rights of everyone who was not a white, Christian, Republican male. Not only did he help place George W. Bush in the White House in 2000, he also fought against women s rights, voting rights, and LGBT rights.  Justice Scalia was also a racist who believed that African-Americans are not smart enough to attend elite universities with white students.No, we are not saddened by his passing, we are relieved that he will no longer be able to inflict harm on the people of the United States. Seriously though, I hope someone did that. Doesn t seem very pro-life to me, but his decisions rarely were. HAHAHAHAHA!Best day ever! I stand with God, do you? Very few . Who is Clarence going to copy now?! OMG what s going to happen to him?! We have decided that Jesus wouldn t like that very much. Thankfully, President Obama now has the opportunity to replace Satan s spawn with a justice who actually supports the Constitution and ALL of its amendments. Republicans are going to fight like hell to keep this from happening, because they, like Scalia, do not care about this country or its citizens. And this, my friends, is why it is so important that we put our Bernie/Hillary fighting aside and vote for whomever the Democratic Party picks as our candidate.I m going to leave you with this, the truest of all the Scalia memes: All images from Facebook/ Twitter/ Instagram",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bush Attorney General: Obama ‘Has An Obligation’ To Fill Scalia’s Seat (VIDEO),"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is still dead and the Republican Party is still pledging to block any nominee for the vacancy that President Obama puts forth. According to right-wingers like Ted Cruz, the president doesn t have the  right  to elect a new justice because in the distorted minds of the imbeciles in the GOP the American people only elect Democratic presidents for three years, not the four Republicans get. However, not everyone on the crazy side of the aisle believes this nonsense, actually a very high-ranking member of the Bush Administration, former-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, thinks that it is President Obama s  obligation  to appoint someone to the court.On Monday, AG Gonzales appeared on CNN s New Day to discuss the  controversy  surrounding the vacancy on the highest court in the country: I know there s a big debate going on right now about whether or not Obama should nominate someone. From my perspective having worked at the White House and the Dept. of Justice, there s just no question in my mind that as president of the United States, you have an obligation to fill a vacancy. I suspect President Obama is going to do his job,  he continued.  And after he does his job and nominating a hopefully qualified individual, the Senate will do its job eventually on its own calendar. The president absolutely has an obligation to fill the court, it is one of his most important duties as president. Of course, I don t really expect Ted Cruz and his buddies to understand anything about  duties,  after all, these are the imbeciles that refused to do their jobs and shut the government down in 2013. Their most important job is to keep the government running and they couldn t even do that.If they decide to be the jackasses we expect them to be, they will once again cripple the government because they are literally incapable of governing. The Republican Party doesn t feel an obligation to perform their duties, they only feel obligated to obstruct Obama   at any cost.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BOMBSHELL: Scalia Wanted A Liberal On The Court,"Ever since the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, pretty much everyone has chimed in with an opinion of what should happen next. Republicans want President Obama to hold off on nominating anyone. They are skillfully maneuvering their language to say that the nation should wait for the next president. While everyone with common sense and a basic understanding of the Constitution understands it s the president s job to pick someone new.The next question would obviously be,  who should that someone be? Well, as it turns out, Justice Scalia often voiced his opinion on this matter. As President Obama s senior adviser David Axelrod pointed out on CNN, after Justice Souter announced his retirement, Scalia knew exactly who he wanted as a replacement.Axelrod sat with Scalia during a previous White House Correspondents Dinner, and as they sat, they discussed who Scalia would like to see on the court. Scalia told him: I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation. But I hope he sends us someone smart. But he wasn t done. Continuing, he said: Let me put a finer point on it. I hope he sends us Elena Kagan. Seemingly surprised by this pick, Axelrod wrote on CNN: I was surprised that a member of the court would so bluntly propose a nominee, and intrigued that it was Kagan, the former Harvard Law School dean who was appointed solicitor general by Obama to represent the government before the Supreme Court. Though she had worked on policy in the Clinton administration and had a reputation for pragmatism, Kagan plainly would be a liberal in the context of the court. And although Obama went on to pick Justice Sotomayor, later when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, Kagan got her chance, and undoubtedly Scalia was pleased.Justice Scalia was a conservative through and through on matters of everything policy. However, he was able to maintain very close friendships with those whom he worked with and was close to, even those whose leanings were far more liberal. Axelrod even pointed out: During her confirmation meetings with senators, Kagan had vowed to go hunting to allay their concerns about her cultural awareness on the issue of guns. When she joined the court, she asked her friend, Scalia, to take her. The two, who occasionally shot intellectual darts at each other on paper, became regular, if unlikely, hunting partners. Thus proving that no matter how opposite some may be on matters of policy, those on the highest court in the land were still able to hold friendships and work together despite their differences. A lesson many in Washington probably still need to learn.It s also surprising that Scalia would talk about who he wanted with the president s senior adviser. He clearly wanted Kagan as his pick. Otherwise he probably would ve kept it to himself. This definitely shines a new light on Scalia, a man whose decisions have ranged from racist to homophobic to misogynistic to sometimes outright cruel. However, he clearly favored balance in the court, and for that, he needs to be respected.Featured image: Flickr",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jim Vejvoda’s HILARIOUS Scalia Tweet Is Nothing Short Of PERFECT (IMAGE),"Republicans love to say that they are the party of God. More than a few GOP presidential candidates in the last year have said that God values their bigoted, conservative  family values  and assorted despicable  principles  and points of view, but the death of Antonin Scalia really calls all of that into question. Scalia was about as much of a far-right nut as anyone could ask for, and now that he is dead, the right is terrified that President Obama will nominate someone with a bit of sense, compassion, and knowledge of the Constitution to the Court to replace him.However, the fact that Scalia died when he did completely undermines the idea that some kind of higher power favors far right nonsense, and movie executive extraordinaire Jim Vejoda brillianatly pointed that out on Twitter. Vejoda pointed out that the stars could not have aligned more perfectly for liberals with the timing of Scalia s death:He s right, of course. If conservatives are claiming that some divine power is on their side after this one, they really are delusional. Get it through your heads, right-wingers: Nobody, including the universe, likes ugly, and you folks are as ugly as they come. Most folks are saying good riddance to Antonin Scalia   apparently, including your so-called God.Featured image from Twitter",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Oliver MERCILESSLY Takes Apart The GOP For Making Up ‘Bullshit’ Rule (VIDEO),"John Oliver absolutely humiliated Mitch McConnell and the GOP for vowing to block any Supreme Court nominee picked by President Obama.During his show on Sunday, Oliver had wanted to recap the last three months he has missed since going on break, but due to the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia he changed the plan and focused instead on how Republicans vowed to obstruct President Obama from filling Scalia s empty seat on the bench.Indeed, Scalia s body wasn t even cold yet before Republicans declared their willingness to desecrate the Constitution he loved so much, and Oliver ripped them apart for it. There is now a huge vacancy on the Supreme Court that needs to be filled, or if you listened to the Republicans in the last 24 hours   not,  Oliver began before showing a clip of Donald Trump telling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to  delay, delay, delay  until a new president can fill the seat in 2017. And Oliver really slammed McConnell since he often obstructs anything President Obama and Democrats try to get done. Well, that does not bode well because Mitch McConnell is actually pretty good at delaying things for people whether it s legislation, court appointments, or orgasms. Believe me, if you ever need to  delay, delay, delay  an orgasm, just picture this face and I guarantee you nothing will happen   possibly for the rest of your life. Oliver then took aim at the Strom Thurmond Rule, an unwritten rule in the Senate that supposedly dictates that presidents can t nominate Supreme Court Justices in the last six months of their final year in office. Yes, the Strom Thurmond Rule. Now, I m not surprised that there is one but I thought that it was always about hush money required to keep your secret family a secret or how racist an old person is allowed to become before their age is no longer an excuse. Oliver then revealed McConnell as a hypocrite for even bringing up this  bullshit rule  because he has condemned its use in the past, specifically in 2008. And yes, there s video, which Oliver happily played. Our Democratic colleagues continually talk about the so-called  Thurmond Rule,  under which the Senate supposedly stops confirming judges in a presidential election year,  McConnell said on the Senate floor.  This seeming obsession with this rule that doesn t exist is an excuse for our colleagues to run out the clock on qualified nominees who are waiting to fill badly needed vacancies. Yes, it seems the  Thurmond Rule  is a bit like God: when things are going your way, you don t bring it up a lot,  Oliver pointed out.  But as soon as you re in trouble   it is all that you talk about. He also pointed out that the rule is about the last six months of a presidency, which for President Obama doesn t begin until July 20th. He also pointed out that Republicans are shitting all over Scalia s memory by disobeying Article II Section II of the Constitution which says the president shall appoint judges of the Supreme Court with the advice and consent of the Senate.In other words, Senate Republicans must do their job just as President Obama must do his.But as Oliver noted, leave it to Republicans to honor Scalia s memory by stretching the definition of  late term.

 The RNC Pulled A Nasty Little Trick To Raise Money And Donald Trump Is FURIOUS,"Donald Trump and the RNC have had a roller coaster ride of a relationship ever since the establishment was forced to acknowledge that Trump is, in fact, a viable candidate for the party s nomination. In the beginning, they attempted to separate the Republican National Committee from the racist rhetoric and asinine platform The Donald is running on, only to switch positions when they realized they were setting up a third party run sure to doom the GOP s chances in the general election.After some schmoozing, the unlikely allies seemed to smooth things over, with Trump signing a pledge not to run as a third party candidate and the RNC dialing down the attacks on Trump. From the committee s standpoint, they had to believe that the nightmare of Trump s campaign would have to flounder and die. After a close second in Iowa that surely would have been a win had he attended the debate just before caucus day and a landslide win in New Hampshire, Trump moves on to South Carolina still poised to be the number one contender to take on the Democratic favorite in November.Things have been ruffled between Trump and his pals at the RNC again, however, when people started noticing overwhelming applause for establishment favorite Jeb Bush at debates and little support for Trump at the national level. Could it be that the truce is off? Could it be that the rift between the establishment of the rich and powerful and the rich and powerful candidate has begun to grow again?That seems likely after the spat between them Saturday when the RNC used Trump s name to raise money for the general election war chest and he exploded over it. In an email sent out hours before the South Carolina debate, the RNC asked for donations using Trump s name. The message, asking for between $35 and $250, said: If you put your name on his list of active party supporters, he will proudly see your name next to the amount you chose to donate to the nominee s war chest. The RNC made the mistake of thinking Donald Trump could possibly care about a war chest for the eventual nominee if there s the slightest chance it won t benefit him. His narcissism wouldn t allow a simple fundraiser to move forward. He said in a statement: The RNC does not treat me well and then they use my name, without my knowledge, to raise money for themselves. This totally unauthorized notice is yet another example of deceptive Washington tricks used to take advantage of the voters and get money from the hard-working people the politicians have failed. In other words, how dare you use his name without paying for it? Trump also tweeted to his supporters not to send any cash to the RNC:""Get on Trump's List"" email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay. Email: https://t.co/6hKW7Ssxz4  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2016Petty little billionaire is petty.

 Report: GOP Voters Are Too Stupid to Know Jeb And George W. Bush Are Related,"It s no secret that our frenemies on the Right are stupid. After all, conservatism, racism (one of the core GOP  values ), and low IQ go together like rama lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong, according to science. But, you know, with a lot less dancing and a bit more drooling.In Iowa, voters had some important questions about the GOP candidates   including  why is Donald Trump so orange,  a question science nor philosophy is likely to answer for decades yet to come.   There is widespread opinion that he either uses tanning beds or a full-body spray to get his bright tangerine finish,  a user on question and answer platform Quora postulated, though Trump is more likely to be found banging his daughter than in a tanning bed.Some wondered if Ted Cruz is from Canada, a query likely stemming from Trump and his fellow Cruz birthers  inane suggestions that Cruz is not eligible to be President.But the dumbest questions were related to Jeb Bush, according to Google. The Washington Post reports:Iowans wondered: Is Jeb Bush related to George W. Bush?   Who are Jeb Bush s parents?   Who is Jeb Bush s father? and Is Jeb Bush George Bush s brother? While no data is available concerning demographics of the folks who asked Almighty Google those ridiculous questions, they likely stem from Republicans  inability to know anything important about candidates they support past their willingness to build multi-billion-dollar walls to keep brown people out of the country, close mosques, and fight tooth-and-nail against women s rights.In any case, that people don t know Jeb and George Bush  are related is nothing short of baffling. Liberals certainly know, as we remember his role in stealing the 2000 election for his brother. This, of course, is something no one would have learned on Fox News. To someone whose primary concern was ensuring that a future war criminal would become President, Jeb Bush was just some guy at the time.Of course, the fact that any Americans don t know even the basics about  Jebra  is probably an indicator that he should join pedophile-worshipping Mike Huckabee and  baby parts  affiche natto Carly Fiorina in dropping out of the presidential race.Featured image via Political Garbage Chute/YouTube",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Conservative Christians Think Girls Are A Crop, Should Be Married Off As Children (IMAGE)","Likening girls to common crops that should be rushed off to the market as soon as possible is a growing belief among conservative  Christians. If you have heard of the Duggar family you ve likely heard of the Quiverfull movement they belong to, which requires Christians to have as many kids as possible, which is why the Duggars have 19 children.But there is another part of the Quiverfull movement that is even creepier.One Quiverfull ministry not only pushes couples to pop out kids like rabbits, they preach that fathers should farm the girls like crops such as apples and give them over to men as early as possible .In other words, this Christian fundamentalist movement believe in child marriage like the ones Americans often are horrified by when we hear stories of little girls being married off to middle-aged men in the Middle East.Their website is called  Let Them Marry,  and one of the first things you would see is a tree shaped missive comparing little girls to apples that must be picked early by the farmer/father and provided to men who are  in need. Girls are like apples on trees. Their fathers are the farmers, whose job is to care for them. He must protect his apples from pests and disease. He must guard them against thieves who may pick his apples prematurely. Neither those at the top nor those at the bottom can help their location. But, when each reaches peak ripeness, it is the farmer s job to harvest that fruit and give it to whom he will, to those in need. So there is nothing wrong with the apples still on the tree and nothing wrong with the boys who seek them. But it is the farmer s duty to provide for both, in due season. Here s the image via Raw Story.A quote from the group leader, Vaughn Ohlman, makes it clear that this pedophilia comes not from the legalization of same-sex marriage like conservatives constantly claim, but directly from religious fanaticism, which former Quiverfull member Vyckie Garrison describes as a  gross  ideology combined with the Christian purity movement in which  the value of a young woman is in her virginity   a consumable commodity owned by her future husband, kept in trust by Daddy. We believe that not only should most people marry, they should marry in their youth. The Bible speaks of the  wife of thy youth  (Prov. 5:18; Is. 54:6; Mal. 2:14-15) and  children of the youth  (Ps. 127:4). Scripture also speaks of not letting children pass the flower of their age (1 Cor. 7:36)   Leaving the physically mature young man struggling with fornication and leaving the physically mature young woman wallowing in fruitless, barren celibacy these are both unscriptural and ungodly actions.In short, this conservative Christian group is a haven for pedophiles who are trying to use religious liberty to justify their sickening desire to marry and rape little girls.Just another example of the Christian Sharia law conservatives are trying to force down our throats.

 What Ted Cruz Said In Church Sounds Like Sharia Law For America (VIDEO),"Presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) visited a South Carolina church on Sunday and in a message broadcast to several other houses of worship, made an argument for a government based on the principles of the religious far right, rather than the American Constitution.Echoing Middle Eastern extremists who believe that the law of God trumps existing laws, Cruz told the crowd what they wanted to hear about where a candidate like himself would take America.Cruz, an avowed evangelical, made his case in front of a packed house of nearly 2,000 churchgoers.His sermon, titled  Faith in Action,  pressed a range of conservative hot buttons, from religious liberty to abortion rights to the Second Amendment.Cruz warned that a  radical   left-wing majority  on the Supreme Court could result in  unlimited abortions on demand across this country   with taxpayer funding and no parental notification. He called the high court s decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide  fundamentally illegitimate, lawless, unconstitutional and wrong. Cruz has previously demonstrated that he believes religious faith trumps the law of the land, with his support for rogue clerk Kim Davis in Kentucky. Cruz was among the woman s most vocal supporters as she refused to grant marriage certificates for same-sex couples, even after the Supreme Court had ruled that same-sex marriages were legal in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.Over his campaign, Cruz has tried to appeal to the faction of conservative Republican voters who have a view of the role of government that is similar to Middle Eastern  sharia,  where religious texts and beliefs have more sway than the written rule of law. Cruz found success, when those voters backed him in the Iowa caucus and led to victory for his campaign. He had a setback with New Hampshire s less religious and more independent primary voters, where he finished in third place. Cruz is hoping that more religious extremist voters in South Carolina will allow him to regain the momentum he may have lost.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black GOP Candidate: Party Bosses Told Me ‘You Sound Too Black’,"Former Republican Party chairman and U.S. Senate candidate Michael Steele, who is black, has made some interesting revelations about what it s like to be a black Republican running for office. Steele spoke to The Huffington Post for their series  Candidate Confessional,  where past candidates reveal the inner workings of their campaigns.Steele notes that while he was the party chairman the RNC took back the house in 2010, but a series of controversies ensured that he would not be re-elected to the position, now held by Reince Priebus who remains party chairman even after the RNC lost in a major way against President Obama in 2012. During his time at the RNC, Steele says members of the committee told him  You sound too black. Steele also explains that it was a  problem  for members of the party that his chief of staff was black. I had a black chief of staff and everyone threw a hissy fit, didn t know how to deal with the brother,  Steele said.  I m like,  Dude, he s a political operative like everybody else. He s a chief of staff. Just deal with him.  But that was a problem. In 2006, Steele attempted to run for Senate in Maryland, eventually losing by 10% to now-Senator Ben Cardin. In that run, Steele was picked to be pushed by the party because he was a black candidate in a state with a large black population. But they had problems finding black staffers for his campaign.Steele, for example, said he knew there d be questions about why there weren t any African Americans on his campaign staff. The reason was easy to explain. The [Republican] party s never taken the time to actually groom blacks to be political operatives, to be campaign managers, political directors, communication directors, finance directors,  Steele said.  So when I have to go as a candidate into a statewide campaign, or even if I m running for local sheriff, what pool of talent am I gonna pull from? I m gonna pull from the established talent that has been developed by the white infrastructure, which is largely white males. In the almost post-Obama era, Steele s revelations almost feel quaint. After the post-2012 election that warned the GOP that they need to appeal to minority voters in order to be a viable presidential party, the GOP has gone even more anti-minority, expressed in the campaign of current Republican front runner Donald Trump, who has egged his supporters on to beat up black protesters while himself smearing the  Black Lives Matter  movement.

" Autopsy Report: SF Cops Shot Man 21 Times, Twice In The Head — He Was No Threat","The cops are out of control. They have appointed themselves judge, jury, and executioner in too many cases to count now, and here is yet another. Police in San Francisco executed a 26-year-old black man, Mario Woods, by shooting him twenty-one times. Two of those shots were to his head, according the an autopsy report obtained by local CBS affiliate KRON-4.In this particular case, San Francisco Chief of Police Greg Suhr did the usual, and lied about a dead man s actions in order cover up the fact that his officers used excessive deadly force against Woods, claiming that the suspect lunged at the officers and refused to drop the knife he was supposedly carrying. Woods was being approached because the cops believed that he had stabbed someone. However, video taken by witnesses reveal otherwise. Woods did not lunge at anyone, and he was outnumbered five to one with armed and trained police officers.Thanks to the medical examiner s report and the fact that the bullet casings from all 27 shots that were fired have been found, the cops have been forced to backtrack on their lies. They are now saying that the current narrative appears to corroborate facts gathered by investigators in the aftermath of this tragic incident.  They went on to say: The department is committed to a thorough review of the shooting and this report will be an important component of all three ongoing independent investigations. The shooting is under investigation by the police department itself, as well as two other independent city agencies, the San Francisco District Attorney s Office, and the San Francisco Office of Citizen Complaints. Likely, they hope to be able to investigate themselves and find that they did nothing wrong. Not so fast on this one, though.The Mayor of San Francisco, Ed Lee, has inquired of the Department of Justice and Attorney General Loretta Lynch for a federal investigation into this deadly shooting. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors want an investigation into not only this police shooting, but those of two other black men who were shot and killed by San Francisco cops. That Blue Wall of Silence won t help ya on this one, boys.Mario Woods  mother, Gwendolyn Woods, has also filed a wrongful death suit against the city. Her attorney, John Burris, says of the situation: The fact is he was shot in the back. The significance to me is most of the officers who were shooting were not being threatened at the time they fired those weapons. Of course, the cops and the city are trying to paint Mario Woods in a bad light, saying in their response to Mrs. Woods  lawsuit that her son advanced abruptly toward the officers  and an armed and dangerous suspect in a violent felony. But John Burris isn t buying that, and says that Woods was not a threat to the lives of the officers, despite the fact that the city says that those cops were in the right. But Burris says: You know you can t just use deadly force against someone who is not threatening you. And that is the bottom line. In this case, and so many others, cops use deadly force not because it was warranted, but because they can, and then they get their stories straight and cover it up. That is absolutely despicable, and yet in so many cases they get away with it.Sue the hell out of them, Mrs. Woods. I hope you have their badges, too.Featured image from video screen capture via Filming Cops",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This List Proves Republicans Are Damned LIARS About Obama’s Replacement For Scalia,"As you may have heard, virtually every Republican in the nation is spewing over the fact that America will be destroyed if Obama replaces Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. Their excuse to block any nominee until after the next election is what s known as the  Thurmond Rule.  Named after the amazingly racist Strom Thurmond, this isn t a real rule. It s only an opinion that a president shouldn t nominate a SCOTUS replacement in the last 6 months of their term.Yes, you are correct in what you just thought. Obama isn t ANYWHERE NEAR his last 6 months. But, when have things like facts stopped Republicans before?The reeking hypocrisy of Republicans on this issue is amazing. Not only is the  rule  they are using not an actual rule, but it doesn t even fit the facts of the situation. But wait, it gets far better. Republicans have said that for the past 80 years, we have not had SCOTUS appointments during the end of a president s term. Let s fact check that, shall we?Frank Murphy (1940) and Anthony Kennedy (1988), have   in the last 80 years   been appointed during the last year of a presidential term. There are 14 final year appointments total in the history of the United States, so to say it s some kind of  rule  is blatantly stupid.The full list is as follows: Oliver Ellsworth, 1796   Samuel Chase, 1796   William Johnson, 1804   Philip Barbour, 1836   Roger Taney, 1836   Melville Fuller, 1888   Lucius Lamar,   1888 George Shiras, 1892   Mahlon Pitney, 1912   John Clarke, 1916   Louis Brandeis, 1916   Benjamin Cardozo, 1932   Frank Murphy, 1940 and Anthony Kennedy, 1988.For now, let s focus on Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy was appointed during the last year of Ronald Reagan s term. Here is where Republican hypocrisy really goes wild.Mitch McConnell could be considered the head Republican cheerleader for the effort to block any nominee that Obama makes to replace Scalia. McConnell cited this rule, talking all about how it should be up to the American people to vote for a president who will make a nominee   giving the people a  voice  in the decision. How did Mitch McConnell vote on Anthony Kennedy? McConnell voted to confirm Anthony Kennedy, along with practically every other Republican on the list at that point. Where was his outrage back then?Senator Chuck Grassley made a huge stink out of voting in a replacement SCOTUS judge as well, saying it was standard practice  to not confirm SCOTUS nominee in an election year. You already guessed it. Grassley voted for Anthony Kennedy as well. Why did he do this when it wasn t standard practice, as he said?This ultra-stupid phenomenon is not only limited to old-school senators. Marco Rubio was asked both during the recent debate and by Chuck Todd this same question about a SCOTUS appointment. It was pointed out to him that Reagan appointed Kennedy in 87 during his last year. Marco responded: It doesn t really matter what Reagan did back in  87. I think the president should allow the next president to appoint the justice to the Supreme Court, and if it s me   and I anticipate that it will be   I m going to look for someone in the mold of Justice Scalia, who while irreplaceable, I think is a model jurist and one of the great jurists in American history. Source: Crooks and LiarsMarco really is being the most honest out of everyone.  It doesn t matter what Republicans do.  Frank, to the point and honest. Republicans don t care about rules or precedent. They just want to have a chance to stack the Supreme Court so they can destroy the last bits of America that are available to everyone, regardless of class.Featured image from Youtube",News,"February 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives Will HATE What Donald Trump Just Said About Planned Parenthood (VIDEO),"Donald Trump isn t exactly a stranger to making large groups of people angry   women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, and mainstream Republicans all despise The Donald. One group, however, has always strongly supported him   the Stupid Part of America   and he s about to lose them, too. Trump s popularity with conservatives has soared since he began screaming about a god he will never actually understand, baby parts, and other favorite talking points of theirs   but his recent remarks about Planned Parenthood may lose him a lot of support among the segment of the population who are dumb enough to fall for heavily-edited propaganda videos.At the insanely heated GOP debate, Ted Cruz managed to trick The Donald into defending Planned Parenthood. During one of the screaming matches between Trump and Cruz that have become rather commonplace, the Texas Senator accused the billionaire of supporting federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Eventually, he managed to goad Trump into supporting Planned Parenthood, though The Donald still spoke out against abortion. But let me say more blunt Donald you notice didn t agree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood and Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record he screams  Liar! Liar! Liar! ,  Cruz said, pointing out that Trump has, in the past, said Planned Parenthood does  wonderful things.  Trump replied: It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion. There are wonderful things having to do with women s health, but not when it comes to abortion. Planned Parenthood absolutely does do wonderful things. But unlike Trump s assertion, those wonderful things include giving women access to a safe, sanitary abortion if they choose to have one. Planned Parenthood also provides numerous irreplaceable services to women that have nothing at all to do with abortion, as well as informs women of alternatives to terminating a pregnancy   like adoption. In fact, only three percent of the organization s services are abortion-related.Unfortunately for Trump, this moment of honesty about Planned Parenthood will haunt him right up until election day   because conservatives simply don t care about women.Watch the exchange below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Alex Jones POSITIVE Obama Killed Scalia, And You’ll Never Believe Who He Thinks Is Next (VIDEO)","There s crazy and then there s nonsensical, conspiratorial, out of your head, paranoid with a tinfoil hat on your head, curled in the fetal position in your mom s basement crazy. The latter would be radio talk show host Alex Jones.Not only does he believe that President Obama somehow secretly had Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia killed, a man who was 79-years-old and a known smoker and we know died of natural causes, but now he believes that the president has plans for other people as well. You know, so Obama can finally unleash his true intentions for the nation. After all, he still hasn t come for anyone s guns or forced us all to be Muslim  yet.Jones declared in a morbid Facebook post,  this is the season of treason, this is the time of betrayal and we would be fools not to ask the question.  Which clearly begs the question, who is allowing Alex Jones to have any sort of internet privileges? He s more than lost his mind, he s replaced it with a new bag of nuts.However, he goes on: You just get used to this,  Scalia found, it s natural, nothing going on here, he just died naturally. And you re like,  Whoa. Red flag.  Then you realize, Obama is one vote away from being able to ban guns, open the borders and actually have the court engage in its agenda and now Scalia dies. I mean, this is hard core I wonder if Clarence Thomas will die of a heart attack next week. If this is an assassination, it signifies that they re dropping the hammer, that s the canary in the coal mine. Wait! There s more! Are they going to kill Clarence Thomas? Maybe they ll kill Ron Paul. Maybe they ll kill Donald Trump next. They all had heart attacks. How many more of these are we going to sit here and put up with? Or maybe their airplane blows up. Someone needs to tell this guy to relax. However, he adds: My gut tells me they killed him and all the intellectual evidence lays it out. The only thing his gut indicates is that he s had one too many cheeseburgers.He then goes on to insist that Republicans need to block anyone Obama nominates, because if they don t liberals are going to destroy the Constitution and start a civil war. He literally believes Obama is coming after everyone.Jones has said a lot of crazy things in his career, but this may take the cake. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Breaking: Justice Scalia Murdered?Posted by Alex Jones on Saturday, February 13, 2016Featured image: screencap",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" KY Gov. Matt Bevin Slashes Funding For Ethics Investigations, Elections Oversight","Kentucky governor Matt Bevin recently introduced a budget proposal that will virtually eliminate the agency designed to investigate corruption in his own office.Bevin s budget includes deep cuts to the state s Executive Branch Ethics Commission. The agency, which was created in the 1990 s, was formed in response to an FBI investigation which led to the indictments of almost two-dozen members of the state legislature.According to Katie Gabhart, the executive director of the Executive Branch Ethics Commission, the budget cuts will essentially hamstring the agency. We will be an investigative and auditing agency with no investigator and auditor,  Gabhart told state lawmakers, who are deliberating on the budget proposal this week .  Public servants are going to violate the ethics code   and if they know we have an ethics commission with so few resources that we can t enforce the code, then what is the point of having one? Also included in the proposed budget cuts is funding for the state s Registry of Election Finance.As the name of the agency implies, the office is charged with monitoring political campaigns and enforcing campaign finance laws in Kentucky.John Steffen, Executive Director of the Registry of Election Finance, told lawmakers that the governor s proposed budget cuts would leave the office without the ability to hire an auditor.State lawmakers responded by suggesting that the law could be changed so that some candidates would not be required to file campaign disclosures.In response, Steffen said I don t know what statutory obligations can be changed and not render our entire agency meaningless. Bevin was elected governor of Kentucky in November of 2015, amid accusations of election rigging. Bevin holds the distinction of being one of only three non-democratic governors to hold office in Kentucky since WWII.Prior to assuming the position of governor, Bevin was best known for delivering a political speech at a cockfighting rally in 2014, before losing an embarrassing senate race to Mitch McConnell.He later gained national attention when he praised Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, after she refused to provide marriage licenses to LGBT couples.It should come as no surprise that Bevin s budget seeks to slash the very agency which was created to investigate ethics violations committed in his own office.We saw the same thing from former Texas governor Rick Perry, another politicians with close ties to the Koch-backed Tea Party, in 2013.Nor should it be any surprise that the budget would virtually eliminate campaign finance oversight.The cuts are clearly designed to give corrupt Tea Party politicians like himself free reign in the state, without fear of political or legal repercussions.Image credit: Gage Skidmore, via Flckr ",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Report: Scalia’s Death Was As Natural As The Love Between Two Men,"Conservatives have been floating the ridiculous theory that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered. Somehow, they are unable to comprehend how an obese 79-year-old smoker with a history of heart problems could possibly die after a day of hunting, partying, and gorging on food   and their irrational hatred of Barack Obama has instead led them to believe that the President had Scalia murdered.In an email to Addicting Info, one conservative summed up the paranoia quite nicely:Let s look at facts. Two to three cases before the Supreme Court involved Obama or an Obama agency such as the DOJ. Scalia was the most conservative Justice on the Court and would have been that fifth vote to say what Obama did was unconstitutional therefore Scalia gone he puts a liberal justice nomination with the hope either the Senate confirms now or Democrats take over the Senate next year (which is expected).Presidents throughout our history have been known to use the CIA to commit assassinations. In the 1970s the CIA showed Congress a gun that shot a frozen dart inside a person and melted poison causing a heart attack. With the new technology we have I think they can do better than a 9mm gun. Comparing to what happen in Russia. Putin had an ex kgb agent killed in a similar way. The ex kgb agent was with a group of  friends  then suddenly felt ill after talking with someone. It was ruled natural causes. Then a UK court recently said he was possibly murdered.Here s another problem. The DOJ is not allowing Texas authorities to investigate. With the DOJ being a party to a case and yes Texas being a party against them to a case, the DOJ would have incentive to cover it up.So yes the theory is not so far fetched.ThanksFranklin StrumAfter we mocked him a bit, Sturm pointed out that:Presidents have throughout history used the CIA to commit political assassinations. And the technology that I mentioned is on unclassified record the CIA had in the 1970s, technology is better now. Even liberals don t trust the CIA. As for Obama himself he had everything to gain from Scalia s death. Nothing would stop him from ordering an assassination as nothing stopped Presidents prior.This, of course, is just one of the many, many theories surrounding how and why President Obama had the elderly man killed, but conservatives like Mr. Sturm will undoubtedly be relieved to know that Scalia actually died of natural causes. USA Today reports that the official cause of death is, indeed, a myocardial infarction   also known as a simple heart attack.Texas Judge Cinderela Guevara says she was called by a county sheriff Saturday because the two justices of the peace were out of town: As part of my investigation, one of the things I did ask the sheriff and the U.S. Marshal:  Were there any signs of foul play?  And they said,  Absolutely not.  At that time I still wanted to be careful, and asked them if (Scalia s) physician would call me. The justice s personal doctor called her at 8 p.m. Saturday night. She said the physician told her that Scalia had a shoulder problem last week and underwent an MRI. Scalia also suffered several chronic ailments, Guevara said. I felt comfortable what I knew was going on with him physically,  she said.That s right   no poison ice darts, no ninja gerbils, no death rays, or any of the other imbecilic ideas conservatives have had since Scalia was found dead in his bed Saturday morning. A simple heart attack.Conservatives have been defiantly refusing to confirm anyone President Obama nominates  but the President has vowed to get a nomination through, no matter what they say. While this is, alongside being part of their continuing effort to stand in Obama s way on every single issue, an effort to show support for the deceased Justice, conservatives are going against Scalia s wishes in refusing all nominees until they can (they hope) get a Republican in office.Scalia, for all his many, many, many, many faults, completely disagreed with politicizing Supreme Court nominations while he was alive   something the Right will ignore in their continuing war on Obama and sanity.Featured image via NY Times",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 PROOF Republicans Claiming Obama Shouldn’t Pick Supreme Court Justice Are Hypocrites (QUOTES),"It really seems as if Republicans don t think the things they say and do are recorded. It s as though they only live in the moment and history ceases to exist. Because if they realize the things they say and do are recorded they would know that we could throw what they ve said and done back in their faces, like with what is about to happen.You see, Republicans are hellbent in making sure President Obama doesn t nominate anyone to become the next Supreme Court Justice of the United States after the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even went so far as to say,  The American people  should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.  And don t forget Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley insisting we wait until next year to fill the vacant seat. He said: The fact of the matter is that it s been standard practice over the last nearly 80 years that Supreme Court nominees are not nominated and confirmed during a presidential election year. Given the huge divide in the country, and the fact that this president, above all others, has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent Congress and push through his own agenda, it only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court justice. However, what both these Republicans fail to realize, alongside all the other conservatives and conservative pundits who share this opinion, is that it is the president s constitutional duty to nominate a new Justice so that order and balance is held within all three branches of government. It is also not their place to say that he can t. Truth is, they don t want him to, because they re terrified of who he might pick to replace the ultra-conservative Scalia.Here s the thing about history, though   it will come back to bite you when you least expect it, and prove that you may, in fact, be a huge hypocrite. Here are some quotes from back when former President George W. Bush was trying to get a vote on his nominees. And you may recognize a couple of the names: Because of the unprecedented obstruction of our Democratic colleagues, the Republican conference intends to restore the principle that, regardless of party, any President s judicial nominees, after full debate, deserve a simple up -or -down vote.    Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) (5/19/05) I hope that by the end of this session of Congress, my colleagues will give the President s qualified nominees what they, and all current and future nominees deserve: the opportunity to have a fair up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate on their nomination. For the sake of the Senate, the nation, and our independent judiciary, I hope that these partisans will not launch more filibusters, but from what I ve heard today, I won t hold my breath.    Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) (3/26/04) The bottom line has to be that the president has the right to get a vote, an up-or-down vote, on his nominees.    Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) (11/10/04) Let s debate the nominees and give our advice and consent. It is a simple  yea  or  nay,  when called to the altar to vote. Filibustering a nominee into oblivion is misguided warfare and the wrong way for a minority party to leverage influence in the Senate. Threatening to grind legislative activity to a standstill if they do not get their way is like being a bully on the school yard playground. Let s do our jobs. Nothing is nuclear about asking the full Senate to take an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees. It is the way the Senate has operated for 214 years.    Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) (5/23/05) But denying these patriotic Americans, of both parties, who seek to serve this country an up-or-down vote is simply not fair, and it certainly was not the intention of our Founding Fathers when they designed and created this very institution.    Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) (4/20/05) Every nominee deserves a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.   Dick Cheney (5/10/04)And if this truly how all these men felt at the moment, then they should still feel that way now. They should abide by the constitution, allowing President Obama to make his picks, as well as give him an up-or-down vote on who he decides would be the best fit. Only reasonable, right? You know, since it s their idea.Featured image: Flickr",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Just Said The Dumbest Thing About President Obama And The Internet Is Letting Them Have It,"It was appalling but not exactly surprising to see the way Republicans responded to the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The party that has increasingly defined itself solely on its opposition to President Obama once again immediately declared that they would not allow him to fulfill his constitutional obligations of appointing a new Justice.Obama, no doubt tired of this obstructionism after seven long years of it, basically told them to shove it. He would be nominating a justice whether they liked it or not.However, in the coverage of this potentially era-defining new appointment, CNN managed to stick its foot so far into its mouth that it s a wonder they didn t just cut to commercial and never come back.Dana Bash was discussing the Republican opposition to a new nominee appointed by President Obama and in her rush to be  fair  to  both sides,  she wound up feeding right into the right-wing talking points that serious journalists might scoff at. When asked about President Obama s decision to go ahead with a nomination, Bash remarked:That s right. And as we were talking about last hour, that is not surprising in the least, since he clearly feels that it is his constitutional duty to do so. That he is the President of the United States. It is his job to nominate somebody.He  clearly feels  it s his constitutional duty? What? It is his constitutional duty to appoint new justices. That s put in simple terms in Constitution itself. Saying this is Obama s opinion is disingenuous. But Bash was only just warming up:He still will be technically the president of the United States for the next 11 months, which is a very, very long time. Yes, we are in an election year, but we are barely into this election year of 2016. So you have Republicans coming back, not just Mitch McConnell who you just mentioned, but the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee saying that he believes that it is standard practice to not deal with such issues in an election year. Technically  he will be president of the United States. Technically. You might want to tell that to the people who voted for him for a full four year term.Needless to say, the internet was not pleased. CNN may have wanted to avoid offending conservatives, but they managed to offend nearly everyone else. He still will be technically the pres. of the US for another 11 months.    CNN. Technically?  John Aravosis (@aravosis) February 14, 2016I'll accept this definition if CNN's talking heads state that they're ""technically"" reporters. https://t.co/piXBmK9ATS  Ferrett Steinmetz (@ferretthimself) February 14, 2016Did CNN actually say Technically President? Did they really? https://t.co/uEnXN74OSU  Anthony (@ThatWeirdGuy77) February 14, 2016Hey @CNN he's not TECHNICALLY the President, he's ACTUALLY the President. Stop parroting right wing stupidity.  Ben Cisco (@BenCisco) February 14, 2016The issue wasn t just a slip of the tongue, it was that CNN was pretending that the Republican beef with Obama s nomination had to do with anything other than political point scoring. For many years, the policy of mainstream media outlets has been to tread lightly on partisan issues to avoid alienating viewers. This might help keep ratings up, but it s not a way to accurately report the news. There are times when things are just WRONG.In the case of Republicans now saying Obama can t appoint a justice because it is an election year, history and the law say otherwise. It s time for reporters to own that.By contrast, debate moderator John Dickerson stood up to Sen. Ted Cruz when he tried to flat-out lie about Supreme Court appointments. Asked to back up his claims with facts, Cruz was left speechless, the Republican audience booed Dickerson, but the American people were informed. It was a highlight of the election.Feature image via YouTube",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Fox Attacks Sanders, Says Rich Kids Deserve Free College Because ‘Their Parents Worked Hard’","Fox News continues to outdo itself for its incompetent so-called journalism. A Fox News host said that Bernie Sanders is basically a communist for wanting free college tuition for young Americans. While the host has no clue to what a communist is, what the host said about millions of Americans was the true insult.In a startling display of disdain for middle and lower-income Americans, Fox host Gretchen Carlson said that if rich kids get to go to school on their parents  dime, then it s because  their parents worked incredibly hard : Where he said, you know, poor people should be able to go to college free, like rich kids. Free?  If that s actually true, quite possibly their parents worked incredibly hard to be able to pay for them, the full ride to go to college! What her silly statement implies is that parents of kids who can t afford to send them to college without assistance means that they are not hard workers. The shear arrogance is striking. How much money a person makes is not indicative of whether he/she works hard! The shear stupidity coupled with arrogance is very disturbing. It s puzzling how such people can have a platform on television.The host also went on to demean younger generations for supporting Bernie Sanders. Alarmed by the overwhelming support Sanders has received from young voters, Carlson dismisses them as lacking an understanding in what she believed were Sanders  communist policies. She said:  We have fought wars! Men and women have died in this country to fight against communism and many of these same principles, quite honestly   Katherine, I mean, it s astounding. The more these people continue to spew such nonsense, the more obvious it is why Sanders has enormous popular appeal to Americans. It s time to give the American Dream back to everyone and not a select few.Watch Here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8DKt6MhUGo]Featured Image via Screen Capture",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Top Ten Reasons We NEED A Liberal Supreme Court,"One way or another, the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will change the course of American history.Scalia s death leaves the court with eight justices, four liberal and four conservative.The next justice appointment has the potential to determine the nature of the court for years to come. While a liberal justice will tip the balance in favor of progressive and liberal ideas, a conservative justice, like Scalia or worse, will tip the balance in the opposite direction.As we ve seen in recent years, decisions made the Supreme Court impact the lives of American citizens in critical ways.While there are an infinite number of reasons that we need a liberal court, here are the top ten issues most likely to be impacted by a change in the political balance of the court in the near future1. LaborLabor unions and the rights of American workers are facing constant attacks, both from billion-dollar corporations and the right-wing state politicians who represent their interests.In the immediate future, a liberal court could influence the outcome of Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case which has the potential to cripple organized labor in the U.S.The was argued before the Supreme Court in January, 2016, but a ruling has not been handed down by the court. In the case that the court s ruling was a 5-4 decision, the case will have to be heard again, once a replacement for Scalia has been appointed.2. Separation of Church and StateOn Tuesday, February 9, Rabbi Adele Plotkin was removed from a meeting of the Chino Valley, Arizona City Council. His crime? Protesting the council s on-going prayers in the name of Jesus.In defense of their actions, the council cited the Supreme Court s ruling in Greece v Galloway. In December 2013, the court ruled 5-4 that government officials in the town of Greece, New York, did not violate the Establishment Clause by opening meetings with Christian prayers.In May of 2014, the justices reversed their opinion in the case, even as many arguments remained unsettled.To understand just how  not settled  the case actually is, here s the overview from the 2014 case update:Judgment: Reversed, 5-4, in an opinion by Justice Kennedy on May 5, 2014. Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join the majority opinion except as to Part II-B. Justice Alito filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Scalia joined. Justice Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Scalia joined as to Part II. Justice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Kagan filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor joined.This case is just one of many with the potential to erode or destroy the Establishment Clause, which prevents public resources from being used to promote religious doctrine, and protects all Americans from being forced to accept the religious beliefs of whoever happens to be running their local, state or federal government on any given day.3. LGBT DiscriminationOn June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court issued its historical ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, otherwise known as the  gay marriage decision. Since that decision, right-wing nuts across America have attempted to enshrine discrimination against the LGBT community into local, state and even federal law.Under the guise of religious freedom, conservatives have attempted to get away with everything from refusing service to gay couples to firing LGBT employees in the name of Jesus.As we ve seen in recent years, there s no end to right-wing creativity, when it comes to anti-gay discrimination. Whether they re trying to ban sodomy and oral sex or illegally refusing to sign marriage licenses, LGBT rights remain under attack all across the country.A liberal Supreme Court is of monumental importance in protecting the LGBT community from religious bigotry and anti-gay bias.4. Money in PoliticsA liberal court could open the door to restoring the integrity of U.S. elections.The disastrous Supreme Court ruling in the 2010 Citizens United Case has allowed unlimited amounts of corporate money to flow into our political system.In a 5-4 decision, the conservative court ruled that money is a form of speech. Under the pretense, the court found that limiting the amount of money flowing through the political system equates to suppression of speech on the part of the government.While the American public overwhelmingly disapproved of the court s decision in the Citizens United case, as long as the court maintains a conservative bias, there s little chance that the ruling will be overturned.There is plenty of room to challenge the decision with a liberal leaning court.5. Women s RightsThe rise of the Tea Party in America has brought with it an unprecedented number of attacks of women s rights.From state-enforced vaginal ultrasounds to disturbing attempts to exclude pregnant women from healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the right wing war on women threatens the health and well being of more than 50 percent of the American population.At stake in America is every woman s right to life, along with her right to self-determination and body autonomy. As the right wing continues to try to give more rights to a zygote than the woman whose body it inhabits, a liberal court is a critical last line of defense against these attacks.6. EnvironmentLess than a week ago, a 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court temporarily blocked President Obama s climate change regulations from taking effect.As the New York Times reported on February 9,The 5-to-4 vote, with the court s four liberal members dissenting, was unprecedented   the Supreme Court had never before granted a request to halt a regulation before review by a federal appeals court.At stake here is much more than whether or not the president s efforts to reduce carbon emissions will become a reality.The case, brought by representatives of the fossil fuel industry, challenges the Environmental Protection Agency s right to create and enforce environmental regulations at all.7. HealthcareAfter years of legislative and legal battles over the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court finally upheld the Constitutionality of President Obama s signature healthcare law in 2012.But this decision has not stopped right-wing fanatics from attacking various parts of the law, bringing case after case to the Supreme Court, in an attempt to undermine the court s original decision.As recently as January, 2016, the court refused to hear another challenge to the law. The challenge was filed by an artist who said that being forced to pay for healthcare violates his rights. He was joined by Sens. John Cornyn (Texas) and Mike Lee (Utah), and right-wing nut Ted Cruz wrote an absurd amicus brief in support of the case.While a more liberal-leaning court will likely dissuade further attempts to overturn the law, the opposite would be true if Scalia were somehow replaced with a right-wing extremist.8. Voting RightsIn June of 2013, a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court struck down the most important provisions of the Voting Rights Act.What s more, in a string of cases brought before the court in 2014, the conservative majority consistently ruled in favor of those who sought to restrict voting rights, rather than expand them.Rulings made it possible for states to introduce voter ID laws, although it s long been established that such laws negatively impact people of color. The same justices ruled in favor of allowing states to restrict early voting and restrict voter access to the polls.A liberal leaning court is vital to protecting and restoring the right of every citizen to participate in elections.9. ImmigrationIn January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to President Obama s executive actions on immigration.As the New York Times reports here, when agreeing to hear the case,The justices raised the possibility of a broad decision by taking the unusual step of adding their own question to the case, asking the parties to address whether Mr. Obama had violated his constitutional obligations to enforce the nation s laws. The answer to that question could significantly alter the scope of presidential power in realms far beyond immigration.Confident that the court s conservative majority would find cause to rule against the Constitutional authority of a liberal, Black president, the five right-leaning justices had clearly planned to take the lead in the case.The outcome of the case is likely to be entirely different, however, with a liberal-leaning majority.10. PoliceThe Supreme Court is regularly charged with the duty of defining what police can and cannot do under the Constitution.The five justices that made up the court s conservative majority have given police more and more leeway.For example, in June of 2015, the court expanded the rights of law enforcement officers to perform warrantless searches.Prior to that, the court ruled that a police officer cannot be held liable for violating a citizen s rights, as long as the officer claims he didn t know law.The court also granted immunity to police officers who shot a mentally ill woman inside a healthcare facility.While it s questionable that the addition of a liberal justice would influence the outcome of cases involving law enforcement, it certainly can t make the situation worse. Unfortunately, even some of the supposedly liberal justices currently on the court have sided with conservatives, helping to expand the rights of police, which necessarily means narrowing the rights of ordinary citizens.As stated earlier, these issues are by no means the only ones that will likely be impacted a shift in the political leanings of the court.President Obama has vowed to appoint a replacement for Justice Scalia, in spite of threats of obstruction from the republicans in Congress.Given that many of the policies that the president has fought for over the past eight years hang in the balance, there s little doubt that he will find a way to ensure that a liberal justice is appointed in Scalia s stead.Image credit: wikimedia commons",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 A Mole In The White House Just Revealed Obama’s SCOTUS Pick – Even The GOP Can’t Deny It (IMAGE),"Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton, and a very reputable source at that, just came forward and announced there is a mole in the White House. And, that mole has information concerning President Obama s selection of the next Supreme Court Justice of The United States (SCOTUS).As you may know by now, Republicans are hell-bent on doing anything and everything they can to block Obama s right to nominate the next SCOTUS, no matter who he picks. Well, that s going to be a problem because this pick is absolutely perfect.Why do we say that? For one, Republicans unanimously nominated him just three years ago (97-0) to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Yes, you read that right, 97-0. How on earth could the Republicans deny him now? If you re familiar with the selection, you d know I m talking about Judge Sri Srinivasan. He s Asian-American and Indian-American, and would be the first minority from both groups to hold the honor if nominated.But, his minority status is not the only reason he s an excellent choice for Democrats. He d be almost impossible for the GOP to deny. But, don t plan on them not trying. I mean, they just don t care who Obama nominates, plain and simple. This is an election year, and they ll fight him at all costs.Still, his record is hard to deny. Obama has called him  a trailblazer who personifies the best of America.  He s worked in the Justice Department under George W. Bush for five years, and twelve former Solicitors General, including Republicans, have endorsed his prior nomination despite his arguing against conservative causes like the Defense of Marriage Act. He didn t think it was constitutional given the fact that it placed limits on same-sex couples.Pic via Facebook.While the pick is far from finalized, you can be sure to take this pick to the bank. Don t expect President Obama to twiddle his thumbs for too long on this one. He s ready for a fight, and will pick the best nominee, without a doubt.But, just in case you re curious, a few other unofficial names are floating around that would be great nominees as well, and are rumored to be on Obama s short-list.Patricia Ann MillettShe also hails from the influential D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Senate confirmed her back in 2013 by a vote of 56-38. Not nearly as impressive as Judge Srinivasan s unanimous selection, but still a contender given her background. She s 50 and has a background working in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.Here s why she would be a wise choice: There s only one other woman that has ever argued more cases before the Supreme Court (32 in all) than her. Impressive, indeed.Loretta LynchShe s the Attorney General of The United States. She s only been in the position since April 2015, not very long. While we don t believe Obama will pick her, it d be impossible not to have her name mentioned.In the short time that she s been Attorney General, she s already filed a discrimination lawsuit against the city of Ferguson and indicted nine FIFA executives for their match-fixing scandal. If Obama picks a woman, it will be the third woman in a row nominated to the court.Paul WatfordSome people are saying this is the most likely selection to replace Antonin Scalia, but then again, they don t have a mole in the White House like Robert Reich does.Watford is an African-American and confirmed to the Ninth Circuit in 2012. He used to clerk for a conservative judge Alex Kozinski, and he s considered to be a moderate. He s also in his 40 s, which would make him a long standing member of the court if selected.Again, though, we stress that none of these nominees were unanimously selected like Judge Srinivasan. Expect Obama to go forward with the selection after his administration can gather up enough information on Republican s opposition to him. Hey, that s what moles are good for.Featured image via White House",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Watch Out, Clarence Thomas: Petition Asks President Obama To Nominate Anita Hill For SCOTUS","Conservatives would be so pissed if this actually happened.In what would perhaps be the most entertaining Supreme Court nominating process in American history, a petition is circulating asking President Obama to nominate Anita Hill to replace recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the bench.Hill is most remembered for her courageous testimony against current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings in 1991. Hill testified that Thomas made unwanted sexual advances toward her during his stint as supervisor at the Department of Education. Despite her passing a lie detector test while he refused to take one, the Senate still confirmed Thomas 52-48 in the narrowest margin since the 1800s after other women were denied the chance to testify in support of Hill.Thomas and his conservative supporters, of course, demonized Hill, accusing her of being used by white liberals to cut down an  uppity black  with a  high-tech lynching. But while Hill may seem to be a controversial choice to fill Scalia s seat on the high court, it s not out of the realm of possibility, nor does she lack the qualifications.Hill is an experienced attorney who also serves as University Professor of Social Policy, Law, and Women s Studies at Brandeis University. The 59-year-old attended Oklahoma State University and Yale Law School. She is one of the most prominent experts in her field and certainly possesses the legal and academic chops to serve on the Supreme Court.Furthermore, there has never been an African-American woman on the Court, which makes this an opportunity to make history with a much needed change. What better way to replace a racist misogynist like Scalia than with an educated black woman who specializes in social policy?Not only that, just imagine how uncomfortable her nomination would make Clarence Thomas feel. He d probably be sweating bullets while watching and hoping the nomination process eliminates her as the nominee. And it would be incredibly hard for conservatives to grill her without reminding the American public of how big of creep Thomas is. And if Republicans are too hard on her, they can be the ones accused of a  high-tech lynching  of an  uppity black  woman as they let their sexism and racism fly during hearings that would would likely be nationally televised and strewn across social media.And even if Hill fails to be confirmed, it would make Republicans look like the terrible lawmakers and human beings that they are, all while embarrassing the hell out of Thomas, who may even end up feeling too exposed to remain on the Court. And if she does get confirmed, he might resign anyway or at the very least be forced to watch as the woman he harassed and humiliated over 20 years ago puts on the same black robe to help the American people in a way he has refused to do throughout his own tenure. She could end up being the social justice crusader women and minorities have hoped for and become more revered than Scalia and Thomas could ever hope to be.As the petition says,  Now THAT S Justice!

 INSANE Bundy Supporter: Conservatives Ready To ‘Lynch Obama Publicly’ (VIDEO),"Ever since the end of the ridiculous exercise in futility and extremism that was the armed occupation of a federal bird sanctuary in Oregon, conservatives have been screaming from the rooftops that the evil federal government is persecuting patriots. Sure, the militants repeatedly declared war on the federal government. Sure, they were establishing a colony of armed and dangerous insurgents, many of whom couldn t legally own guns in the first place. Sure, they were surrounding themselves with children they intended to use as human shields. Sure, they resisted demands from locals that they leave and spent most of their time begging for free stuff and disturbing historical artifacts.This anti-government effort cost one person   a violent and dangerous individual whose foster children (or, as he called them, his primary source of sweet, sweet dollar signs) were taken from him after he abandoned them to join the Revolution   his life. Dozens of the terrorists are now facing upwards of a decade in prison, including the original Welfare Cowboy, Cliven Bundy, who attempted to join the occupation after most insurgents had turned tail and fled.A message from  darmour88  to the  Harney county, oregon (burns) intel channel of messaging app Zello reveals that conservatives have more in mind than simply hanging out with a bunch of ducks   they want to  lynch  the President:Like, I woke up this morning I woke up and went down to the coffee shop and sat around with a bunch of old ranchers and a bunch of people from the area this morning and had some discussions with them and all I can say is they re all ready to march into that White House and take that son of a bitch and lynch him publicly. And that s a matter of fact.The message seems to be from a man by the name of Dustin Armour, who uses the same username and photo on Facebook as the Zello account from which the message originated. Armour loves his Confederate flag, hate  blacks,  and proudly supports domestic terrorist LaVoy Finicum, who was shot by federal agents after he attempted to pull a gun on them.    According to his OKCupid profile, Armour has no problem with  someone who has vocalized a strong negative bias toward a certain race of people,  he has no problem with racist jokes, and he is an  all around redneck  who loves  a good horror movie and some snacks    the latter bit, of course, being something that would make him quite popular with the Oregon terrorists, who also love snacks. Posts to right-wing extremist groups reveal that Armour also believes the government controls the weather:Conservatives are crazy   especially the ones who are stupid enough to support armed terrorists. But to suggest that the President should be  lynched  is an unfortunate position for them to take, no matter what their political leanings.Listen to the clip below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans May Force Democrats To Use THIS Extreme Tactic To Appoint Obama Nominee,"The GOP has obstructed President Obama at every turn since he set foot in the Oval Office. They hate the man with a passion, and will stop at nothing   including the destruction of the country   in order to ensure anything Obama might do fails. That fact is why it comes as no surprise that, in the wake of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death, the GOP is busily and openly vowing to make sure no Obama appointee gets onto the court.The thing is, though, it is entirely possible for the Republicans to have their way on this one. The nominee would have to be confirmed by the Senate, which is controlled by the GOP. Therefore, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can delay the confirmation until President Obama is out of office. Hell, he can delay as along he likes, actually, as long as the GOP controls the Senate. Ted Cruz, for his part, has vowed to block anyone Obama might put up for the position, and he is sure to have the full backing of his fellow Republican Senators.There is a catch here, though, for the Democrats. Senator Chuck Schumer, who is set to succeed Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid in 2017, is furious with Cruz and McConnell for their plans of blatant obstruction, and he said so on live television Sunday morning. That s not all, either. If Schumer wants, he can go ahead and remove the option of filibusters for presidential appointments to the Supreme Court. Filibusters have already been removed as an option for other appointments made by sitting presidents, but not for SCOTUS appointments. This would be disastrous for the GOP, because it means they would be powerless to stop any appointments made to the court by the next (Hopefully Democratic) president.Think about that   people stay on the Supreme Court for decades, literally. If Schumer does this, the GOP is doomed for at least two generations. Now, this tactic is extreme. Democrats are not extremists, and we don t like to threaten our right-wing counterparts. However, they are forcing our hands on this one. If this happens, it will be no one but the obstructionist Republicans  faults. The sitting president has the constitutional right to make Supreme Court appointments.They are willing to let a Supreme Court seat sit empty and block all Obama appointees   no matter who they might be   for a full 300+ days, all for spite, the cost to the nation be damned. That right there is an extreme measure, and it pretty much forces an extreme response.Likely, Schumer doesn t want to go to extremes, but since the GOP seems unwilling to budge on this one, he most likely should.Featured image from video screen capture",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chuck Schumer DESTROYS Ted Cruz Over Vow To Block Obama SCOTUS Nominee (VIDEO),"Senator Chuck Schumer ( D- NY) is furious with Ted Cruz, and with good reason. Like many Republicans, Cruz has helped circle the wagons in the wake of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and has promised to block anyone President Obama might appoint. Of course, all of those extremist windbags on the right want another far-right nut like Antonin Scalia on the Court   but there s a catch. President Obama has every right to nominate a person of his choosing, which will ensure a Supreme Court with liberal leanings. The GOP-controlled Senate, however, will do all they can to make sure that doesn t happen, though, and they have said so openly, thus leading to Sen. Schumer s fury.Appearing on This Week on Sunday morning, the Senator laid into Cruz s plans: Well, the job, first and foremost, is for the president to nominate and for the Senate to hold hearings and go through the process. You know, the Constitution, Ted Cruz holds the Constitution when he walks through the halls of Congress. Let him show me the clause that says president s only president for three years. After making his point about Cruz, Schumer then turned his attentions to Mitch McConnell s obstructionism. You know, the kind of obstructionism that Mitch McConnell s talking about, he s harking back to his old days, you know, he recently he said, well,  I want regular order.  But in 2010, right after the election or right during the election, he said,  My number one job is to defeat Barack Obama,  without even knowing what Barack Obama was going to propose. Here, he doesn t even know who the president s going to propose and he said,  no, we re not having hearings, we re not going to go forward to lead the Supreme Court vacant at 300 days in a divided time. This kind of obstructionism isn t going to last. And you know, we Democrats didn t do this. We voted 97-0 for Justice Kennedy in the last year of Reagan s term. I think first the American people don t like this obstruction. When you go right off the bat and say,  I don t care who he nominates, I am going to oppose him,  that s not going to fly. Indeed it s not going to fly. These people hate the sitting President so much that they are willing to leave a vacant seat on the court before they let anyone he might nominate through.

" Ted Cruz Repeats Lie About SCOTUS Nominations, Vows To Block Anyone Obama Chooses (VIDEO)","After being embarrassed on live television Saturday night when John Dickerson fact-checked his lie about Supreme Court history, Ted Cruz showed no shame as he repeated the same line on Sunday.The GOP Debate started off on Saturday night with Dickerson asked Cruz about whether or not President Obama should be able to name a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier that day.Cruz claimed that a Supreme Court nominee named by a lame duck president has not been confirmed by the Senate in 80 years. Dickerson, however, pointed out that former President Ronald Reagan s nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy to the bench in 1987 was confirmed by the Senate in 1988, the final year of Reagan s presidency. Thus, Dickerson caught Cruz lying, which stunned the candidate into silence as the crowd booed the moderator for bringing up pesky facts.During an appearance on ABC s This Week, the Texas Senator told George Stephanopoulos the very same lie and then blamed Democrats as the reason why Kennedy was only confirmed in 1988, claiming that it would never have happened if they had just automatically confirmed universally despised nominee Robert Bork instead of rejecting him and his extremism. George, the Senate has not confirmed a nominee that was named in the final year, an election year, in 80 years. This is a lame duck president. And, by the way, the only reason Anthony Kennedy was nominated that late is that Democrats in the Senate had gone after and defeated two previous nominees, Robert Bork, which set a new standard for partisan attacks on a nominee, and Doug Ginsburg. So it was the Democrats that had dragged it out for many months to make it that late. And right now, the court is exquisitely balanced. The fact is, however, that there is a process to Supreme Court nominations and confirmations. Many presidents have had their nominees rejected by the Senate, so it s not like Reagan was the first to have a nominee fail to be confirmed. The bottom line is that Cruz is still wrong on his Supreme Court history.But Cruz wasn t done. Upon being asked if he would filibuster anyone President Obama nominates to fill Scalia s seat, Cruz replied  Absolutely,  and said that the people should decide who fills the seat by electing the next president. This should be a decision for the people, George. We ve got an election. And, you know, Democrats   I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton or with Bernie Sanders and take the case to the people, what vision of the Supreme Court do you want? Let the election decide it. If the Democrats want to replace this nominee, they need to win the election. Here s the video via ABC. ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosThis is a particularly hard argument to make since Americans elected President Obama for a full four year second term in 2012 by five million votes. President Obama has nearly a full year left in office, so it is absolutely absurd, not to mention an admission that Republican will refuse to do their constitutional duty, to suggest that President Obama should force America to wait a full year or more before the Supreme Court is functioning with a full nine member bench again. President Obama earned the right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice when he won the 2012 Election. Ted Cruz and his Republican comrades need to get over it and do their damn jobs.

 Elizabeth Warren SHATTERS Republican Effort To Thwart Obama SCOTUS Pick,"With the death of a Supreme Court Justice many implications follow, including who will be their replacement. After ultra-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia s death many are left wondering what will happen next, and others are trying to sway decision-making altogether. Including Republicans who don t want President Obama to have the ability to pick who will be the nominee.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) wrote on Facebook just hours after Scalia passed away that  The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.  Of course, he s completely politicizing the vacancy, while also assuming the next president will be a Republican.Noticing this absolutely pathetic attempt to thwart President Obama s constitutional authority to nominate the next Supreme Court Justice was none other that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (D). In her own statement released Sunday on Twitter, she said: Senator McConnell is right that the American people should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court justice. In fact, they did   when President Obama won the 2012 election by five million votes. Article II Section 2 of the Constitution says the president of the United States nominates justices to the Supreme Court, with the advice and consent of the Senate. I can t find a clause that says  except when there s a year left in the term of a Democratic president.The Senate GOP took an oath just like Democrats did. Abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the Constitution & our democracy. Abandoning their Senate duties would also prove that all the Republican talk about loving the Constitution is just that   empty talk. And she s absolutely correct. President Obama is granted, by the Constitution, the ability to select who he deems appropriate as a nominee to replace Justice Scalia. What we are seeing right now is Republicans slip in to panic mode, because they are terrified that the replacement for their most conservative Justice in the Supreme Court has now fallen into the hands of Obama.The people more than showed their voice in who they want to have chosen as their Supreme Court Justices. They did so in November of 2008 and again in November of 2012 with the election and reelection of President Obama.Featured image: Flickr",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Newt Gingrich Demands President Obama Pick A Conservative Just Like Scalia For SCOTUS (VIDEO),"Newt Gingrich is hoping President Obama will say  yes sir  and do what white conservatives tell him to do.During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Sunday, the former House Speaker and former Republican presidential wannabe chimed in on the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and whether or not President Obama should be able to nominate a replacement during his final year in office.Of course, picking a nominee is the job of the executive branch as laid out clearly by the Constitution. It is then the job of the Senate to hold hearings and then bring up the nominee for a confirmation vote. That s how this works.But Senate Republicans have already vowed to block any and every nominee President Obama puts forward. And Newt Gingrich s solution is even worse than not having a nominee confirmed at all.When Clayton Morris explained that Democrats expect Senate Republicans to do their Constitutional duty because President Obama was elected to a four year term and not just three, Gingrich said that if President Obama wants to guarantee the confirmation of a nominee he should meet with conservative Senators and let them handpick a conservative like Scalia to be the nominee.In other words, conservatives actually think that since Scalia was a conservative that a like-minded individual should be selected to replace him, thus keeping the Supreme Court a conservative-leaning institution.MORRIS:  Senator Leahy and others have said though this would send the [Supreme] Court into disarray, having four-four and leaving these big decisions to the appellate courts and let these decisions stand for a year. And Democrats also saying, look, President Obama was elected to a four-year term. Americans spoke. He was elected to four years, not three years. He has every right to choose a nominee. GINGRICH:  No, no, no. He has every right to recommend. He doesn t have every right to choose. This goes back to the Constitution. The Senate is not obligated to approve who he recommends. I mean, he has a simple model. If he really wants to get somebody approved, sit down with Mitch McConnell and with conservative senators like Mike Lee, ask them who they would approve and nominate somebody who is in the Scalia tradition. Now, Obama is not going to do that. Obama wants to send up a radical to eliminate the Second Amendment right to bear arms, to eliminate religious liberty, to impose bigger government and more power in Washington. And that s his right. I understand that s what he believes. But the Senate has no obligation to shift this court for the next 30 years radically to the left in the last year of the Obama presidency. Here s the video via Media Matters:However, Gingrich s demand is ridiculous. This is not how the system works. While the truth is that no one really knows how a Supreme Court Justice will rule once they start hearing cases and issuing decisions, the fact is that no president is obligated to replace a dead or retiring Justice with one that has the exact ideological views, nor does the Constitution require such a thing.And if Senate Republicans think that s how it should be, they would be committing a sort of political blackmail to get their own way. The bottom line is that the president picks nominees to the Court and it s the Senate s job to confirm them or not. We all know that if Ruth Bader Ginsburg ever stepped down from the bench during a Republican presidency that she would be replaced immediately with a staunch conservative. Republicans certainly would never entertain the thought of replacing her with an ideological copy in the name of  fairness.  So conservatives like Gingrich should not expect Scalia s replacement to be a nominee of their choosing. President Obama will fulfill his constitutional obligation and whether Senate Republicans like the nominee or not, they must do theirs. America deserves a fully functioning Supreme Court.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SHAME: Desperate Rubio Repeatedly Tries To Pin ALL Blame For 9/11 On Clinton (VIDEO),"In what can only be seen as the worst attempt ever to be a George W. Bush apologist, even more so than his own brother Jeb, Sen. Marco Rubio is repeatedly touting the line that Bill Clinton is actually who we should blame for the attacks on 9/11/01.Living in his alternate reality, he fails to see that, unlike George W. Bush, who ignored intelligence and reports that indicated attacks were imminent within the United States by Osama bin Laden, Clinton actually attempted to thwart the terror mastermind s progress just years earlier. The fact that he wasn t able to rests heavy with Clinton, but to see Rubio clearly ignore Clinton s attempt, and even worse, completely ignore the fact that his beloved George W. Bush was absolutely negligent, goes beyond absurd and inaccurate to just outright pathetic.You can watch him during the GOP debate try to shift blame from Republican President Bush to Democratic President Clinton. Republicans biggest line that they try to tout is that they will be the ones to keep us safe, when reality shows it s quite the opposite.Watch here:Then the storyteller goes on Meet the Press Sunday morning, and when pressed on the lie by host Chuck Todd, Rubio doesn t backtrack, instead he doubles down.CHUCK TODD: So I m actually still not quite clear. Are you putting 9/11 on Bill Clinton?MARCO RUBIO: No, I m putting it on his decision not to take out bin Laden, absolutely. This is what happens when you have a chance to take out the leader of a terrorist organization, and you failed to do so. And the results are something like 9/11.So, yes, you are putting the blame on Bill Clinton, Rubio, and the fact that you have to meander around directly answering that answer like a used car salesman refusing to say if a car has flood damage, is more proof of that.Watch Rubio be VERY clear that he thinks Clinton is to blame:Does Rubio realize that everyone who is present in reality, and not in the bubble of the lies touted on Fox News, knows that the attacks on 9/11 occurred on George W. Bush s watch? Does he realize that he s only damaging himself and his reputation by delivering such nonsense time and time again? Bush didn t keep us safe. Plain and simple. Ignoring reality doesn t change facts.Rubio should honestly be ashamed of himself.Featured image: Video screen capture",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 40 Ted Cruz Quotes That Prove He Would Be The Worst President Of All Time,"Ted Cruz is one of the most extreme individuals to ever run for the presidency. As such he has left a trail of quotes that should be held against him as his 2016 campaign continues.His campaign has primarily focused on religion in an effort to attract the support of conservative  Christians,  much like Rick Santorum did in 2012.And just like Rick Santorum, Cruz has also made his fair share of statements on topics such as the environment, science, foreign policy, and women s rights among others based on his fanatical religious views that completely disqualify him as a viable occupant of the White House.Here are 40 of them.1.  I am saddened to see that some here, not everyone, but some here, are so consumed with hate  If you will not stand with Israel and the Jews, then I will not stand with you. ~Ted Cruz trashing his Muslim-American audience, who promptly booed him, September 20142.  It is now or never. I don t think we ve reached the point of no return yet. But we re close. We are close! And I believe if we go four or eight more years on this same path, we risk losing the greatest country in the history of the world. Millions of Americans are realizing this isn t working. The Obama economy is a disaster. Obamacare is a train wreck. And the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind   the whole world is on fire. ~Ted Cruz before scaring a little girl with same ending line as if the apocalypse is upon us, March 2015 3.  You always have to be worried about something that is considered a so-called scientific theory that fits every scenario. Climate change, as they have defined it, can never be disproved, because whether it gets hotter or whether it gets colder, whatever happens, they ll say, well, it s changing, so it proves our theory. ~Ted Cruz bashing science and denying the reality of climate change, January 20154.  I think it s an enormous blessing to be the child of an immigrant who fled oppression, because you realize how fragile liberty is and how easily it can be taken away. ~Ted Cruz being a hypocrite on immigrants, June 20115.  No man who doesn t begin every day on his knees is fit to stand in the Oval Office. ~Ted Cruz saying atheists should are unqualified to be president, August 20156.  Let me say something to the school-aged kids here. When Heidi s first lady, French fries are coming back to the cafeteria  The last I checked the cardboard was supposed to be on the tray and not in the food! ~Ted Cruz tries to pander to kids by promising them unhealthy food for lunch, January 20167.  If I am elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need health care reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting between us and our doctors. Three specific reforms that reflect those principles: Number 1, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That ll create a true 50-state national marketplace while will drive down the cost of low-cost catastropic health insurance. Number 2, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine health care needs. And Number 3, we should work to delink health insurance from employment, so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you, and it is personal, portable, and affordable, and I tell you, Bret I think that s a much more attractive vision for health care than the Washington-driven, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions to hurt. ~Ted Cruz stating that only the rich and healthy will have health insurance if he is president, January 20168.  Listen on the question of tithing, all of us are on a faith journey, and I will readily admit that I have not been as faithful in this aspect of my walk as I should have been. That article focuses on ten years ago. We don t have the ability to go back and change what occurred ten years ago when Heidi and I were newly married and we d just started a family. But at the end of the day, being a Christian is not about holding yourself out as righteous. It s about beginning with the understanding that we are flawed sinners and we are saved not by deeds but by Christ s redemption. I am grateful that God is a patient and forgiving God and this area, as in many areas of my life I am working to do a better job walking in my faith. ~Ted Cruz lying to a Christian reporter about how much he tithes, January 20169.  Well my aspiration is to, uh, oh I don t know, be in a teen tit film like that guy who played Horatio. You know he was in Malibu Bikini Beach Shop. Well, other than that, take over the world, world domination, you know, rule everything. Rich, powerful, that sort of stuff. ~Ted Cruz admitting at the age of 18 that he wants to achieve world domination in a video released in January 201610.  I ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who s lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me. I don t have health care right now. ~Ted Cruz lies about not having health insurance and blames President Obama for it, January 201611.  JFK campaigned on tax cuts, limiting government and standing up and defeating Soviet communists. JFK would be a Republican today. He stood for religious liberty, and he would be tarred and feathered by the modern Democratic Party. ~Ted Cruz claiming JFK would be in the GOP today only to then be smacked down by JFK s grandson, January 201612.  I believe in the death penalty. ~Ted Cruz in his book as dug up by the New York Times in January 201613.  We will carpet-bomb them into oblivion. I don t know if sand can glow in the dark, but we re going to find out! ~Ted Cruz stating his willingness to kill everyone and everything in the Middle East to beat ISIS even though carpet bombing is a war crime, December 201514.  If you re a DACA recipient, you were brought here illegally, and violating the law has consequences. One of the problems of our broken immigration system is that it is creating human tragedies and there are human tragedies when people break the law. ~Ted Cruz tells a woman to her face that he will deport her and her family if elected president, January 201615.  What happened in Benghazi is a national disgrace. Four Americans were murdered. We lost the first ambassador in the line of duty since the Carter administration. The immediate response of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the entire administration was to engage in deception, obstruction and cover up. They began by falsely blaming it on some ridiculous internet video, but even before that was the question that everyone should ask is why was security not there in the first place when the ambassador said over and over again, keep us safe. We do know Hillary told her daughter Chelsea, well gosh, I knew it was a terrorist attack, while we were out telling the American people it wasn t. You know I ll tell you, in my house, if my daughter Catherine, the five-year-old, says something she knows to be false, she gets a spanking. ~Ted Cruz lies about Benghazi before saying he wants to physically discipline Hillary Clinton for it, January 201616.  I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming. ~Ted Cruz tells his fanatical supporters to get ready to do battle on his behalf, January 201617.  We ve seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative, and this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic. This deal, on its face, will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, making the Obama administration the world s leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism You d better believe it. If I am elected president, on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. ~Ted Cruz vows not to honor the Iran nuclear deal, favoring war instead, September 201518.  The next president should announce that America is moving its embassy to Jerusalem. For decades political candidates, Republicans and Democrats, have talked about doing so. Enough talk! We need a leader who will act and respect the eternal capital of Israel. ~Ted Cruz says he would inflame tensions in the Middle East and basically start World War III for Israel, June 201519.  Listen, absolutely, yes. I think the first obligation of everyone in public office is to protect life. Life is foundational. In fact, as you look at the Declaration, that ordering of unalienable rights   life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness   I think is a very deliberate ordering. I very much agree with the pope s longstanding, and the prior popes  before him, longstanding call to protect every human life from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death. And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child s Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. ~Ted Cruz misreading the Constitution and declaring his intention to outlaw abortion despite Roe v. Wade, December 201520.  The simple and undeniable fact is the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats. ~Ted Cruz says 43 percent of the American people are violent criminals, November 201521.  There is no doubt that millions of people are suffering from the rise of radical Islamic terrorists. Christians are suffering, Jews are suffering and other Muslims are suffering  What I m saying is Syrian Muslim refugees should be resettled in the Middle East, in majority Muslim countries. ~Ted Cruz says only Christians should be allowed to enter the United States, November 201522.  There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror. If there were a group of radical Christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they, we would have a different national security situation. But it is precisely the Obama administration s unwillingness to recognize that or ask those questions that makes them so unable to fight this enemy. Because they pretend as if there is no religious aspect to this. ~Ted Cruz falsely claiming that Christians do not commit acts of terrorism, November 201623.  Climate change is not science, it s religion. ~Ted Cruz claims climate science is a religious view, October 201524.  It s wrong for Barack Obama to threaten to shut down the government over the issue. Under no circumstances should we spend $500 million   funding Planned Parenthood, which appears to be a criminal enterprise. ~Ted Cruz attacks Planned Parenthood and blames President Obama for wanting a government shutdown when he s the one really trying to shut it down again, September 201525.  I stand with Kim Davis. ~Ted Cruz declaring his support of a religious anti-gay bigot, September 201526.  Nothing is more important in the next 18 months than that the body of Christ rise up and that Christians stand up, that pastors stand up and lead. In this last election, 54 million evangelical Christians stayed home   If we can simply bring Christians to the polls   is it any wonder we have the government we have, we have the leaders we have if believers stay home and leave electing our leaders to unbelievers. We get exactly what we deserve and nothing is more important than having people of faith stand up and just vote our values, vote biblical values and that s how we turn the country around. ~Ted Cruz openly planning to turn America into a Christian-ruled tyranny, August 201527.  Following the tragic shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, President Obama and Harry Reid lead an assault, not on going after violent criminals, which is what they should have done, but instead going after the Constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. And I led the fight to protect the Second Amendment in the U.S. Senate and we defeated President Obama efforts to undermine our rights. ~Ted Cruz bragging about ignoring the mass killing of 20 little kids to oppose gun control measures, August 201528.  We need a Commander-in-Chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words  radical Islamic terrorism.  What we need is a Commander-in-Chief who makes clear: If you join ISIS, if you wage Jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant. ~Ted Cruz thinks merely shouting  radical Islam  will defeat ISIS, August 201529.  Our single vote in opposition is just and the abstentions of our friends are welcome, but at this point they are meaningless gestures. It is time to stop ceding moral authority to the UNHRC and tell the truth about this hopelessly biased and anti-Semitic institution. There is no equivalency between Israel s right to self-defense and Hamas  genocidal aggression against the Jewish people. There is no equivalence between Israel s extraordinary efforts to protect civilians and Hamas  use of the Palestinian people as human shields. Being party to any body that believes there is only perpetuates this injustice. The United States should stop legitimizing the UNHRC with our membership and withdraw now. ~Ted Cruz declaring that he will remove America from the United Nations Human Rights Council, July 201530.  I like Donald Trump. I think he s terrific, I think he s brash, I think he speaks the truth He has a way of speaking that gets attention. And I credit him for focusing on an issue that needs to be focused on. ~Ted Cruz agreeing with Donald Trump that Mexicans are a bunch of rapists, June 201531.  You know, Vice President Joe Biden. You know the nice thing? You don t need a punch line. (uproarious laughter) I promise you it works   the next party you re at, just walk up to someone, say  Vice President Joe Biden  and just close your mouth. They will crack up laughing. And Biden said, if anyone attacks your house, just go outside with a double-barrel shotgun, and fire both barrels. Now that is very very good advice  if it so happens you re being attacked by a flock of geese. ~Ted Cruz cruelly mocks Joe Biden after his son Beau died, June 201532.  This bill is symptomatic of a larger problem in Washington   an addiction to spending money we do not have. The United States Senate should not be in the business of exploiting victims of natural disasters to fund pork projects that further expand our debt. ~Ted Cruz denying disaster relief funding to Hurricane Sandy victims in 2013.33.  There are a series of federal statutory thresholds that have to be satisfied. Initially, it appears those thresholds are likely to be satisfied by the magnitude of the damage we re seeing. Democrats and Republicans in the congressional delegation will stand as one in support of the federal government meeting its statutory obligations to provide the relief to help the Texans who are hurting. ~Ted Cruz demanding federal disaster relief for his own state and being a hypocrite simultaneously, May 201534.  Instead of a tax code that crushes innovation and inflicts burdens on families struggling to make ends met, imagine a simple, flat tax that lets Americans fill out their taxes on a postcard. Imagine a tax code that is simple enough to abolish the IRS. ~Ted Cruz saying he would abolish the IRS and lower taxes to the point where our government couldn t function, April 201535.  We need a hundred more like Jesse Helms in the U.S. Senate. ~Ted Cruz longing for the Senate to be dominated by pro-segregationist racists who oppose the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, March 201536.  I think when it comes to campaign finance reform it is one of the most misunderstood issues in terms of the debate. I am first and foremost a constitutionalist. I believe in the Constitution and I believe in the bill of rights. We saw last year, and you probably didn t see it because it wasn t covered in the local media, but Senate Democrats introduced and voted on an amendment to repeal the free speech protections of the first amendment. ~Ted Cruz saying he support wealthy people buying elections, March 201537.  Net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet. It would put the government in charge of determining Internet prices, terms of service and what types of products and services can be delivered, leading to fewer choices, fewer opportunities and higher prices. Government-regulated utilities invariably destroy innovation and freedom. ~Ted Cruz opposing a free and open Internet, November 201438.  Of course we should have a surgeon general in place. And we don t have one because President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist and that individual didn t have the votes in the Senate. ~Ted Cruz keeping America from having a Surgeon General during the Ebola outbreak because the nominee supports gun control, October 201439.  If Harry Reid kills this bill in the Senate, I think the House should hold its ground, and should begin passing smaller continuing resolutions, one department at a time. It should start with a continuing resolution focused on the military. Fund the military, send it over, and let s see if Harry Reid is willing to shut down the military just because he wants to force Obamacare on the American people. ~Ted Cruz tries and succeeds in causing a government shutdown, September 201340.  Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, and the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement. ~Ted Cruz vowing on Twitter to help Senate Republicans block any Obama nominee to the Supreme Court in hope of a Republican like himself being able to do so in 2017, February 2016And these 40 quotes, especially the final quote on this list, demonstrate precisely why Ted Cruz should never be allowed to become president.Featured Image: Wikimedia ",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama’s Crystal Clear Response To Republicans’ Threat To Block His SCOTUS Nominee Is Perfect (VIDEO),"Within hours of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Republicans made it clear that there would be no nominee confirmed while President Obama is in office. The party that prides themselves on  defending the constitution  has once again shown that they ve never read it.Cries of  this president hasn t earned the right  and  we owe it to the country  to block any Obama nominee were common themes among the party of spite. While they certainly have the power in the senate to block the president s nominees, they don t have the power to stop him from trying.And try he shall. The president gave a moving tribute to Justice Scalia Saturday, calling his service  historic  and applauding him as an incredible man and a dedicated public servant. While those of us who know better would have preferred words like  incredible bigot  and  person living in the past,  the president showed what Scalia s own party couldn t afford him: Respect for him and his family in their time of grief.They opted instead to politicize yet another death, assuring their base immediately that they would never allow a secret Muslim (no they didn t say it but if you follow their base you know they re thinking it) to serve on the United States Supreme Court. What it boils down to is fear. Republicans fear they will lose their conservative voice on the court. They have already seen the law prevail in the cases of gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act subsidies when the 4-4 tie of liberal versus conservative was again broken by centrist Justice Kennedy. If President Obama, or any Democrat for that matter, gets a nominee confirmed, the balance will swing toward the left and the demise of the reason so many of their party are in office to begin with: Citizens United.Watch the president s remarks below:Featured image from screen capture",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch: Trump Doesn’t Know What To Do During Moment Of Silence For Justice Scalia (VIDEO),"You may have seen the latest Republican debates held on Saturday night. If so, chances are you caught the pre-debate moment of silence held for the belated Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who recently passed away in his hotel room in Texas. What you may or may not have noticed, depending on how attentive you were, was that Donald Trump stuck out like a sore thumb. Instead of bowing his head like every other Republican candidate up on the stage, he just stood there and seemed just to stare the entire time.So, this begs the question, does Donald Trump know what to do during a moment of silence? Or, does he just not care to show respect to dead Supreme Court Justices once they pass away (a right-wing one at that)? Either way   it makes him end up looking like a jackass   even more so than the one he already is.Which brings us to another point: remember that time conservatives threw a fit when President Obama was accused of being  unpatriotic  after a photograph circulated in the right-wing media showing him not placing his hand on his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance? Well, guess what, that was a total lie. It was the National Anthem, and the Star-Spangled Banner was playing.Also   remember that time, not too long ago, when Republicans also tried to take jabs at the president when he showed up late for a moment of silence held by world leaders in Turkey to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris? He got an earful in the media for that one.Pic via screen capture.Where is the outrage against Donald Trump? That s really the question being posed here. There isn t any.

 You Will Not BELIEVE What Conservatives Actually Think About Scalia’s Death (SCREENSHOTS/VIDEO),"As soon as news broke of notorious hatemonger Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death, some liberals joked that conservatives are so desperate to hate Obama that they would accuse the president of murder. The idea seemed so nonsensical that it could never happen. Sure, it was entirely expected that Republicans would immediately vow to block any Obama nominees no matter who they are. Republicans have been working to stand in between Obama and success since before he was elected the first time. But to accuse him of murdering Scalia?Scalia, a man who opposed anything that advanced human rights at every turn, was a 79-year-old obese gentleman who smoked (factors that greatly contribute to one s risk of death), but lived a full life   one he chose to waste opposing LGBT rights, a woman s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, racial equality, and other endeavors rational, thinking, decent human beings would consider reasonable.That President Obama will be nominating a replacement is something that frightens conservatives   apparently to the point that the gerbils that operate their brains have all simultaneously died. All across right-wing social media, you can find a curious assertion repeated: that bastard Obama gone done and killed Scalia. On Twitter, several hashtags have formed to push the moronic belief that the President s secret Muslim enforcers gave Scalia a heart attack   and there is such an outpouring of stupid, Sarah Palin will likely announce plans to speak about foreign policy for 30 minutes straight in order to regain her title as the Dumbest F*cking Human Being Alive:                   Though Scalia s true murderer is heart disease, the Right is almost desperate to believe that the president had Scalia killed. One gentleman calling himself  NatureHacker manages to spin a particularly crazy theory that: This is a white house president government coverup. The fbi and cia with barack are probably involved. mercury nitrate may have been the poison of choice at dinner or the sulfate with lead, cadmium, radium, plutonium, uranium, or organophosphate. Roundup is an organophosphate that could have been used by leonard nimoy. This justice was killed and found dead. He died of a premeditated murder. Another term for this is that he was assasinated for his spot in the supreme court to be appointed by a liberal. NatureHacker  explains that, after a night of partying and gorging on food, Scalia  wakes up dead. What a coincidence,  Mr. Genius says sarcastically, explaining that Scalia was poisoned  to get him to die for Obama s agenda. Watch the insane rant below, and remember to VOTE BLUE in November. Not only does the next president appoint at least two Supreme Court Justices, but if conservatives have their way, he or she will appoint a third as well.

 White People Have Gone Absolutely CRAZY In SNL’s ‘The Day Beyoncé Turned Black’ (VIDEO),"After Beyonc  came out with her new single  Formation,  which instantly became another hit for the artist, there was a lot of buzz surrounding the content of the lyrics. The song speaks truth to power and depicts the ongoing conflict that far too many people of color face in regards to police brutality. The song, however, doesn t have the usual music behind it that many of her past hits have had. So, if people aren t being critical of the content of the song, they re being critical of the composition and beat. Well, not all people, pretty much just white people. White people who would prefer Beyonc  stick to pure pop and dance.To top it off, after Beyonc  stole the show at the Super Bowl halftime performance, even more people became critical of the legendary singer. She was far too  black  for the folks over at Fox News, and seemingly many other places as well. After all, how dare she speak the truth and hurt the feelings of those who are too afraid to hear it?Saturday Night Live, noticing the ridiculousness of everyone criticizing Beyonc  for her new song, perfectly satirized the outrage and confusion coming from far too many white people. In a sketch titled  The Day Beyonc  Turned Black,  they show white people everywhere freaking the f*ck out and losing their damn minds after listening to her new song. It s as though they just found out, that after all these years of Beyonc  releasing hit after hit that white people adore, all of a sudden she releases a song that shows her as a powerful black woman speaking truth to power, and no one knows what to do with themselves. Heaven forbid people of color have their own voice and not just be forced to cater to white people all the time, right?Anyway, this is absolutely brilliant.Featured image: Screencap",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 10 Of The Most Harmful And Disastrous Opinions Of Antonin Scalia’s Career — With Quotes,"Justice Antonin Scalia had an impressive career. In his decades-long appointment as a Supreme Court Justice, he has worked diligently against the forces of social justice. Scalia s insane originalist philosophy has had a major impact on modern conservatism. Luckily, President Obama will now have the opportunity to appoint a new Supreme Court Justice, which will tip the scales in favor of a liberal court.Here is a look back on ten of the worst Supreme Court Decisions of Scalia s career. Sometimes his opinions were in the majority. The ones that were in dissent were oftentimes vicious.In Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court decided to stop recounting ballots in Florida. This decision is considered by many to be the reason George W. Bush became the president, with everything that came after. Scalia voted in concurrence with majority, and wrote: The issue is not, as the dissent puts it, whether  [c]ounting every legally cast vote ca[n] constitute irreparable harm.  One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are, under a reasonable interpretation of Florida law,  legally cast vote[s].  The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election. Count first, and rule upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires. 2. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 2010:In Citizen United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court decided that corporations are people. This created the situation we are in now, where corporations can donate unlimited amounts of money to SuperPACS, which are used to influence political elections. Scalia voted in concurrence with the majority, and wrote: Even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent s approach of excluding from First Amendment coverage what the Founders disliked, and even if we agreed that the Founders disliked founding-era corporations; modern corporations might not qualify for exclusion. Most of the Founders  resentment towards corporations was directed at the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered corporations enjoyed. Modern corporations do not have such privileges, and would probably have been favored by most of our enterprising Founders excluding, perhaps, Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian society. 3. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 2014:In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court decided that private businesses can be exempted from certain laws on religious grounds. Justice Scalia voted with the opinion of the court. During the case s oral argument, Scalia said: Well, religious beliefs aren t reasonable. I mean, religious beliefs are categorical. You know, it s God tells you. It s not a matter of being reasonable. God be reasonable? He s supposed to have a full beard. 4. King v. Burwell, 2015:In King v. Burwell, the Supreme Court decided that subsidies under Obamacare could be used through the federal exchange program. Scalia dissented, saying: We should start calling this law SCOTUScare   [T]his Court s two decisions on the Act will surely be remembered through the years   And the cases will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites. 5. Shelby County v. Holder, 2013:In Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court decided to strike down parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This weakened the Voting Rights Act and is considered by many an attack on the civil liberties of black voters. Scalia said, in 2013 in a speech at the University of California Washington Center, the following: Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes. Even the name of it is wonderful, the Voting Rights Act. Who s going to vote against that? 6. Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015:In Obergrefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court decided that same-sex couples have the right to get married. Scalia dissented from the opinion of the court, saying: Those civil consequences and the public approval that conferring the name of marriage evidences can perhaps have adverse social effects, but no more adverse than the effects of many other controversial laws. So it is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage. It is of overwhelming importance, however, who it is that rules me. Today s decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. 7. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 1992:In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, challenges were made to Pennsylvania law that required women to meet certain provisions in order to have an abortion. The court found that the provisions were unconstitutional, except for one that required women to notify their husband. Justice Scalia dissented gainst the opinion of the court, saying: The States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. 8. Lawrence v. Texas, 2003:In this Supreme Court decision, a law that banned sodomy was struck down. Scalia dissented from the opinion of the court. He wrote: Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children s schools, or as boarders in their home,  he wrote.  They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. 9. Romer v. Evans, 1996:In Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court decided that the state of Colorado could not prevent local jurisdictions from creating laws that prohibit discrimination against LGBT people, Scalia dissented, saying: [Colorado s ban] prohibits special treatment of homosexuals, and nothing more. [I]t would prevent the State or any municipality from making death benefit payments to the  life partner  of a homosexual when it does not make such payments to the long time roommate of a nonhomosexual employee. 10. Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 2011:In Wal-Mart v. Dukes, the Supreme court made the decision that ended one of the largest class-action suits in history. More than 1.5 million women filed a class action suit against Wal-Mart claiming gender discrimination. Scalia voted with the majority of the court and delivered their opinion. Scalia said: Respondents have not identified a common mode of exercising discretion that pervades the entire company aside from their reliance on Dr. Bielby s social frameworks analysis that we have rejected. In a company of Wal-Mart s size and geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction. Respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence, but their evidence falls well short. Republicans are already hard at work trying to prevent President Obama from appointing Scalia s replacement. Their efforts are in vain. There is no legitimate reason President Obama should not appoint Scalia s replacement. Luckily for everyone, it is likely that President Obama s replacement can undo much of the harm that Scalia has done during his career.Featured image from Donkey Hotey via Flickr",News,"February 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz: ‘We Are One Justice Away’ From Stopping Every GOP Assault On Human Rights (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz summed up the significance of Justice Antonin Scalia s passing  quite nicely in the early parts of Saturday s GOP debate: the appointment of a liberal justice would completely destroy every Republican agenda for the foreseeable future. We are one Justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states. We are one Justice away from a supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia s seminal decisions that upheld the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms. We are one Justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans, and the stakes of this election for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say  we re not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee. Yes, a more liberal Justice would reverse the 2008 Heller decision, which for the first time in our nation s history affirmed the right of men like George Zimmerman, the Bundy  militia,  and other violent people to own firearms. A more liberal Justice would definitely  undermine  what conservatives call  religious liberty  these days   the  right  to deny service based on sexual orientation, the right to discriminate in the name of God.Cruz is right: Scalia s death emphasizes the importance of the upcoming election. The next President will appoint at LEAST two Supreme Court Justices   three, if conservatives have their way.Watch Cruz s remarks below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cruz Humiliated By Moderator After Lie About Presidents Not Appointing Justices In Election Year,"Almost immediately after learning that longtime Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away suddenly while on a hunting trip in Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz joined his fellow Republican senators in boldly announcing that they would oppose any nomination that President Obama made and block the process for the remaining 361 days of his term.Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, & the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement.  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 13, 2016Republicans, Cruz included, were instantly greeted with a collective  what the hell are you thinking?  from the American people. The ability to appoint a Supreme Court Justice to replace one that has retired or passed away is the president s right by constitutional law. It s been this way for hundred of years. Suggesting otherwise is a violation of one of the country bedrock democratic principles.At the Republican Debate held later in the day, Cruz was asked to justify how torching the Constitution was defensible just because he didn t like the current president. He responded that it wasn t fair to appoint a new justice during an election year. In fact, he claimed, one hadn t been appointed during the last year of a presidency in over 80 years.Instantly, moderator John Dickerson s bullshit detector lit up. Cruz s lie was so egregious that his pants may as well have spontaneously combusted. I m sorry to interrupt, were any nominees appointed in an election year? Or was that just 80 years, there happened to be [no appointees in an election year]? Cruz doubles down on his lie: There were 80 years of not confirming. For example, LBJ nominated Abe Fordus, Fordus did not get confirmed he was defeated. So John Dickerson drops the hammer: But Kennedy was confirmed in [an election year] 1988. Cruz comes back with lie number 3: No Kennedy was confirmed in 1987. Which is immediately fact-checked yet again: He was appointed in  87, confirmed in  88. In other words, just a few decades ago, the country was faced with a similar dilemma   and they stuck with the Constitution. The legal team at NBC News confirmed that Kennedy was indeed nominated in 1987, but confirmed in 1988. The country was fine with this.For the record, Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed in 1988 but nominated in 1987. (We've been doing some research over here at #MTP)  Shawna Thomas (@ShawnaNBCNews) February 14, 2016As usual, Cruz has no leg to stand on. He simply wants his way and doesn t want to be bothered worrying about the facts. Fortunately, Dickerson has been one of those rare debate moderators who won t Cruz to spew lies and get no pushback.Watch the video below:Featured image via CBS News",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michele Bachmann Comes Out Of Hiding To Mourn Scalia On Twitter — Gets His Name Wrong (TWEETS),"Michele Bachmann is easily one of the craziest people to ever grace the halls of Congress. She spent her entire tenure being a complete embarrassment and disgrace to the institution which she served, spending more time ranting about abortion, religion, and gay people than actually, you know, trying to govern. All sane people were giddy with glee when she decided not to run for re-election. Shortly thereafter, she faded into the bowels of the more humiliating and shameful parts of America s history, right where she belongs.Well, with the death of extreme right-wing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, former Congresswoman Bachmann has emerged from her vampire crypt to tell the world just how much she admired the man. She sent out a tweet just hours after his death that read: God Bless Anthony Scalia, finest Sup Ct Justice RIP God bless Anthony Scalia, finest Sup Ct Justice RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016There s just one problem with that: his name is Antonin Scalia, not Anthony. This nitwit can t even get that much right, yet, after that major f*ck up, Bachmann went on to go on a tirade about who should replace the deceased Justice, and, of course, only other extreme right-wingers are even a little bit acceptable to her. Here is that series of insane tweets:Obama must appoint a constitutional originalist to replace Justice Scalia, nothing else will do.  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016She even had the gall to compare Scalia s insane ramblings to William Shakespeare s masterpieces.Reading a Scalia dissent was akin to reading a Shakespearean sonnet. RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016Now Scalia belongs to the ages. Let's add his profile to historical lawgivers which surround the US House chamber.  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016Scalia will be read and quoted 200 years hence, if America survives. RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016He ll be quoted alright, just not in the way that you think.

 Why The Death Of Justice Scalia Makes The Supreme Court A Huge 2016 Election Issue,"The death of Justice Antonin Scalia at the age of 79, while sad for his family, represents an opportunity to change the Supreme Court and America with a single nomination.The Supreme Court has leaned conservative for decades now, which has had devastating effects om laws and policies that were championed by the Court during the progressive era between the Great Depression and the early 1970s.Only hours after Scalia s death was confirmed, Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama makes to replace him. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already said that he would rather wait until the next president takes office to confirm a new Justice. Ted Cruz, who hopes to be that next president, has made the same statement.If Republicans have their way, Americans will have a Supreme Court with only eight Justices on the bench for the next year or more instead of doing their job to help fill the new vacancy as soon as possible. That means we could have many cases that end in a tie, unresolved, for that span of time or longer depending on how long it takes for them to get back to the Court. Those cases would have to be brought back to the Court later when it has a full bench again.Scalia s death effectively changes all the cases that are currently on the docket, including an affirmative action case, a public sector unions case, and an abortion case that almost certainly would have gone in favor of conservatives had he lived to make his decision. So these issues could live on to fight another day.And that s why the 2016 Election has become even more important. We have heard multiple times that this election is an important one because the next president could end up making several nominations to the nation s highest court in the next four years. Well, if we weren t taking that seriously before, we certainly must take that seriously now.If Senate Republicans say  no  to confirming any nominee President Obama makes during his last year in office, it would fall to the next president to nominate someone after taking office in 2017. It could delay the Court from settling cases effectively for over a year since we would have to wait for a new president who would then have to go through the nominating process. The nominee would then have to be confirmed in what would likely be a long and grueling process if Republicans still hold the Senate and Democrats remain in control of the White House. Keep in mind that the Senate is up for grabs as well in this election.If a Democrat like Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders wins the presidency, we would see a seismic shift in the Court. With one nomination, and the possibility of others over the next 4 to 8 years, the Supreme Court could become a liberal-leaning or liberal-dominated Court that would have the power to not only keep abortion legal and protect affirmative action, it would have the power to reverse decisions made by the Court during Scalia s tenure, including Citizen s United which struck down campaign finance reform and Shelby County v. Holder which weakened the Voting Rights Act. A nomination by a Democratic president would end the constant 5-4 decisions that have rolled America back.If a Republican wins on the other hand, we could end up with a nominee who would be as conservative as Justice Scalia or even more extreme. Ted Cruz is desperate to become president, and you can bet that he ll pick a nominee who would vote to end Obamacare, abortion, same-sex marriage, and basically vote the way conservatives want that new Justice to vote. Conservative dominance of the Court would continue on and any policy that liberals care about would be in serious jeopardy.The next pick for the Supreme Court will have an enormous impact no matter if a Republican or a Democrat makes the selection. But if a Democrat makes the choice, it would certainly have the most impact of all.Senate Republicans could obey precedence and immediately begin the process of confirming a nominee President Obama chooses, therefore the Supreme Court issue wouldn t play nearly as big a role in the election, essentially keeping it out of politics where it belongs. But it looks like Republicans want to play politics with the Court and neglect to do their jobs again in the hope that they can delay long enough so that a Republican can make the selection in 2017, and potentially more selections if other Justices die or retire.In short, it really doesn t matter if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders wins the nomination. What is important is that all Democrats vote for whoever the Democratic candidate is so that a Republican will not be making the choice of who sits on the Supreme Court. America s future could very well depend on it.

 Cop Holds Gun On Black Delivery Man During Routine Traffic Stop (VIDEO),"Twenty-five-year-old Christopher Jeffries was working as a pizza delivery driver on the night of January 16, when he was pulled over by a Bladensburg, MA, police officer.According to Jeffries, who captured the encounter with the unnamed officer on cell-phone video, the cop got out of his own vehicle with his gun drawn. After approaching Jeffries car, the officer pointed the gun in the young man s face.The cell-phone video shows the officer approaching the driver s side of his vehicle, shouting, POLICE OFFICER! PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL! Jeffries tries to communicate with the officer, who again demands that he puts his hands on the steering wheel.Jeffries complies by placing his hands on the wheel. He then calmly asks the cop, Can you put your gun away sir? Instead, the cop demands that he produce his license and registration. As he is attempting to do that, the officer commands him to put his phone down. I m putting my phone down,  Jeffries says.The cop repeats the command several more times, even though Jeffries is no longer holding his phone.He tells the officer that he did put his phone down, but the cop is too busy shouting orders in rapid-fire succession to even hear what he s saying.At this point Jeffries raises his empty hands, saying, My phone is not even in my hands. Immediately the cop starts demanding that he roll down his window.At this point the driver s window is cracked enough that he can hear the officer and the officer can hear him.Jeffries rolls the window down further, handing his driver s license through the opening, as the officer continues to demand that he roll his window down. My window is down,  he says. This can go from bad to real bad,  the cop says.A minute later, after Jeffries tells him he doesn t have his registration on him, the officer begins demanding that he get out of the vehicle.At this point Jeffries says,  I actually am afraid right now. He asks the officer,  Can you please call for backup?  saying,  You re pulling a gun on me. Watch the video below, via VerifiedPlus on YouTube.  During an interview with Fox 5, Jeffries described the encounter, saying: I felt like I was living the last seconds of my life when the man walked out of his car. He went to say: Seeing that gun just on my side mirror was like a startling, frightening moment of like,  This could be it,  given the atmosphere and the time that we are in. This stop should have resulted in a minor traffic ticket, at best.Instead it was escalated to a life or death situation, by a cop who was too scared to even talk to a Black man without his gun drawn and pointed in his face.Not surprisingly, the police chief contends that his officer s behavior was appropriate.Jeffries has filed a civil rights suit against the officer.

 DNC Hilariously Matches Republican Voters With Candidates In Parody Dating Site Ad (VIDEO),"Are you a Republican? Are you tired of trying to figure out which GOP candidate to vote for? Well, you re in luck because the DNC can totally help you out.The Democratic National Committee created a parody commercial for a dating site service that matches conservative voters with the Republican candidate that best completes them.That s right. Conservative voters can find their political soulmate on gopHarmony.The ad features a bunch of happy young men and women who are using gopHarmony satisfactorily, complete with testimonials. I m still looking for that perfect match. Someone who hates Obamacare just as much as I do!  one woman claims.A man named Dr. Love then appears to comfort conservatives that the site is here to finally help them find a GOP candidate who is just as  out of touch with reality as you are. I wanted to find my match easily without the constant disappointment,  another woman says.  I also don t want to let Mexicans and Muslims into the country. A male gopHarmony user then says he  has no idea how the economy works,  but that s okay because neither does anyone else on gopHarmony.The ad then lays out the metrics used to determine potential matches, including fear, being too thirsty, misogyny, xenophobia, climate denial, refusal to compromise, watching Fox & Friends unironically, hatred of unions and workers, being allergic to facts, attempting to repeal Obamacare, NRA score, and shutting down the government among many others.

" Before Scalia’s Body Is Even Cold, Republicans Vow To Obstruct ANY Obama Nominee","Moments after learning that long-time Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had died in his sleep, Congressional Republicans were already vowing that they would spend the next 361 days preventing Obama from appointing a new justice   as is required in the Constitution.Sen. Ted Cruz, who bills himself as a  constitutional scholar,  boldly demanded that the country wait a year before appointing a new justice simply because he doesn t like Obama.Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, & the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement.  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 13, 2016A staffer for Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) also swore he would never allow President Obama to fulfill his job of appointing a new justice. In a series of shameless tweets, sent almost immediately after Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed his 79-year-old colleague had passed away, Conn Carroll said there was a  less than zero  chance that Republicans would let Obama pick a new nominee.What is less than zero? The chances of Obama successfully appointing a Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia?  Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) February 13, 2016If anything this will put a full stop to all Obama judicial nominees going forward.  Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) February 13, 2016Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also endorsed the idea of preventing Obama s nominee:McConnell goes there: ""this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.""  Rick Klein (@rickklein) February 13, 2016For anyone who has followed politics in recent years, the idea that Republicans would openly express a desire to prevent President Obama from doing his job is nothing new. However, with the Supreme Court, the stakes are even higher than usual. Until today, the court was divided 5-4 in favor of Republicans. This meant that things like Citizens United and the infamous Hobby Lobby decision went in favor of conservative interest groups. With Obama s chance to appoint a new justice, the court is poised to flip. Liberals, for the first time in years, will have the majority.For a bit of perspective, the longest Congress ever took to confirm a nominee is 125 days. If Republicans succeed in preventing President Obama from his right to make an appointment, it will clearly be due to obstructionism and political underhandedness. Already we see they are vowing to not confirm his choice   and they have absolutely no idea who it is yet. That s a level of partisanship that should shock and disgust you, regardless of what side of the aisle you re on.Feature image from Flickr/Flickr ",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Right Wing Supreme Court Justice Found Dead,"Reports out of Texas are saying that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead while visiting the luxury resort at the Cibolo Creek Ranch just south of Marfa, Texas. He was apparently on a hunting trip, and it looks at though his death was from natural causes, but his death is still under investigation.The 79-year-old justice was found in his hotel room after he didn t appear for breakfast. He was attending the ranch with about 40 other people.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued this statement after the news of Scalia s passing: He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. We mourn his passing, and we pray that his successor on the Supreme Court will take his place as a champion for the written Constitution and the Rule of Law. Cecilia and I extend our deepest condolences to his family, and we will keep them in our thoughts and prayers.

But how much influence remains to be seen.As Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight writes here, superdelegates are democratic insiders who hold voting power apart from that of ordinary delegates.Silver explains: Superdelegates were created in part to give Democratic party elites the opportunity to put their finger on the scale and prevent nominations like those of George McGovern in 1972 or Jimmy Carter in 1976, which displeased party insiders. While Silver agrees with many progressive voters, who say that the superdelegate system is  profoundly unfair,  he also notes that the amount of influence superdelegates have on the outcome of a primary race depends largely on how close the race is.There are approximately 712 superdelegates. These delegates equal about one-sixth of the 4,763 delegates who will determine the outcome of the primary. In order to win the party s nomination, a candidate needs to secure at least 2,382 delegates.According to Silver: Superdelegates are mathematically relevant when a candidate has 41.2 percent to 58.8 percent of elected delegates. Below that range, a candidate couldn t win a first-ballot majority even with the votes of every superdelegate; above that range, the superdelegates  help wouldn t be necessary to clinch the nomination. To clarify, the following chart was published on FiveThirtyEight, on February 12.The chart shows the percentage of superdelegate votes a candidate would need to win the primary, in correlation to the percentage of regular delegates, which are awarded based on the outcomes of state primary elections.Image credit: screen capture Nate Silver fivethirtyeight.comAs the chart illustrates, the closer the race is, the more impact the superdelegates have on the outcome.Currently Hillary Clinton holds a tremendous lead over Bernie Sanders among pledged superdelegates. Clinton has the support of 362 superdelegates, while Sanders has only captured the support of eight superdelegates thus far.But Silver also points out that superdelegates are free to change their vote at any time during the race, and notes that they often do just that. Unlike elected delegates, superdelegates are unbound to any candidate even on the first ballot. They can switch whenever they like, and some of them probably will switch to Sanders if he extends his winning streak into more diverse states and eventually appears to have more of a mandate than Clinton among Democratic voters. Additionally, Silver states that it s highly unlikely superdelegates would back a candidate who had lost the popular vote by any significant margin, since doing so would likely alienate over half the party s base.So while at the moment it may appear that party insiders are attempting to override the popular vote, it s not likely that the superdelegates will ignore or deny the will of the voters, should they favor Sanders by a significant margin.Silver points to 2008 as an example of how fast things can change. Clinton had a large superdelegate lead over then-senator Barack Obama early on during the 2008 democratic primary, as well. But as the election wore on, several dozen superdelegates changed their original vote from Clinton to Obama. At the same time, uncommitted superdelegates came out in support of his candidacy.So while superdelegates definitely have the power to influence the outcome of an election, especially in the case of very close race, it s important to keep in mind that voters also have the power to influence the decisions of the superdelegates.View a state-by-state list of democratic superdelegates here.

 ‘Squeaky Clean’ Super Bowl Champ And GOP Poster Boy Peyton Manning Buried A Sex Scandal In College,"Denver Broncos Quarterback and two-time Super Bowl Champ Peyton Manning makes a great commercial. His boyish looks and unassuming southern drawl combined with a squeaky clean image make him the perfect poster boy for just about any product.Aside from being a Papa John Schnatter loving, Jeb Bush supporting Republican who sends maximum donations to GOP campaigns regularly, Peyton Manning has what appears to be a polished past with nothing but daisies, rainbows and NFL records dotting it. As with most Republicans, however, the illusion at some point comes crashing down. As it turns out, the already-famous Manning was reportedly responsible for an assault of a sexual nature and subsequent cover-up that changed the course of a woman s career while he was in college at the University of Tennessee.The woman, Dr. Jamie Ann Naughright, wasn t a random female student who could be bullied into silence the way so many in the twisted world of men s college sports are. She was a student volunteer on the training staff and a pioneer in a field where only men had previously prevailed.According to court records recently uncovered by The New York Daily News, a 74-page scandal was swept under the rug and a great woman was forced to leave a campus and a job she loved because Peyton Manning was a foolish and vulgar scumbag. After months of abuse by the misogynist coaching staff, who joked that she must be a lesbian and called her  c*nt bumper,  Dr. Naughright s glass ceiling was raised to impossible heights by none other than number 18.The story begins with Manning suffering a typical football injury and Naughtright, whose name was Whited at the time, attending to him. She said that Manning had first asked her personal questions, including if she  hung out  with people she worked with. Then things got infinitely worse.After turning down his advances, Manning decided to drop trou while Dr. Naughright had her head down. When she hears chuckles from the others in the room, she looked up to see Manning s privates in her face. According to the court documents, Naughright said: It was the gluteus maximus, the rectum, the testicles and the area in between the testicles. And all that was on my face when I pushed him up. To get leverage, I took my head out to push him up and off. Such blatant lewd behavior and disrespect for a woman who was trying to help him shows a different character than the one the NFL has sold its fans for nearly two decades. Not only did Manning stick his privates in this woman s face, he and the coaching staff tried to blame the incident on a black player, according to documents, and went on to downplay it as  mooning. They went so far as to involve yet another player, who was supposedly the target of said mooning, who rebuffed the theory that Naughright accidentally placed her own face in the path of Manning s ass. Yes, it really did get that ridiculous. The other player rebuffed the claim, telling Manning in a letter that he should  take responsibility  for what he did.After the incident was reported, Manning was punished with the removal of his  privilege to eat at the athletic facilities dining room, and requiring him to run at 6:00 a.m. for two weeks.  The dining room ban was then reduced to two weeks as well. Dr. Naughright ended up being forced out of the University with a $300K settlement and a confidentiality agreement. For her, the incident was over.For Manning, however, the incident needed to be put into his own context, most likely as a pre-emptive strike against the truth ever coming out. In a book released by him and his father, Archie, Manning tells a completely different story of a woman he called  vulgar.  While he admitted his behavior was  inappropriate,  he placed most of the blame on Dr. Naughright, claiming she had a foul mouth and that she yearned to be  one of the guys.  In his book, Manning described his feelings towards women in the manly man s world of football: Never mind that women in the men s locker room is one of the most misbegotten concessions to equal rights ever made,  Manning wrote.  When Dad played, there was still at least a tacit acknowledgment that women and men are two different sexes, with all that implies, and a certain amount of decorum had to be maintained. Meaning when it came to training rooms and shower stalls, the opposite sex was not allowed. Common sense tells you why. Misogyny is what tells you why. Peyton Manning s need to display his superiority over a woman who had halted his advances tells you why.At the time, Naughright was working at Florida Southern College and while she wasn t named, it became common knowledge that she was the trainer Manning was referring to in his book. She ended up leaving the school and filing a defamation lawsuit against Manning, which is where the 74 pages of documents came from.USA Today picked the story up in 2003 but didn t release the documents they obtained that incriminated Manning. Instead, they ran a piece about an unnamed woman who took a mooning incident the wrong way, clearing the way for Manning s squeaky clean image to move forward.Here we are, on what seems to be the waning days of manning s career, and lo and behold the truth comes out. Consequences at this point for Manning will probably be non-existent, because even though what he did and how he treated this woman were disgusting, he has two Super Bowl Rings and the undying admiration of millions of fans.To those of us keeping score, Manning belongs in another club of players: The ones who got away with something horrible.

 After Margaret Cho Calls George W. Bush What He Actually Is The Maher Panel ERUPTS (VIDEO),"Many Republicans have a clever way of remembering history. Instead of acknowledging that former President George W. Bush had the terror which occurred on 9/11/01 happen under his watch, they skillfully say nothing happened after 9/11/01. Completely ignoring the fact that yes, in fact, intelligence was ignored completely, and George W. Bush, alongside his administration,p  f*cked up big time. BIG time. If they d own that, you could almost respect the candor, but since they can t, they just look utterly moronic and slightly evil.This is what just happened, yet again, on Real Time with Bill Maher when Republican Bush apologist Ana Navarro was trying to defend George W. Bush and state the case for Jeb Bush. Not only that, she couldn t seem to acknowledge the fact that what W did to get us into a war in Iraq was not only false and horrific, but should be considered a war crime. He and his administration manufactured intelligence to make their case. And with most smart-minded folks out there understanding this and willfully acknowledging this fact, many would even go so far as to call him a war criminal. Which is exactly what fellow Real Time guest Margaret Cho did.After a discussion about how the best way to prevent veterans from needing help would be to not create veterans in the first place by unnecessarily going to war, Cho chimes in, and says: I think George W. Bush is a war criminal. He sent all those people to die. And as harsh as that sounds, it s true. He betrayed the trust of not only the American people, but more so of our men and women in uniform. He sent them to a war based on lies and thousands of them died, and even more came home injured both physically and mentally. It is most definitely criminal behavior and W alongside his administration should still be held accountable.Navarro, unwilling to accept reality, came back at Cho with: Let s not throw around that term so loosely. I mean, I know you are a comedian and everything, but war criminals are Nazis. Which is when Maher chimed in and asked her not to use  comedian  in such a disparaging tone as though those who are funny for a living can t be serious. In fact, comedians, of all people, are able to dissect reality much more thoroughly than others who just view it on the surface and their insight is quite valuable, because they can often see things others can t.If you find yourself defending the incompetency of George W. Bush and ignoring the reality that 9/11/01 occurred on his watch, or defending his lies that led us into Iraq, you need to take a good, long look at yourself and what you really stand for as a human being living in what s supposed to be a civilized society.Watch the tense moment between panelists here:Video/Featured image from YouTube",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Host BEGS Republicans: Leave Trump ALOOOONE (VIDEO),"Fox News host Eric Bolling wants mean Republicans to just leave his favorite candidate, Donald Trump, alone. Bolling, the host of the Fox weekend business news show Cashin  In, released a special message on the Saturday edition of the program timed to coincide with the upcoming South Carolina primary.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8QbU8YMdMBolling, who also co-hosts The Five during the week, noted that the  Our Principles  Republican super PAC headed by former Romney aide Katie Packer is targeting Trump. The ads show that on a number of issues, Trump has flip-flopped from a moderate/liberal position to positions designed to pander to conservative Republican voters. Abortion, health care, and taxes are among Trump s flip-flops.While you would think Bolling, a conservative, would be happy to see an expose of Trump s fakery, his problem is actually with the ad itself.In his rant, Bolling complains about establishment Republicans consistently tearing down conservatives, as he sees it, and points out that he believes the PAC ad is a part of this sustained campaign.He calls on the ad makers to stop going after the reality star turned Republican presidential front-runner and racial demagogue. Bolling, speaking to the camera, told the PAC that  Trump s not your problem. Liberals and socialists are.  He suggests that instead  Why not use that Super PAC money to expose the dark underbelly of liberal politics? Bolling s suggestion is humorous because he effectively works for the biggest anti-liberal Super PAC around, Fox News. His network is a steady stream of lies, half-truths, and propaganda designed to attack the Democratic Party and the left. At the same time, actual super PACs on the right and other dark money groups designed to shield their donors are consistently the source of propaganda campaigns against the left. The Koch Brothers preside over a network that some believe could spend $1 billion in 2016 in order to elect a Republican president and congress.Fox has been the premiere media vehicle for Trump. He has received more airtime on the network than any other candidate, and even when feuding with Fox host Megyn Kelly, he still got coverage on their prime time programming. Of those at Fox, Bolling has been one of the staunchest supporters and defenders of Trump s campaign for months now, and according to a report he was directly ordered to back Trump by Fox News boss Roger Ailes.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump’s New Willie Horton-style Ad Could Get Latinos Killed (VIDEO),"A new campaign ad from reality TV star and current Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump exploits the death of 17-year-old Jas Shaw in order to further the racist narrative Trump launched his campaign with. In the ad, Shaw s death at the hands of undocumented immigrant Pedro Espinoza is used as an argument to elect Trump president. Jas Shaw was a 17-year-old football star who was gunned just outside his home,  a narrator says as the words  gunned down  appear in white bold letters against a red background on top of the photo.  His killer? An illegal immigrant gang member who just got out of prison. The 30-second ad, which will soon air in South Carolina ahead of the Feb. 20 Republican primary, features Jas Shaw s father, Jamiel Shaw, who has endorsed Trump for president and appeared on the campaign trail with him. In the ad, Shaw says Trump is the only candidate who will end illegal immigration. Trump is the only one saying:  You re going to be dealt with. We re going to enforce that,    Shaw says in the ad.  We re going to enforce that. That s a beautiful thing. It is, of course, impossible to end all illegal immigration and Trump s proposal to deport 11 million people is similarly a stupid and unworkable idea that has been derided by people on both the left and the right.But Trump doesn t actually care about how practical the idea is. He is pandering to base, racist impulses on the right and from the day his campaign launched he has been exploiting bigotry in order to advance politically.The new ad is the direct 2016 descendant of 1988 s  Willie Horton  ad, in which images of a black murderer were used by Republican supporters of President George H.W. Bush (who were also connected to Roger Ailes, now the head of Fox News) to attack Democratic presidential nominee as  soft on crime. Trump s anti-Latino, anti-Muslim rhetoric has already resulted in assaults on Latinos by perpetrators who said Trump inspired them, as well as incidents at Trump rallies of Muslim and black protesters being physically and verbally assaulted by Trump backers.An ad broadcast on television during a heated primary simply ramps up the outrage felt by many on the right and give them the excuse of another ethnic target.The mainstream media has studiously avoided pointing out the hate motivating Trump s campaign, either out of fear of backlash from conservatives or just out of the sense that a continued Trump campaign is good for ratings.Featured image from YouTube",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ted Nugent’s Latest Racist Rant May Cost Him The One Thing He Loves, His Precious NRA Membership","Ted Nugent is a mentally unstable man with almost as many insecurities as guns. His frequent rants run the gamut of violent and racist talking points. He s threatened to kill Hillary Clinton. He s threatened to kill President Obama. There isn t a minority group that he hasn t tried to incite his rabid all-white, all-conservative fanbase into attacking (verbally or otherwise).But something is happening that may finally make Nugent shut the hell up.Following his latest racist rant, this time focused on Jewish liberals, calling them  soulless sheep to the slaughter  (and posting a picture of holocaust victims, just to make sure his low intelligence followers really got it), the backlash came not only from liberals   who are constantly calling Nugent out for his disgusting views   but also from the people who typically defend him: Fellow conservatives.Nugent must have assumed this was just another mundane backlash so he characteristically told his critics  eat me.  He may want to rethink that. Instead of just shouting at him on social media, they did something far more terrifying for the gun-obsessed lunatic: They are calling on the NRA to kick him out.Up until now, the NRA could be forgiven for having tolerated Nugent s excesses. He is, after all, a rock star rather than a politician, and his passion for the Second Amendment has been admirable. It takes all sorts to make a movement   those who can offer the visceral case are just as important as those who can crunch the numbers and parse the laws. But there is always a line somewhere, and Nugent has unapologetically leaped across it.As Media Matters documented, even far-right gun groups have spoken out against Nugent s latest anti-Semitic smears. If the NRA had hoped to be able to weather this storm and continue to keep Nugent as one of the members of their board (yeah, he s a board member of the organization.), it doesn t look like they are going to get any defense from their allies. EVERYONE wants him gone.His  haters  were even more adamant. The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence released a strong statement condemning Nugent and started a petition to have the NRA drop him from their ranks. Tell the NRA: The repeated racist statements of NRA board member Ted Nugent are grossly offensive and intolerable. Remove him from your Board of Directors. Which probably terrifies Nugent who, underneath his tough talk, has always been a coward.For him, the NRA represents the last vestige of respectability. As more and more of his former supporters distance themselves from his ugly behavior, he needs the NRA to be on his side. Without them he will look like what he is: A has-been musician who needs serious psychiatric help. He s not an  ambassador  for gun rights. He s not a  board member  of a large organization. Just a sad, angry racist shouting into an increasingly empty room.While it s frustrating to watch Nugent repeatedly slur minorities, it will feel extremely gratifying to watch one of these unhinged rants finally destroy the only thing he loves: His NRA membership card.Feature image via Flickr ",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Accuses Pope Francis And Mexico Of Plotting The Takeover Of America (VIDEO),"Donald Trump used a recent television interview to detail an elaborate conspiracy involving Pope Francis, the Mexican government, and immigration.During an interview with Stuart Varney on Fox Business, Trump explained how he believes the leader of the Catholic faith is in cahoots with the Mexican government to lead a some kind of immigrant takeover of America. As he puts it: So I think the pope is a very political person and I think that he doesn t understand the problems our country has. I don t think he understands the danger of the open border we have with Mexico. And I think Mexico got him to do it because Mexico wants to keep the border just the way it is because they re making a fortune and we re losing. So to be clear, the Pope may be an unwitting collaborator in the Mexican government s evil plan to send their drug dealers and rapists across the border to kill Americans. but Trump believes that during his visit this week, those crafty Mexicans are going to get him on their side for the takeover of America.Barney s other guest, a pastor from Dallas, then essentially backs Trump up in his absurd conspiracy theory. Not only the Pope, but evangelical pastors who argue for a lenient immigration policy are really basing their views not on biblical truth, but on personal opinion. But apparently, pastors who are anti-immigration are speaking the word of God?Hold up a minute. Perhaps the Pastor missed a few pages of the Bible, because there are a whole host of biblical references to the importance of helping those in need, wherever they come from.From the The Parable of the Good Samaritan: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind [a]; and,  Love your neighbor as yourself. [b] From Deuteronomy 27:19: Cursed be anyone who perverts the justice due to the sojourner (visitor/immigrant), the fatherless, and the widow.  And all the people shall say,  Amen. From Hebrews 13:2: Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. From Exodus 23:9: You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the heart of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. The list goes on and on. The Bible is absolutely full of references of the need for generosity and compassion to one s neighbor, newcomers, and anyone who finds themselves in need.In fact, there is also a pretty clear instruction in the Bible against the attitudes that so-called Christian conservatives have towards immigrants, and those in need. Greed, vanity, envy, wrath, pride, gluttony   all of these appear in the seven deadly sins. For billionaires like Donald Trump hoard their wealth, splurging it on vanity projects and eating themselves fat, while raging against some of the most vulnerable people on the planet   THAT is the very definition of basing their views not on biblical truth but on personal opinion. In this case, a personal opinion that contradicts the core values of the faith these extremists purport to serve.Featured image from Flickr Creative Commons/Screengrab",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Gets His A** Handed To Him By Rachel Maddow For Bragging About Ted Nugent Endorsement (VIDEO),"Rachel Maddow noticed Ted Cruz bragging about being endorsed by Ted Nugent, and she didn t let him get away with it.Last month, Ted Cruz boasted about being endorsed by a pastor who thinks Hitler was sent by God to exterminate Jews, and now he s boasting about gaining the support of a man who thinks Jews who support gun control are Nazis in disguise.As Maddow pointed out on Friday night, Cruz s website proudly displays a message crowing about Nugent s support of the Texas Senator. TED NUGENT SAYS TED CRUZ IS HIS FAVORITE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,  blares the headline on Cruz s weebsite.Maddow then listed the other slimy people who Ted Cruz is proud to call supporters of his campaign.One of those supporters is anti-gay conservative pastor Kevin Swanson, who wants to execute all gay people. Cruz actually shared a stage with Swanson in Iowa late last year and bragged about it instead of distancing himself from him.Another supporter of Cruz is Pastor Mike Bickle, who once said that Hitler was sent by God to exterminate Jews because they refused to convert to Christianity. Cruz embraced Bickle s support last month.And now Cruz is openly bragging about being endorsed by Nugent, who not only went on an incredibly anti-Semitic rant about Jews who support gun control, he also shit his pants to avoid being drafted during the Vietnam War, has called for the assassination of President Obama, and has a fascination with pedophilia. If you re Senator Cruz and you put this up on your website proudly embracing an endorsement from Ted Nugent   showing off, campaigning even tonight on the fact that you are the choice for president of Ted Nugent   then you do kind of own this,  she argued.  Just like you own the guy who said that God sent Hitler to kill all the Jews, because you campaigned on his endorsement, too. Just like you own it when the guy saying every gay person in America should be executed, because you attended his event. You shared a stage with him. You did not have to do that. Honestly, this year, Ted Cruz is shooting the moon on this stuff. I don t know how long it s gonna be before the Beltway notices this pattern and realizes it might be a real issue for him. Here s the video via MSNBC.Earlier in the segment, Maddow noted that Cruz also spoke at Bob Jones University, a Christian indoctrination camp that forbids homosexuality, forbids interracial dating, and supports segregation as if it is stuck in the 1950s.The bottom line is that Ted Cruz is a dangerous religious zealot who should not be allowed anywhere near the White House, or the US Senate, or any public office for that matter. His views and supporters are just too extreme in this country and go against our values as a nation.

 Anti-Obama ESPN Host Cuts Off Singer As He Begins Passionate Speech On Universal Healthcare (VIDEO),"ESPN has a bit of a conservative bias problem. The network devoted to sports may have anchors of all political backgrounds, but the right-leaning ones keep managing to embarrass everyone else.Nowhere is that more clear than with Sage Steele, an ESPN reporter with an inexplicable seething hatred for President Obama and his landmark healthcare reform. How much does she hate the idea of universal healthcare? Watch her painfully ham-fisted attempt to stop Arcade Fire s Win Butler from endorsing the seemingly uncontroversial idea that everyone should have health insurance.Butler wanted to use the opportunity of playing in a Celebrity All-Star basketball game in Toronto to bring up the issue of healthcare. He starts to make a comparison between Canada s model of universal healthcare and America s rather lousy counterpart when Steele rudely interrupts him with this astoundingly dumb line: We re talking about celebrity stuff, not politics. Priorities!Heaven forbid celebrities talk about issues that matter (especially in the lead up to a very important presidential election) instead of what they re wearing, who they re dating, and how exciting it is to win an MVP trophy at a Celebrity All-Star game.But Steele isn t just shallow, she s tenaciously anti-Obamacare. She wasn t just trying to move the show along, she was trying to prevent Butler from putting pesky ideas like  nobody deserves to go bankrupt when they get sick  into the heads of the American public watching the show.And it s not just singers that Steele doesn t think should be allowed to talk about healthcare   she also bashed the President of the United States for doing it.Comical hearing @BarackObama pimping his health care plan on @ESPN_Colin 's show  It's ESPN!! Let's stick to his take on hoops!!!  Sage Steele (@sagesteele) March 20, 2014While guest starring on The View in 2014, Steele was in the mood to discuss Obamacare   but only to say that it would destroy America.So far ESPN has remained silent about one of its reporters so shamelessly censoring the liberal political opinions of someone on their show. Unfortunately, this lack of backbone isn t surprising. ESPN recently came under fire for suspending one of their reporters when he called out ESPN contributor Curt Schilling for being astoundingly ignorant of evolution following one of Schillings almost daily anti-science rants on Twitter. Schilling received no punishment.ESPN wants to be more than just a sports channel, but in order to do that it needs to start respecting the idea of the free exchange of ideas. The people who watch the network probably like watching celebrities play basketball, but they also want to be informed about the world. This kind of blatant censorship has no place, no matter how much Sage Steele might prefer it.Feature image from screen capture via YouTube ",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Exposed As A Speed Tweaker: Suddenly His Megalomania Makes A Little More Sense,"Donald Trump s personality could be described several ways. Some would call him type A   competitive, outgoing, ambitious and aggressive   while others would call him the textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder. Megalomaniac is another that comes to mind. No matter what way you look at The Donald, he definitely doesn t qualify as  typical. As it turns out, there may be a very good, very dangerous, very pharmaceutical reason for it. Gawker recently re-examined an article from 1992 that may have more to do with Donald Trump s failures as a human being than the genes he inherited from his booze and hooker pimping grandfather.As it turns out, a story from Spy Magazine revealed that Trump was a patient of the infamous Dr. Joseph Greenburg, who was known for prescribing an amphetamine-like drug called Tenuate Dospan for a non-existent condition called  metabolic imbalance.  According to the story:Dr. Greenberg s program included no set caloric limit, and Tenuate was prescribed or five months. The long-term use of Tenuate can, according to the medical literature, lead to psychosis delusions of grandeur, say, like the belief that by simply putting your name on real estate properties, you will double their value.According to the NIH, prolonged use of tenuate can lead to hallucinations and confusion. Prolonged is exactly what Trump s exposure to the drug can be described as, according to this medical record obtained by Gawker that shows years of visits to Greenburg by Trump:Gawker was able to confirm by email with a former employee of Greenburg that this is in fact an actual copy of The Donald s record. Since Greenburg s role in Trump s care seemed to only include giving him happy pills that should have been prescribed for no longer than a month, it could be argued that the lasting effects of anger, anxiety and delusions of grandeur are still with the man today. His campaign speeches and lack of ability to hold a coherent thought in an interview for more than a moment or two are fairly clear indicators.The pills had such a detrimental effect on Trump that one of his Vice-Presidents once noted that when he got to work he would ask if it was a  Dr, Greenburg day,  doing everything in his power to avoid the boss if the answer was yes.Does Trump s obsession with fitness and physical appearance have something to do with his obvious desire to be thin and trim? His personal attacks on people based solely on their looks do a pretty good job of answering that question.Featured image from Gawker via screen capture ",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Columbine Shooter Dylan Klebold’s Mother Breaks Silence In Riveting New Interview (VIDEOS),"Columbine was the original school shooting. Sure, there had been others, but that was the one that got the world s attention. It was the horror that was to become all too common in America s high schools and colleges. On that fateful day   April 20, 1999   the nation was rocked when 17-year old Dylan Klebold and 18-year-old Eric Harris went to their own high school and opened fire. They wounded 24 victims and killed 13 more. The truly horrific part of all of this is the fact that it could have been much worse   because, even more than a school shooting, Columbine was a failed bombing. Klebold and Harris had brought several homemade propane bombs with them in their efforts to make sure their attack on their school reached maximum effect   but the bombs failed to detonate.In the past, the parents of these infamous school shooters have refused to talk to the press on television. However, that all changed when Sue Klebold, Dylan Klebold s mother, decided to break her silence and sit down for an intimate interview with Diane Sawyer   her first television appearance ever regarding her son s devastating crimes.Mrs. Klebold talked about the guilt she has lived with over what her son did, and about the many things that she missed that, in hindsight, may have prevented this travesty, saying: I had all those illusions that everything was OK because, and more than anything else, because my love for him was so strong. Klebold then acknowledges that she understands why some parents blame her, why they believe that she and her husband should have seen that something was not right with their son long before he took it upon himself to commit any such atrocity. Before Columbine happened I would have been one of those parents. If I had recognized that Dylan was experiencing some real mental distress, he would not have been there. He would ve gotten help. I don t ever, for a moment, mean to imply that I m not conscious of the fact that he was a killer, because I am. Klebold hopes to help parents who might be unknowingly missing the signs that they might be raising killers by speaking out, both in this interview, and the book she has written, entitled A Mother s Reckoning, which will come out next week. Klebold says what we all know: that hindsight is always 20/20. I wish I had known then what I know now: that it was possible for everything to seem fine with him when it was not, and that behaviors I mistook as normal for a moody teenager were actually subtle signs of psychological deterioration. Perhaps the most powerful lesson comes from an essay Sue Klebold wrote for O Magazine, which is that you try to protect your kids from outside dangers, and can often fail to recognize the internal ones. She says in the essay:  I taught him how to protect himself from a host of dangers: lightning, snake bites, head injuries, skin cancer, smoking, drinking, sexually transmitted diseases, drug addiction, reckless driving, even carbon monoxide poisoning. It never occurred to me that the gravest danger   to him and, as it turned out, to so many others   might come from within. Most of us do not see suicidal thinking as the health threat that it is. We are not trained to identify it in others, to help others appropriately, or to respond in a healthy way if we have these feelings ourselves. Hopefully, this brave mother accomplishes her goal of saving lives through telling her own story, and hopefully she can one day find some kind of peace with what her son did.You can watch Sue Klebold tell her story in the clips below, courtesy of ABC News: ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosFeatured image from video screen capture via ABC News",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Just Did Something Amazing For Medical Marijuana Policy,"This week, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to the Center for Disease Control s Director, Thomas Friedman. In the letter, Warren urges them to begin to consider medical marijuana as a way of combating skyrocketing rates of opioid addiction.Warren called for the CDC to do two things specifically in her letter. Warren wants the CDC to work with other organizations to fill in the  gaps  in the government s knowledge on the  the use, uptake and effectiveness of medical marijuana as an alternative to opioids for pain treatment in states where it is legal . Warren also asked for them to find out more about the  the impact of the legalization of medical and recreational marijuana on opioid overdose deaths .The CDC s own website makes it very clear that there is a problem with patients being overprescribed opiates and the deadly consequences it has had on society. They write: In a period of nine months, a tiny Kentucky county of fewer than 12,000 people sees a 53-year-old mother, her 35-year-old son, and seven others die by overdosing on prescription painkillers obtained from pain clinics in Florida. In Utah, a 13-year-old fatally overdoses on oxycodone pills taken from a friend s grandmother. A 20-year-old Boston man dies from an overdose of methadone, only a year after his friend also died from a prescription painkiller overdose.These are not isolated events. Each day, 44 people in the United States die from overdose of prescription painkillers. Chronic pain is the number one reason that people are prescribed medical marijuana. As much progress as has been made in efforts to legalize medical marijuana have been, there is still a long way to go. 27 states still have yet to legalize medical marijuana. If the CDC were to find enough evidence to come out in support for the legalization of medical marijuana as a way to curb opioid prescriptions, it would be a huge win for medical marijuana advocates.Featured image from elizabethwarren.com",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher Hilariously Rips Donald Trump’s Unemployment Lie To Shreds (VIDEO),"On Friday, during a segment of Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedic host utterly destroyed Donald Trump s latest round of lies. The most notable example of Trump s no f#cks given, blatant lying relates to unemployment. Trump has stated multiple times that he has  heard  that the unemployment rate is really somewhere around 40 percent. Trump s continued use of the bogus talking point, has recently garnered new attention.Politifact gave Trump a  Pants on Fire  rating when he made the claim during a televised press conference back in September. It is just one among his total of the 18  Pants on Fire  ratings that Trump has received from them. During the press conference, Trump said: The number isn t reflective. I ve seen numbers of 24 percent   I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent. 5.3 percent unemployment   that is the biggest joke there is in this country.   The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it s a 30, 32. And the highest I ve heard so far is 42 percent. Maher marveled at how ridiculous the claim is. Maher pondered what exactly an America with a 40% unemployment would look like. He mentions the horrific realities of the life during the Great Depression. During that dark time in the United States economic history, the unemployment rate was at its highest was 25 percent. Almost half of Trump s claim. Maher asks: Do you have any idea what America would look like with 40 percent unemployment? In the Great Depression, people were jumping out of windows and selling apples on the street. Maher laid part of the blame for Trump and other Republican s ability to get away with making such bold and obvious lies, with the media. He points out the lack of outrage in the media over the Supreme Court s decision earlier this week to block most of President Obama s new carbon emission rules, as an example.You can watch the segment below, in full.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXVhR5rC7rg Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube ",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher Lights Up A Joint And Gets Real About Pot Legalization (VIDEO),"Bill Maher is a hardcore supporter of the legalization of marijuana. On Friday, during a segment of  New Rules  on the HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, the host laid out his case for legalizing marijuana. He also admonished Congress for refusing to legalize marijuana, despite historically high (no pun intended) levels of support for the legalization of the drug.Maher even went as far as to light up a joint while he railed against the powers in place that are preventing marijuana legalization efforts from succeeding. This is the first time that Maher has smoked marijuana on his show. It is, however, not the first time someone has smoked marijuana while on the show.In the fall of 2010, Zach Galifianakis appeared on the show as a guest. During the middle of a segment, Galifianakis quietly and calmly lite up a joint, with hilarious consequences.Maher noted how horrible it is that people who use medical marijuana cannot use their medicine in other states where it is not legal. It s not a tenable situation. When I leave Colorado, Oregon, Washington or Alaska, my back pain doesn t go away. Or whatever it is I have. I m kidding   I use medical marijuana because my third eye has glaucoma. Maher pointed out how utterly ridiculous it is that in 2016, Congress has not made any serious effort to pass marijuana legalization legislation. Maher says: Somehow, this is the year that everything from socialism to mass deportation is on the table and voters love the authentic guys who speak their minds, but when it comes time for Congress to consider common-sense pot legislation, it s like smoking a joint with Woody Harrelson; they just won t pass it! I couldn t agree with Maher more. It s time for the self-described Republican lovers of  small government  in Congress to put their legislation where their mouth is. Marijuana is now is legal in twenty-three states, as well as the District of Columbia, in one form or another. Of those, four states and Washington D.C have fully legalized recreational marijuana. That number is expected to dramatically increase over the next few years.You can watch the segment from the show below.Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Kentucky Democrat’s Brilliant Bill Would Require Men To Obtain Note From Wives To Get Viagra,"In response to her male GOP colleague s insistence that women s reproductive decisions be ridiculously regulated, a female Kentucky lawmaker is fighting back.Democratic state Rep. Mary Lou Marzian is sick and tired of Republicans attacking abortion rights in her state and she isn t taking it anymore. So she introduced Bill 396, which would require men to seek permission slips from their wives and present the note to their doctor in order to get access to Viagra, a little blue pill that gives men boners.And that s not all. In addition to the note, men must also put their hand on a Bible at the doctor s office and swear an oath that they are married and are only using the Viagra so they can have sex only with their wives. That means  family values  conservative lawmakers would have to promise the Lord that they want to have sex with their wives and not that pretty intern they ve been perving on for weeks.Sorry, Republicans. Not kidding. The bill literally requires a  man to make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse. I want to protect these men from themselves,  Marzian told the Courier-Journal about the legislation.  This is about family values. She knows what she is talking about, too. Marzian is a trained nurse so if she says this is about protecting men s health, then it must be taken seriously.Of course, Republicans will never take this kind of legislation seriously until a women-dominated legislature is in place ready to show men what it feels like to have their bodies and privacy attacked.This isn t the first time a female lawmaker has fought fire with fire. Many have introduced the same kind of bill in states across the country, including Ohio state Senator Nina Turner back in 2012. Her bill would have required men to visit a sex therapist, undergo a cardiac stress test, and get their sexual partner to sign a notarized affidavit confirming impotency in order to get a prescription for Viagra.And like Turner s bill, Marzian s bill is a direct response to an extreme anti-abortion bill. Senate Bill 4, which Kentucky Republicans actually passed, forces women to obtain  informed consent  from a counselor 24 hours prior to getting an abortion. Do we really want a bunch or legislators interfering in private, personal, medical decisions?  Marzian asked.Only male lawmakers do apparently, as long as the interference is in the private, personal, and medical decisions of women and not men.Featured Image: Tim Reckmann/Wikimedia",News,"February 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bizarre Reason Right-Wing Actor James Woods Is Suing A Twitter User For $10 Million,"Right-wing actor James Woods is so upset that a liberal made fun of him on Twitter that he is suing for $10 million dollars. Woods, who has been in Hollywood for several decades, is part of a secretive Hollywood club of conservatives called Friends of Abe.A Twitter user, who goes by the name of  Abe List  has been sued by Woods, after he called the actor a cocaine addict. Woods is now attempting to uncover the true identity of the Twitter user and get an award of damages for the tweet.The spat began when Mr Woods posted on Twitter about a row between Bruce Jenner and Planned Parenthood.He wrote:  USATODAY app features Bruce Jenner s latest dress selection but makes zero mention of Planned Parenthood baby parts market. Abe List replied:  Cocaine addict James Woods still sniffing and spouting. He also referred to Mr Woods as a  joke  and  a ridiculous scum clown-boy .Woods often uses his account to post attacks and smears against President Obama and other liberals (he called Al Sharpton a  pimp ). In his lawsuit, Woods whines that  Abe List  is a  cowardly individual  who was the mastermind of a  malicious online campaign  to discredit the actor.In response Lisa Bloom, who is a lawyer representing Abe List, has pointed out that  suggestions that Mr Woods was on drugs was not meant to be taken literally. While Hollywood obviously leans heavily to the left, there are of course conservatives in that industry like there are everywhere else. Yet, it is an article of faith that Hollywood conservatives are somehow frozen out from opportunities in the industry, which helped lead to the creation of the Friends of Abe group. Deceased right-wing provocateur Andrew Breitbart was among the founders of the group, along with Gary Sinise, Kelsey Grammer, Lionel Chetwynd, Jon Voight. They hosted Donald Trump for a get together in July of 2015.While Woods is not an  A-list  actor, he has steadily worked in Hollywood, and recently appeared in the TV series Ray Donovan and in the movie White House Down, hardly the resume of someone being persecuted for his conservative beliefs.Ever the victim.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Democrats May Save Oregon’s Middle Class From GOP With New Wage Law,"The Oregon State Senate has just approved a bill that would increase the state s minimum wage over the next six years in incremental steps.Democrats can be thanked for pushing the measure through on a margin of 16-12, saying that it was necessary to help lift residents out of poverty and handle increasing costs of living. One lone sellout, Democratic Senator Betsy Johnson, voted no along with all Republicans. The bill will raise the minimum wage to $14.75 in Portland, $13.50 in other urban counties, and $12.50 in rural counties to prevent harming business in lower cost of living areas. The current minimum wage in the state is $9.25, which is higher than the federal minimum. However, it still is inadequate, especially in urban areas.The bill passed after a floor debate that lasted six hours. It was introduced by Democratic Senator Michael Dembrow, of Portland. Gradual increases will take place yearly, leading up to the maximum numbers in 2022. The measure is set to move to the State House next, with expectations of approval by Governor Kate Brown.As usual, wealthy wanna-be plutocrats have come out threatening doom and gloom over the attempt to make sure Oregonians are not living in grinding poverty. Jason Brandt, CEO of the Oregon Restaurant and Lodging Association released the following statement: It will kill jobs, harm consumers, force school and government service cuts and hurt Oregon farms and small businesses. We urge the House to defeat this plan that puts election year politics ahead of Oregon s economy. Source: oregonlive.comAll that anyone needs to do is refer to Seattle Seatac, who raised its minimum wage to $15/hour. The results are amazingly good, with an unemployment rate of only 3.3 percent   a rate not seen since 2008. Seatac is also one of the fastest growing airport hubs in the United States, which destroys the myth that a living wage will stifle growth and explode unemployment.One of the most basic concepts of capitalism is lost on literally every Republican who claims to LOVE the system   the fact that more money in the hands of consumers equals higher demand which increases the need for employment. Everywhere a minimum wage goes up, unemployment tends to trend down, and the anecdotal accounts of it weeding out already-failed businesses or spiteful greedy owners can t counter the right-wing propaganda anymore. It s happening, and the positive results are not going to stop.Featured image from Twitter",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Backers Go Full Birther And Slam Ted Cruz With Lawsuit (IMAGE/TWEETS),"Donald Trump supporters have taken it upon themselves to try and throw Texas senator Ted Cruz out of the presidential race   by filing a lawsuit against him.The lawsuit, which was filed on February 3rd at a district court in Alabama, questions if Cruz is even eligible to run for president, considering that he was born in Canada. The lawsuit cites Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which states that  no person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president. The plaintiffs of the lawsuit are Sebastian Green, Shannon Duncan, Kathryn Spears, Kyle Spears and Jerry Parker, all residents of Cullman County as well as loyal fans of The Donald. In the suit, the plaintiffs declared that  Rafael Edward Cruz is ineligible to qualify/run/seek and be elected to the Office of the President of the United States of America. Thomas Drake, the attorney representing the group, explained: Mr. Cruz was born in Canada, and obviously Canada is not a territory or protectorate of the United States, it s not dominion of the United States. And as such, when he was born, at the moment of his birth, location determined his status, and his status was that of a natural-born Canadian citizen. You cannot be a natural-born or native-born citizen of two countries. Birther lawsuit against Ted CruzTwitterTrump has long been raising concern about Cruz s  natural born  status before, in almost the same way he did in 2011 when he went after President Barack Obama s birth certificate, claiming that that Barack wasn t a United States citizen.TwitterTed and Cruz will face each other again on Saturday, and the air between them will surely be even more tense, as the Trump has won the New Hampshire primary and Cruz took the Iowa caucuses.

 Conservative Megachurch Pastor Forced To Resign After Being Busted For Extramarital Affair (VIDEO),"Another conservative  Christian  hypocrite gets exposed and you ll enjoy the hilarious twist at the end.A female parishioner at the Orlando Baptist Church in Florida forced Pastor David Janney to step down in disgrace after she revealed through a lawsuit that he had an affair with her and promised her hush money to stay quiet about it.In 2015, Janney made sexual advances toward Arlene Miranda, a church member since 2008, and sent her text messages professing his fantasies about her. In September of that year, Janney and Miranda had sex at the offices of his charity World Hope, Inc.Afterward, he sent this text regretting that there wasn t a better time or place for their affair and told her that he needed to talk with God and work things out. You re beautiful, you re very sexy, your body is amazing and you re very passionate,  the married 61-year-old pastor wrote.  I wish we had a better place and a better time for today. You re more than I fantasized. Be proud of yourself. [A]md now please give me a few days to work through my mind my heart and talk to my Lord. More than anything I want to be the man of God and your pastor. Janney later told Miranda to stop texting him out of fear that his wife might catch him, to which Miranda asked if she was just a one-night stand. I have tried to help you with your feelings,  he replied as if she s to blame for the situation.  I do not have the ability to deal with your feelings all the time. You have to get a handle on this. According to the lawsuit, Miranda sought council from another pastor at the church, who also seemed to fault her for the affair. Miranda was told she has a  religious duty  to the church and should remain silent to protect Janney.Once he learned that the person in this affair was David Janney, Pastor Don told Plaintiff that she had a religious duty to protect Defendant, the church, and the Orlando Baptist Church community by keeping the affair quiet and silently repenting and praying.This all led up to church officials arranging to pay Miranda for her silence, but once it became clear that they were all lying to her just to cover their own asses, she filed a lawsuit.The church, of course. would rather pretend the affair never took place and released a bullshit statement on Janney s resignation where they stress that him stepping down has nothing to do with the allegations. Pastor Dave Janney resigned as the Senior Pastor effective Sunday, February 7, 2016, not because the allegations against him are true, but because he felt his resignation was in the best interest of the Church. Orlando Baptist Church is saddened by the resignation of Pastor Dave Janney. He leaves with our love and support. As a church we desire to extend grace and love to all, in all that we do. The church will be forming a pulpit committee that will lead in the process of selecting a new pastor. Ultimately our church members will be able to ask questions of, and vote for, any new pastor. In other words, let s not hold the so-called  man of God  accountable for his actions even though they go against everything he preaches.Here s a report of the lawsuit via WFTV.Hilariously enough, Pastor Janney is the same Pastor Janney who participated in a campaign call for Mitt Romney in 2012 with a group of conservative  Christians  who blasted Newt Gingrich for his  moral failures.  You know, because Gingrich had a history of cheating on his wives and then leaving them for the other woman.  When I look at his life I m not concerned about being embarrassed or distracted by his personal issues,  Janney said when he explained his support of Romney over Gingrich three years before inducting himself into the Hypocritical Christian Hall of Fame.Gingrich must be laughing his ass off right about now.

 Here’s A Simple How-To Guide For Shooting Down A ‘Gunsplainer’ (VIDEO/TWEET),"The only thing more irritating to a woman than a mansplainer is perhaps his more dangerous cousin, the gunsplainer.TwitterTo address the horrible type of person, Cosmopolitan teamed up with Everytown for Gun Safety, a movement that aims to end gun violence, to form the campaign Singled Out to raise awareness and empower unmarried women about gun violence and the danger associated with firearms.Singledout.orgThanks to this initiative, a humorous how-to guide has been released that shows women how to deal with a man who repeatedly and condescendingly explains to a woman why she d be safer if she had a gun    also known as a  gunsplainer.  Here s the hilarious short film:It almost seems insane that an adult would make some of these arguments, but the male actor s lines echo the exact arguments that have been used by the National Rifle Association and gun nuts all over America.In the video, a gunsplainer named Gary tries to pick up a woman named Jessica in a bar. They get into a discussion about guns, and Jessica reveals she is in the service, which only eggs Gary on. Before Jessica can run away, Gary has launched into full gunsplaining mode, putting the responsibility on victims to defend themselves with guns. He reveals that he takes his guns literally EVERYWHERE with him, because  These guns are the only things standing between us and tyranny.  Soon, he s opening his jacket to reveal an entire collection of guns hanging around his torso. All the while, he s using sexist pet names like  schnookums  and  lady soldier    which only repulses Jessica even more.Toward the end, Gary actually insists that hammers were the real threat to Americans. His idiocy proves too much for Jessica to stomach, so she walks away right after Gary calls her a  pistol.  In parting, she says: Guess that s why I m going to have to shoot you down. Not only is Gary straight-up irritating, but pretty much every argument he makes is wrong. It s actually been proven that guns don t keep women safer. According to a study, women  with access to firearms become homicide victims at significantly higher rates than men.  Women in America are also 11 times more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other high-income countries. Unfortunately, there are gunsplainers like Gary all around us who are in denial of the facts and keeping America a dangerous place. Hopefully with more awareness and initiatives like Singled Out, the truth will make it through.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 A Hedge Fund Exploiting Death And Destruction Could Spell Big Trouble For A US Congressman,"Progressive hero Alan Grayson is best known as the member of congress who has introduced more legislation than any other. He s remembered for his statements on the GOP s lack of a plan for health insurance, stating  their plan is, if you get sick, you die.  He s also well-known for comparing the Tea Party to the KKK.From the outside, Grayson is a true American success story. Born in the Bronx, Grayson managed to make his way through Harvard Law, becoming a multi-millionaire as a trial lawyer. On the inside, however, some serious questions have arisen.A House Ethics Committee investigation is underway looking into a trio of hedge funds operated by Grayson that may have broken several rules for second-source income, use of congressional staffers for private enterprise and misuse of government travel expenses. Two of the hedge funds, that have since been closed, were located in the Cayman Islands, and one in the US.As a United States Congressman, Grayson is forbidden from earning more than $27,500 from a second source. While he states he had no taxable income from the funds during his time as a congressman, which include terms from 2009-2011 and 2013 to present. Grayson started the funds in 2012 while not serving, but kept them open when he won reelection for 2013. The question of his income comes because he was still listed as a manager of the fund, which typically comes with a price tag.Emails from Grayson s staff, as well as income disclosures, show that at least one of his staffers appeared to be employed by the fund and the congressman at the same time. Though the earnings were as light as $1K per month, there are still clear ethics violations that have to be investigated.Evidence also shows that Grayson has used taxpayer funds to manage the fund from abroad and possibly to solicit new investors to the fund, a charge he vehemently denies. While on a trip to Tampa to present a proposal for increases to social security in August 2015, Grayson reportedly scuttled his agenda to manage the hedge fund as markets bottomed out across the globe because of turmoil in China.What this all spells is big trouble for Alan Grayson. He s convinced that the DNC is working against him in a bid to see another Democrat elected to the senate seat being vacated by Marco Rubio. Unfortunately, the most disturbing news about Grayson and his hedge fund comes from his own brochures and admissions, where he asserts that the philosophy of the fund is to invest in low-cost markets where political turmoil, civil unrest, war, famine and  blood in the streets  offers unique opportunities when the area rebuilds.His funds have all but failed, and his investors have all been paid back what they have lost, making him quite possibly the most decent of congressional rule-breakers, but a rule breaker nonetheless.",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Of All The Candidates Running For President, Only One Pays Their Interns","Here s a nice little factoid for you: out of all the candidates running for president this year, only one actually pays their interns. Can you take a guess as to who that one person might be? It s none other than your favorite democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders.You heard that right: No one else, not Donald Trump, not even Hillary Clinton, pay their interns, not in a house, not in a tree, not anywhere (to borrow a line from Dr. Suess).The Washington Post ran an unofficial investigation from the angle of how  Presidential candidates ignore the costs of unpaid internships  despite their rhetoric to the contrary. It s particularly fitting considering they talk a big game about the  eroding middle class and rising social inequality,  yet they treat their own workers like slaves.Even the leading Republican candidates talk about income inequality openly, even though they may not get as much press coverage on the topic, yet still, somehow Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump don t care enough to pay their interns. Not Bernie Sanders, though. He pays his interns $10.10 an hour. Not too shabby!While we will admit this is nowhere close to the $15.00 an hour Bernie advocates for on the campaign trail, it s far and above anything else the other candidates are offering.If you believe in a higher minimum wage, this should be important to you. If you think workers need to be treated with respect, this difference between the candidates should be important to you. What better predictor is there for how a candidate is going to conduct themselves in office than how they conduct their own campaign?Featured image via Flickr",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Furious That Even Fox News Is Reporting How Low The Deficit Is Under Obama (VIDEO),"Something extraordinary happened that is certain to have Republicans and Republican voters everywhere furious   Fox News just admitted that the United States deficit is at its lowest level since 2008. That s right, since the last Republican was in office. You have to admit, this must have taken a lot of courage on the behalf of Fox News to admit something like this. It goes directly against their  bash President Obama for everything  policy.However, there it is, in bold print on FoxBusiness.com:They even published this, which will make every Republican that follows Fox News as a religion and believe without question, do a double take: The U.S. ran a budget surplus in January, dropping the annual deficit to its lowest level since August 2008, the Treasury Department said Wednesday.The U.S. deficit fell to $405 billion over the 12-month period ended January, or around 2.2% of gross domestic product, boosted by a $55 billion surplus in January. The deficit figure was down from the year-earlier $495 billion, or 2.8% of GDP.  Quite a change of heart when Fox News actually sees the results of Obama s actions. Unlike how they behaved years ago after the president first took office, which you can view here, when they completely ignored deficit reduction:Fox Business even explained how the reduction in deficit was achieved: Revenues stood around 6% above their year-earlier levels, while outlays were around 3% higher. Receipts of $314 billion collected by the Treasury was a record for the month of January.The latest report showed annual revenues posted their slowest rate of growth since August 2012. Corporate tax receipts for the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1., ran around 10% below their year-earlier level. Individual taxes withheld by employers and payroll tax revenues were up 3%, while other individual taxes, such as capital gains, were 8% higher. Funny how when you have a president that truly believes in math, they can actually achieve success in regards to deficit reduction, and understands that in order to pay for things, we need revenue coming in. Republicans have yet to figure that out.Now, if only we could get Republicans to actually look at the presidents latest budget, which as of now, they have simply refused to even entertain.The GOP is literally a vomit stain on the rug of America that we can t seem to remove.Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Makes Ellen Choke Up Discussing Her Role In LGBT Equality (VIDEO),"It has been a long and windy road for the LGBT community, one they are still traveling, to have true equality under the law. One of the people who really helped clear the path for so many individuals frightened to come out of the closet was Ellen DeGeneres (full disclosure: myself included). She was brave at a time when it wasn t yet okay to be brave. She was strong at a time when it was still dangerous for many LGBT individuals to live outside the closet. However, she came out, and not only was she able to be successful, but she is a powerhouse in the entertainment industry, an inspiration to those who needed to know it s okay to be who you are, and just an outright tremendous human being who has been thriving as her true self.So, as Ellen thanked President Obama on her show for all the amazing support he has shown for the gay community, and all the progress that s been made under his leadership, Obama, being the honest and humble man that he is, turned the conversation back to Ellen.He said: As much as we ve done with laws and ending Don t Ask Don t Tell, etc., changing hearts and minds, I don t think anyone has been more influential than you on that. I really mean that. That s true  You know, your courage and you re just really likable  You, being willing to claim who you were, that suddenly empowers other people, and suddenly it s your brother, your uncle, it s your best friend, it s your coworkers. And then attitudes shift and the laws followed. It started with folks like you. I m so proud of you. Ellen, clearly touched by this moment of gratitude from the President of the United States, tries to return to center by joking,  I m not really gay,  which got a huge laugh from the crowd.However, the president is correct. Ellen s bravery opened the doors to people accepting gay individuals for who they are. She helped the nation and the world see that gay individuals are just like everybody else, and are in our communities, our churches, our circle of friends, and even our homes. And for myself, she made it okay to come out. She opened the door for so many people in that same regard. So, thank you, Ellen. You deserve all the praise the president just gave you, and more.This episode of The Ellen Show was absolutely fantastic and not only showed this touching moment, but also a moment of pure hilarity when the president read aloud a love poem to the First Lady.Watch here to see the touching moment between President Obama and Ellen:Video/Featured image from EllenTube",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 MSNBC Sources Say Everyone At Network Is Disturbed By Joe Scarborough’s Love Of Donald Trump,"Political pundit Joe Scarborough has a Donald Trump problem, and that makes MSNBC have a Joe Scarborough problem.While other networks, including the ultra-conservatives at Fox News, have been combative with Republican front-runner Trump, MSNBC s Joe Scarborough is cozying up to the unapologetic bigot in a way that has almost everyone at the progressive network extremely worried. It s one thing to have a conservative pundit who can represent  the other side  of the aisle; it s quite another when he s the turning out to be a big fan of a racist, sexist demagogue.CNN s Dylan Byers spoke with numerous sources within MSNBC and found that there is broad agreement that Scarborough is embarrassing both himself and the network with the Trump love.In background discussions, NBC News and MSNBC journalists, reporters and staffers said there was widespread discomfort at the network over Scarborough s friendship with Trump and his increasingly favorable coverage of the candidate. People don t like that Joe is promoting Trump,  one MSNBC insider said. Others described Scarborough s admiration for Trump as  over the top  and  unseemly. Four of those sources also said that the growing media scrutiny over the two men s relationship has caused the network s leadership to more closely monitor Scarborough s comments.  The higher-ups are definitely aware about what s going on,  said another person within MSNBC.  It s an issue. This comes just a few days after Scarborough was very publicly called out for visiting Trump in New Hampshire on the night of the election to celebrate his landslide victory. The next day, Trump went on Morning Joe to personally thank Scarborough and co-host Mika Brzezinski for their  support  for his campaign. It raised more than a few eyebrows.Hilariously, Scarborough seemed to deny both that he went to Trump s hotel room (he did) and that he  supported  Trump (he does). This sharply contrasts with the reality, which is that Scarborough has consistently painted Trump in a positive light.In recent weeks, Scarborough has spoken about Trump in increasingly glowing terms, praising him as  a masterful politician  and defending him against his political opponents and media critics. The Washington Post has noted that Trump has received  a tremendous degree of warmth from the show,  and that his appearances on the show, in person and over the phone, often feel like  a cozy social club. Scarborough also confessed that he coached Trump during his debate prep.Listening to Scarborough talk about Trump and it s obvious there is a lot of admiration there. Trump s blustering stupidity Scarborough mistakes for decisiveness. He may be a small government ideologue, but he likes that Trump wants total control over everything. It s a tyrannical bent that appeals to a guy like Scarborough who views anyone who uses diplomacy or thoughtful, measured responses as  weak. Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay.  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 12, 2016This is, of course, a nightmare for MSNBC s reputation. Donald Trump might rev Scarborough s engine, but the Republican candidate has consistently demonstrated that he is a racist, xenophobic, hate-mongering narcissist. He has absolutely no realistic policy plans (building a great wall on the border with Mexico doesn t count) and no political experience. Watching one of MSNBC s star hosts worship a guy like this is difficult to endure.Featured image from MSNBC ",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative Indiana Governor’s Stupid Response To LGBT Question Gets Him In Big Trouble (VIDEO),"Indiana Governor Mike Pence is at the center of a political and human rights predicament of his own making.It all relates to what he said   or what he didn t say   when confronted with a question about LGBT rights. Speaking at a town hall in Kokomo, the Republican governor was unable to directly answer a simple yes or no question, taking 13 seconds to respond and then delving into defending religion. Here is the question from an unidentified audience member: In a simple yes or no answer, do you believe that gay and transgender people should be able to be fired from their jobs just for that reason? Pence immediately had difficulty with the question, taking time to think about it. Moreover, the applause for the question itself threw him off.  Here is Pence s pensive response:  It s a great privilege for me to be your governor, I don t think anyone should ever be discriminated against because of who they are or who they love. My position as I expressed in my State of the State Address, and did again today, is we are a state with a constitution. And as you know, as a pastor, that constitution has very strong safeguards for the freedom of conscience and freedom of religion of Hoosiers And my strong conviction is that, should the General Assembly put legislation on my desk, which they considered this year, and should I continue to be governor and they ever do in the future, it just must be consistent with the constitution. But I will not support legislation that diminishes religious freedom. I hope you hear my heart a little bit as much as my head on this, because it really is a great privilege to serve you.  I thank you for the question. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbHm2wtl6F8]He s clearly throwing red herrings with his talk about religion, never answering the question directly. Freedom Indiana immediately turned the clip into a political ad:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY1FeQIgjsY]The problem with Republican conservatives like Pence is that they fail to realize why they are in office in the first place: to serve the public, and that includes everyone   including the LGBT community. Once there is evidence that they are not serving the entire public, then that s when people like Pence should be fired.

 Caught On Camera: Devastating Moment 2100 People Find Out Job Outsourced (VIDEO),"Some companies definitely prefer increased profit over principle and, clearly, patriotism. Yet another U.S. company, this time Carrier, decided that they would be relocating their Indianapolis, IN, plant to Monterrey, Mexico. This relocation will, in turn, put 2,100 people out of work come 2017.The company, of course, in a state-run by a supposed business friendly Republican, Gov. Mike Pence, is blaming regulations and the high cost to run business here at home. In a statement put out by HVAC Systems and Services North America president Chris Nelson: This move is intended to address the challenges we continue to face in a rapidly changing HVAC industry, with the continued migration of the HVAC industry to Mexico, including our suppliers and competitors, and ongoing cost and pricing pressures driven, in part, by new regulatory requirements, Relocating our operations to a region where we have existing infrastructure and a strong supplier base will allow us to operate more cost effectively so that we can continue to produce high-quality HVAC products that are competitively positioned while continuing to meet customer needs. Nelson, trying to have a heart, but failing miserably, also said: This decision is difficult and we recognize the impact on employees, their families and the community. We are committed to ensuring that our employees are treated respectfully and to working closely with their representatives throughout this transition. Actually having a heart, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett (D) issued his own statement regarding the devastating blow to the local economy: A job lost in any part of our community affects us all, and I believe these are the times we must come together as one city to lift up our neighbors. That is why this afternoon I will issue and Executive Order to create a task force that will convene local, state, and federal resources and direct every tool at our disposal toward supporting these workers in the days ahead. You can actually witness and listen to Carrier tell their employees that they will soon be out of work in this video below. The gasps are audible and the anger is palpable, justifiably so. You can hear the company try to explain themselves to their employees. And unfortunately, due to the rotten discourse created by the likes of people like Donald Trump, you can hear one employee blame Mexicans. To add insult to injury, Carrier simply states: This is simply a business decision.

 Ohio Cop Suspended After Disgusting Facebook Post Celebrating Suicide Of #BlackLivesMatter Activist (IMAGE/VIDEO),"Cops are no fan of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. They don t like it because it shines a light on the systemic racism, the so-called  Blue Code of Silence,  and brutality, murder and corruption that is so prevalent in police culture. While this is understandable, considering their positions, some things are just beyond the pale. Here is one of those things.#BlackLivesMatter activist MarShawn McCarrel was a pillar of his community, but apparently he had some very deep struggles of his own. He left a post on his own Facebook wall that said that his  demons won.  He committed suicide that same day. While most people who are not complete sociopaths would be upset at anyone s suicide, one Ohio cop had the opposite reaction to McCarrel s death. In fact, this pile of excrement actually reacted joyfully with a Facebook post of his own that read,  Love the happy ending.  Here is a tweet from writer and activist Shaun King that not only showed the officer s, Lee Cyr of the Fairborn Police Department, reaction, but also other equally gross and disrespectful comments.Ohio Officer Lee Cyr suspended for calling the suicide of #MarshawnMcCarrel a ""happy ending"" https://t.co/LpAckz1CNK pic.twitter.com/2IzMO6zj9R  Shaun King (@ShaunKing) February 12, 2016Luckily, the police department s actions were swift, and Cyr has been suspended. The Chief of the Department, Terry Barlow, said of the incident: When we were made aware of a Facebook post that was linked to a Fairborn police officer, an internal affairs complaint was initiated. Posts that may discredit the police department are against policy. We take this seriously. We will ensure the professional standards of the department are upheld. While this is all fine and well, Barlow really should have condemned the remarks for how absolutely disgusting they were, rather than just worrying about this cop s views being a blight on his department s image.As far as I am concerned, this department is definitely discredited without a much stronger condemnation of this cop s words, and without a full termination. He has no business policing anyone, especially not black people.Watch a news report on the story below, courtesy of local station WHIO:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story ",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Twitter Wishes Lincoln Happy Birthday With Hilarious #ThingsLincolnDidntSay Hashtag (TWEETS),"February 12, is the 207th anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln s birth, and Twitter decided to celebrate it like only the social media giant can: with a hilarious hashtag.If you are an avid social networking user, then you have probably come across a quote attributed to President Lincoln or some other famous historical figure and thought, He definitely didn t say that.  It happens so often that it s an internet joke, just slap a quote next to someone notable s face and you have a viral internet meme shared by thousands (sometimes millions) of really stupid people. President Lincoln is often the person in many of those memes, so Twitter users decided to celebrate his birthday with #ThingsLincolnDidntSay:I m excited for the future of my party. #ThingsLincolnDidntSay pic.twitter.com/8rUBVSKSvx  Simar Ahluwalia (@sahluwal) February 12, 2016  In 150 years, the Republican Party will be greater than ever !  #ThingsLincolnDidntSay pic.twitter.com/uCLP0mQUNl  TrivWorks (@TrivWorks) February 12, 2016#ThingsLincolnDidntSay  Brian Williams, what are you doing here at Gettysburg?  pic.twitter.com/3StneMusxB  Vlad Bayon (@misterdish69) February 12, 2016  If this gets retweeted 1 million times I ll end slavery. #ThingsLincolnDidntSay pic.twitter.com/JEueYSYewb  MJ  (@MJGWrites) February 12, 2016Jeez, Mary, I need to see a play like I need a hole in the head. #ThingsLincolnDidntSay  John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) February 12, 2016 Four score and seven beers ago #ThingsLincolnDidntSay  Elizabeth So Totally (@elizablitzed) February 12, 2016Hey, I wonder how my face would look on our LEAST VALUABLE ITEM OF CURRENCY#ThingsLincolnDidntSay  Dreamweasel (@Dreamweasel) February 12, 2016 #ThingsLincolnDidntSay I m a vampire hunter  R IN (@_A_W_W_R_) February 12, 2016There are so many more of them, you should definitely check out the entire thread.President Lincoln is arguably one of the greatest presidents we have ever had and Republicans often like to pretend that he was their president. It is true, he was a Republican, but if he were alive today there is absolutely no doubt that he d be considered a filthy liberal.The GOP is always trying to divide our country, especially the far-right anti-government Tea Party crazies. President Lincoln, on the other hand, went to war to keep the country from splitting apart   that s how much he loved the Union. So it s pretty safe to say that he would not support the Confederate flag waving, Bundy militia supporting, Obama-hating Republican Party of 2016. I will leave you with an actual quote from the sixteenth president, one that the right needs to remember:  A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved   I do not expect the house to fall   but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Happy birthday, President Lincoln!

 The Koch Brothers Now Bankrolling The Bundy Anti-Government Agenda To Sell Off Public Land,"If you were wondering how a bunch of wannabe revolutionaries could afford to spend all of their time occupying wildlife refuges and pointing guns at federal agents instead of working, the answer is becoming more obvious: They are being bankrolled by the billionaires who hate the government just as much as they do.Just as the last few Bundy militia hold outs were finally being rounded up and sent to jail, the Koch brothers announced that their heavily-funded powerful political network would be shifting to focus on dismantling laws that allow the government to own public lands. The Bundys  plea for snacks and temper tantrums over sex toys may have made most of us laugh, but they clearly impressed the Kochs.ThinkProgress explains:Though ClimateProgress has previously uncovered and reported on the dark money that the Kochs have provided for political efforts to seize and sell public lands, recent organizational changes reveal that the Koch network is providing direct support to the ringleader of the land grab movement, Utah state representative Ken Ivory, and has forged an alliance with groups and individuals who have militia ties and share extreme anti-government ideologies.Ivory is one of the shamelessly corrupt legislators currently in office. He freely acknowledges that he receives a $135,000 a year salary from an organization called  American Lands Council  which works to erode America s protected forests so oil and gas companies can move in. Not surprisingly, he s also one of the most aggressive opponents of the very concept of federal land, introducing bills to sell it off to private companies. In fact, Ivory claims he works 60 hours a week at ALC, leaving him little time to actually represent his state in any meaningful capacity.He will now be leaving that anti-government organization to head another one: Federalism in Action and will help start the group s  Free the Lands  project. His replacement at ALC is Montana State Senator Jennifer Fielder   and she s not any better.Fielder s selection as ALC s CEO suggests that the group is tightening its ties with the violent anti-government elements of the land seizure movement that is represented by Cliven Bundy and his sons. Fielder s land seizure efforts and campaign for Montana State Senate, for example, were vocally supported by a Militia of Montana organization that is run by white supremacist John Trochmann. In a recent blog post Fielder also expressed her support for the Bundys and the Oregon militants by referring to them fondly as  cowboys  and  protesters  performing  an act of civil disobedience  and bringing  new light to the widespread problems of a distant federal bureaucracy in control of local land management decisions. Her backers   the Koch brothers   probably love the Bundy family as well. They don t have any interest in cattle grazing fees, surely, but they certainly salivate over the idea of seeing federally protected land turned over to the public. They have enough money to buy a large chunk of it. That means more fracking, more oil drilling, and more land for chemical waste deposits. A whole new opportunity to make a fortune.In recent years, the Koch brothers have began freaking out because the massive amount of money they spent on influencing elections hasn t really worked out well for them. In 2012, they went all out of defeat President Obama, spending over $400 million in a scorched-earth campaign. The money might as well have been thrown in a bonfire. Obama won in a landslide. Since then they ve doubled down, suggesting they may spend up to a billion in 2016, but clearly they are shaken.Rather than keep wasting money on losing in general elections, the billionaires appear to be shifting a lot of their energy towards individual targets. Hence we see them align themselves with the Bundy militia and their allies. With less money and less scrutiny, Koch Industries can still get its way   just on a smaller scale.Feature image via YouTube screengrabs ",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Recites A Love Poem To The First Lady On National Television (VIDEO),"President Obama is forced to spend another Valentine s day away from his wife this year, but that didn t stop him winning his efforts to remind her how much he loves her   by wooing her on national television.On Friday s installment in the Ellen Show, the First Lady had done some impromptu wooing of her husband by appearing in a surprise broadcast. Roses are red, violets are blue, you are the president and I am your boo. But little did she know that the Commander-in-Chief was all prepared to deliver his own Valentine s day present to Mrs. Obama. Somebody call the Situation Room because things are about to get hot,  he said as he emerged from red curtains, surrounded by flowers and the Barry White kicked in. Michelle, this Valentine s Day I m going to treat you right. I m going to make you some zucchini bread. Then I ll spread out some veggies on a plate just the way you like them. Then I ll give you a massage while you watch  Ellen s Design Challenge  on HGTV. Because I love you so much, I Obamacare about you more than you even know. But laughter aside, the President took a moment to get real. Michelle,  he said.  I ve made a lot of great decisions as president. The best decision I ever made was choosing you. Thanks for putting up with me. I love you. It s the first time Obama has appeared on the Ellen Show in person since his 2007 appearance, during which he impressed the world by managing some dance moves that defied the  dad dancing  routines of other candidates. With this return, he becomes the first President to make an in-studio appearance on the show.Ellen, who is married to actress Portia de Rossi, took a moment to thank the President for his action on Equal Marriage rights, which meant she was able to stay married to her very own  strong, beautiful  wife.All in all, it was a tour-de-force for the President, who seems to be spending his final year in the White House loosening up and chilling out. He has no further elections to win. He won them all. It s at moments like this we realize we re going to really miss the Obama White House when it s over.You can watch a segment of Obama s conversation with Ellen about being President and being married to Michelle Obama below: Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Latino Celebrities Release An Open Letter Explaining How Screwed The Republican Party Is,"On Thursday, over 20 Latino celebrities including Benjamin Bratt, America Ferrera, George Lopez, Aubrey Plaza, Zoe Saldana and Carlos Santana released an open letter through the People for the American Way. The letter was addressed to the Latino community concerning the Republican candidates running for Racist-in-Chief and it explained, very simply, that the Republican Party has committed electoral suicide:The candidates cannot come back from these hardline stances. Trump is certainly an outlier for his racist remarks. But the rest of the Republican presidential candidates went off the deep end with him.Our communities have the power to decide who wins in the 2016 election. We hope that power is used to vote for candidates who support our community, share our values, and will fight for working families. Neither Trump nor any of his fellow Republican candidates meet that standard.Even if the eventual Republican nominee backtracks on his or her anti-immigrant sentiments, we must not forget that we ve now seen that in the face of bigotry, the Republican candidates have chosen to turn their backs on our community. The current slate of GOP candidates has proven to us that they ve joined and embraced the party of Trump.This is exactly why I ve been so excited about Trump s campaign. In previous elections, the  liberal  media helped Republicans maintain the fiction that they weren t xenophobic bigots. But with the coming of Trump, that s all over. He s been so open about his loathing for Latinos that the other candidates have been forced to abandon their coded language in order to compete for the attention of their breathtakingly racist base.This, in turn, has made it perfectly clear to the Latino community that the Republican Party is not interested in them in the slightest but rather only in  pandering to the anti-immigrant base of the Republican Party that idolizes Donald Trump. The longer this goes on, the worse it will get and it MUST go on because racism and hate is all Republicans have left anymore. If Republicans try to appeal to Latino voters in any way at all, their base will instantly revolt. They are caught in a trap of their own making and it is truly a glorious thing to behold.In an individual statement, America Ferrera said: It s critical that all Americans, and especially American Latinos, stand up to the misrepresentation of our communities coming from Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and any other candidate running on a platform of xenophobia and fear-mongering. The way to do that is to show up on Election Day. And that means young Latinos have to register and vote. We have the numbers and potential to make a difference. This, of course, is the GOP s worst nightmare come true. Latinos voting en masse would take power away from the poor, oppressed white people of America.Carlos Santana sent a more hopeful message to Republicans that will 100% fall on deaf ears: To Donald Trump and the Republican candidates Spirit requires integration and total acceptance of everyone on this blessed planet. I invite you to utilize your power of wealth, to restore, amend and heal your relationship with all your sisters and brothers! It s never too late to graduate from the university of fear! I believe in you! Your light can make a difference on our great nation-when the power of love replaces the love for power. Divinity is who you really are   LIGHT. Peace to you, your families and all your immigrant employees. I ve said this many times before and I ll keep saying it: There s a reason the black community votes 90%+ Democratic and it s not because Democrats have made the black community a top priority. They haven t and it s an uphill battle to get Democrats to do more for their black voters. Even knowing that, the black community votes Democratic because they know, as sure as the sun will rise, that the Republican Party hates them with every fiber of their beings. Republicans are not indifferent like Democrats, they are actively hostile and work to make things worse for the black community whenever and wherever possible.Now the Latino community is learning the same lesson. Republicans are no longer content to mostly ignore the Latino community, they are going out of their way to demonize it and are openly planning to hurt Latino families to appease their rabidly racist base.Republicans have awoken the sleeping giant and they re going to pay dearly for it in the very near future.

 Donald Trump Attacks Ted Cruz With The Single Most Hypocritical Move Of The Campaign (IMAGE),"Republican Presidential front runner Donald Trump has one of the worst honesty ratings of any politician evaluated in the history of Politifact. Yet, he has just launched an attack on Ted Cruz asking: How can Ted Cruz be an evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2016Firstly, asked by a candidate of integrity, or a voter, this is a totally acceptable question. Ted Cruz and the entire Christian Conservative movement fly in the face of the teachings of Jesus. Turning the other cheek, forgiveness, compassion, charity, community, the corrupting influence of wealth, the baselessness of individuality   all of these teachings were totally abandoned. Republican Jesus is actually evangelical libertarian Ayn Rand, and their bible is her book, Atlas Shrugged.However, for trust fund tycoon Donald Trump, this attack is nothing short of the single most hypocritical question of the campaign. Donald Trump is a lying liar who lies. Don t take our word for it. Check out his file on fact checking site Politifact.Just 1% of claims made by Donald Trump are true. One percent! Meanwhile, 3 out of every 5 statements he makes are absolute lies. Let s take a look back at some of those lies:They just keep on coming.And on the matter of faith, Donald Trump is now claiming to be some sort of born again evangelical. Yet, Trump has been married three times, pokes fun of Holy Communion as eating  the little cracker , claims he has never asked God to forgive his sins in his life, and could not name a single passage of the Bible when pressed for his favorite piece of scripture.Trump is about as devout a Christian as Bill Nye.And yet, he is winning evangelical support in droves. Why? Because the evangelical, Christian Conservative movement has zero to do with faith in God, and everything to do with a fanatical conviction in right-wing principles of crony capitalism, white supremacy, homophobia and sexism.If this was not the case, Trump would be the LAST candidate that appealed to Evangelicals. To any right-thinking Christian, he is the 21st century incarnation of the Whore of Babylon.If this contest is going to come down to Ted Cruz or Donald Trump, the Republican party is really being asked whether to die by lethal injection or firing squad. Either way, the party is going to end up dead.Featured Image via T. J.

 Jimmy Kimmel Lets A Little Girl Adorably Mock Sarah Palin On Her 52nd Birthday (VIDEO),"This is cute and hilarious.During his show on Thursday night, Jimmy Kimmel pointed out to his audience that it was Sarah Palin s birthday. The half-wit former governor of Alaska is now 52-years-old and continues to defend her status as America s Village Idiot.Kimmel didn t break out into a rendition of  Happy Birthday,  even though the copyright claim on the song has been vanquished by a federal judge. Instead he let a little girl on stage to deliver a birthday message to Palin dressed as a birthday card.Third-grader Lindsey then stepped through the curtain dressed as Palin with an American flag as the background and gave the audience the most adorable mocking of Sarah Palin ever witnessed. Hi everybody, I m Sarah Palin!  she began. Is today my birthday? You betcha! I m 29-years-old, but the lame-stream media says I m 52.

Well, I gotta go make my husband Todd a moose pie. Obama s the Anti-Christ! Bye-bye! Here s the video via YouTube:As you may all nightmarishly recall, Palin jumped to reappear in the spotlight in order to endorse Donald Trump last month in a bizarre rant that made everyone think of the Yosemite Sam character in the Looney Tunes cartoons. How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution,  Palin said during her endorsement speech.

 Trump Campaign Cops To Black Rally Goers: ‘You’re No Longer Welcome Here’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a flaming racist, and he has made no secret of that. After all, he has a history of calling Mexican immigrants rapists, of calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, and of telling his imbecile supporters to beat up black protesters. Well, if all of that wasn t enough to convince you of the racism of the Trump campaign and of the man himself, this ought to be.Donald Trump took his hate parade of a campaign to South Carolina   to Clemson University, to be precise. A professor at the historic South Carolina university, Chenjerai Kumanyika was at the rally with his friend, A.D. Carson. They listened, first, to (amazingly) gospel television preacher Mark Burris give a prayer/speech, which included the words: Father God, in the name of Jesus, we re truly thankful for the life of Donald J. Trump. We re thankful that you have created a man through the spirit of the Holy Spirit to give him the boldness to say what other people will not say, to do what other people will not do After that, Kumanyika and Carson stood listening to the events of the evening, when they were approached by police officers who told them they had to leave. There was no apparent reason for this, so Kumanyika asked why they were being tossed out.  I m leaving, I m not arguing with you,  he said.  I just want to know why. Once they had exited the event, one cop was kind enough to tell the men why they had been thrown out. The Trump campaign or the Trump people said that you are no longer welcome. Yes, you read that right. The campaign simply said that they were not welcome there. No explanation for that, as they were not protesting or causing a ruckus. Just standing there. The professor said of the incident: I stood peacefully observing Trump s speech. I remained quiet and calm the entire time I was there and never spoke to anyone other than A.D. Eventually, several police officers dressed in military gear grabbed my arm and told me to leave the venue immediately. Again, no protests, just observing like everyone else there. The difference? They re black. That s the only conceivable reason.Luckily, the entire exchange was caught on camera and posted to social media.

" Your Taxes Buy Billionaires Stadiums, They Charge You $7 For A Hot Dog — Obama Says NO MORE","Imagine you re a billionaire who buys himself an NFL team. You re obviously doing well if you can afford to even consider such a venture, but you re about to start raking it in big time. At an average of $85 per ticket, 70,000 people or so are going to come pouring through the gates.They aren t allowed to bring any food or drinks with them, of course, so if they get hungry they ll be feasting on $7.50 hot dogs and $16 cheese steaks. If you toss a couple of Oreos in the fryer at a cost of about 30 cents they ll fork over another six bucks. That s not including the drinks. The bottom of the barrel at most stadiums is the $5 bottled water.Owners love to chalk up the price of tickets and concessions to the amount of money they pay their players. That certainly does factor in, but if you walk through your local mall you ll see ridiculous amounts of merchandise from teddy bears to framed pictures, hats, jerseys, shoes and even pet clothing with your team s logo on them. it s not there for free. Multiply that times every mall in a team s fan base and what you have is an entity that is so ridiculously profitable it goes beyond description.Why, then, are we footing the bill to build these elitist one percenters new stadiums? With very few exceptions, when an owner wants a stadium, they go directly to those whose campaigns they donate to and get the ball rolling on state funds. They sell fans on voting for these funds because  don t you want to have a nicer stadium than the one in Philly?  Ask a Washington fan the answer to that one.At the federal level, owners bilk all of us out of tax dollars through a tax exemption on bond interest that means that even if you live in Billings Montana with no chance of ever going to a Wranglers game (because your market is too small for such a team to exist in any sport), you re paying for that shiny new facility they re planning in Los Angeles.According to a 2012 Bloomberg report, the exemption amounts to roughly $4 billion in federal taxpayer money. In President Obama s FY2017 budget, the exemption is eliminated, which would create a savings of $542 million for the year and hopefully create a more cost-conscious building process for stadiums that will still be footed largely by taxpayers at the state and local level.It s welfare for billionaires. A family of four can save for a year and spend upwards of a thousand dollars for a single afternoon at Texas Stadium, but Jerry Jones should be able to be exempt from millions in taxes because he has so much debt on a stadium he could have written a check for.The Presidents proposal will, of course, be met with Republican opposition, because they are in the business of giving billionaires as much of your money as possible.Featured image from cowboyzone.com ",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Woman Was Body Shamed By Her Boss And Her Response Was PERFECT (IMAGES),"Oklahoma State University student  Sherene Zarrabi loves fashion. She is so fond of it, in fact, that she found a job working at a clothing store called Danity Hooligan while she went to school. But now her beloved job is a thing of the past and it is all because of one extremely nasty boss, a body-shaming email and the young woman s respect for herself.While she worked at Danity Hooligan she also ran the store s Instagram page. During her down time at work, she would try on some of the store s clothes, snap a picture and post it on the social media website as a form of advertising.High buns and combat boots are my new thing. And apparently mirror selfies are my new thing also. #fallfashion #combatboots #highbun #selfieA photo posted by Sherene Zarrabi (@sherenemarie) on Nov 30, 2015 at 5:28pm PSTWhen I m bored at work, I take shameless mirror pics to show off my extra comfy outfit. Fall clothes make me so happy! ??? #fallfashion #ootdA photo posted by Sherene Zarrabi (@sherenemarie) on Nov 14, 2015 at 11:53am PSTYou d think her boss would be thrilled, right?Apparently, not so much. Instead of rewarding her for the time and effort she put into the business, her boss sent an email to the store manager complaining that Sherene didn t have a  model  figure:The email reads: Something I want to make sure you keep in mind: I want size small, the stereotypical  model  type to model our clothes. Please use our pictures of our models if Stillwater can t find someone who would be considered  model material.  This is not to put anyone down but to communicate the expectations of presenting our brand.Don t take it personal. All I ask is for really good representation. In exchange for the freedom, I ask you to take down all pictures of anyone that doesn t fit the criteria. Don t take it personal ? Really?First of all, this young lady is a beautiful woman and she looked amazing in those clothes. This vile human being was lucky to have such a lovely girl in their clothing.Secondly, no woman should ever be made to feel as if they are not good enough no matter what size they are. Body shaming is disgusting and has no place in our society.Fortunately, Sharene gave zero f*cks what her boss thought of her and she responded by promptly quitting and writing the following statement on Facebook:This is an email I was forwarded earlier. I just want to start by saying this: I am fully comfortable with who I am and the way I look. I have recently been attacked and discriminated against by the owner of Dainty Hooligan. She went on our stores Instagram and deleted all of the pictures where I was modeling the clothing and then sent this email to my manager. I do not want to respresent or support a business that has such archaic values and beliefs. THIS is the reason young girls have body image issues. This is disgusting. I quit immediately and I suggest that my friends and family do not support Dainty Hooligan. Love yourself, no matter what you look like.BRAVO!She is exactly right and the best response to that horrible email was removing herself from such a toxic environment. Frankly, if the store owner does not respect ALL women, they have no business selling clothes to us. Women have enough issues with body image as it is, we really don t need someone else shaming us.

 WATCH: Harney County Trio Releases ‘Ballad Of The Malheur Patriots’,"As the 41 day standoff between federal officials and the Bundy terrorists who occupied Oregon s Malheur National Wildlife Sanctuary finally came to an end, a group calling itself The Harney County Trio released a hilarious tribute to the now arrested  patriots. The trio, identified only as Garrett, Laura and Rob, posted the video to YouTube on February 11, just as the last four Bundy terrorists surrendered to federal authorities.The song, titled The Ballad Of The Malheur Patriots, immortalizes Ammon Bundy and his band of  American Heroes,  paying tribute to the most significant moments that occurred during the occupation.From the group s first desperate plea for supplies, sent out just two days into the siege, to the table full of dicks and dildos they got in response, the ballad is both historically accurate and genuinely hilarious.The video incorporates scenes from the standoff, along with authentic footage of the Malheur Wildlife Sanctuary.During the chorus, the group belts out the heartfelt lines, Patriots, patriots storming a building surrounded by ducks. They didn t stand down. They vowed to stand up, even if they didn t know for what. Watch the video below, courtesy of Adele Comedy on YouTube.While it s definitely not the ballad Bundy and his followers must have hoped would someday be written to immortalize their  brave actions,  it s historical value goes without saying.Decades from now, when the world looks back to reflect on the events surrounding the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Sanctuary, this is what our children and our children s children will remember.As for the Bundy terrorists, their delusional ideas of becoming the heroes of future generations will eventually be destroyed by the reality of their own stupid videos and social media posts.So far 24 militants have been charged in connection with the illegal occupation.May those men forever be remembered wherever dicks and dildos are sold.Featured image: screen capture",News,"February 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s The Ted Cruz Ad Starring An Adult Film Star He Doesn’t Want You To See (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz s presidential campaign has pulled an ad featuring a softcore adult film star. The ad, titled  Conservatives Anonymous,  was an attack ad focused on Senator Marco Rubio. In the production, a support group for conservatives talks about being betrayed by Rubio and his flip-flop on immigration.One of the conservatives in the group is played by actress Amy Lindsay, who tells the group,  maybe you should vote for more than just a pretty face next time. When they were asked about Lindsay, the Cruz campaign apparently panicked.Lindsay has appeared in several softcore porn films, including Erotic Confessions, Carnal Wishes, Secrets of a Chambermaid, and Insatiable Desires.BuzzFeed News, after learning of Lindsay s prior filmography, requested comment from the Cruz campaign. Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the campaign is taking the ad down and replacing it with a different one. The actress responded to an open casting call. She passed her audition and got the job. Unfortunately, she was not vetted by the production company. Had the campaign known of her full filmography, we obviously would not have let her appear in the ad,  Tyler said.The revelation comes at a bad time for Cruz. He came in third place in the New Hampshire primary after winning the Iowa caucuses, and hopes to capitalize on social conservative support in order to win the South Carolina primary.Cruz was supported by the right-wing conservative Family Leader, who in the past has called for opposition to pornography which it lumped in with abortion and prostitution as a type of  coercion or stolen innocence. The ad had received praise from conservatives and journalists when it was released on YouTube earlier on Thursday.Now the YouTube page for the ad shows that the video  has been removed by the user.

 WATCH: Eric Garner’s Daughter Tells The World Why She’s Backing Bernie,"Eric Garner s daughter has released a new video in which she endorses Bernie Sanders for president. Erica Garner s father was killed when he was placed in a chokehold by New York City police.In the video, Erica Garner talks about the importance of her family and the struggle of raising her daughter, talking about the problems of racism facing black America in modern times. Garner says she is fighting for racial justice  in honor of her pop-pop  after seeing her father die on national TV. Our people died for this,  Garner continues, saying she s  behind anyone who s going to listen and speak up for us, and I think we need to believe in a leader like Bernie Sanders. We need a president who s going to speak about this,  Garner adds.Eric Garner was selling loose cigarettes when police approached him for selling them without tax stamps. As they went to arrest him, he was put in a chokehold. Garner told them 11 times  I can t breathe,  and he was pronounced dead an hour later.The ad comes as both Sanders and Secretary Clinton are vying for support amongst the black electorate in South Carolina. Unlike the mostly white electorate in New Hampshire and Iowa, about 25 percent of the voters in South Carolina are black. Currently Clinton enjoys an aggregate of 62 percent support in that state, an advantage of 29.5 percent over Sanders.Sanders is hoping to capitalize on the near-tie in the Iowa caucus and his big victory in New Hampshire to eat into Clinton s lead, while also demonstrating that he appeals to more than just white college liberals.The Garner endorsement comes on the same day that Clinton received the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, announced in a press conference where legendary civil rights leader John Lewis pointed out that he did not personally encounter Sen. Sanders during the heyday of the movement.The Sanders campaign also announced today that actor Harry Belafonte had endorsed the senator.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Parents Ban Black History Month Video From School Because Of ‘White Guilt’ (VIDEO),"Thanks to a bunch of parents who cannot handle the truth, a Virginia school district was forced to nix an educational video about racism and inequality from its curriculum after receiving complaints that its message was racially divisive.Using the metaphor of a race track, the video expertly addresses racial disparity in America throughout history in which individual runners encounter various obstacles depending on their race. Created by the African American Policy Forum, the short video has been used hundreds of thousands of times all over America without any issues   up until now.Unfortunately, a few parents in Glen Allen felt it was a  white guilt video  and although officials of Henrico County Public Schools originally stood by the film s much-needed message, those ignorant parents got their way. Two days after saying the video was one component of a thoughtful discussion in which all viewpoints were encouraged,  officials had banned the video, labeling it racially divisive.  They even issued an apology for trying to bring cultural awareness to students!School Board Chair Micky Ogburn said: The Henrico School Board and administration consider this to be a matter of grave concern. We are making every effort to respond to our community. It is our goal to prevent the recurrence of this type of event. School leaders have been instructed not to use the video in our schools. In addition, steps are being taken to prevent the use of racially divisive materials in the future. We do apologize to those who were offended and for the unintended impact on our community. Luke Harris, co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, felt the video was completely appropriate. He said: The video is designed for the general public. We produced something you could show in elementary and secondary schools or in college studies courses. We found that the video has a huge impact on the people that we re showing it to. Most of us know very little about the social history of the United States and its contemporary impact. It was designed as a tool to throw light on American history. It s already a shame that black history is only celebrated one month   the shortest month   out of the entire year, and this proves that even educational videos about the real-life struggles of African Americans don t stand a chance against white privilege. This was a great cartoon that made the obstacles of racism (many of which still exist to this day) easy to understand. Out of the four hundred years of slavery and oppression that black people have had to endure, you would think that the least we could do is watch a four-minute cartoon about it.

 ‘Sex And The City’ Star Forced To Do CRINGEWORTHY Skit While Trying To Discuss Refugees (VIDEO/TWEETS),"Everyone knows actress Kristin Davis from her role as Charlotte on HBO s smash hit Sex and the City. However, that show ended airing over a decade ago, and Davis has gone on to do amazing things in her life and career, including with the United Nations to address the refugee crisis. She s also dedicated a lot of her life to working in Africa with and their wildlife conservation.So, when Davis appeared on the Australian morning show  Sunrise  to discuss the ongoing refugee crisis, she was met with hosts extremely eager to do a  Sex and the City  sketch instead. An absolutely cringeworthy sketch that Davis seemed to woefully agree to do, despite the reason she was there in the first place.

 Congressional Black Caucus Cries Foul Over Supposed Clinton Endorsement (VIDEO),"Earlier this week, following Hillary Clinton s stunning defeat during the New Hampshire primaries, it was widely reported that the Congressional Black Caucus PAC had endorsed the former Secretary of State.Lost in the media coverage was an important distinction between the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), made up of 48 elected officials, and the political action committee (PAC) that actually endorsed Clinton.On February 11, Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, one of the 48 members of the CBC, posted on Twitter.Cong l Black Caucus (CBC) has NOT endorsed in presidential. Separate CBCPAC endorsed withOUT input from CBC membership, including me.  Rep.

 Ted Cruz Was Just Trolled By The Master Campaign Troll — Vermin Supreme (VIDEO),"During a campaign stop, Republican primary candidate Ted Cruz was confronted with the most well-known troll in United States politics. In case you are not in on the joke, Vermin Supreme runs in every presidential election. He is a performance artist who pulls stunts that satirize the U.S. election system.The confrontation was hilarious, to say the least. Supreme and a group of his supporters ambushed Cruz, who was standing outside his campaign bus. They swarmed Cruz, carrying handmade  Vermin Supreme 2016  signs. Shouting into a megaphone, Supreme asks Cruz: Ted Cruz, do you agree that the waterboarding water should be fluoridated? Shouldn t we at least fluoridate the water that we use to water board the bad people with? That s Supreme s act in a nutshell. He makes completely ridiculous comments about either real issues or fictional ones. Supreme rose to fame instantly when a video was published online that showed him campaigning on the promise that if he is elected, everyone will get a free pony.Obviously not knowing what the heck is going on, Cruz flees to the safety of his campaign bus. Once inside Supreme shouts into the megaphone towards the bus: Surrender, Ted Cruz, surrender. We have you surrounded. You must surrender immediately. Put your hands in the air and drop your pants for your safety, thank you. Mr. Cruz, why do you hate America? Sir, why do you hate America? Taking shots at both Cruz s religious zealotry and his hawkish foreign policy platform, Supreme concludes the protest/campaign event/performance piece by holding a prayer. Supreme prays that: That, uh, we don t get into any wars, and the war that we do get into against Narnia, that there will not be very many American causalities.

 Anti-Gay Texas Attorney General Faces Disbarment,"The Texas Bar Association is stepping up to the plate to nail Ken Paxton for violating legal ethics.After the Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal across the nation last summer, some red states threw a collective hissy fit over the decision. In Alabama, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore ordered county judges to disobey the highest court in the land.Texas Republicans also threw a temper tantrum, especially Attorney General Ken Paxton, who told county clerks to defy the Supreme Court ruling as well.  I will do everything I can from this office to be a public voice for those standing in defense of their rights,  Paxton vowed a day after the ruling came down. But unlike Moore, Ken Paxton could end up losing his status on the bar.Because he told clerks to violate the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court, the Texas Bar Association has launched an investigation against Paxton for ethics violations.The new investigation against Paxton comes on top of his indictment for committing securities fraud. If convicted, he faces up to 99 years in prison.Houston lawyer Eddie Rodriguez said that the Board of Disciplinary Appeals is looking into whether or not Paxton should be disbarred, which would prevent him from practicing law in the state, provided being thrown in prison doesn t do the trick first. Attorney General Paxton has a right to disagree with a ruling of the Supreme Court,  Rodriguez told Reuters.  Lawyers do that every single day. What makes a difference is that you cannot encourage people to violate that ruling and that law. Of course, Paxton denies being an unethical slug. This complaint has always lacked merit, and we are confident the legal process for resolving these complaints will bear that out,  a statement from his office said.As usual, it will take time for the investigation to run its course before a decision is made, but it s hard to believe a legitimate bar association would allow Paxton to continue being a lawyer since it is clear that he defied federal law and the order of the Supreme Court to let same-sex couples legally marry. If they don t remove him from the bar, what does that say about the ethics of the Texas Bar Association itself?Featured image from texasattorneygeneral.gov",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Has Something To Say To The Racists Who Didn’t Vote For Him Because He Was Black,"President Obama is nearing the end of his time in office and he s taking stock of everything that has happened since his first election   including a very special message to the people who refused to vote for him based solely on the color of his skin.Back in Illinois to celebrate the ninth anniversary of his entry into national politics, Obama sat down for fascinating interview with Christi Parsons, along with several of Obama s former political mentors. As usual, the President was adamant that the only way forward for America is to end the kind of political partisanship that hampers any progress. Nobody knows this better than he does. The challenges Obama faced as president often came not from natural disasters, hostile enemies, or unforeseen economic setbacks, but simple sabotage from lawmakers who were hoping to score a few cheap political points at the expense of America.This was, after all, the president who dealt with a Congress whose senate leader claimed early into Obama s first term that his number one objective was ensuring Obama lost his next election.But while Obama was characteristically optimistic that America could be better than the ugliness he had seen, it was when the conversation turned to racism that he really delivered the knockout punch. The group was skeptical of whether Obama was the victim of merely partisan bickering or if there was another factor going on. I think they were afraid of you, more so than anybody else. It s one thing   like with George Bush or anybody else, they may think, well, we might suffer through him for two years   or two terms, but I think they were actually afraid of you. They were afraid of you for a couple of reasons. Number one, you were black. And I talk to my Republican friends   and I ve got a lot of them   and that s all they could ever talk about, was the race card, the race. You know,  he s a nice guy,  he s this, he s that, but he s black. Well, get over it. For anyone who has been paying any attention to the way Obama has been treated during his time in office, this should be a familiar story. It s no coincidence that this president is the only one in history to have to deal with years of  serious  reporters on  respected  news networks like Fox (fair and balanced, remember?) suggesting that he might not be from the United States. It s no coincidence that Obama is often depicted at Tea Party rallies in highly racist iconography. Sadly, it may be the 21st century but many Americans still have a HUGE hang up about race.Obama seems aware of all of this, but he turns the tables on the depressing narrative in a brilliant way. Look, I ve always said this, that I have no doubt that there are people who voted against me because of race, or didn t approve of my agenda because of race. I also suspect there were a bunch of people who were excited and voted for me, or I got political benefits because of the notion of the first African American President. So those things cut both ways.I think that a lot of proof that we are a lot further along than we were is I got reelected. So it would be one thing if the first time that it was just an accident. The second time, I won again. And each time I got more votes in consecutive terms. So despite the racism facing him, Obama really has proven just how far America has come. During his first election, nobody knew whether an African-American could successfully be elected. He was. The second election, an unquestionable trouncing of Whitest Guy On Earth Mitt Romney, just proved that things had only gotten better.Obama concludes: So although there s no doubt that there are pockets of the country where some dog whistles blow and there s underlying racial fears that may be exploited, overall, what s more the case I think is just the straight, hardball politics of running against an incumbent and beating the heck out of them and softening them up. Because if a whole bunch of stuff gets done, he s going to get the credit. In other words, after his first election Obama knew that it was time to put up or shut up. The best way to combat the  racial fears  and  dog whistles  was to succeed. It s clear that this strategy has been vindicated. Racism is by no means dead, but Obama s presidency will be defined not in  black and white  terms, but from a long list of victories and accomplishments.No doubt this is rage-inducing for the most racist Americans who had hoped to see the first black president fail. Instead, he proved them wrong and hastened their inevitable extinction. Not bad, Mr. President.Check out the full interview via the LA Times here.Featured image via The White House",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Denny’s Serves Up A Grand Slam Of Racism By Forcing Black Family To Pre-Pay For Meal," America s Diner  Denny s, has lived up to that title if you are looking at it in the context of how much racism exists in the nation. Henry Williams and Renee Hebert settled in a lawsuit against the company, that stemmed from an incident in 2014 when an L.A. Denny s forced them to prepay for their meal because they were ordering food while black.Williams was told by employees that he would have to hand over the cash in full to cover the meal before his group would be served. Clearly, a group of black individuals going to a restaurant is suspicious enough to assume a conspiracy to do the  dine and dash  is in the works. Surprisingly, Williams decided to actually hand over the money rather than take his business elsewhere. Maybe he really likes the Moons Over My Hammy meal.The ridiculousness of this was so bad, that even the Denny s manager eventually realized how bad his people screwed up and tried to return the money. The manager was so desperate to give the money back that Williams actually had to tell him to stop repeatedly coming over to their table to grovel and hand over the cash because he was being a nuisance. The manager kicked it up a notch by offering free dessert, to which Williams said he wanted to box his food and leave.Williams and Hebert said that nobody else was asked to pre-pay for their meal. In court, a customer that was seated nearby at the time testified that Williams and Hebert handled the situation well: They were black. I m white. I ve never been asked to prepay. I thought it was appalling for someone in that year and time to be discriminated against like that. Denny s tried to argue against the lawsuit because the customers  order was a large one, and the location had other problems with people walking out on checks before. It got pretty damning, though, when the other customer testifying on behalf of Williams said that they had seen the restaurant targeting other black patrons to pre-pay in weeks prior. I bet not every case of these was a  huge order.  Denny s already had a bad reputation in this area, because it had to pay $54 million in 1994 for a case of similar discrimination against black customers.The details of the settlement were not disclosed, but it would be a safe bet that it was more than the cost of a dine-and-dash.Featured image from wikicommons",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative Pastor Preaches That Women Should Be Banned From Voting And Confined To Their Homes (VIDEO),"Clearly, one big goal of the conservative  Christian  base is to one day strip women of their right to vote and confine them solely to the home.And that s exactly what Arizona pastor Steven Anderson of the Faithful Word Baptist Church preached to his congregation in a video he uploaded to YouTube.In this latest rant, Anderson goes full misogynist, whining about women being able to divorce their husbands, having the right to vote, and having a job outside of the home, all of which he believes only men should have the ability to do. You know what they mean [by women s rights]?  Anderon asked his flock. The right to divorce your husband is what they mean. You know what they mean? The right to rebel and disobey your husband, the right to divorce him, the right to go out and get a job and make your own money, the right to tell him what to do, the right to go vote for our leaders as if women should have any say in how our country is run when the Bible says that  I suffer not a woman to teach, not to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence ?I AM QUOTING THE BIBLE RIGHT NOW!But it s old-fashioned Here s the video via YouTube.This isn t the first time Anderson has been a total dick towards women. He once went on a rant about how women shouldn t be allowed to read, talk, or leave the house without permission from a man. He has even demanded that women keep their mouths shut in church, which makes one wonder how any woman can stand being around this asshole.And he is hardly the first conservative  Christian  hero to call for banning women from voting. Fake historian David Barton has also said that women should be barred from voting because the Bible says that only the head of the household should be allowed to vote on the family s behalf, regardless of what policies or candidates the rest of the family supports.And Republican presidential candidates, from Ted Cruz to Trump to Rubio to Kasich, haven t exactly made it a secret that they have a general disdain for women. All of them have made it clear that women s rights will suffer should any of them become president. And it s because of preachers like Anderson on the Christian right that Republicans have adopted such medieval beliefs about women, which is why it is even more important than ever before that every woman in this country exercise their right to vote. Because if they don t, they may not have that right much longer if conservatives have their way.Featured image: screenshot",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Iran Makes Damning New Claims About GOP Trying To Sabotage Obama’s Prisoner Exchange,"An explosive allegation has come out of Tasnim News against Republicans. The Secretary of Iran s Supreme National Security council said that the recent prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Iran had an attempt made by Republicans to sabotage it when they requested Iran delay release of the prisoners until the eve of the 2016 election.Ali Shamkhani, Secretary of Iran s Supreme National Security Council, released the following statement: In the course of the talks for exchanging prisoners, the Republican rivals of the current US administration who claim to be humanitarians and advocates of human rights sent a message telling us not to release these people (American prisoners) and continue this process (of talks) until the eve of US presidential elections. However  he said  we acted upon our independent resolve and moved the process forward. Source: Tasnim NewsThis is the second time that the allegations have been raised that Republicans requested Americans were to be held hostage by Iran in order to serve their domestic political interests. The first time came from the suggestion that Republicans conspired with Iran to delay the release of American hostages until Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1980. They were to be rewarded for this by Reagan then selling them weapons. This was supposedly done to hurt Carter s re-election while allowing Republicans to claim that the act of electing a Republican made our enemies cower in fear. Iran did end up releasing the hostages 20 minutes after Reagan completed his inaugural address.Now here we are again. There is an upcoming presidential election, Republican prospects look grim as usual and now they might have gotten caught using the same old trick a second time. If this turns out to be true, the consequences could destroy the party.One could discount this by saying it s Iran, and we can t believe what they say because they are an  enemy.  However, if you look at the fact Republicans have admitted to trying to work with Iran to hurt America before, it seems very plausible. Republicans tried to sabotage the Iranian peace deal by contacting Iran directly and suggesting that any peace deal would not last after Obama left office. They have a history of trying to conspire with Iran, for political reasons at home.Republicans are obsessed with hurting this nation, and it s people, in order to create an environment of fear, rage and paranoia. Only in this mindset would Americans ever want to vote them into power.Featured image from Pinterest",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Right-Wing Terrorist Cliven Bundy Finally Charged In Relation To 2014 Standoff With Feds In Nevada,"It s about damn time.It s been two years since Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy engaged in an illegal armed standoff with federal authorities with the help of right-wing gun nuts.As you ll recall, Bundy threw a temper tantrum after the government began rounding up his cattle because he refused to pay the $1 million in grazing fees and penalties owed to the Bureau of Land Management even after a judge ordered him to do so.Anti-government gun nuts rushed to Bundy s side to prevent him from being arrested and interfered with federal agents who were doing their job.Not only did Bundy and his band of armed militants use women and children as shields, they also used a highway to aim their guns at federal officials and set up unauthorized checkpoints to question and search people.And after two years of seemingly getting away with his illegal rebellion against the government, it appears Bundy is finally going to see the inside of a prison cell for his actions.Bundy was arrested by the FBI on Wednesday at Portland International Airport as he tried to make his way to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in support of the remaining armed thugs who have refused to surrender since Bundy s sons Ammon and Ryan were arrested at the end of January.According to The Oregonian, Bundy  was booked into the downtown Multnomah County jail  and faces the charge of conspiracy to interfere with a federal officer in relation to his little standoff in 2014.In fact, here is Bundy s mugshot courtesy of The Oregonian.Perhaps this will serve as a lesson to other anti-government gun nuts that the long arm of the law will come for them if they pull more stunts like the one Bundy and his boys have pulled over the years. And maybe the prison time they serve will give them the opportunity to actually read the Constitution they claim to love so much and realize that their claim that the government is violating it is pure bullshit.

 LIVE: Bundy Terrorist Declares ‘War Against The Federal Government’ Because He Might Be Raped In Jail (LIVE AUDIO),"The Bundy empire has crumbled. Thursday morning, Welfare Cowboy Cliven arrived in Oregon just in time to be arrested for aiding his sons  armed occupation of a federal bird sanctuary. Every militia leader, including Blaine Cooper as of Thursday morning, is in custody. One is dead after he attempted to pull a gun on FBI agents. Cliven Bundy s son Ammon, the leader of the revolution, has called it quits. As of early Thursday, the militants had (with the aid of a Nevada Assemblywoman who thinks cancer is a fungus) agreed to surrender peacefully.But things took an interesting turn after they got a good night s sleep. ISIS-supporting human piece of garbage David Fry decided he no longer wishes to give himself up. I declare war against the federal government.  Fry said during a livestream. There s no way to beat this anymore but liberty or death.  Fry complains that his tax dollars are used to fund abortions (they re not) and that the FBI  allowed  Hillary Clinton to run for President, along with a laundry list of other ridiculous complaints.Fry explained that he is  taking a stand,  that he is willing to risk his life in his rather nonsensical war against the federal government. But his real motivation became clear later:Will the Revolution end in peaceful surrender, or will Fry ruin it all?Listen below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oregon Judge Politely Mocks Cliven Bundy’s Lunatic Demands (VIDEO),"Last week, Oregon Judge Steve Grasty issued a statement that could be summed up as  Geddafugouttahere!  The statement was directed to head Domestic Terrorist Cliven Bundy who s been overcome with delusions of power. Bundy has declared that the four morons still inside the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge will  retain possession  of the property and he s also demanding that local officials resign because they haven t been America-Lovin  Christian Soldier For Freedom fully supportive of the Bundy militia s seizure of federal property. Judge Gratsy seemed a bit confused as to why some schmuck in Nevada thinks he can dictate the law in Oregon: Last night I got a tweet with a copy of the letter in it from Mr. Cliven Bundy. I looked at that and wondered what does that mean? Perhaps he thinks he owns the refuge. I don t think that s the case. Judge Gratsy also responded to a petition to arrest the officers involved with the 100 percent justified shooting of martyr moron Lavoy Finicum: This isn t a valid petition in any sense of the law that I understand,  Grasty told KOIN 6 News on Tuesday.  That request won t be honored. Even funnier, the  patriots  that have been protesting clearly don t know how to count: Mr. Curtiss said [the petition] it was 200 signatures. What was delivered to us has lines for 150 signatures and it 118 signatures on them,  the judge said. We think we can identify 111 of those as maybe Harney County folks. That sums up the Bundy clown parade perfectly: Ignorant of the law, very angry and very, very stupid. With a lot of guns. What could possibly go wrong?Since this story was first reported on, Cliven Bundy has been arrested for trying to join up with domestic terrorists and the four boneheads at Malhuer are reportedly in the process of surrendering after demanding that they not be arrested.Here s the full story via KOIN6: Featured image via AI Archives",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cleveland Bills Tamir Rice’s Family $500 For An UNBELIEVABLE Reason,"On November 22, 2014, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was gunned down by Cleveland police as he played with a toy gun in a park. The officers involved in the shooting were cleared of any wrongdoing, even though they shot the child within seconds of arriving at the park. Now, a year and a half later, the city is doing something so outrageous that even the president of the police union is disgusted: billing his mother for his final ambulance ride.On Wednesday, his family s attorney Subodh Chandra spoke to the press about the $500 bill from the city: The callousness, insensitivity and poor judgment required for the city to send a bill   is breathtaking. This adds insult to homicide. Not only is Chandra horrified by the city s decision to send Tamir s mom, Samaria Rice, a statement for the cost of the ride, so is police union President Steve Loomis, who said: Subodh Chandra and I have never agreed on anything until now. It is unconscionable that the city of Cleveland would send that bill to the Rice family Truly disappointing, but not at all surprising. It s hard to imagine what the city was thinking when they sent his mother that invoice. Ms.Rice said that she believes the city is harassing her because of the civil suit she has against them, and it sure sounds like that.This isn t the first time Cleveland has responded to the little boy s family with such callousness. When Rice filed the lawsuit against the city they blamed Tamir s death on himself, claiming he failed  to exercise due care to avoid injury.  Because apparently it is a child s responsibility to not be shot by a trigger-happy police officer who had a history of mental health problems. This 12-year-old was supposed to know that a cop, someone who was supposed to protect him, was going to shoot him without even speaking to him because he looked  scary. The Department of Justice is still investigating the department and we can only hope that this child finally gets the justice he deserves; we also hope that Samaria Rice prevails in her civil suit and teaches this disgusting city a lesson.

 W. Virginia Clerk Screams ‘Abomination!’ At Newlywed Lesbian Couple Because ‘God Was Standing With Me’,"Proving once again that conservative  Christianity  is a religion of pure hate,  a clerk in West Virginia decided it wasn t enough to process the marriage license of a newlywed lesbian couple, she also had to scream her anti-gay religious beliefs at them:Samantha Brookover and Amanda Abramovich went last week to get married, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. The couple had loved ones and cameras in tow.The West Virginia couple said Debbie Allen, the deputy clerk who processed their marriage license, gave them a biblical earful. They say Allen huffed and puffed, slammed things around then yelled at them for two or three minutes about her views that what they were doing was wrong in her eyes and God s.Allow me to be blunt for a second: No one, but no one, gives a flying fuck about your views Ms. Allen. They are as abhorrent and ugly as your soul. Period. Got that? Ok, let s move on.This is the lie at the heart of the right s demands for  religious freedom.  They don t just want the freedom to practice their religion (which they already have), they want the  freedom  to impose their religion on everyone around them. They literally feel persecuted because they can t persecute others without consequence.To see this in action, pay attention to what Allen says about her unwanted screed: I just told them my opinion,  she told the paper.  I just felt led to do that. I believe God was standing with me and that s just my religious belief. When people start to pressure Gilmer County, where Allen is employed, to fire or rebuke the clerk in even the mildest fashion, she is going to squeal about  Christian persecution  and she ll be the next Fox News warrior in the fight to defend Christian values  that aren t actually under assault.But at least she didn t try to deny them their marriage license, so that s a bit of progress, right?

 This Company Uses A Black Model To Promote The Worst Shirt Ever (IMAGES/TWEETS),"Online retailer ASOS has come under fire for their horrible lack of judgment in having a black model wear a t-shirt that has the word  slave  on it in huge letters. For some reason, it never occurred to anyone in the process of approval that this might be considered extremely racist.The t-shirt, which is by the brand Wasted Heroes, was posted to ASOS  website and the internet basically blew up as soon as it was published. It didn t take long before there was enough backlash to encourage the company to remove the photo, as Twitter users reprimanded the company with an onslaught of complaints.Seriously, you have to be pretty dense in order to overlook how bad of an idea this t-shirt and photo was. But apparently, ASOS is fine with being ignorant   the company took zero responsibility for the offense, and instead blamed the manufacturer. A spokesperson for the company offered no apology and simply said: Marketplace is a collection of independent sellers [like Wasted Heroes] who must agree to our terms and conditions when they join. Whenever we find a product that violates our policies we remove it immediately. The company s response on social media was equally underwhelming, and pointed complaints to the manufacturer:Wasted Heroes didn t do much better, but they at least admitted that the decision was  extremely stupid of us. The company s weak attempt at an apology was overshadowed by the suggestion that shoppers had misinterpreted the shirt. When you go to Wasted Heroes  website, you can see the same t-shirt alongside other slave-themed merchandise   although the shirts are hanging from a bar and chains instead of people.One has to wonder how such monstrous mistakes go unnoticed and make it all the way to a company s website without one person raising a red flag. This is ASOS  second strike within the last few months   last October, the company was criticized for selling bindis in their site s Halloween section.There have been several instances of other retailers making similar racist or culturally clueless mistakes. In 2014, Zara had to remove a children s shirt because it bared resemblance to concentration camp uniforms. A few years before that, Adidas was forced to pull a pair of trainers before they even got to stores because the shoes included Velcro shackles, which caused outrage for being reminiscent of shackles worn by prisoners or slaves.Companies need to do better. There s no reason why something as racist, offensive and culturally inappropriate as these examples should make it all the way up the chain of commands and onto shelves or websites.

 Jimmy Fallon Debuts His Bernie Sanders Impression and It’s Hilarious (VIDEO),"The Tonight Show s Jimmy Fallon debuted his impersonation of Senator Bernie Sanders, and it was hilarious and spot-on. After Sander s resounding victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Fallon-as-Sanders gave his victory speech. Repeatedly telling the crowd to be stop clapping, Fallon-as-Sanders said: I m speaking tonight to claim victory in the New Hampshire primary over She Who Must Not Be Named. New Hampshirites showed the world that you are good, decent people, even though you live in towns that sound like 18th-century porn stars.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua3aNP19ah8]Fallon-as-Sanders told the crowd that they wanted a candidate who  looks like a Scooby-Doo villain before his mask is removed  and that they got one in Sanders. He said that he feels like  a million bucks, which of course means I will now evenly distribute myself among the middle class. Fallon already has a Trump impersonation he often does on the show but his debut of Sanders is an indication of the senator s rising star and his popularity among voters, especially younger generations, who regularly watch Fallon s show.If the resounding victory in New Hampshire is an indication of things to come, Fallon will be doing plenty of impersonations of Sanders victory speeches both in the primaries and in the general election in November.

 The Amazing White Right-Wing Entitlement Of The Oregon Militants,"As of this writing, there are 4 heavily armed morons still in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney county, Oregon. The FBI has the place surrounded and it s finally occurred to the  patriots  inside that the only way they re leaving is in handcuffs or body bags. Listening to the livestream ravings of the group, this is a shocking revelation:Surrounded by FBI, ISIS supporter David Fry yelled at an FBI negotiator: You re going to hell. Kill me. Get it over with. We re innocent people camping at a public facility, and you re going to murder us. The only way we re leaving here is dead or without charges,  Fry said during the night s ravings.Just so we re all on the same page, these people seized a government building, threatened to kill anyone that entered, and did a great deal of property damage, all while being allowed to hold press conferences. PRESS CONFERENCES! But to them, they were just camping. With guns. And death threats. And no snacks.They sound exactly like a kid that s locked himself in the bathroom and refuses to come out until mommy and daddy promise not to punish him for setting the curtains on fire.Now that their playtime is coming to an end, they truly, honestly, deep down, don t understand why they can t just pack up and go home. Ask a black person, a Latino or a Muslim if they would be allowed to leave unharmed much less not under arrest and they would quite possibly die from laughter.But these are white right wingers and this is  their  country! How DARE someone hold them accountable to the law?! Those laws exist to keep Those People in line! They re not supposed to keep white right wingers from doing whatever the hell they want! This. Is. TYRANNY!For frak s sake! Cliven Bundy, head moron, was arrested trying to join up with the 4 morons at the refuge. I guarantee he was outraged at the very idea of not being allowed to join an armed standoff.If the FBI is lucky, the militants  fear will outweigh their indignation and they ll surrender peacefully. If not, they re all going to die under the false belief that they re being unjustly murdered for exercising their rights. Rights that they don t seem to understand only exist for white conservatives and for absolutely no one else.I hope for the sake of law enforcement all over the country that no one dies. The militia movement is already trying to turn LaVoy Finicum into a martyr even though he was clearly seen reaching for his gun. How many cops will be assassinated in the name of 4 more dead morons at the hands of the FBI? How many federal buildings will be blown up this time?And finally: How long will we keep pretending that America doesn t have a serious domestic terrorism problem and that it s not coming almost exclusively from the overly-entitled right wing?Featured image via AI archives.",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Colbert Grills Sanders On His ‘Revolution For America’ — Sanders’ Response Is Brilliant (VIDEO),"Senator Bernie Sanders made an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert a day following his landslide win in New Hampshire and he was riding high. Colbert resurrected his former conservative Colbert Report character, playing devil s advocate by grilling  the senator on his polices, even suggesting that he was promoting  class warfare.  Colbert said that trying to take power away from the 1% was not going to be easy.  I ll tell you how I know, I am in the top 1 percent.  Colbert also warned of revolution which Sanders advocates by quoting John F. Kennedy. He said: Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. Sanders, however, rejected the idea that his revolution would go bad. He said: What the goal of this campaign is about is to look at the Civil Rights Movement, look at the women s movement, look at the gay movement, understand that when people come together we can accomplish enormous things. But I think what people are saying is enough is enough. We need fundamental changes in our political system and our economic system. Sanders is right. Thinking outside of the box is what creates both innovation and change and Sanders sums it up perfectly: We used to have a segregated society. African-Americans couldn t go to schools, couldn t drink at water fountains. Millions of people stood together and said,  Hey, enough is enough. That is not what America is supposed to be about. Americans are on board with Sanders  message. He s scored a resounding victory in New Hampshire, especially with America s youth, collecting 86% of the vote in the 18-24 age bracket. Bernie Sanders is not only running for the presidency, but thus far he s winning.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Justice Dept. Has Had Enough — Sues Ferguson Over Police Misconduct,"The Department of Justice laid down the law on Wednesday and announced that they have had enough and they are suing Ferguson for police misconduct. The decision to sue came after the Ferguson City Council voted on Tuesday to change the terms of a deal that had been negotiated over seven months.The DOJ began investigating Ferguson police after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by former police officer Darren Wilson. Although Wilson was cleared of any wrongdoing, federal authorities found a pattern of abuse and systematic racism within the department.For seven months federal authorities and the city hashed out a deal to fix the problems within the police department. In a tentative agreement the city agreed to hire consultants to train officials, require every officer to have a dash or body cam, abide by specific guidelines for when officers can stop and question people on the streets, along with a number of other things. On Tuesday, though, the city suddenly decided that they wanted to alter the agreement. Shortly after the vote, the feds released a statement: The Ferguson City Council has attempted to unilaterally amend the negotiated agreement,  Vanita Gupta, head of the agency s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.  Their vote to do so creates an unnecessary delay in the essential work to bring constitutional policing to the city, and marks an unfortunate outcome for concerned community members and Ferguson police officers. On Wednesday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch dropped the lawsuit on the brilliant city council. She told reporters, We intend to aggressively prosecute this case and we intend to prevail.  She continued: The residents of Ferguson have suffered the deprivation of their constitutional rights, the rights guaranteed to all Americans, for decades. They have waited decades for justice. They should not be forced to wait any longer These violations were not only egregious, they were routine. They were encouraged by the city in the interest of raising revenue. They were driven, at least in part, by racial bias and they occurred disproportionately against African-American residents of Ferguson. The fact is, the city has failed the people of Ferguson on so many levels and now they are going to waste millions of dollars trying to fight the federal government because THEY tried to play fast and loose with the DOJ. They knew that their actions on Tuesday would result in litigation, but they took it as seriously as they take protecting people in their city.Hopefully, the citizens of Ferguson are able to get rid of each and every one of the council members who played a role in this vote.

 DNC Insiders Vote To Take Bernie’s Win In New Hampshire Away From Him (IMAGES),"You may or may not know this, but the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has a system in place that s capable of overriding the will of the people when the popular vote doesn t quite match up with what the  establishment  has in mind. Due to DNC rules put into place, party elites have chosen to award Hillary Clinton an equal amount of delegates in New Hampshire even though Bernie Sanders won by an overwhelmingly large margin. Pretty messed up, huh? Yes, it is. But   there s more you need to know before panicking entirely (although you should panic a little).New Hampshire has a total of 24  pledged  delegates that go to the winner of the primaries. Since Bernie won 60.4% of the vote, he was awarded 15 of those, and Clinton only 9. But, party officials in the state are given 8  superdelegates  and are free to choose whichever candidate they like. Six of those insider party officials are throwing their support behind Clinton while two remain undecided. If you do the math, that means that the DNC is technically overriding the will of the voters and making the state an even call between the both of them.Pic via AP.Don t blame Hillary Clinton, though. While there is substantial evidence of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz being personally tied to Clinton (she was the co-chair of Clinton s 2008 campaign after all), these rules were put in place back in 1984. The whole point of the superdelegate system was to make sure  unelectable  candidates wouldn t get elected. That s a good thing. Remember George McGovern? He was beaten so bad by Nixon, the Democratic Party felt like it needed to do something, and this is what they eventually came up with. Bernie Sanders is electable, though, and you d think the establishment is just now starting to get that. The momentum he s currently receiving (and fundraising) is unbelievable   far more than anyone could have ever imagined just six months ago.The truth is (and no fault to Sanders), but Clinton began the race with an enormous amount of support still left intact from her 2008 run against Barack Obama. Due to her expansive campaign reach, she has been able to gain favor early on with most party insiders from the get go. And, yes, they still support her. Bernie s momentum is definitely happening, but so far that hasn t changed how the rules are set up. And   right now, because of the rules, Clinton has that advantage.Pic via New York Times.There is good news, though. Even though technically Clinton received the same number of delegates as Sanders, taking away the kind of win needed to secure enough delegates from the state, he still won the popular vote. And that s important no matter what anyone claims to tell you. Here s why: the popular vote will decide the election overall. Clinton started with an overwhelming amount of support, true, but 4,051 of the ordinary, popular vote delegates are allocated based on the voters, not the party. And   it only takes 2,282 to secure the nomination. If it ever came down to it, and Bernie somehow received more of the popular vote than Clinton, the superdelegates should, in theory, back Bernie. If they didn t, it would cause chaos. Don t ever plan on that happening, though   the DNC isn t that stupid.The DNC establishment, with their early superdelegate total factoring in, might make it seem like Bernie has an uphill battle, but the voters will largely determine the overall outcome. Unfortunately, as of right now, though, Bernie didn t win the overwhelming majority of delegates like the citizens of New Hampshire democratically went to the polls for. But, that s the DNC s rules for you.Featured image from Flickr.",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cliven Bundy Was Just ARRESTED As He Tried To Join Terrorists In Oregon,"If you ve been wondering how long it would be before Cliven Bundy was finally arrested, you ll be happy to know that just happened. No, you re not dreaming. Yes, the tea you drank was just tea (as far as you know), and you are not hallucinating. Cliven Bundy has been arrested. While he was given a free pass after he organized an armed standoff with the federal government at his ranch because he didn t feel he should pay heavily-subsidized and discounted grazing fees, the FBI finally cracked down on the Welfare Cowboy we love to mock as he attempted to join the remnants of his sons  army in Oregon.Earlier this week, Bundy announced his intention to go to Oregon, but when he attempted to act out his fantasy of rekindling the revolution with an ISIS supporter who joined the occupation of a federal bird sanctuary and his buddies, law enforcement moved in. Oregon Live reports:Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who touched off one showdown with federal authorities and applauded another started in Oregon by his sons, was arrested late Wednesday at Portland International Airport.Bundy, 74, was booked into the downtown Multnomah County jail at 10:54 p.m.The Bundy Ranch Facebook page reported Bundy was surrounded by SWAT officers and detained after his arrival.For those who still feel this is too good to be true, here is his booking information:Shortly after Bundy s arrest, the Bundy Ranch Facebook page posted the terrible, terrible, not very good news:The militants Bundy attempted to join did not have a good night either. Surrounded by FBI, ISIS supporter David Fry yelled at an FBI negotiator: You re going to hell. Kill me. Get it over with. We re innocent people camping at a public facility, and you re going to murder us. The only way we re leaving here is dead or without charges,  Fry said during the night s ravings. Ultimately, however, the four remaining militants agreed to surrender in the morning after they have had some snacks.The terrorists will turn themselves in, flanked by Evangelical icon Franklin Graham and Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, who believes that cancer is a fungus that can be washed out with baking soda   a fitting escort for people who think they can give people more freedumbs by taking over a bird sanctuary.While it may seem an unfortunate night for the Revolution, at least Cliven can have a family reunion with his sons, who are also in jail along with more than a dozen of their compatriots.Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Something many conservatives don t want to admit actually exists against people of color.However, as they want to go after Beyonc  for being a woman of color with a powerful platform to get an important message across, what exactly are these conservatives doing to make the world a better place? Because as far as I can tell, Beyonc  has actually been the one doing just that for a long, long time.As Beyonc  uses her success to spread awareness, she s also using her earnings to make sure the homeless in Houston have a place to live. In fact, she gave $7 million over several years to help fund  Knowles Temenos Place Apartments  which helps house those who have been displaced. She, alongside her family and fellow Destiny s Child alum Kelly Roland, began this project in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.In Houston, it s actually illegal to feed the homeless. On top of that, it s illegal for the homeless to go in search of food for themselves. It s seems as if it s a pretty heartless society, and Beyonc  is actually stepping up where society has let these people down.Texas, that prides itself of on conservatism, even more so on their conservative Christianity, is letting their citizens down. While they love to boast that they re welcoming to business, they clearly are not welcome to much of anything else. Well, at least if you don t have money. However, part of being good Christians should be adhering to the teachings of the Bible, something Beyonc  seems to have actually taken to heart by taking action. After all, in the Bible, Jesus told everyone to take care of the sick and shelter the needy. Conservatives have seemed to have lost that message somewhere along the way while they were hating immigrants, the poor and needy, and while telling sick people if they can t afford healthcare, well, too bad.So, maybe next time, before criticizing someone for performing and speaking truth to power on a stage being broadcast around the world, just because it s difficult for you to hear and wrap your head around. Maybe, just maybe, listen to what s being said. Maybe, just maybe, realize there s an epidemic of police brutality that makes all the good officers look bad as well, and something needs to be done. And maybe, just maybe, realize the person who you are criticizing is a person you should emulate and appreciate for all they are doing for communities, those around her, and pretty much all of society. Then maybe, just maybe, you ll see something you ve never seen before   faith, hope and love. The pillars of the Christian faith that conservatives boast so proudly, but have failed at actually achieving.Featured image: Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Glenn Beck Anchor In Race Attack On Beyoncé For Super Bowl Show (VIDEO),"An anchor for Glenn Beck s TV network, The Blaze, is the latest right-wing media figure to attack Beyonc  for her Super Bowl halftime performance.Tomi Lahren, who hosts the show Tomi, used her program to berate Beyonc s work. Lahren, 23, argues that,  Your husband was a drug dealer. For fourteen years, he sold crack cocaine. Talk about protecting black neighborhoods? Start at home. https://youtu.be/cwVnDRx8EikThat is a reference to Beyonc s husband, rapper and rap mogul Jay Z. The strange bit is that Lahren is referring to behavior Jay Z engaged in when he was a teenager. He is now 46 years old, and has had a multi-decade career topping music charts, producing some of the biggest names in music, working in fashion and other industries. He is worth an estimated $520 million, and has sold over 100 million records and received 21 Grammy Awards.Lahren has inadvertently made a point about the racial injustice and prejudice Beyonc  was alluding to in her performance and in the song  Formation,  when she reduces Jay Z s life to his teenage mistakes   which he has been very open about in his work   and ignores his business success and philanthropy (he was part of a $1 million donation to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina, for instance).She joins other conservatives like former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani in attacking Beyonc s performance for having the nerve to bring up Hurricane Katrina, black pride, and police shootings of black civilians.The mindset being promoted by Lahren in this attack definitely fits in with former Fox News host Glenn Beck, who welcomed her to The Blaze  family  in October of last year after several of her right-wing video rants went viral.Beck, who is still heard on the radio after a cascade of dropped sponsors pushed Fox to cancel his show. Has a history of racially charged remarks. He said President Obama had a  deep-seated hatred of white people,  claimed progressives were pushing for a  race war,  promoted a book written by an anti-semite, and repeatedly claimed Obama was trying to enslave people.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Brags About His HUGE Tax Return: ‘I Fight Like Hell Not To Pay’ Taxes (VIDEO),"Clearly riding the high off of his New Hampshire victory, Republican front runner Donald Trump announced that he would be releasing his tax returns in the next few months, foolishly admitting that he fights  like hell  to avoid paying his dues to the government like the rest of America.In an interview with NBC s Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie, Trump bragged that although they were  being worked on , his tax returns were taking longer than usual because they are the  biggest ever in the history of what we are doing.  The real estate mogul also said that once his  very big tax returns  finally make their public debut, people will probably be shocked at how little he pays. He boasted: I fight like hell not to pay (taxes). I hate the way the government spends my money. Trump didn t seem to think this was much of a problem, and commended himself on being more crooked than other tax-paying politicians: I fight like hell not to pay a lot of tax, and you know what? Every politician probably does. I ve watched others where they say,  Oh, I want to pay [tax]. In the same interview, Trump defended himself for calling Texas Senator Ted Cruz a  p*ssy , explaining that it wasn t the worst thing in the world and that he was just  having a good time.  He also said that because he stood up against political correctness by being himself and just saying whatever batsh*t crazy thing came to mind,  people went out and voted for me, and that s why we got, you know, the numbers we did  when talking about his New Hampshire victory.This interview is hardly the first time Trump has confessed to not paying as much as others in taxes. Last year, Trump said in an interview with CBS  Face The Nation: I fight like hell to pay as little as possible for two reasons. Number one, I m a businessman. And that s the way you re supposed to do it. The other reason is that I hate the way our government spends our taxes. I hate the way they waste our money. Trillions and trillions of dollars of waste and abuse. And I hate it. But building that racist $8 billion border wall isn t wasteful?

 Jay Carney Let It Slip That He Knows Who Obama Wants As His Successor,"Former White House Press Secretary in the Obama administration Jay Carney is sure he knows who the president wants for his successor: Hillary Clinton. President Obama has yet to hand out any official endorsements during this primary season, but, of course, like all major political players, he has his favorite. Carney is sure that person is Hillary. He said to Brooke Baldwin on CNN: I don t think there is any doubt that he wants Hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what he s achieved. I think the President has signaled, while still remaining neutral, that he supports Secretary Clinton s candidacy and would prefer to see her as the nominee. He won t officially embrace her unless and until it s clear that she s going to be the nominee. I think he is maintaining that tradition of not intervening in a party primary. Smartly, the president is refusing to comment on what Jay Carney has said. However, he s done all but given an official nod to Hillary as the primary race heats up. President Obama will likely give the nod to whomever gets the nomination, as we all want a Democrat in the White House. However, he wants Hillary to be that person. That much is pretty clear.It s hard for anybody to speak for President Obama, of course, but his former Secretary of State seems to be his pick. Hopefully, we find out for sure in short order, but it s pretty smart for a sitting president not to endorse one of his party s candidates over the other while waiting to see who actually gets the nomination, especially in a close, neck-in-neck race. He must be pretty antsy, though, being unable to endorse right away.No worries, Mr. President. The primaries will be over soon, and you can speak your piece then.Featured image via screen capture from Flickr",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Snags Coveted Endorsement Of The Congressional Black Caucus,"If there was any doubt about whether or not Hillary Clinton had the black vote locked up, said doubts are sure to be squashed now. The Congressional Black Caucus will formally endorse the former Secretary of State for president on Thursday morning, according to The Washington Post. Endorsing isn t all they are doing, either.Following the planned meeting with the Democratic National Committee to officially hand Clinton their nod, Caucus leaders will send their troops out into states where the black vote is a make-or-break situation to make sure that they have as much support for their candidate as possible. They are intensely focused on South Carolina, where getting the black vote out will definitely be a boost for whichever candidate takes that state s primary. From the Washington Post: It s one thing to endorse and do nothing. It s another thing to endorse and to go to work,  said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), chairman of the CBC PAC. These lawmakers are, Meeks said,  people that can actually testify [to] the work that Hillary Clinton has done. This is so true. Endorsements hold power, but the work that goes along with them is just as   if not more than   important. A whopping 90 percent of the Congressional Black Caucus is on board with endorsing Clinton. Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D- NC), who chairs the Caucus, says of the endorsement of Clinton over Sanders, despite the fact that Sanders  message is popular with young progressives: Many of these are first-time voters and Senator Sanders  message resonates with the younger generation because of the promises that he is making. But Mrs. Clinton and others are going to challenge the message by suggesting that it is unrealistic to believe that we can accomplish all of the things that Senator Sanders proposes. They need to understand that when a candidate presents a message, you ve got to pierce the message to determine whether or not it s realistic, given the political climate that we live in. It s not a negative, it s not an aspersion on the new voter. It s the fact that many of them are inexperienced and have not gone through a presidential election cycle before. And that is what is important   they aren t against Sanders just because they are for Clinton. It is important for folks here on the left to realize you can support one candidate over the other during the primary, but to ultimately vote blue in November.Congratulations, Secretary Clinton!Featured image via Hillary Clinton Twitter",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Planned Parenthood Tells Carly Fiorina To Go F*ck Herself On The Way Out The Door (TWEETS),"If you have not heard, lying,  baby parts -obsessed windbag Carly Fiorina has dropped out of the presidential race. This is, of course, completely unsurprising given her poll numbers, which have traditionally been firmly in the gutter ever since it became common knowledge that the felons who created her favorite propaganda videos had heavily and deceptively edited them.On Wednesday, Fiorina joined fellow (former) 2016 hopeful Chris Christie in dropping out of the race. While I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them,  Fiorina said as she pretended she has accomplished anything more than helping convince a right-wing terrorist to shoot up a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado.As part of her outgoing message to  girls and women across the country,  Fiorina made it clear that females should not feel they have  to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because you re a woman  (*cough*HillaryClinton*cough*).Planned Parenthood, the organization Fiorina has chosen to spend nearly every waking hour maligning, also had an outgoing message for the failed former Hewlett-Packer CEO. It wasn t  Bye, Felicia,  but it might as well have been. Farewell to @CarlyFiorina,  the women s health organization said in a tweet.  It turns out you can t flat-out lie to the American people about Planned Parenthood. Farewell to @CarlyFiorina.

The best way to protect women is to vote in November. The next President will appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices. This, of course, has the power to swing the power heavily in favor of regressive, or progressive, policies.

 One Of Bernie Sanders’ Biggest Critics Explains Why He Is Voting For Him (VIDEO),"Ta-Nehisi Coates sat down with an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! on Wednesday, where he said that he  will be voting for Sen. Sanders.  This endorsement is particularly interesting, due to some very real criticisms Coates wrote about Sanders earlier this month.Coates is a correspondent for The Atlantic and won the 2015 National Award winner for his book, Between the World and Me. His essay, The Case for Reparations, is a must read. Late into last January, Coates wrote about some of his frustrations with Sanders  lack of willingness to publicly support reparations for slavery.The criticism of Sanders is one that is both new and old. As Coates notes, people are beginning to look at the issue of reparations from a new historical lens. That new lens is what fuels most of Coates  critique of Sanders  stance on reparations.  That being said, there has always been tension between all the flavors of the black liberation movement, with all of the flavors of the revolutionary left.Coinciding with the rise of the New Democrats, this is an old feud that has largely been missing from the mainstream political discussion for several decades. Indeed, the fact that this debate is once again seeing the light of day is a very good thing to happen. A synthesis of diverging thoughts cannot occur if they are neglected.During the interview, Coates says that he is stunned by the rise of Sanders. Goodman asks Coates why he is stunned. His response is revealing: Well, I think, had you told me this like a year ago, I certainly would not have expected, you know, an avowed socialist to be putting up these sorts of numbers and actually be contending for the Democratic Party nomination. But I think it s awesome. You know, I think it s great. You know, like a lot of people, I m very, very concerned about Senator Clinton s record. I m very, very concerned about where her positions were in the 1990s, when we had some of the most disgusting legislation in terms of our criminal justice, really, in this country s history. I get really, really concerned when I see somebody taking $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, will not release what they re actually saying. That s concerning. And so, having options, not having this be a coronation, I think, is a good thing. So, I m stunned, but I m pleasantly stunned.

 Trump Just Added Assassination To His List Of Presidential Promises,"Well, here we go again. Donald Trump saying something weird, stupid or offensive has become as common as the sun rising. Despite that, he just keeps managing to take things up one more notch on the ladder of inflammatory nonsense.Today s new normal in stupidity comes with Trump s declaration that he would be open to arranging the assassination of world leaders that he doesn t like. This was revealed when he said that he would make China assassinate Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.Trump elaborated a bit on his plan for forcing another country to assassinate people. However, he failed to explain exactly how he could force another sovereign nation to actually do something so asinine: I would get China to make that guy [Kim Jong Un] disappear in one form or another very quickly. China has control, absolute control of North Korea. They don t say it, but they do, and they should make that problem disappear  China is sucking us dry. They re taking our money, they re taking our jobs and doing so much. We have rebuilt China with what they ve taken out. We have power over China. China should do that. Source: InquisitrWe all know it isn t a big shock when Republicans, Trump in particular, simply don t know what the hell they are talking about. However, on this one, Trump really does take the cake. State-arranged assassination is illegal in the U.S. and has been for decades. Gerald Ford banned it via executive order in 1976, and Jimmy Carter strengthened the ban again in 1978. Executive Order 12036 lays it out plain as day.2-305. Prohibition on Assassination. No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.Source: fas.orgThis follows promises by Trump to not only bring back waterboarding but to also include new and unspecified methods of torture that he calls  a hell of a lot worse. Do you know who else assassinates people and tortures  enemies of the state?  North Korea. Will Trump get so bad that he advocates for the assassination of himself? It would be ironic.Featured image from alan.com",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sanders Fans Break Fundraising Site After NH Primary Win (VIDEO/TWEETS),"After Bernie Sanders  win in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, so many people contributed to his campaign that ActBlue, the fundraising service used by Democratic candidates, is having trouble processing the donations. That s because during his victory speech, Sanders said: I m not going to New York City to host a fundraiser on Wall Street. Instead, I m going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America. My request is please go to BernieSanders.com and contribute. So there it is, that s our fundraiser. Pretty quick,  Sanders concluded. That  fundraiser  brought in more than $5.1 million dollars in one night for Sanders.  It was a Yuuuge night for the Democratic candidate.Here is the victory speech that broke the internet:Sanders supporters took to Twitter to complain that their contributions were not going through. Act Blue is doing the best they can to deal with the new flood of donations being sent to Sanders.Huge night! Contributions are processing, receipts are a little delayed. Keep the donations coming!!  ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016Our customer service team is always available for support. Just email [email protected] and someone will get back to you.  ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016 ActBlue laid out what happened to cause the issues, in a blog post: Last night s spontaneous fundraiser (the one that raised $5.2 million in less than a day) broke our external processor s response systems. That s some amazing grassroots power. Like we said, we over-prepare, so we were ready for that. But the vendor started giving us a previously undocumented error message, which temporarily caused some donors to not move from the  please wait  page to the confirmation page even though their contributions were already fully processed As a certain hilarious SNL skit pointed out, we all know that Bernie Sanders  average campaign donation is $27 dollars. The people-powered campaign has already smashed President Obama s previous record for the highest number of contributions. The fact that people are making smaller donations to Sanders  campaign gives the candidate a huge advantage in terms of grassroots fundraising. Since very few people have donated the maximum amount they can, supporters can continue to donate to Sanders  campaign throughout the primary season.That might have something to do with why Sanders  raised more money than Hillary Clinton s campaign in January. In January, Sanders received $20 million dollars in donations, while Clinton raised $15 million dollars.Rest assured, anxious Berners.  The campaign s site is up and running and this shouldn t be a problem anymore. Be happy, this is  probably the best problem any candidate could ever have during an election.Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Heidi Cruz Seems POSITIVE Her Husband Is The Second Coming Of Christ (AUDIO),"When thinking about the qualities of someone who should be president, it should be someone who embraces the founding principles as mentioned in our founding documents. Someone who respects freedom of speech, freedom of and from religion, equality under the law, and so on.When thinking about the qualities of Senator Ted Cruz, he doesn t seem to embody much, if any, of those founding principles as they are written. However, he does embody the principles he imagines in his head of what the founders actually meant. He thinks the nation was founded on  Judeo-Christian  principles, and sure, while some of the founders were Christian, many were Deist and didn t believe in the deification of Jesus as mentioned in the Christian Bible.However, Cruz, and several of those who seem to believe what they will about the Constitution and our founders, will continue to wrongfully tout the line that we re a Christian nation. One of those individuals being the Texas senator s wife.While speaking to South Carolina radio host Vince Coakley, Heidi Cruz first told us all the qualities that embody her husband: a man of faith, a believer, a constitutionalist, defender of values, and doesn t waver from his beliefs. However, then she goes on and says something that one can only assume is her declaring Ted Cruz as the second coming of Christ. She said: When I thought about doing it for our country, it became very clear to me that our family must be in this race. And it also became clear to me that we are at a cultural crossroads in our country and if we can be in this race to show this country the face of the God that we serve   this Christian God that we serve is the foundation of our country, our country was built on Judeo-Christian values, we are a nation of freedom of religion, but the God of Christianity is the God of freedom, of individual liberty, of choice and of consequence.And I think that s something that this country really needs to be reminded of, is that Christians are loving people, are nonjudgmental people, but there is right and wrong, we have a country of law and order, there are consequences to actions and we must all live peaceably in our own faiths under the Constitution. And Ted is uniquely able to deliver on that combination of the law and religion. Ted Cruz is going to show us the  face of God ?? What the heck kind of language is that? And if we don t elect her husband, we re going against God? How about this, let s not use any God as a political prop to garner votes in a flailing campaign. Which is exactly what the Cruz family seems to be doing.Oh, and if we re to live in a nation that respects  freedom of religion  that s all religions or lack there of. However, that freedom does not allow any religion to legislate by its religious principles. So while many are terrified of Sharia Law, which is not allowed, neither is Christian Law. Freedom of religion is the freedom to worship whatever you want on your own time as long as you re not harming others. Now, if someone comes into your place of worship and tells you that you can t worship your God, well then that would actually be a violation of your freedom. However, that s not happening, so all this  religious freedom  malarkey is being drummed up to rile up a base of voters that don t know any better. And if she thinks her husband is  nonjudgmental  she must not be listening to the same guy we ve all been subject to hearing for far too long now.No, Heidi, your husband won t show us the  face of God    he s not the second coming of Christ, and he wasn t sent to this earth my means of Canada to govern the United States by  Judeo-Christian  principles. You are mistaken.Listen here to Heidi Cruz go on and on about her husband:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246382976  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image: Flickr/Wikimedia",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Netanyahu Echos Trump, Wants Fence Around Israel To Keep Out ‘Wild Beasts’ (VIDEO)","Echoing statements made by Donald Trump about fences and unwanted Mexicans coming to America, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to build a fence around Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories in order to protect the country  from what he says are  wild beasts,  in reference to Palestinians, Arabs, and black African migrants, who the Israelis find especially scary. During a tour of the Jordan-Israel border in the south Netanyahu said: In our neighborhood, we need to protect ourselves from wild beasts. At the end of the day as I see it, there will be a fence like this one surrounding Israel in its entirety. We will surround the entire state of Israel with a fence, a barrier. He said the plan will take several years to complete and Israel will also look at ways to ensure that the Palestinians don t find ways to escape from the walls that have been built around their cities and villages in the illegally occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Netanyahu said: This thing costs many billions, and we re working on a multi-year plan of prioritization so it would be spread out over years in order to gradually build it, but to complete it to defend the State of Israel. His assertion to defend Israel is not the reason he s building a fence. About 85% of the wall is actually built inside the occupied Palestinian West Bank, effectively annexing and stealing 46% of the land. The wall was ruled illegal by the International Court of Justice in 2004 yet Israel has failed to dismantle it. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJFKL-wkQQI] Trump has also pledged to build walls along the 2,000 mile border with Mexico, a campaign pledge that has apparently caught on with Republican voters.  Trump said:  I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. The abrasive personality traits are striking but the plans are dangerous. We can already see what Netanyahu s policies have done to the Palestinians. He is a war criminal pure and simple. If Trump were to become president of  the most powerful country in the history of the world, the US and the rest of the world have a very bleak future.Featured Image Via Screenshot Capture",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Joe Scarborough Frantically Backtrack After Donald Trump Outs Him As A Supporter (VIDEO),"Considering left-leaning MSNBC still signs Joe Scarborough s paychecks and he s consistently feigned neutrality in the presidential election, it seemed clear that his support of Donald Trump was meant to remain under the radar. Unfortunately for that facade, nobody bothered to tell Trump.While Scarborough was interviewing Trump on MSNBC s Morning Joe things reached an awkward tipping point when the Republican front-runner casually remarked that he appreciated the fact that Scarborough and his co-host Mika Brzezinski were his  supporters  while most of the media was against him. It was great seeing you, you guys have been supporters and I appreciate it. And not necessarily supporters but at least believers. Hilariously, this sent the pundits scrambling to undo the potentially career-ending damage of being tainted with Trump s name. After all, it s bad enough that they, in their capacity as journalists, would choose to pull for any particular candidate, but a racist, xenophobic, torture-enthusiast one is egregious. Brzezinski fares pretty well. She has consistently criticized Trump s toxic demagoguery. Scarborough on the other hand In his clawing desperation to distance himself from Trump, he manages to throw several of his colleagues under the bus as well: Well, I will tell you what when you say  supported  you re talking about how actually   you re talking about Bob (Costa), Mika, myself, also Halperin, Willie and those of us around the table. There were a handful of people who for six months have been saying what happened last night could happen, and the rest of the media world has been mocking and ridiculing what he s done. But while Scarborough would like us to believe he s simply a political savant who predicted Trump s rise, there is mounting evidence that he really does long for a Trump win.In December, when Trump s campaign was starting to change from  This guy is a complete joke  to  This guy could actually win the nomination,  Scarborough openly bragged that he helped Trump prepare for the first debate. It was largely considered to be a make-or-break moment for Trump and his buddy Joe Scarborough was there to help walk him through the process. Let s allow Scarborough to tell it. I ve actually called him up, and I ve said  Donald, listen, you need to speak in complete sentences in debates.  And he goes,  I m up 30 points, Joe,  and I m like,  Good point, Donald,  he said to laughter.He later admitted he met personally with Trump to congratulate him on his second debate performance, albeit saying I hope we don t have reporters here. Further, there has been rumors that Scarborough and Brzezinski met up with Trump on the night of the New Hampshire primary to celebrate his first win. Again, he had hoped to keep it a secret. CNN broke the story anyway:Scarborough and Brzezinski visited Trump s hotel room on Tuesday night while the New Hampshire primary results were rolling in, according to two sources with knowledge of their visit. Scarborough and Brzezinski did not respond to a request for comment.After this article was published, Scarborough posted a series of tweets accusing CNN of lying about him.  Your sources are wrong,  he wrote. Scarborough did not explicitly deny that he visited Trump s hotel room, however.Undermining Scarborough s denials, Trump greeted Scarborough on Morning Joe by saying  it was great  seeing them the previous evening. Oops.While it s a wonder that anyone would support a guy like Trump, Scarborough s fixation isn t entirely out of left field. Despite his posturing as a  moderate  Republican, he s provided plenty of evidence to suggest a war-mongering, egomaniac like Trump would get him hot and bothered. When a group of U.S. soldiers accidentally floated into Iranian waters and were briefly detained, Scarborough shot off a series of embarrassing tweets that advocated for a president who was willing to start a world war over it.Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay.  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 12, 2016(Obama didn t take his advice. Instead, he got the sailors released in less than 24 hours by diplomacy. No shots were fired.)Scarborough has flirted with supporting Trump for too long. To maintain any credibility at all, he needs to either openly admit he s backing the racist buffoon or clarify why he feels so invested in helping him win the election. Hotel visits, late-night debate prep calls, endless soft interviews on his show, all of this is beginning to paint a pretty clear picture. It s not a good one.Featured image: Screenshot",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cruz Ad Turns Trump Into A Creepy Doll Who ‘Pretends To Be A Republican’ (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz s latest ad just manipulated children to send a political message to voters.The latest campaign move for the Texas Senator is a big jab at his biggest GOP rival, Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who is portrayed in the ad as an action figure who  pretends to be a Republican. In the 45-second spot, young boys are shown playing with a Trump doll, while stating that this action figure likes  bailouts for the banks  and donates to Democrats. The ad also features a Hillary Clinton doll, who gets paid by Trump to befriend him   a reference to Trump s claim that Clinton attended his wedding because he donated to her Foundation.Toward the end of the ad, a large dollhouse gets ruined by the Trump doll, who says,  I m going to take your house with eminent domain and park my limos there!  right before destroying it. This particular part of the ad is a reminder that Trump once tried to level an elderly woman s Atlantic City home so he could turn it into a parking lot for limos.At the end of the ad, concerned parents see their children playing destructively with the Trump doll and the narrator asks viewers: We wouldn t tolerate these values in our children. Why would we want them in a president? You can watch the ad below:Cruz s latest ad might just be the candidate s rebuttal to Trump indirectly calling him a  p*ssy  at a recent rally, but this ad doesn t communicate anything that hasn t been said about Trump before. Although the use of children in a political ad was not a tasteful decision, the GOP has often criticized Trump for being a phony Republican   and this ad just points his inconsistencies out in easier terms. Trump has a history of flip-flopping and holding more liberal values.Last week, Cruz beat Trump in the Iowa Caucuses, but Trump took the New Hampshire primary. This attack ad might be the first of many as the two will face off again on February 20th for the South Carolina primary.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Was Asked To Say One Nice Thing About Trump And Cruz – His Response Is Hilarious (IMAGE/VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders made his first appearance on television after his  YUGGGEEE  win in the New Hampshire primaries with the hosts of The View  and it was the perfect mixture of seriousness as well as a little light-humored fun. Bernie began his discussion talking about  the greed and recklessness of Wall Street,  but when he was asked to say just one nice thing about Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, he couldn t!Considering his Republican rivals have never said a single nice thing about Bernie Sanders other than he s a  socialist,  his response was fitting. Here was his first reaction when asked to say something nice about Trump: What can I say? When pressed further,  come on Bernie, he has nice ties; nice hair?  he said very sarcastically  humble  earning him a huge applause. Donald Trump is anything but humble, but we have a feeling everyone already knew that. The guy puts his name on everything for crying out loud.And   when he was asked about Ted Cruz, the only thing he could say was  loud.  Come on Bernie, there must be something nice you can say about the Senator from Texas!He did have nice things to say about John Kasich, though, calling him an  old friend,  and he does think Hillary Clinton is  intelligent.  Very classy with those responses.After winning New Hampshire, Bernie is starting to get more attention from Donald Trump. He used to ignore him preferring to attack Hillary, but now things have changed. While Bernie appeared on The View, Trump was busy taking shots at the Senator from Vermont. On CBS This Morning Trump ignored the polls (go figure, right?) and suggested he would take Bernie head on in a matchup. Real Clear Politics shows Bernie beating Trump handily, though; not the other way around. I would beat Bernie easily. The one thing we have in common is trade. The difference between us is, [Sanders] can t do anything about it. I can.

 Candace Cameron Bure VISIBLY Upset On Fox News Over ANYONE Joking About Hell (VIDEO),"When you ve never been taught what a figure of speech is, you will take everything everyone ever says to you very literally. Same goes for Christian fundamentalists who practice the literal interpretation of the Bible. Candace Cameron Bure seems to be both.While appearing on Fox & Friends, the Fuller House star and sister of the uber fundie Christian Kirk Cameron, decided she would weigh in on what Madeleine Albright joked about while introducing Hillary Clinton at a recent campaign event. Albright said: There s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other. It was meant in jest, and clearly not to be taken as telling women they literally belong in the hell as described in the Bible. However, Bure didn t see it that way at all. Visibly upset, she tells the Fox hosts: Anyone that can even joke, if it was a joke, about hell. There s nothing to me that s funny about that If anybody actually read their Bible and saw what   the description of Hell, it s disgusting. To be honest, what would be scarier for a lot of people would be,  there s a special place at the bottom of a Chuck-E-Cheese ball pit  but I digress.Bure took this comment made by Albright very personally and then somehow magically linked it to abortion, because why not? Then she said: To say that they re not feminists, that they re anti-women if they re not supporting another woman is   you know, that to me is what s wrong with feminism. That is a turnoff for me as a woman. Someone clearly missed the day in her Women s Study course that explained part of feminism is empowering all women, even women who in their abortion choices, choose life and those who advocate for that cause. That s their right if they so choose. No one is telling Bure how to think, and Albright was simply pointing out the fact that if any woman were to tell another woman, say Candace Cameron Bure, that they were wrong for the mere fact that they re a woman, then there s a special place in H-E- double hockey sticks, for them.All too often in society, women s voices are placed on the back burner. This happens in the home, it happens in the workplace, and in happens in politics. And yes, women, who don t help each other are of detriment to not only those in their immediate surroundings, but in all of society. Women can sometimes find themselves trying with all their might to compete in a male-dominated world, and while men pat themselves on the back regularly help each other rise up, women don t often have that luxury, because they are working hard on themselves. That s why feminism is important. That s why what Madeleine Albright said is true, and that s why women everywhere need to make sure we are making all women inclusive in the workplace, in politics, and in society.So, Bure, while your concerns are heard, they are unfounded. You are more than allowed to be pro-life and still advocate for other women to be heard and seen as well. And no, Madeleine Albright doesn t actually want people to go to hell. It s a figure of speech.

 Michigan Republican: We’re Making Gay Sex A Felony To Protect Animals Because Reasons,"Recently, an anti-animal abuse bill passed the Michigan state Senate. That s the good news. Everyone likes to protect animals, right? Unfortunately, the sneaky little bastards in the GOP  decided the bill just wasn t human enough. Keeping in line with their long tradition of ruining every single thing they touch, Republicans inserted language into the bill that would make human-on-human oral and anal sex a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.One might assume that  Senate Bill (SB) 219, sponsored by state Senator (R)ick Jones, would at least be further amended to remove language penalizing  sodomy  (oral and anal sex) with a stiff sentence of up to 15 years behind bars. Unfortunately, we apparently live in some bizarre dimension where this sort of backward-thinking idiocy is somehow acceptable.The legislation states that it is a felony to engage in  the abominable and detestable crime against nature with mankind or with any animal.  While most would agree that it s probably not appropriate to finger-bang a horse, and that someone who does that sort of thing should probably spend some time away from the rest of society, most Americans also agree that we must not police what goes on in private citizens  bedrooms.Law Newz reports that Jones remains steadfast that the language he personally inserted in the bill is not intended to in any way target the gay community, but also maintains that removing the  with mankind  portion will poison the bill:SB 219 was designed to be part of a larger package of bills known as Logan s Law. The law is designed to prevent individuals convicted of animal abuse, animal torture or bestiality from possessing an animal for five years, and during probation, in the hopes the individual will seek mental health treatment. People wanted an animal abuse registry similar to a sex abuse registry,  Jones continued.So why does this latest bill include language that equates anal sex with crimes against nature? Senator Jones maintains it s just part of the legislative process. He claims that the anti-sodomy language is preexisting Michigan law and has no practical effect.The  existing law  was deemed unconstitutional thanks to a 2003 Supreme Court ruling, yet he included it anyway.The law blog continues:In defiance of stark criticism, Jones claims removing the anti-sodomy language would effectively poison the bill, though it was Senator Jones who included the language in the first place. When asked why he would include the phrase  crime against nature with mankind,  Jones said,  in order to write that law, we had to go into a section of law, the bestiality section, which has sodomy in it and has been there forever. It has nothing to do with it. Oddly, these lawmakers seem completely unaware that the water in Flint is literally poison   or, they simply don t care.Conservatives  obsession with gay sex is creepy at best, criminal at worst. Hopefully, on election day, voters remember this blatant attempt to pass legislation criminalizing homosexuality   because Republicans get scarier by the day.Hopefully, lawmakers in the Michigan state House have a little more sense than their counterparts in the Senate.Featured image via LawNewz",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 L.A. Cop Accidentally Shoots Himself While Chasing Suspect (VIDEO),"A Los Angeles County sheriff s deputy accidentally shot himself while chasing a suspect on February 10.According to the Los Angeles Times, the unnamed deputy sustained a gunshot wound to the calf. He was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where he received medical treatment for non-life threatening injuries.According to the L.A. Times, the officer attempted to stop a vehicle at around 4:00 in the morning, when the driver fled the scene. The deputy ran after the suspect and accidentally shot himself. Police have not released further details on how the shooting took place.Here s more on the story from KTLA.Just over a week ago, the L.A. County Sheriff s Department mistakenly released a murderer.According to Fox 11, 37-year-old Steven Lawrence Wright was  accidentally  released from jail at about 1:00 in the afternoon, on Saturday, January 30.Wright was arrested on murder charges and was awaiting trial.The Sheriff s department finally realized that Wright had been  mistakenly  let out of jail at 9:30 pm on January 31, more than 32 hours later.Wright was finally recaptured on February 8, nine days after he was first allowed to walk out of the jail. Not surprisingly, the accused murderer had fled the state of California. He was taken into custody in Boulder City, Nevada.But ineptitude isn t the only thing that is troubling the L.A. County Sheriff s Department this week.The department has been under intense public scrutiny over the past several years. A five-year-long federal investigation has resulted in the convictions of more than a dozen officials on a wide-range of brutality, abuse and corruption charges.Those convicted include Undersheriff Paul Tanaka and former Captain William Thomas Carey, along with a list of other former department officials and deputies.On February 10, the L.A. Times reported that former sheriff Lee Baca, who retired in 2014 during the height of the abuse and corruption scandal, pled guilty to making false statements to investigators.Baca struck a plea agreement with prosecutors, who promised to drop additional charges in exchange for the guilty plea. Under the agreement, he will serve no more than six months in prison for his crimes.The almost unbelievable ineptitude and corruption in the L.A. County Sheriff s Department should serve as a warning to all of us.Police are not infallible. Sometimes they make stupid mistakes, like accidentally shooting themselves in the leg or mixing up their prisoner list. Sometimes they abuse their power and violate the nature of their oath.We don t do our society any favors when we put cops on a pedestal or automatically assume that having a gun and a badge makes them infallible.

 Chris Matthews Stuns Colleagues By Telling The Harsh Truth About Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz is horrible. According to former classmates, he spent his time in college hanging out near the women s restroom in a bathrobe, and leaves a greasy film behind on all he touches. His own daughter seems to be repulsed by the very thought of expressing affection toward him. On Wednesday, MSNBC s Chris Matthews may have solved the puzzle of the Texas Senator s general horribleness. There s a troll-like quality to Cruz,  Matthews told Joe Scarborough during a panel on the topic of Cruz s ability to challenge Trump.  He operates below the level of human life. That s a little tough!  Scarborough replied.  You have not gotten sleep. We re going to try that again. Can I not have an opinion?  Matthews asked, before being told by Scarborough,  Not that opinion.  Matthews attempted to better explain his position in a manner that even Joe Scarborough can grasp, which is a difficult task: I think he appeals to people s negativity rather than their joy. I don t think people feel good about voting for Cruz. I think they feel   I don t know what it is he appeals to. People say he inherited the Libertarian crowd. I don t see how. He doesn t seem Libertarian to me. He s appealed to the Baptists up here. I don t understand that. What is he? A theocrat? Maybe he is,  the Matthews continued.  There s something about that guy who has always reminded me of Joe McCarthy, and there s something about him that s negative and menacing. When I say below the level of human life, I mean the good nature of human life, not just being a person,  he said, explaining that the 2016 hopeful simply doesn t have a human side.That pretty much explains Ted Cruz. He s human, certainly, in that he has flesh and breathes and probably has feelings sometimes. But he is terrible at displaying it. Like Rubio, he comes off as robotic. But unlike Rubio, everything about him seems disgusting and evil.Watch the Hardball host reveal Cruz for who he is below:Featured image from screengrab",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Right-Wingers Super P*ssed That School Board Will Not Allow Federal Agents To Target Kids,"The Los Angeles County School Board has caused an uproar with their right-wing residents because they do not want federal immigration officers inside of schools. The board voted unanimously on Tuesday to direct staff members at any school not to allow ICE agents inside of schools or provide federal authorities with student data without clearance. This move has prompted anti-immigration conservatives to lash out because, apparently, they believe children should be hauled out of their classrooms and arrested.Here are some of the comments under the article on the LA Times Facebook page:   And the comments under the article on the site were not much better:Well, aren t they just chock full of  family values ?!What s even funnier is that these imbeciles obviously have not ever bothered to look into our countries immigration policies because if they had, this isn t new. Traditionally immigration officials have not raided places they have deemed  sensitive  like churches and schools. In 2011, they made this very clear in a memo that stated:This memorandum sets forth Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policy regarding certain enforcement actions by ICE officers and agents at or focused on sensitive locations. This policy is designed to ensure that these enforcement actions do not occur at nor are focused on sensitive locations such as schools and churches The only reason the school board voted on this was to reassure parents, who do not trust the government, that school was safe for their kids. Ever since nationwide immigration sweeps netted more than a hundred undocumented people last month, parents have been even more frightened. According to the LA Times:Although there were no raids in L.A. last month, residents are concerned because the city has a large Central American immigrant population.So to Rodriguez, the resolution is, in part, a symbolic gesture to tell families that  we stand for the safety of our children,  he said.  These are safe spaces. It s sad that the right-wing is so full of hate, that they want kids to be afraid to go to school. And if these kids overcome their fear, they want law enforcement agents with guns to rip these children away from their families because they had the audacity to try to receive an education. How sick is that?

" So Long, Chris Christie — And Thanks For Destroying Marco Rubio On Your Way Out","Chris Christie s campaign has signaled that the New Jersey governor has finally read the writing on the wall and will announce the end of presidential campaign soon. It s surely a victory for America (although probably disappointing for New Jersey residents) to see Christie return from whence he came, but amid the celebrations let s remember: There were some good times too.Like when Christie single-handedly destroyed Marco Rubio s chances of ever being president.It will go down in history as one of 2016 s defining political moments. Live and on the debate stage, a combative Christie managed to utterly embarrass the ill-prepared, shallow Marco Rubio in a matter of seconds. In an election that has been far too consumed with cheap talking points and heavily-rehearsed performance art, we got to see, in that instant, the moment two candidates stopped being polite and started being real.Rubio crumpled   and it was painful to watch.It s hard to know what Rubio was thinking after getting so completely shut down   in fairness, it s hard to think above the noise of whirring of gears and CPU cooling fans   but afterwards the effect was clear. The candidate most journalists had already ordained as the presumptive Republican nominee was dead in the water. Rubio s campaign limps on, but in the way a ghost might if his end was so sudden he never realized he died at all.The Washington Post s Dana Milbank puts it better:Tuesday night, Rubio proved true the axiom popularized by Alan Simpson, the wisecracking former senator from Wyoming:  One day you re the toast of the town, the next you re toast. Now, to be clear, let s not give Christie too much credit for his kamikaze finish. The infamous blowhard was   and remains   a complete asshole. His quest to take down his opponents doesn t stem from some higher moral principles   he just likes being a bully. Returning to New Jersey, he will go on being a bully. That s Christie s whole shtick. In this light, Christie s Rubio takedown was a Joker-like desire just to see the world burn. He takes down Rubio because he can, not because he wants to.But regardless of motives, Christie was a refreshing change of pace. Trump also insults his fellow candidates, but his diminished intellect and massive ego mean that they are typically low-blows, potshots and vulgarity. Christie, having practiced the artform numerous times against teachers and nurses, is capable of bullying on the next level.Now Christie returns to New Jersey, a place where most residents despise him and most attorneys have grown fat off his nearly-endless stream of self-induced scandals. At one time he was considered a Republican frontrunner. It never panned out. Instead, he ll have to be content with the idea that while there will never be a Chris Christie White House, there won t be a Marco Rubio one either thanks to him.We all have our parts to play. Maybe this one is Christie s.Feature image from screengrab ",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher Hilariously Hammers ‘Evil’ Ted Cruz On Jimmy Kimmel Live (VIDEO),"Jimmy Kimmel couldn t stop laughing as Bill Maher repeatedly mocked the GOP.During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday night, Real Time host Bill Maher made an appearance to talk about the New Hampshire primary and what he would do if he had no choice but to vote for one Republican candidate in the field. I d kill myself,  Maher simply stated.Maher explained that the United States would be a horrible place to live under Republican control, especially for women. The nearest abortion clinic will be in London!  he said.Then Maher got the chance to talk about the candidates he doesn t like, and Ted Cruz was at the top of the list. Ted Cruz is always the worst,  Maher said. He is smart and evil. The other ones are true dummies, like Rubio, he doesn t know what he s talking about, he just says the words. But Ted Cruz is diabolical. He s smart. This is what I really hate about this   and this is what a true cynic is   he s smart, but he knows what to say to his dummy base that they will believe. Maher even gave an example. Cruz once told his dummy base that he was a fan of classic rock prior to 9/11, but said he leaned more toward country music after the towers fell. It was a perfect example of Cruz pandering to the stupid rednecks who dominate the conservative base today.Here s the video via YouTube.Maher also reiterated his support of Bernie Sanders, but urged Democrats to vote for Hillary Clinton should she become the nominee because not doing so could send a Republican to the White House, which would doom our nation to at least four years of hell as the GOP passes every policy they ve ever desired to force upon us.

 Bette Midler Sums Up The Republican Party In One Amazing Tweet Everyone Should Read (IMAGE),"It really is perfect.And it s from a book that was published in 1961.When Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22 over 50 years ago, he had no idea that a particular passage in his classic novel would one day be the EXACT description of the Republican Party.But Twitter user Maris Kreizman certainly noticed the similarities, which is why she shared the discovery, only for it to then be shared worldwide by singing and acting icon Bette Midler.In a post last month that seems to have gone largely unnoticed for some reason, Midler posted the passage, aiming particularly at Donald Trump. However, the paragraph really can be be applied to the GOP in general. It was miraculous. It was almost no trick at all, he saw, to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth, impotence into abstinence, arrogance into humility, plunder into philanthropy, thievery into honor, blasphemy into wisdom, brutality into patriotism, and sadism into justice. Anybody could do it; it required no brains at all. It merely required no character.  ~Joseph Heller, Catch-22Here s the tweet via Twitter.With credit. pic.twitter.com/8wrCbwEY49  Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) January 4, 2016For years, Republicans have been hypocrites when it comes to lawbreaking, claiming that it s okay when white conservatives use their guns to seize federal property or use their bibles as an excuse to violate the rights of others. In other words, they want us all to think of these vices as virtues.The  slander into truth  part is pretty easy since Republicans have been lying about liberals and liberal policies throughout the last eight years while insisting that they are telling the truth.Republicans have also disguised arrogance as humility, although they really aren t hiding it anymore.The way conservative donors like the Koch brothers use pretended philanthropy to give themselves more power is one of the more disgusting aspects of Republicans today, and it was perfectly described by Heller.Republicans have also pretended for decades that stealing from the poor to give to the wealthy is honorable, but it s only caused great suffering among the American people as the middle class shrinks and families struggle to put food on the table.Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have made it very clear during the GOP primary that they intend to bring back torture, which they think is a patriotic and just way of fighting the war on terror. For years, Republicans have displayed fake patriotism while at the same time sending our troops to their deaths in wars for profit and once our troops come home, they refuse to take care of them. This is evident in their blockage of bills that would aid veterans and first responders.And finally, the conservative support of the death penalty and cops who kill unarmed black men are the ultimate examples of how Republicans see sadism as justice.Make no mistake, this paragraph from Joseph Heller is downright prophetic, and Bette Midler did us all a favor by bringing it to our attention.

 Texas Cops Execute Naked Black Teen — Won’t Say If He Was Armed (VIDEO),"Another day, another black teen s life lost at the hands of cops. This incident took place in Austin, Texas, where a naked black teen was killed by officers who were checking out complaints about   get this   a suspicious black suspect.Austin s Chief Brian Manley held a press conference and tried to calm the public and the media surrounding the shooting, in which he, of course, deemed it necessary because the 18-year-old disobeyed the officers. Conveniently, he also says that the guy charged at the cops. Whether this is true or not is unknown at this time. Further, the top cop would not tell reporters whether or not the teen was armed in any way. This likely means that he was not, because if he had been, they d be rushing to tell every reporter in the country that the scary, naked black guy would have shot them if they hadn t shot him first.The police department has also refused to say who the officers who fired the fatal shots are, only that they are on leave while the shooting is checked out. In other words, they ll investigate themselves and find that they did nothing wrong.The local chapter of the NAACP is on the case, and rightfully so, because the likelihood of this being an illegal execution by cop, rather than a justified police shooting, is, as per usual in these cases, quite high. The chapter s president, Nelson Linder, said of the shooting: We see a rush to judgment and as a result, somebody is dead. Normally it s always somebody black, in this city and this country. I don t see how a young man who s naked, and not hurting anybody, winds up being dead. When in reality, those things require constraint and understanding, as opposed to deadly force. The question is, how do you address your policy now? The problem with these shootings is often times APD, they don t appear to enforce their own policies. If that s the case we have a major problem because if you have a policy and don t follow it, then what good is it? He s exactly right. So, now,  disobeying  a cop is a capital offense? Then again, it always has been if you re Black in America. Despicable, but true.Watch a video news report on the incident below:Featured image from video screen capture via Raw Story",News,"February 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John McCain Just Openly Mocked ‘Dangerous’ GOP Candidates On The Senate Floor (VIDEO),"John McCain is no stranger to war and torture. He experienced it first hand when his plane was shot down in Vietnam and he was captured by the VC. His descriptions of what he endured in 1968 are horrific at best.That makes him possibly the most qualified man in Congress to speak on the subject. His seat as Chair of the Armed Forces Committee also gives him a certain insight into what the United States did to prisoners in violation of the Geneva Convention and the treaty we signed outlawing torture with 147 other countries in 1987.For candidates like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz to declare that waterboarding, a simulated execution by drowning, is in any way acceptable isn t just dangerous, it s criminal. McCain reminds us that after World War II, Japanese generals were tried, convicted and hung for their role in torturing POWs, which included waterboarding.McCain makes a powerful statement about the role of waterboarding or any kind of torture for that matter: It s been so disappointing to see some presidential candidates on the campaign trail engaged in loose talk about reviving waterboarding and other inhumane interrogation techniques. It might be easy to dismiss this bluster as cheap campaign rhetoric, but these statements must not go unanswered because they mislead the American people about the realities of interrogation, how to gather intelligence, what it takes to defend our security and at the most fundamental level what we are fighting for as a nation. Senator McCain s words had to sting those candidates who love to pander to the extremists of the right. The fear-mongering they engage in creates a perfect atmosphere for a mob mentality that demands we torture people, even if it isn t good interrogation technique because hate prevails with the ignorant.Good for you, Senator. It s comforting to see Republicans standing up to the degenerates your base has decided to endorse.

 A Bunch Of Dumb White Racists Will Picket NFL Offices Because Beyonce Gave Them Butthurt (IMAGES),"Beyonce Knowles took the field at Super Bowl 50 and the crowd went wild. The mega-star and her corps of dancers were perfectly choreographed and brilliantly outfitted. It was lively and entertaining. It was also, unfortunately, far too  black  for those wonderful American racists who just can t help but ruin everything.In case you weren t paying attention, Beyonce s dancers wore berets, which automatically means they support Herman Bell, the famous Black Panther who was tried and convicted of murder in the 1970s without ever being positively identified by an all-white jury. Even if Bell were indisputably guilty   which is beyond questionable   by that logic any white person wearing a cross around their neck supports the Westboro Baptist Church, but I digress.At one point, The dancers formed an  X  on the field, an obvious and admitted tribute to Malcolm X. They also formed an arrow that pointed at Beyonce, which was obviously meant to call attention to the black woman on the field, and we can t have that. Only black men in uniform are allowed on football fields, and only if they never have an opinion about anything or show any emotion whatsoever. It upsets racists.Beyonce and her team also put their fists up in a  black power  salute, which is also a common sign used by the black panthers and millions of other people since the 1960s. The coup de gras came after the performance, however, when several of the dancers were photographed around a sign that read  Justice For Mario Wood,  a young black man murdered by police, which of curse also ties Beyonce to the Black Lives Matter movement.The song Beyonce chose is also about her pride for her heritage. The lyrics included: My daddy Alabama   Momma Louisiana. You mix that Negro with that Creole   Make a Texas bamma I like my baby hair    with baby hair and afros I like my Negro nose   with Jackson Five nostrils. The racist douchebags of America have declared that they won t stand for this sort of thing. These shenanigans are unbefitting a halftime show and they won t sit idly by and allow it to happen. A black woman and her black dancers performed a number that wasn t acceptable to them, so they demand a return to the glory days when only Paul McCartney, Elton John and other white people were allowed to entertain at halftime.Fifteen minutes of the Left Shark bouncing around to the chicken dance would be more acceptable than having to endure black culture mixed in with their Coldplay. And just why the hell would Chris Martin join two black artists at the end for a chorus promoting unity for ALL people? Disgusting.Sadly, that isn t an exaggeration. The racist bags of sh*t of America can t understand how black artists do anything other than smile and sing innocuous lyrics while impersonating the Four Tops, rejecting their desire to be individuals or to protest for the good of the white race. They are so upset about it, there s now an Eventbrite announcement for an anti-Beyonce rally outside the NFL headquarters scheduled for February 16th. The front page of the event reads as though Beyonce held up pictures of Michael Brown and screamed  black power  into the mic. Sorry to burst your bubble, racists, but even that would have been acceptable:As if that weren t bad enough, the images used to promote the protest are actually of Herman Bell:Herman Bell was an activist during turbulent times who managed to turn his life around and earn a dual bachelor s and a master s degree and become a positive role model and mentor, all while incarcerated for 35 years for a crime he swears he didn t commit. In true racist a-holes of America fashion, all they see is an angry young man from another era who was convicted 70s style by a jury of someone else s peers.Organizers have also taken to Twitter, where the memes about how evil black people are and how all they can be are criminals are also making the rounds in connection with the #BoycottBeyonce  movement :Fun fact BernieBlacks are incarcerated at higher rate because they commit higher rate of crime ?#NHPrimary pic.twitter.com/oEpCaNo990  Jared Wyand (@JaredWyand) February 10, 2016There are so many ways a guy like that needs to be educated. The first way would be  how to remove your own hgead from your ass and read a book.  They tend to hide lots of useful information in those things.Here s the tweet that perfectly sums up the situation:#BoycottBeyonce = I wish black people would just entertain me instead of standing up for #BlackLivesMatter + being proud of their culture.  jen miller (@jenerallyspeaks) February 9, 2016The rally will happen. Racists will gather and demand to be heard, because they are white. Black people will be painted as even more evil than those darned Hispanics. At the end of the day they ll go home and nobody will care. The Super Bowl will continue to offer entertaining halftime shows by artists of all backgrounds, because they love ratings and money.Sorry, you meatheads, but the NFL won t be putting David Allen Coe on stage anytime soon.

 Family’s Dog Poisoned By Flint’s Toxic Lead Water,"For more than a year the people of Flint, Michigan have been poisoned by their government because Republicans in the state wanted to save some money. What s worse is that officials knew the water was full of lead and they did nothing about it. The toxic water has been linked to the deaths of ten people and thousands of adults and children have been exposed to a multitude of chronic conditions because Governor Synder failed them. Unsurprisingly, we are now learning that in addition to the human victims of Flint, dogs have also been contaminated.According to Dog Time:Two dogs in Genessee County tested positive for lead toxicity according to the state veterinarian, Dr. James Averill. State officials aren t releasing many other details such as how much lead they had in their systems or what their symptoms were. One was a stray, and the other was a pet. Both are still alive. Symptoms of lead poisoning can include malaise, arthritis, and mental dullness.It was really only a matter of time before we heard about pets being affected by the Snyder Administration s systematic poisoning of an entire city. Our pets, after all, drink the same water we do; but even though we knew it would happen, it is still infuriating.Literally, nobody has gone untouched in Flint. And as more details emerge about what led to this, it really is just completely mind-blowing. For instance, for just $100 a day, for three months, all of this could have been avoided, but Republicans were like, Meh. Let s  save  money and gamble with people s lives.  Oh, but it gets even better: Instead of spending all of their time worrying about the people in Flint and the enormous humanitarian crisis on their hands, GOP lawmakers are trying to ban anal and oral sex. We are not kidding.Dr. Averill is telling the people of Flint to keep an eye on their pets and if they are acting out of the ordinary, bring them to the vet. He also told them to give them bottled water or melted snow. That s right, melted snow is safer than the water in the city. How screwed up is that?All of this proves that not even our pets are safe from the Republican Party s inability to govern.

 Starbucks ‘Pleased’ That Their Cafes Are Now Segregated For Men And Women (TWEETS),"Saudi Arabia, that bastion of human rights, is at the center of a controversy on Twitter. To be more specific, a Starbucks in Saudi Arabia is getting the attention. That s because their stores have segregated entrances for men and women.Stories about the barbaric treatment women and other political minorities face in Saudi Arabia are nothing new. However, the oppression they face does not usually receive a publicly stated golden seal of approval from a major U.S. company.One Starbucks located in Jabir is currently undergoing remodeling. They have segregated entrances and seating for women and families. The wall that separates the two sides came down during the remodel. So they decided to just outright ban women from entering the cafe. One woman encountered this sign while trying to get her caffeine fix. PLEASE NO ENTRY FOR LADIES ONLY SEND YOUR DRIVER TO ORDER THANK YOU. #Starbucks store in Riyadh refused 2 serve me just because I'm a WOMAN & asked me 2 send a man instead@Starbucks pic.twitter.com/6Nj6DkOtFJ  Manar N (@manarn8) February 1, 2016Unreal. Starbucks in Saudi Arabia refused to serve women. Note on their door, plus official response from company. pic.twitter.com/d4tCSqqQOv  Muhammad Lila (@MuhammadLila) February 3, 2016It gets so much worse.Starbucks responded to the situation. They released a press statement, which says the following: At Starbucks, we adhere to the local customs of Saudi Arabia by providing separate entrances for families as well as single people. In addition, all our stores provide equal amenities, service, menu, and seating for men, women, and families. Starbucks, whoever came up with  we adhere to the local customs of Saudi Arabia  needs to be paid more. They managed to make Starbuck s support of incredibly sexist laws against women sound like the company is doing nothing more than trying to be a culturally sensitive 21st-century global corporation.What other local customs of rich ISIS does (Saudi Arabia really does not like it when you compare them to ISIS) Starbucks adhere too? If an atheist like Raef Badawi,  threatened  Islam by saying what they believe in one of their 78 locations in Saudi Arabia, would they be fine with it if they person was sentenced to death?  The official statement said  customs  which leaves a lot of room for such questions.I could go on and on dissecting the lengthy statement put out by Starbucks. The mental gymnastics that went into making the company sound as if they are actually supporting women s rights is astounding. However, I think this might be the most egregious part: We are pleased to share that the store is now accessible to single men on one side as well as women and families on the other side. Starbucks has now 78 stores in Saudi Arabia and all stores cater to both families and singles, except for one that is exclusively reserved for women and families. They re  pleased  to inform people everything is back to normal because their cafes are all now 100% segregated again.If you recall, Starbucks attempted to profit from the wholesale slaughter of people of color last year, by way of their infamous #RaceTogether marketing campaign. After all, one marginalized group s oppression is another empowered group s opportunity. For some f#cking reason, Starbucks urged customers to talk to their baristas about racism.Here s an idea, what if every one of Starbucks  customers started asking baristas about how incredibly messed up Starbucks  overseas business practices are? We can make it a campaign and call it something like #HoldTheSexism or #PatriarchyTogether. This is really low for a company that tries so hard to appear to be progressive.Featured image By Nirzar (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons ",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FL Man Hurls Live Alligator Through Wendy’s Drive-Thru Window (VIDEO),"Joshua James, a 24-year-old resident of Jupiter, Florida, is facing charges of assault with a deadly weapon, illegal transportation of an alligator, and theft.The charges were filed after James threw a three-and-a-half foot long, living American alligator through a Wendy s drive-thru window.According to investigators at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Division, James and a friend were driving on Southern Blvd. near Loxahatchee, in Palm Beach County, when he noticed the alligator at the side of the road.He pulled his four-door pickup truck to the side of the road and then wrangled the reptile into the backseat.After capturing the animal, James drove to a gas station, where he proceeded to fill up his gas tank, with the live alligator in the backseat.He then headed off to the Wendy s drive-thru, where he ordered a large drink.After the server handed him his beverage, he reached into the back of the truck, grabbed the alligator, and threw it through the drive-up window, into the restaurant.Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation officers were called to the scene to remove the alligator from the restaurant.Conservation officials took this picture.Image credit: screen capture from NBC 5, via youtubeOn February 9, Judge Joseph Marx released James on $6,000 bail.As part of the terms of his release, James is barred from visiting any Wendy s restaurants. He is also barred from coming into contact with any animals, except for his mother s dog.Under Florida law, it is a third-degree felony to kill, attempt to kill, possess or capture an alligator or its eggs without a license. James faces up to five years in prison on that charge alone.Conservation officials managed to capture the gator. It was released into a nearby canal, where it can hopefully live out the rest of its life without further contact with idiotic humans.According to James, throwing the alligator was just a  funny prank. The people working inside the restaurant didn t find it so funny. Thankfully, neither the employees nor the alligator were injured during this stupid stunt, although things could have ended much differently.Here s more on this story from NBC 5, via YouTube.

" Charity Is Buying Bankrupt Homophobic Pastor’s Church, Converting It To LGBT Youth Haven","In a complete 180 degree turn, a church that was the site of numerous mind boggling anti-gay rants will now be home to a shelter designed specifically to help at-risk LGBT youth. How s that for karma?Reverend James David Manning has become notorious for the awful sermons he delivers from his Harlem-based Atlah Worldwide Church. Outside, he frequently puts up massive signs denouncing homosexuality and anyone who supports gay rights. One sign claimed supporting same-sex marriage would give a person cancer or syphilis. Another declared Obama had released  homo demons  to attack black men.Thankfully, Manning s time being able to spew insane garbage from the pulpit appears to be over. Manning, busy as he was spreading hate, seems to have massively mismanaged his finances. His church is reportedly over $1 million in debt and the property it sits on will now be auctioned off.Enter the Ali Forney Center, an organization dedicated to providing help to homeless and at-risk LGBTQ youth. Since hearing about the recent vacancy they have been fundraising to buy Manning s old church. In just 12 days they raised over $200,000. It s likely they will soon be able to acquire it. We re confident we ll be able to go into the auction with a partner that will allow us to have not just an entry-level bid,  said Carl Siciliano, the Center s founder and executive director. Because the building is historic, it is subject to zoning laws that make it almost impossible for the lot to be used to erect something like luxury housing or office buildings. If the building still manages to fall into the hands of a developer, Siciliano and his colleagues have a back-up plan: they will try to rent space there for $30,000 a month.Hilariously, Manning seems to be in pure denial that his church is being sold. He insists he s not leaving. In a disturbing video, Manning took aim at his  enemies  that want to take him down just because he hasn t paid over a million dollars in taxes. He does, however, appear to be dimly aware that his church will soon be a homeless shelter for LGBTQ youths. All kinds of stuff is being spread around [about how] they re going to turn this church into a bathhouse. How they re going to turn it into a homeless building for the sodomites. It s mainly the sodomites. The soulful minded people aren t doing anything. It s not  soulful  people or  sodomites  doing this to Manning   it s the government. In December, a judge ordered the foreclosure after over a decade of Manning s church deliberately not paying his taxes. Records show that he has a whopping nine separate tax liens against him. Some going as far back as 2002.Manning is always quick to point out parts of the bible that speak against homosexuality, but he seems to have overlooked the parts that condemn greed. Maybe he should have paid more attention.Feature image from YouTube ",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders And The Racist Billionaire Won The New Hampshire Primary,"Bernie Sanders just won the New Hampshire primary race. The candidate that was once written off as a protest candidate, that would only be successful in pushing Hillary Clinton to the left, has won one of the first primary elections in the nation. At the time this was written, Bernie Sanders has 57.9 percent of the vote with Clinton at 40 percent. That isn t particularly surprising, seeing as Sanders has long held a massive lead in the polls over Clinton in that state.This comes after a close caucus election in Iowa. Bernie Sanders ultimately lost that election, though it was virtually a tie.https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/977514378970233/?type=3&theaterSanders supporters should be Feeling the Bern harder than they ever have at this moment. Though that feeling must ultimately transform into action, if they wish to bypass Clinton s firewall that is the Nevada caucus and South Carolina primary. The only thing for sure at this point is that the Democratic primary battle is going to be a long, tight race.On the Republican side, Donald Trump has won the New Hampshire primary. I guess racism and sexism still sells in parts of New England. What is somewhat interesting, is that John Kasich, a man whose candidacy has been anything but interesting, appears to have taken second place, with the anemic Jeb Bush taking third. Cruz, the winner of the Iowa caucus took fourth place. The Rubiobot seems to be malfunctioning, as he took fifth place.Trump may be riding high now though it remains to be seen if he can maintain his momentum. One thing is for sure, should he be the eventual Republican nominee, it will be fun to watch Sanders or Clinton mop the floor with him in the general election. Then again, that is true for any of the other GOP candidates.Featured image from Phil Roeder via Flickr",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Watch These Young Conservatives Try To Explain Why Trump Is Their Man, But Fail Miserably (VIDEO)","It s somewhat terrifying listening to how some of how our young people praise Donald Trump and how he d like to govern the country. It s also more than disconcerting when you hear them just parrot talking points that have no basis in reality. Such as,  Conservative values are ensuring that the government doesn t get too involved in people s lives.  They ve apparently never witnessed their conservative legislators trying to dictate the lives of women and the LGBT community. Maybe they mean  their lives    other people, well, that s different.You ll also hear these kids talk about the standard catch phrases like  family values,  which has been code for  hating gays  for a very long time, as well as  limited government  which is code for  limited regulations on business.  Because as aforementioned, they have no problem making sure government gets involved in the lives of those they don t agree with.These young cons even had the audacity to say: The worst Republican is better than the best Democrat. Really? Where the hell did you hear that? And most of these young conservatives would actually vote for Donald Trump if he were to become the nominee. However, not all of them have fallen for The Donald s schtick.You really need to witness the insanity for yourself.

 Looks Like The Matrix May Actually Happen – Check Out This Amazing New Brain Implant (VIDEO),"Depending on how you look at it, being able to control our minds with machines and computers could be either very terrifying or extremely awesome. However it looks like we re getting very close to connecting the two together.And according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA): A DARPA-funded research team has created a novel neural-recording device that can be implanted into the brain through blood vessels, reducing the need for invasive surgery and the risks associated with breaching the blood-brain barrier. The technology was developed under DARPA s Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, and offers new potential for safely expanding the use of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) to treat physical disabilities and neurological disorders. via DARPAResearchers at the University of Melbourne are trying to reduce the need for invasive surgery, and success of this technique could change the way modern medicine is performed. Their hope is that with this non-invasive techniques doctors will be able to better treat a wide range of neurological ailments. One of which being PTSD.According to HuffPo: The idea shares some similarities to the film  The Matrix  where human beings are  plugged  into a virtual world through a data port in the back of the neck. However DARPA believes that the main barrier in place preventing humans from effectively communicating is that the cabling we use to transfer the data between the brain and the computer is far too simplistic. There s hope that eventually this will be a way for people to even use artificial limbs as though they were organic. This technology, if successful, is going to change the lives of millions of individuals around the world.Quite honestly, this is absolutely extraordinary.Watch here via HuffPo:Featured image: flixnerd",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black College Professor: I Was Handcuffed By White Cops For A Parking Ticket,"A black college professor from New Jersey is alleging that police officers detained her over a parking ticket, handcuffing her to a table and subjecting her to a search.Dr. Imani Perry, an African-American studies professor at Princeton University, said she was mistreated by two white police officers because of her race.According to a New York Times interview with police Capt. Nicholas K. Sutter, a computer search found that Perry had an outstanding arrest warrant for unpaid parking tickets from 2013, and she was arrested.Dr. Perry wrote about her arrest on Twitter and Facebook, saying it left her humiliated and frightened. She said she was on her way to work when she was pulled over  for a single parking ticket three years ago. She said that the male officer conducted a  body search  on her even though a female officer was present. She said that she was not allowed to make a phone call before she was put into the squad car, and that she was later handcuffed to a table at the station.Writing on Twitter, Perry said she received criticism from conservative observers who insisted she brought her predicament on herself,  There are a number of commentators online who have repeated to me an all-too-common formulation:  Well, if you hadn t done anything wrong this wouldn t have happened.  But this demand for behavioral perfection from Black people in response to disproportionate policing and punishment is a terrible red herring. Perry s case is the most recent in a string of incidents that have received exposure online, in which it appears police officers have put black citizens under extra scrutiny, in some cases leading to their deaths in the case of people like Sandra Bland.In turn, this has led to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, in which greater accountability and oversight of police officers is being demanded. By contrast, conservatives have insisted that this accountability is part of a  war on cops.

 Conservative Supreme Court Ruling Just Gave The Oil Companies A Big Win,"In what is considered a massive set-back not just to Obama s environmental policy, but to the very planet we live on, the Supreme Court just killed the best chance America had to combat climate change in the foreseeable future. And if you think this wasn t politically motivated   the five Justices responsible all come from the right side of the bench.In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled to stay the requirements that energy companies needed to rein in the ludicrous amount of carbon that they were pouring into the atmosphere. For decades, scientists have warned that this carbon is among the number one contributors to global warming. Obama had hoped to address this with a landmark move to curtail these emissions with an initiative he named the  Clean Power Plan. With strong but achievable standards for power plants, and customized goals for states to cut the carbon pollution that is driving climate change, the Clean Power Plan provides national consistency, accountability and a level playing field while reflecting each state s energy mix. It also shows the world that the United States is committed to leading global efforts to address climate change.Or not.Instead, America s right-wing showed the world once again that it is not remotely serious about trying to combat climate change. Naturally, this lack of initiative gives other major polluters like China a fantastic excuse to not curtail their own emissions. We will, when you do, they might say.For now, the oil and gas companies get to ignore the rule. This is a major victory for the corporations that are most responsible for polluting in the first place. The Koch brothers, of course, were vehemently opposed to the new plans. So too were the Republican politicians they sponsor. How desperate were Republicans to let their pollution-heavy friends off the hook? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell broke with all existing protocol to deliver a letter to all 50 United States governors telling them to simply ignore Obama s EPA requirements altogether.The four liberal justices   Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan   all wrote that they objected to the stay.But if all of this shady monkey wrench tossing is giving you a sense of hopeless, the silver lining is this: All that is standing in the way of bold new plans like this becoming law are five aging conservative members of the Supreme Court. It s expected that the next president will get to appoint at least two new Justices. The ability to change the course of not just America s, but the world s climate rests with who Americans chose as their next president this year. That s a lot of power. Let s use it to elect a person who has our interests in mind, not the Koch brothers.Feature image from YouTube ",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Nugent Attacks Jews Who Support Gun Control By Calling Them Nazis (IMAGES),"Professional douchebag Ted Nugent took his love of guns way too far on Monday, demonstrating how conservatives really feel about Jews.Much in the way Adolf Hitler scapegoated the Jews to justify World War II and the Holocaust, Nugent scapegoated Jews to justify an extreme pro-gun agenda.On his own Facebook page, Nugent plastered several photographs of Jewish activists and politicians, and warned his followers to memorize who they are and gave them marching orders to give them hell and shut them down. Know these punks,  Nugent wrote.  They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us the basic human right to self defense & to KEEP & BEAR ARMS while many of them have tax paid hired ARMED security! Know them well. Tell every1 you know how evil they are. Let us raise maximum hell to shut them down! Here s the post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Know these punks. They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us the basic human right to self defense  Posted by Ted Nugent on Monday, February 8, 2016In a comment below his own post, Nugent wrote,  NEVER AGAIN  in reference to the Holocaust.Conservatives often use the Holocaust as a prop in their argument to oppose gun control laws. The problem with that argument is that it assumes the minority Jewish population would have been able to stand up to the powerful German military, which included the brutal SS.When Ben Carson made the same claim last year, Politifact ripped him a new one by pointing out that the Nazis actually loosened gun laws significantly for the population, but restricted Jews from owning firearms.German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis. Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized. But for most German citizens, the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened, not tightened.Second, a lack of guns was not the issue. If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis, they could have. But they didn t.In other words, the only form of gun control the Nazis really liked was keeping Jews from owning them.But even if the Jews were well-armed and willing to fight back, the fact remains that the German population supported the Nazis and Hitler had powerful military forces under his command. It is highly unlikely that the Jews could have prevented the Holocaust by themselves.Despite the facts, Nugent wrote another rant aimed at those who criticized his first post, referring to Jews who don t agree with him as  Nazis in disguise. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Just when you hope that mankind couldnt possibly get any dumber or more dishonest, superFreaks rise to the occasion .Posted by Ted Nugent on Monday, February 8, 2016Offended by Nugent s nasty words, the Anti-Defamation League blasted him and demanded the removal of the post. This is nothing short of conspiratorial anti-Semitism. Regardless of one s views on gun control, this kind of scapegoating of an entire religious group is completely unacceptable and completely divorced from reality. It should go without saying that anti-Semitism has no place in the gun control debate. You should be ashamed for promoting anti-Semitic content, and we hope that good people on both sides of the gun control debate will reject his tactics and his message. We hope you will have the good sense to remove this share immediately so that it does not spread virally across the internet. Ted Nugent talks tough about his dad, but apparently the apple fell far from the tree. Let s not forget that Nugent dodged the Vietnam war by pooping in his pants.And this isn t the first time Nugent has attacked a people that suffered through genocide. Nugent once referred to Native Americans as  unclean vermin  who don t qualify as people. And let s not forget his anthem to child rape that must drive family values Republicans wild.Also, keep in mind that Ted Cruz is Nugent s favorite Republican presidential candidate in the 2016 race. Perhaps someone should ask Cruz how he feels about what Nugent thinks about Jews who support reasonable laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. Because that s what we re really talking about here  better background checks that most Americans, including NRA members, support. Nobody in our government has suggested seizing the guns of every American. And there have certainly been no suggestions of banning certain ethnic minorities from owning firearms. This is all in the imaginations of conservatives who have used such claims to push a guns everywhere agenda that has only opened our society up to more gun deaths and mass shootings than ever before.But if anyone should have their guns taken from them, it s Ted Nugent, considering the fact that he has openly called for the assassination of President Obama and other government officials on several occasions.

" Texas Man Shoots Puppy That Pooped In His Yard, Finds Himself On The Receiving End Of Gunfire (VIDEO)","The NRA tells us that guns make us safer, that a  responsible gun owner  or a  good guy with a gun  will leap into action at the first sign of danger to act as savior. Unfortunately, many gun-toting individuals completely fail to live up to the  gun rights  organization s lofty ideals. The problem is that a  good guy with a gun  is only a  good guy  until he pulls the trigger in a completely unwarranted situation   like in a  spat over dog poop.A Texas man found himself on the receiving end of gunfire after he Stood His Ground when a neighbor s puppy wandered into his yard and relieved itself. Frustrated that the young animal came into his yard, ate his cat s food, and relieved itself, Joe Ramirez grabbed his trusty shotgun and ended its life. In true  responsible gun owner  fashion, he told investigators that he thought the gun was loaded with blanks   but, of course, it contained live ammunition.The dog s owner heard the gunfire and the sound of her pet yelping, so she ran outside to investigate. Another person noticed, as well   her neighbor, who applied a Second Amendment Solution to the situation. When Angela Cruz saw Ramirez standing over the dog and shooting it at close range, she opened fire on him and his roommate, fortunately injuring neither of them.Cruz was arrested on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Ramirez was charged with cruelty to a non-livestock animal. The dog owner and Ramirez s roommate weere questioned, but were not charged with a crime.Unfortunately, as long as it is easy for quite literally anyone to buy a gun, we will continue to see incidents like this   where popping off shots becomes the first solution rather than an option employed only in self-defense. Ramirez should absolutely be charged   and punished   but think about how different the situation would have been if none of these people had guns.Watch a report on the shootings below:Featured image via screengrab ",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" White School Board Member ‘Honors’ Black History Month In The Most Racist, Appalling Way (IMAGE)","A school board member in Illinois is getting heat for expressing her own personal way of kicking off Black History Month: with blatant, inexcusable racism.Jeanette Ward, part of Elgin Area School District U-46, didn t waste a moment telling her peers how she really felt about African Americans during a month dedicated to the accomplishments and milestones of historical black figures. On February 1st, Ward created a post on the board s Facebook page that began with this: Blacks have become their own worst enemy, and liberal leaders do not help matters by blaming self-inflicted wounds on whites or  society. The notion that racism is holding back blacks as a group, or that better black outcomes cannot be expected until racism has been vanquished, is a dodge. And encouraging blacks to look to politicians to solve their problems does them a disservice. As the next chapter explains, one lesson maybe the most important one for blacks is that having a black man in the Oval Office is less important than having one in the home. Ward immediately received heat for this, and was torn apart at a Monday night board meeting for her  irresponsible  and  racist speech    which was so coincidentally timed on the very first day of Black History Month.One of the speakers, Myrna Becker, expressed that she was appalled by Ward s words. She said,  When we honor Black History Month, we ought to know what black history is all about. Danise Habun of the Elgin Human Relations Commission also agreed that Ward was out of line: There was nothing respectful toward or celebratory of Black History Month contained in the passage posted by Ms. Ward. If her words and the quoted passage from the book is indeed to offer a fresh perspective, it appears as if there has been a failure to communicate. It continues to blame the victim, and ignores institutionalized racism. As an official elected to represent all members of the U-46 school district, Ms. Ward is to be held to a high standard of behavior and conduct. Despite the widespread backlash she received, Ward didn t think there was anything wrong with her post, and said she was merely giving a different perspective to Black History Month. She also pointed out that the author she quoted, Jason Riley, was African American  so her post couldn t possibly be racist or disrespectful.Ward has continued to stand behind her remarks and refuses to back down. Which isn t surprising, considering that Ward has a history of being offensive and socially ignorant. Last year, Ward objected to an anti-bullying program that would address homophobic slurs in schools. According to Ward, using  gay  as an insult wasn t as bad as calling someone  retarded  or  girly  because homosexuality is a choice, while being mentally retarded or a female is not. Ward just doesn t have a clue, and has no interest in getting one.

 Fox News Just Declared Trump The Winner In New Hampshire — Before Votes Were Even Counted (IMAGES),"Fox News had a bit of an embarrassing moment Tuesday when the network accidentally declared Megyn Kelly s arch-nemesis, Donald Trump, the winner of the New Hampshire primary. It s no secret that Fox doesn t much like Trump   which is why it must have been embarrassing when a graphic declaring that 100% of the results were in   and that the billionaire 2016 hopeful had won   went live on the network s website.Taking the lead in New Hampshire, according to Fox s  data  puts Donald Trump in the front with 83,000 votes   28 percent. Coming in second is human-robot hybrid Marco Rubio at 15%. Taking third place is creepy Evangelical Ted Cruz at 15%. According to the fictional results, Ben Carson brought up the rear  with 2% of the vote   well behind Jeb Bush and even Carly Fiorina.Fox very quickly removed the  results  from the website with Jeff Misenti, chief digital officer for the network, explaining that the  results  appeared as part of a test for its coverage of the state s primary: During routine testing in preparation for the New Hampshire primary a malfunction occurred which briefly showed errant data on our website. This error has been rectified. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused. While Trump is almost a sure winner in any GOP matchup, it s hilarious that Fox would, however accidentally, preemptively declare the man who has been trading barbs with the network and who skipped the last debate hosted by a Fox station after they refused to pay him $5 million to appear.In the showdown between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, Fox declared Sanders the winner with 53% of the vote to Hillary s 43 percent.Sure, Fox has a history of getting nearly anything wrong, but it s impressive that they have managed to open a portal to the future in their efforts to be first with the news.Featured image via screengrab ",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch The Moment A White Teacher Gets SCHOOLED By His Student On Racism’s True Meaning (VIDEO),"A brilliant moment where a high school student turned the tables and gave her white male teacher a much-needed lesson on racism has been caught on camera and is currently going viral.The video, which surfaced on the But That s None of My Business Facebook page, shows a young woman of color confronting her teacher during a presentation, for what appears to be his assertion that white people can also become victims of racism.The female student calls him out on his misinformed position and explains to him that it is impossible for white people to experience racism, because white people have never once faced systemic oppression or been discriminated against or disenfranchised by institutions. She offered a heated explanation: Racism is based on the systematic oppression of people. White people have never suffered that. Yeah, you ve tried to say it s possible. Yeah, in the future it s possible to like have some sort of systematic oppression of white people. But it s never happened. So you saying it s not going to be up for argument, it s kind of like you, as a white man, saying what is and what is not racist. And that s what s been happening throughout this century. Many of her fellow students, most of which also appear to be people of color, begin applauding right before she adds, So for you to tell me that, it doesn t make me believe you, because that s what s been said to us for so long. You can watch her powerful lesson below:Without a doubt, the parents of this young girl deserve a hand for raising such a socially aware teenager who not only understands white privilege and systemic racism, but possesses enough courage to dispute and educate an adult in power when they are painfully wrong and ignorant.It would have been amazing if the entire discussion had been caught on camera, but it s safe to say that this student is probably more capable of teaching a class on racism than her teacher.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Marco ‘Roboto’ Rubio Short-Circuits Again, Repeats Same Line Twice In 30 Seconds (VIDEO)","Once a broken record, always a broken record. At least that s what Marco Rubio has been demonstrating since his disastrous debate performance on Saturday.As you ll recall, Chris Christie absolutely hammered Rubio for using a canned line about President Obama over and over again. Let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing,  Rubio said during his exchange with the New Jersey governor.  He knows exactly what he s doing. He went on to repeat the line several more times, leading to Christie nailing Rubio for being scripted.Rubio s robotic performance has inspired people to troll him by dressing up and appearing at Rubio rallies as robots.One would think that Rubio would more carefully monitor his speeches to make sure that he doesn t come off as a broken record, but he either doesn t give a damn or he thinks voters are stupid and won t notice.On Tuesday, Rubio repeated himself once again during a rally in New Hampshire as he talked about raising his children in the 21st Century, and he actually repeated the same line twice back-to-back. Because as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century and we know how hard it s become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats. In the 21st century it s become harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture. Here s the video via YouTube:Clearly, Marco Rubio is having a hard time shaking the appearance of being a scripted robot who glitches out, which certainly does not help him look like a viable candidate for president. Not only do we not need a president who will repeat the disastrous policies of past Republican presidents, we do not need a president who relies on canned lines to communicate with the American people.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Seth Meyers Takes No Prisoners In GLORIOUS Smackdown Of The Entire GOP Clown Car (VIDEO),"It s clear most of America has had just about enough of the GOP clown car and this primary season. Recognizing this, Seth Meyers absolutely tore apart the most recent Republican debate in a segment called  GOP Debate Antics: A Closer Look. The Late Night host took no prisoners and one by one just completely pummeled them, and righteously so. From the botched intro to the very end.In pointing out Rubio s robotics he even suggested that he might as well go with a GIF of Donald Trump s facial expressions as a running-mate if he were to get the nomination, because it would work every time.Meyers mercilessly mocked Bush and Trump s back and forth, as well as how Trump went after the New Hampshire debate audience, arguing that the real estate mogul seems to hate them, but loves waterboarding. Which is true.Ben Carson, of course, didn t escape being lampooned, Meyers roasted him by pointing out the ridiculous introduction portion of the debate, asking: Is Ben Carson really a brain surgeon, or did people just start calling him that sarcastically and it just stuck?   Oh yeah, that guy s a real  brain surgeon.  Your surgery will start any moment, we just need to get Doctor Carson in here. Meyers then pretends to wave him in, just like with what happened at the debate when he didn t seem to realize he needed to walk out on stage.All in all, if these Republicans want to say and do the things that they say and do, they need to realize that it s all being recorded and will be played back and mocked for all eternity.Well done, Meyers.Here s the whole clip: Video/Featured image: YouTube",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Stephen Colbert And His Audience Absolutely Pummeled Bill O’Reilly, And It Was Spectacular (VIDEO)","When appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert it s probably best to expect the unexpected. And in the case for Fox News host Bill O Reilly, it was probably best to expect his far right-wing humor to not be appreciated whatsoever by either Colbert or his audience.Within the first few moments of his appearance, he alienated pretty much everyone by saying those over on CNN and MSNBC are  on crack.  He was trying to convince people that Fox News is #1 in the ratings for a reason. Little does he realize that if people want their right-wing hate TV, they only have one place to go, whereas facts are dispersed everywhere else. So when O Reilly made his remark about the other networks, the crowd audibly booed him and was not impressed whatsoever.Then, just moments later, O Reilly thought it wise to do a Bernie Sanders impersonation while also saying that Sanders and Trump are the same person. Here s the thing: Colbert and his audience, are likely going to have a liberal response, so you can only guess how this Sanders bashing was received   not well. Colbert even asking the Fox News host after his Sanders impression,  are you having a stroke? After a huge back and forth about what O Reilly deems best for the nation, and when Colbert explains what actually is best for the nation, they end their debate cordially, but it was obvious the Late Show host was visibly annoyed with the Fox News toady.Colbert ended the interview with this amazing statement: You re a great model to do an impression of for ten years. Which is a complete slam at O Reilly s ridiculously conservative viewpoints and show.All in all, this was one of the best smackdowns of O Reilly ever.Here s the full appearance: Part 1:Part 2:Video/Featured image: YouTube",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 A**hole Of The Day – Michele Bachmann: Muslim ‘Rape Jihad’ Is Destroying ‘Western Christiandom’,"Michele Bachmann has been pretty quiet since leaving office under a cloud of scandal and that was a damn shame. She was one of the most perfect examples of how utterly hate-filled and detached from reality the right-wing has become. But apparently Bachmann has remembered that it was her GAWD!-given mission to warn America about all the threats the voices in her head have been making up for years.Last week, Michele warned us about Obama s status as the Anti-Christ and his plan to cancel the elections and crown himself King. This week, GAWD! has told her that the evil Muslims. I kid you not, made up the entire Syrian civil war: This clearly is an invasion,  Bachmann said.  This is a planned invasion, not only in Europe but also in the United States, I believe for the specific purpose of destroying Western Christendom. The solution, of course, is to close all the borders to people with brown skin immigrants just to be safe. And for those of you who are about to say I m race-baiting, during her rant, Bachmann insisted that we needed to  pause  immigration just like Calvin Coolidge did in 1924. That  pause , incidentally, was targeted specifically  to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity  (AKA  White Supremacy ) by allowing in  good  immigrants from Western Europe but keeping out the  bad  ones from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. That s what Michele Bachmann thinks is a solution. Why? Because she s a fucking racist like a great deal of the American right-wing.If this fact upsets you, too bad.But Bachmann wasn t done being a total asshole:Bachmann said that countries with large Muslim minorities like France now experience  Islamic jihad 24/7, terrorist bloodbath attacks 24/7,  warning that the same thing is coming to the U.S. unless we decide to have  no more immigration into the United States. I m sure this will come as a surprise to France. They ll be wondering why they haven t heard about these 24/7 bloodbaths. Maybe they re only happening in the mythical  no go zones? Bachmann continues: The more that come in, the more they act upon their religious convictions and their stated religious convictions,  she said.  The imams from the original countries that they come from, they recruit and send these guys to come in and to bring about this destruction. Right now in Europe it s called a  rape culture  that s coming into Sweden and Germany and all across Europe for the specific purpose of Islamizing these countries, and they are falling. I wish I could be surprised that a conservative like Bachmann will only acknowledge the existence of rape culture as long as she can blame it on Muslims. Islamists have a plan,  Bachmann later added.  They have a plan to destroy Western Christendom. It s called civilization jihad. By bringing Islamists into our country and destroying us from in, they don t need to just have a nuclear bomb. If they send their invading army into our countries and if young men are doing what they did on New Year s Eve in Cologne, Germany, and other places where they are literally sexually attacking and raping and groping women and causing them to fear, we are looking at a completely ramped-up level of invasion one like we have never seen before. There are days that I truly and profoundly wish I wasn t an atheist. Why? Because it would give me great comfort to believe that after she dies, Jesus Christ will personally walk up to Bachmann in the afterlife and, after explaining to her exactly how horrible of a human being she was in life, send her to Hell along with most of the Republican Party.Hey, a man can dream, right?Featured image courtesy of Newsweek ",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Frustrated Rubio Staffers Attack Robot Protester (PHOTOS/VIDEO),"Frustrated staffers for Marco Rubio s beleaguered presidential campaign lashed out on Tuesday morning at protesters making fun of the junior senator s  habit of repeating himself in a robotic fashion.Protestors from the Democratic group American Bridge came to a Manchester, New Hampshire event for the Rubio campaign dressed in cardboard boxes designed to look like robots.

After their staff pushed and shoved us he retreated to bus after like 2 mins. Rubio s campaign has been under fire since the Republican debate on Saturday night, where Gov. Chris Christie pointed out that in order to substitute for his lack of experience, Rubio had memorized mini-speeches that he leaned on as a crutch.Since then, the candidate has had to defend this habit, which has even been criticized by some figures on Fox News.Suddenly the candidate that has been promoted by some as the Republican establishment s answer to Donald Trump s insurgent campaign has been exposed with a flaw that is relatively easy for political opponents to exploit.The  Marcobot  idea is beginning to spread, and it is eroding Rubio s campaign that so far has been so heavily focused on his confidence and polish, allowing him to quickly play in the big leagues of American politics.Obviously his backers are feeling the heat as well, spilling over into a thuggish display at this campaign event. What once appeared to be a strong path to the nomination now appears to have some robot-sized obstacles in the way.Much like Dukakis in the tank, or the Dean Scream, Marcbot is on the loose   can the young senator contain it, or will he be destroyed by it?Featured image via Twitter",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Marco Rubio’s Attempt To Sweet Talk A Gay Voter In A New Hampshire Bar Ends In Tears (IMAGE),"Florida Republican senator and presidential hopeful Marco Rubio has spent much of his political life and campaign making life harder for LGBT people. So what happened when he was confronted by a real life gay man in new Hampshire on Monday? Nothing good.On Monday February 8th, openly gay 50-year-old Timothy Kierstead was enjoying a drink with his mother and his husband in the wonderfully appropriately named Puritan Backroom diner, when he was approached by Marco Rubio during a campaign event. He asked the candidate a very simple question: Why do you want to put me back in the closet? The color leeched from Rubio s face as he realized he d definitely come to the wrong table.The New York Times reports that the candidate, when face-to-face with Kierstead, responded: I don t You can live any way you want. But it did not end there. As The Times continues: Mr. Rubio, who is seeking to win over conservatives, is seldom asked about gay rights at his campaign stops.During a brief conversation, Mr. Kierstead, 50, told Mr. Rubio that he was married but complained that the senator s position amounted to him declaring that  we don t matter. Mr. Rubio, who was standing with his youngest son, Dominick, 8, by his side, gently disagreed.  No, I just believe marriage is between one man and one woman. Well,  replied Mr. Kierstead,  that s your belief. Mr. Rubio continued:  I think that s what the law should be. And if you don t agree you should have the law changed by a legislature. Rubio was reminded by Mr. Keirstad that this is exactly what the LGBT community had done, and that the Senator and his party were seeking to have their religious prejudices supersede the law of the land. In fact, just last December, Rubio told Chuck Todd: It is the current law. I don t believe any case law is settled law. Any future Supreme Court can change it. I don t think the current Constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate marriage, What is wrong is that the Supreme Court has found this hidden constitutional right that 200 years of jurisprudence had not discovered and basically overturned the will of the voters in Florida, where over 60 percent passed a constitutional amendment that defined marriage in the state constitution as the union of one man and one woman. In short, Rubio doesn t believe that the Constitution gives federal government the right to regulate marriage, unless it is regulating against the rights of same-sex couples. Rubio doesn t want the government regulating his access to guns, yet he is totally in favor of the government regulating the access of same-sex couples to marriage. This hypocrisy reveals that for Rubio and his fellow Republicans, the government can never be too big, so long it is enforcing their prejudices.Rubio, suddenly lost the courage of his convictions, tried to remove himself from the situation at the soonest opportunity. The campaign also did it s best to pretend the incident never even happened.Enjoyed meeting voters at the Puritan Backroom in Manchester, NH today. #fitn pic.twitter.com/S7VVTtnY40  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 8, 2016With his campaign polls going into free fall, his robotic performances being heavily criticized, and his failure to win round the Puritan Backroom   isn t it time Rubio slipped quietly into the night and declared what we all know to be true?

" Religious Bigots Angry At Beyonce, Coldplay For ‘Promoting Homosexuality’ At Superbowl 50 (TWEETS)","As per usual, the halftime show at the Superbowl was the main attraction. This year, it featured superstar singer Beyonce, along with the wildly popular band, Coldplay. It also featured lots of .rainbows. Of course, this particular detail upset the perpetually gay sex-obsessed religious bigots. They took to twitter to decry the fact that one of the manliest sports ever would dare to include anything rainbow themed in its entertainment for any reason whatsoever.

Nobody is going to force churches to perform gay weddings, or make them attend one. Nothing about their lives has changed with legalized marriage equality. The sky has not fallen. Perhaps the most accurate and ironic assessment of this whole ridiculous situation comes from Hemant Mehta, the Friendly Atheist, who reminded everyone that these complaints come from the same people who are watching a game in which dozens of men jump on top of each other for hours before dancing and patting each other on the butt.

 ‘The Most Deranged Electoral Sh*t Show In A Generation’: Samantha Bee DESTROYS The GOP Race (VIDEO),"Comedian and former Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee launched her first show at the helm of Full Frontal this week with an all-out skewering of the 2016 Presidential election race, focusing her best lines as the GOP clown car.Introducing the race as  the most deranged electoral sh*t show in a generation , Bee quickly moved onto to hilarious vocal assaults on individual candidates.After taking a moment to lampoon the outfit of Bernie Sanders, who she said appears to have shown up at the debate wearing the party s  big tent,  she told Hillary Clinton to  f*ck off  after a clip of the former Secretary of State making a transparently inauthentic attempt at being  folksy. But Bee was really just warming up, because then she turned to the GOP. Or, as Bee put it: We ll be honest with you people. We wont like two hours of jokes about the Democrats. But we had to throw them all away because then the Republicans laid out a banquet of all-you-can-eat crazy. She began with an attack on Iowa winner and  fist-faced horsesh*t salesman  Senator Ted Cruz. Then, the scene cuts to an interview with CNN s Dana Ford, and Heidi Cruz (the Senator s wife). Ford asks Heidi to explain why her husband is so thoroughly disliked by his fellow Republican Senators, candidates and well everyone in the country. As the scene pauses on the screen behind her, Bee gives a response on Heidi s behalf: It s not his fault, Dana, My husband has stage four cancer of the personality. Bee also skewers the candidate for this warped effort to utilize his own daughter to political advantage, by attempting to kiss her on camera. It all goes horribly wrong when she reels back from her dad s creepy advances. Let s just look at that again.  Bee takes apart Marco Rubio for exploiting his own children at a political rally, wing a clip of Rubio prompting his son to a truly abysmal gag. For what benefit? Oh look at that! Marco Rubio finally found a way to look like the big boy in the room!  she says.No candidate is left untouched in Bee s brilliant rant, which might just be the finest assault on the GOP clown car yet in the 2016 race.You can watch the piece in full in the video below:  SamBeeseg1 by lookatmyshirt Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Son Tries His Hand At Politics: Waterboarding ‘No Different’ Than Being A Frat Boy (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s son, Eric Trump, wants to be just like daddy. And, truth be told, normally there would be nothing wrong with that, except for the fact that his dad is none other than Donald Trump. So   maybe it s not his fault per say for this latest slip up of his (it is, after all, engrained into him) but little Trump ended up making quite the statement Monday night when he appeared on Fox s On the Record. It s so ridiculous even that maybe he does have a political future ahead of him, just like daddy.Here was what little Trump said when asked to explain what his dad meant by his  we ll do something worse than waterboarding  comments yesterday: You see these terrorists that are flying planes into buildings, right? You see our cities getting shot up in California. You see Paris getting shot up. And then somebody complains when a terrorist gets waterboarded, which quite frankly is no different than what happens on college campuses and frat houses every day. And, you know, the man would keep this country safe. There is no question about it. As he says, he  just wants to protect his father.  But, that s quite a statement he made. We re still trying to process it. We might even let such a ridiculous statement slide if it wasn t such a serious issue. Waterboarding is torture, end of discussion. We ve already dealt with George W. Bush s presidency; we don t need another. But, this is the main difference between Republicans and Democrats it seems; Trump isn t the only one who thinks waterboarding is okay. Ted Cruz has also come out on the record of saying it doesn t even fit the definition of torture, contrary to not only common sense but even the United Nation s definition. Here it is: Torture  means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession  when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public office or other person acting in an official capacity.Time and time again, highly credible experts and well-respected people have come forward on this issue, and all have said waterboarding is torture. This is a political issue of trying to look tough on terrorism, and it s also an election year. Deep down these guys don t care if it s torture or not; they think they re making the country safe. And, they re wrong.Featured image from screen capture.",News,"February 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CA School Resource Officer Arrested For Having Sex With A Minor (VIDEO),"It is extremely important to vet the people we put in charge of our children    especially in positions of power. Apparently, a Chowchilla, California school, along with the local police department, failed to do so when it came to school resource officer Timothy Hormel.Hormel is currently on administrative leave because of allegations that he had sex with a minor. The 35-year-old cop was arrested by the Mandera County Sheriff s office after the accusations surfaced. As per usual, the police department is conducting an internal investigations in the Hormel s allegedly criminal actions. According the Sheriff s department, the minor was not a student at any school Hormel was assigned to.What makes this all so frustrating is that a predator like that never should have been anywhere around school children, especially not in a position of power. There s a reason there are age of consent laws: children do not have the mental and psychological capacity to consent to sex with adults. Further, Hormel could have used his power as an officer of the law to coerce the sex, if it did indeed happen.Either way, this guy needs to go to jail if he did this, and that Sheriff s department and local school system need to be investigated.Watch a video news report below, via ABC 30:Featured image from video screen capture",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Encourages Audience To Call Ted Cruz A ‘P***y’ – Admits Protests Are Staged (VIDEO),"Just when you think Donald Trump can t get any more grotesque he proves us all wrong. It s as though he s trying to see how awful he can get and still get away with it.The real estate mogul has been racist, misogynistic, homophobic, dropped the f-bomb, amongst other several other things. Now, hearing an audience member from his latest rally in Manchester, NH, yell out  Ted Cruz is a pu y!  he encouraged them to say it again. He jokingly said,  I never expect to hear that from you again,  then he said it himself while laughing and barely containing his glee from the moment. He even had to turn away.Watch the moment here:Trump, of course, is trying to belittle his competition, and seeing that Cruz is the guy who beat in him in Iowa, he ll encourage any and all insults thrown at the Texas senator. Is this juvenile? Sure. Is it outrageous that a candidate for President of the United States will use the word  pu y  on a national stage? Of course. Would you expect anything less from Trump? Of course not.Let it be known, that the audience member who shouted this could have been a plant, so it would make it more acceptable for Trump to say this remark. As was pointed out by, well, himself shortly before the outburst, when he said: They re getting rid of some protesters, look. Are the police the greatest? I like protesters, because that s the only way the camera shows how big the crowd is. Sometimes we even stage protesters! And if they re openly admitting to staging protesters, they re probably also planting outbursts from supporters   probably:Note: Shortly before that audience member's Cruz outburst, Trump said this  https://t.co/MKFDoOfNf1  Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) February 9, 2016At least now we know why some protesters aren t beaten while others are.Let s be real, Trump is a walking and talking joke of a candidate. He has no political experience, no policy experience, no diplomatic experience, and as a businessman had to file for bankruptcy multiple times. What is he good at? Bullshitting. Which is how he s gotten as far as he has not only in this election, but also in life. And people, really imbecilic people, are falling for it.Now, if people insist on having a president who will openly use the word  pu y  on a national stage, well, then  Trump is your guy. However, let s hope he s not.Video/Featured image: YouTube",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Someone Just Tried To Perform An Exorcism On Ted Cruz; Unfortunately, It Failed (VIDEO)","While Ted Cruz would say that he is possessed by the spirit of his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, some would argue that he is instead possessed by a more insidious force. According to two men who attended one of the Texas Senator s rallies, he s plagued by demons  likely the sort that cause a person to say and do things so stupid that they have a chance of becoming the GOP nominee for President.The Dallas Morning News reports that Cruz had just begun a speech when two men wielding mirrors and crosses appeared, one of the men shouting: Ted Cruz look in the mirror and let the evil spirit depart! He s possessed by a demon! Cruz s supporters began to boo as their allegedly demon-possessed leader joked that the men were sent by the Bernie Sanders campaign. As police forced the men to exit for simply expressing a religious opinion   something conservatives would normally oppose, even if it was crazy or in jest   the men managed to stay in character. He s possessed by a demon!  the man yelled.  The demon has to leave. That s why the body is so disgusting to look at! This, of course, is something with which Cruz s daughter seems to agree, as she was unwilling to accept her father s forced affection at another recent campaign event in which he tried to use her as a political prop. Further evidence that Cruz is possessed can, of course, be found in the words of the Senator s former college roommate, who has stated that Ted leaves behind a disgusting greasy film on anything he touches. Even science struggles to explain what, exactly, is so unsettling about Cruz but one neurologist explained that he is  at a loss  to explain why Cruz s face leaves him  cold. While it s unlikely Cruz is actually possessed by a demon, it is easy to see why one might assume this is the case. Yhe other man urged the Senator to look at himself in the mirror so  the evil can confront itself. Evil body! Evil spirit. Look yourself in the mirror!  the man said.As they exited the building, one of the unnamed men explained   still impressively in character   that: We just had to get rid of the evil spirit. I hope it works,  one man remarked, motioning that he was sick to his stomach.  He s very hard to be in the same room with. We had to exorcise some sort of disgusting evil spirit. There s a reason that the body is so haggard and disgusting, and the face, and it s all so weathered and gross and hard to look at.And it s because he s possessed by a demon. Being in the room with evil so close, it s just hard to even comprehend. The evil is so deep rooted and maybe if it had to confront itself. Watch the  exorcism  below: ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosThe men explain their actions here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9sbySqe1Tw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab/Dallas Morning News",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Couple Gives Up Buying $1 Million Boat To Send 26 Kindergarteners To College (VIDEO),"The parents at a Southern California elementary school just got their minds blown when they heard that a complete stranger had decided to pay for their kindergarten-age children to go to college.Navy vet and Fullerton lawyer Marty Burbank and his wife were the people who selflessly decided to abandon their dreams of buying the $1 million boat they met and got married on to put 26 kindergarteners at the Rio Vista Elementary School through college.When 51-year-old Burbank told kindergarten teacher Tessa Ashton his plan to ensure that each one of her kindergarteners would receive a college education, she could hardly believe it. Ashton said that the news forced her to give her young students a lesson about  happy tears  because they couldn t understand her powerful reaction to the news. She said: He cried and I cried. And the kids got really concerned because they ve never seen me cry! You don t walk into moments like that very often so it was kind of a magical thing. Burbank had met Ashton several years ago when they were both attending a service day at the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District campus. Since then, he d donated tons of supplies to the elementary school such as a thousand notebooks and snacks for the children. Burbank noticed that one of the rooms had a display of college flags, and the image stuck with him. Burbank knew he could change these children s lives in a bigger way than simply donating supplies. He said: They don t come from families where anybody has had an opportunity to go to college. And college is not something that the parents talk to the kids about. Burbank was inspired to forgo his plan to buy the sentimental boat after he heard a sermon about giving. Burbank, who d been sailing since he was a toddler, said: Sailing has been a big part of my life. (But) the boat seemed like a real selfish thing to me at that point. This is something significant that I think is going to impact a lot more people than just me. Burbank s wife, Seon Chun-Burbank, was more than on board with the idea. She had come from a family who could never afford a college education, and said it was only because of her aunt s financial support that she became a first-generation college graduate. She explained: I like the movie  Pay It Forward. I got a lot of help and now I m helping others. And I hope they can do that too. You can listen to Burbank talk about his amazing act of kindness below:The kids are more than enthusiastic about their new future. Six-year-old Jessyca Resendiz said, College is a big place and there is a fountain. It has a big cafeteria that has coffee and bread.  Resendiz has plans to be a doctor, and because of Burbank and his wife, she ll get to fulfill that dream.One of the kindergartener s parents, Silvia Escobar, revealed that she had only completed second grade and didn t have the opportunity that her son would have thanks to Burbank s kindness. She said, May God bless him always for helping people who truly need his help. There are no words. Burbank s gift is for each child to receive two years of community college, and two years at a university in California. Burbank will also cover the cost of the children s books. With inflation taken into account, the lawyer estimates that it will take approximately $1 million to cover the kindergarteners  tuition and expenses, beginning in 2032.On Monday, the Burbanks received thank-you cards from the students, but the knowledge that there will be education in each child s future is enough for the couple. There s just one catch   the parents are to keep the Burbanks up to date on their children s academics and the students must submit a picture or essay about what they would like to be when they grow up every year. Burbanks, who has now decided to postpone his retirement, said: I d rather not have a boat and get these kids through school. Maybe one day they ll buy me a boat.

 This State Is About To Let Guns Have More Rights Than Most People,"Just when you think things can t get any more absurd than they already are, Republicans go and prove you wrong. Now, in the state of Michigan, Republicans are pushing for a law that would allow law-abiding  citizens to carry concealed pistols without a government-issued permit.  Who are these legislators that are introducing such absurd legislation? Michigan Reps. Tom Barrett, R-Potterville; Lee Chatfield, R-Levering; Triston Cole, R-Mancelona; and Jim Runestad, R-White Lake.In HB 5301, it states: A person shall not carry a dagger, dirk, stiletto, a double-edged nonfolding stabbing instrument of any length, or any other dangerous weapon OTHER THAN A PISTOL, except a hunting knife adapted and carried as such, concealed on or about his or her person, or whether concealed or otherwise in any vehicle operated or occupied by the person, except in his or her dwelling house, IN HIS OR HER place of business, or on other land possessed by the person. To summarize, knives bad, guns good. Makes sense, right?According to MLive: Cole, author of House Bill 5304, said the current Concealed Pistol License permit requirement in Michigan is a  government over-reach  that places an undue burden on residents who want to defend themselves against criminals.  Criminals don t have to go through a training class and wait for government permission to have a handgun before they commit armed robbery, yet a law-abiding citizen who simply wants the option of self-defense has to jump through all the hoops and pay a price to carry a concealed weapon,  he said in a prepared statement. People who want to ensure the safety of their families against the criminal element should not have to beg for that right,  Cole said. Here s a reminder for Triston Cole: guns safety laws are not  government overreach.  In fact, the Second Amendment calls for a well regulated (ie. well-trained and maintained) militia. The founders didn t write  well regulated  for no reason. They knew an armed populace also needs to be held under certain laws, restrictions and training. If getting a gun permit and/or training is too hard for some folks, maybe they shouldn t have guns, because they apparently don t have the mental capacity to seek a proper permit. This sort of vigilante justice is exactly what s wrong with parts of America. We need more laws, not fewer, and we definitely don t need a bunch of people just going out, buying guns, and carrying them wherever they like.It s amazing, really. Guns and gun owners in Michigan are about to have more rights than women, and the LGBT community. Apparently,  sodomy  is to be labeled a felony in the state and punishable by up to 15 years in prison. And as far as abortion rights for women, here are the restrictions in Michigan:Keep in mind, abortion is legal nationwide, and has been since 1973.It is absolutely outrageous how these Republicans will say that going to get a gun permit is  government overreach,  yet in the same breath go in to people s bedrooms and call them a felon, or into a woman s uterus and call her a murderer.They definitely have their priorities backwards, and should be condemned for this outrageous way of thinking.Featured image: Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Ridiculously Creepy Vine May Prove Ted Cruz Is Steve King’s Ventriloquist Dummy (VIDEO),"There have been a lot of strange this that have happened this presidential election season, but some things are definitely stranger than others. One of those things being the fact that Rep. Steve King (R-IA) seems to know Sen. Ted Cruz s speeches by heart.Now, one could assume that it s because he s heard them so many times and Cruz doesn t change things up, so like a fan of a band he s mouthing the words. Another assumption could be made that perhaps he helped write the speech, so he s proudly mouthing the words along side his partner in conservative crime. However, probably the most accurate assumption would be that Ted Cruz is actually King s ventriloquist dummy and he s not doing a good job of hiding the movements of his mouth.Need proof? Watch this Vine: Now, this is still just a working theory, but it s one that makes the most sense, really. How else can one explain that they seem to be the same person in two different bodies. Albeit, one is Canadian and the other from Iowa.Need further proof?flickr/amazonI can t be the only one who sees this? How uncanny is that? I mean, c mon.However, I digress, maybe, just maybe, King should either practice his ventriloquism better, or learn to keep his mouth just so he doesn t appear to be a creeper in the background. Either choice would work.Video/Featured image from  Vine",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News And Rudy Giuliani Fully Brought Out Their White Hoods To Attack Beyoncé (VIDEO),"How does the saying go? Fox News: Not racist, but number one with racists. Actually, no, they are pretty damn racist. And proof of this can be seen on Fox & Friends, when they decided to talk about the Super Bowl halftime show and Beyonc s performance.According to Fox News and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Beyonc  wasn t  wholesome  enough for them, and she bashed police officers. You know, because god forbid as an African-American artist Beyonc  speak of the ever-present reality of police brutality that has become an epidemic in the nation for people of color. And instead of seeing her performance as something that can bring people together to tackle hate, Giuliani saw it as a tribute to the Black Panthers.Brian Kilmeade said: I couldn t really make out what Beyonc  was saying. But at the end, we find out Beyonc  dressed up in a tribute to the Black Panthers, went to a Malcolm X formation. And the song, the lyrics, which I couldn t make out a syllable, were basically telling cops to stop shooting blacks! Okay, first of all, here s who Beyonc  seemed to be paying tribute to, after all the entire halftime show was paying tribute to past performers:Michael Jackson. Beyonce. #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/VAraK3dppE  zellie (@zellieimani) February 8, 2016Fox News, though, knowing they have to cater to their racist fan base, insists it s a tribute to the Black Panthers.Secondly, if she is speaking of police brutality, what better stage than one that is being watched by over 100 million viewers worldwide. It is a national epidemic that is obvious to anyone who isn t a raging racist.Giuliani chimed in with: I think it was outrageous. The halftime show I thought was ridiculous anyway, I don t know what the heck it was. A bunch of people like bouncing around and doing strange things. I actually don t even know why we have this. I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers, who are the people who protect her. What we should be doing in the African-American community and all communities is build up respect for police officers. He apparently doesn t see that, while yes, police officers should be respected, many of these officers need to also respect the citizens they are paid to serve and protect.The former mayor continued: This is a political position and she s probably going to take advantage of it. You re talking to middle America when you have the Super Bowl. So if you re going to have entertainment, let s have decent, wholesome entertainment. And not use it as a platform to attack the people who put their lives at risk just to save us. Yes, let s not ever make people think about things. Let s keep things clean and under cover, like apparently this entire couch when they are wearing their white sheets at the local Klan meeting. What the actual fuck? They are being racist, at this point, to just be racist. Beyonc s performance was flawless and entertaining, see it for what it is, and not for what your racist brain twists it to be.Watch the whole exchange here: Video/Featured image fromRaw Story YouTube",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 West Virginia GOP Push Bill To Literally Give Conservative Christians Ability To Break The Law At Will,"If West Virginia Republicans have their way, conservative Christians will be able to break any law they don t like and use  religious freedom  as a defense.Outrageous legislation known as Senate Bill 11 would create anarchy across the state by giving conservative Christians the ability to ignore any law they think doesn t have a  governmental interest of the highest magnitude that cannot otherwise be achieved without burdening the exercise of religion. For instance, bigoted Christians could argue that they can ignore anti-discrimination laws that protect racial and religious minorities as well as gay people. They could also argue that they can ignore sexual harassment laws, traffic laws, gun control laws, environmental laws, or any other law they don t like and all they have to do is claim that such laws impede their  sincerely held  religious beliefs.SB 11 states: Exercise of religion  means the sincere practice or observance of religion or religious conscience. It includes, but is not limited to, the ability to act or refuse to act in a manner substantially motivated by one s sincerely held religious beliefs or religious conscience, whether or not the exercise is compulsory or central to a larger system of religious belief.This is perhaps the most dangerous piece of legislation Republicans have ever dreamed up.It s basically a get out of jail free card for Christians who think they should be able to hide behind their Bibles to get away with disobeying the law.According to civil rights advocate Tim Peacock,SB 11 would literally create a new class of rights superior to all other protections afforded at the local, state or federal level. It would create a special class of rights wherein one civil right comes into conflict with another, religious belief would always prevail.As Peacock further explains, it would fall to government to  offer a compelling state interest in violating the person s beliefs. In short, West Virginia would be turned into an anarchy as conservatives use their  Christian  beliefs as an excuse to violate the laws while everyone else has to follow the law to the letter since they wouldn t have these new special rights.And you can bet that conservative lawmakers across the country are looking at passing the same legislation in their own states as they continue to desperately try anything to replace civil law with biblical law. This is what religious tyranny looks like.

" Asked Why He’s Defending Abortion Group Pro-Bono, Lawyer Drops Truthbomb Pro-Lifers Will HATE","After the release of a series of fraudulent  hidden camera  videos purporting to show Planned Parenthood engaged in illegal body part trafficking, Republican lawmakers pounced. In red state after red state, Republican governors demanded investigations into the allegations. (In fact, they had been waiting for this moment for some time. The pro-life activist group responsible for the videos had been coordinating with conservative politicians for months and the bedfellows   Republicans and activists   worked together to create anti-Planned Parenthood legislation timed with the release of the tapes.)Ultimately, not a single investigation found evidence of wrongdoing. Planned Parenthood clinics around the country were exonerated one by one. In a twist, the anti-abortion group that made the tapes, Center for Medical Progress, did get indicted for criminal charges stemming from using fake identification.But while it s certainly a victory for justice that Planned Parenthood came out squeaky clean and the anti-abortion group s leaders are facing prison time, it wasn t a total victory. Planned Parenthood devotes almost all of its budget to helping men and women have affordable access to healthcare. They don t have the money to waste on endless witch hunts. Given the lack of evidence of wrongdoing, it s pretty clear that Republicans were hoping to bankrupt them on trumped up charges, rather than actually catch them in a criminal act.Thankfully, the unsung heroes in this story are the lawyers who agreed to represent Planned Parenthood and other abortion groups. They didn t do it because they were going to get rich, in fact, they ll get nothing; they did it because it was the right thing to do.Highlighting that point is Derek Foran, a partner at a corporate law firm named Morrison & Foerster. In an interview with the New York Times, Foran walks us through his thought process when he was asked to represent the National Abortion Federation pro-bono.The organization, the National Abortion Federation, had trouble finding a law firm to represent it pro bono. Morrison & Foerster, which previously handled abortion-rights cases, received the request and emailed lawyers at the firm about the inquiry. Mr. Foran raised his hand and, soon after, secured a court order stopping the group from releasing information from the organization s meetings.Why would he stick his neck out for a group that had no way of paying him? His answer is both uplifting and brutally honest. I don t like bullies,  Mr. Foran, who was born and raised in Ireland, said in an interview this week.  And these guys were not only trying to bully women, they were trying to bully poor women. Foran isn t exaggerating. Planned Parenthood predominately helps the poorest women in the country. Aside from providing women access to their constitutional right to have an abortion, the clinics also do life-saving medical check-ups and tests. Shutting them down is a clear message from Republican lawmakers to American women: We do not care about you. It s bullying.Foran, representing NAF, decided to hit the  bullies  back to protect the vital work that Planned Parenthood was doing. They filed a lawsuit against Center for Medical Progress in San Francisco. Thankfully, his job was made a bit easier because Fox News   in its rush to praise the anti-abortion activists   was giving the fraudsters a ton of airtime   all of which was being used to build a case against them. I turned on Fox News and they were open right away about what they did,  Foran told reporters.Unlike the lawsuits and investigations directed at Planned Parenthood, Foran s goals were never malicious. He didn t intend to  destroy  any side of the issue based on a fanatical belief in his own ideological superiority. He was simply standing up for what was right. Our lawsuit is not about pro-choice versus pro-life,  he said.  What you can t do is defraud people, lie and go about manufacturing tales. These guys are accountable under the law just like everybody else. And that s the missing piece in many of the stories covering the Planned Parenthood videos. They are lies, carefully fabricated to achieve an agenda. No matter where you stand on the issue of abortion, this type of smear campaign is just wrong.Pro-life activists are, of course, despondent over their recent change in fortune. After scoring a victory with the release of those tapes, Planned Parenthood continues to thrive, and the videos and the group which produced them have been thoroughly discredited. The lawmakers who once thought they could defund and bankrupt women s clinics are losing every battle. Things have gone just about as badly as they possibly could have on nearly every front.Feature image from Flickr",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Marco Rubio’s Friend Thinks He Needs To See A Doctor After His Insane Debate Performance (VIDEO),"When Marco Rubio announced that he was running for president, some people thought that he was going to be the who beat Jeb and Trump. Some have even speculated that he is the only Republican presidential candidate who would have a fighting chance against the Democratic nominee. However, over the last week or so, he s just started acting really, really strange and now even his friends are worried about him.First, after Ted Cruz was declared the winner of the Iowa Caucus, Rubio stood up at a podium and gave a victory speech. Seriously, he literally stood there for nearly twelve minutes. He spoke for so long that even I started to believe that the news stations were all wrong and he was the first place, not third place winner. It was the most awkward thing I have witnessed since he desperate reach for water during the State of the Union rebuttal in 2013.So, after his extremely awkward Iowa Caucus speech, he showed up at the Republican debate and it only got worse.During the debate Rubio repeated the same line four times. It was almost as if his team was like, Yo, Marco, whenever you get stuck just say  Obama knows exactly what he s doing.  Don t worry, bro, the crowd will know what you re saying. Watching him repeat himself was painful and highlighted all of his inexperience. But, one of his personal friends, CNN commentator Anna Navarro said she thinks that his performance illustrates a much larger problem for the candidate: I ve got to tell you this. By the fourth time he was repeating the exact same words verbatim, I was concerned for his health. Just because Marco is too good And somehow his cables got crossed. You know, short-circuited. And it was very weird. You know your debate theatrics were really, really bad when one of your friends thinks you need to go see a doctor. I personally believe he is just in too deep and not ready to play such a large roll in the government; he is not President Obama. But just to be on the safe side, maybe Ben Carson should take a look at his noggin with those gifted hands of his.Watch the interview below: Featured image via video screenshot",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Senator Slimeball Is At It Again: Cruz Sends Fake ‘Checks’ To Trick Voters Into Giving Him Money,"It might just be time to say Sen. Ted Cruz, in his desperation to win, is running the most disgusting, deceitful political campaign in U.S. history. He seems eager to keep using these underhanded tactics. He clearly enjoys it.After unapolegetically pissing off the entire state of Iowa with fraudulent mailers, Cruz immediately traveled to New Hampshire and beyond where  he s doing the exact same thing. In New Jersey, for example, residents woke up this week to find that Cruz had sent them a  check  in the mail.For a struggling family, a bit of free money coming in the mail out of the blue could mean everything. Tearing it open, what did they find? A shameless campaign tactic designed to get them to give money to Cruz s floundering campaign. Rather than a check made out to them, Cruz s campaign took it upon themselves to write out a check paid to the order of  Cruz for President  for $45.00.It was all part of Cruz s (possibly illegal) money-making scheme that he s used in recent weeks. Cruz has suggested that he has  secret  wealthy backers that have promised to match donations with regular voters. He begs supporters to give him as much money as they can so that these anonymous, super-secret definitely  real  rich friends of his will double the money.While these underhanded tactics probably do work to get Cruz the money he needs to pay people to like him, it s hard to imagine they are doing wonders for his electability. At this rate, there won t be a state in the country that Cruz hasn t personally disgusted with his slimeball campaign. Iowa s state government is already floating the idea that they will be looking into legal action against Cruz s campaign for the numerous election laws that Cruz skated the line of.For Cruz, all of this backlash might be worth it. He s long been considered one of the most reviled people in politics. People who know him, people who work with him, people who once lived with him in college, all say he s a creep. He s not going to win votes by popularity or policy. Instead, his campaign has always been about raising a ton of money from a select group of millionaires and billionaires and then desperately clinging onto fringe right voters who find his homophobia and poor-shaming rhetoric  a turn on.If Cruz s campaign continues to drag for the duration of the primaries, expect to see all the stops pulled out. His team is clearly looking for any possible way to win   ethics and lawfulness need not apply.Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr ",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 People Are Now Hilariously Trolling Marco Rubio By Showing Up To Rallies Dressed As Robots (IMAGE),"Marco Rubio sounded so robotic during the last GOP debate that people are now trolling him by dressing up as robots.As you ll recall, Rubio had a terrible performance on Saturday night thanks to the efforts of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Christie nailed Rubio for repeating the same line over and over again in a matter of minutes as if the Florida Senator malfunctioned and became a broken record. Let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing,  Rubio said in response to Christie s charge that Rubio lacks the experience to be president.  He knows exactly what he s doing. Rubio would go on to repeat the line several more times. Let s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing. He knows exactly what he s doing. Here s the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he s doing. Christie didn t let Rubio get away with it either. Christie accused Rubio of being scripted. This is what Washington D.C. does,  Christie said.  The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech. That is exactly what his advisers gave him. It was a disaster for Rubio, especially since he looked to be rising in the New Hampshire polls. But now, he s seen as a robot who is pre-programmed to say certain things.And he s not going to able to forget about his robotic blunder any time soon.Some clever people had the brilliant idea to troll Rubio by dressing up as robots. In the Twitter image below, you can see two guys in their robot gear.

Memos Expose Propaganda Plans,"Secret memos have been unearthed that show the inner workings of a propaganda campaign being waged in order to keep the multi-million dollar influence of dark money groups funded by people like the Koch Brothers a secret.In the documents obtained by the non-profit investigative news site ProPublica, instructions have been disseminated by the State Policy Network to tell right-wing politicians how to fight against campaign finance laws, and how to push back on laws that fight other political corruption.The State Policy Network, which on its website calls pro-regulation activists  enemies of debate,  distributed its documents at a conference held last fall in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The material includes a map of cities and states considering measures to  force disclosure of charitable giving  and a set of  questions that help people see the consequences of public disclosure.  Among them:  Do you think the government should be able to take down names and addresses of Americans and who they donate to? Do you think people should be targeted for expressing their opinions? The organization also urges its supporters to choose the right phrases to color the debate, shunning terms such as  activist,   anonymous  or  dark money  in favor of  private giving,   censor  and  silencing dissent.  Under the header  Framing the Issue,  a man is pictured with tape over his mouth.In a perversion of the phrase  free speech,  the memos argue that bills dealing with corruption or ethics should be examined in order to campaign against them with the claim that they are censoring free speech.The goal here is to keep in place a world where right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers, who bankroll organizations like the State Policy Network along with other conservative sugar daddies, set the policy and the direction of America.The continued use of  dark money  to influence local and national elections without identifying the people behind it is a long-term aim of the right. By contrast, progressive activists have argued that if someone is putting millions or billions of dollars into political campaigns, often with the hopes that the politicians they ve helped to elect will return the favor with laws tilted in favor of the super-rich, we should know who they are.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jeb Bush Was Just Asked To Sum Up Donald Trump In One Word (VIDEO),"The Republican Party s establishment candidates are being thrashed by the evangelical right wingers. So, when Jeb Bush went appeared on MSNBC s Morning Joe on Monday morning, he decided it was time to fight fire with fire. He opened a can of whoop-ass.Bush took a moment to hit out at his Republcan peers for failing to take on Donald Trump. He seems staggered by the success of the Trump campaign, which has turned former anticipated favorites into footnotes in the race so far. He puts this down to other candidates being too  scared  to confront the  bully. It s just ridiculous. I mean the guy, he s just a real estate guy  he told the hosts.  He s gone bankrupt four times! He s a successful man but not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, so why not confront him, challenge him? Later on, Bush played a word association game about his Republican and Democrat rivals with host Mika Brzezinski. The results were more than revealing. Here were his answers:MIKA: Chris ChristieJEB!: Great guy.MIKA: Marco RubioJEB!: Work in progressMIKA: Hillary ClintonJEB!: Can be beatenMIKA: Bernie SandersJEB!: Love the ad!But the one the really stands out? He summed up Trump Eoin just one word.MIKA: Donald TrumpJEB!: Loser.There aren t really any issues where we agree with the platform of Jeb Bush. Despite presenting himself as a moderate among the likes of Trump and Cruz, Bush is promising a pretty similar offer to America. He is just another anti-science, anti-choice, pro-gun, creationist attempting to drag America back into the dark ages. but on this one thing, Jeb: spot on. It s actually the second time in 24 hours that Jeb! has called Trump as loser. He got a standing ovation for doing the same during an address in New Hampshire on Sunday night.But however angry Bush is, he is still polling below 10% in New Hampshire while Trump soars over 30%. It appears the GOP is choosing which lunatic they want to run the asylum, and the crazier the better.

" Sanders BLASTS Misogynist ‘Bernie Bro’ Fans: ‘I Don’t Want That Crap, I Don’t Want Them’ (VIDEO)","Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are in a dead heat right now to win the Democratic presidential nomination. This, of course, means attacks from both sides   and not just from the candidates themselves. It also means that their respective fans are at war. However, there is a troubling faction among Sanders supporters: blatant misogynists. This online phenomenon, with said fans being known as  Bernie Bros,  is troubling to anyone who abhors sexism of any and all kinds  including Bernie Sanders himself.The senator sat down on Sunday with CNN s Jack Tapper on State of the Union, and, of course, Tapper wanted Sanders  opinion on this particular part of his rabid fanbase. When confronted about the misogyny, Sanders didn t hold back, and positively blasted his own  fans .Tapper posed the question thusly: Have you heard about this phenomenon  Bernie bros ? People who support you, and sometimes attack in very crude and sexist ways? Sanders responded swiftly, and with obvious disgust, saying that he s not down with what some of his so-called fans are up to on the interwebs: Yeah, I have heard about it. It s disgusting. We don t want that crap. And we will do everything we can, and I think we have tried. Look, anybody who is supporting me and is doing sexist things is   we don t want them. I don t want them. That s not what this campaign is about. Good on Bernie for calling out his own worst fans. For someone who is largely seen as the underdog in this race, it was a risky and honorable thing to do.In short, no matter who you support, if you re a Democrat, progressive, liberal   or, hell, even just someone with common sense who sees the danger of ushering in one of the GOP Clown Car candidates this November   you ll call out the crap that is dividing the party of sense.Thanks, Bernie, for doing your part and keeping these  bros  in check.Watch the clip below:https://youtu.be/gCcgZjxEskYFeatured image from video screen capture via Raw Story",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s How The NY Times First Wrote About Obama In 1990 — It Is Not Pretty (IMAGE),"A little more than 25 years ago, the New York Times ran its first profile on Barack Obama. Reading it now, it is stunning just how much has changed, and how much has not.The NYT was writing up 28-year-old Columbia University graduate Barack Obama for becoming the first black President of the Harvard Law Review. Looking at this piece today, it is difficult to understand how just 18 years later, he would become the first black President of the United States.Let s start with the headline: First Black Elected To Lead Harvard Law Review? Frankly, it made us think of the recent headlines about chimpanzees reaching the stone age.  But despite the tone of the piece, in which the tone of paternalism wafts out of the pages even a quarter of a century later, Obama is notably chill. He makes a point in 1990 that he continues to make, and is just as relevant, today. He told the Times: The fact that I ve been elected shows a lot of progress, it s encouraging.   But, he added,  it s important that stories like mine aren t used to say that everything is O.K. for blacks. You have to remember that for every one of me, there are hundreds or thousands of black students with at least equal talent who don t get a chance. There are the same fears of tokenism in 2016 and there were in 1990. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our systems of education, saw and justice.The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world.  This means a higher percentage of U.S. citizens pass through the prison system, than any other country on the planet.For most countries with comparable demographics to the US, there will be 100 prisoners per every 100,000 population. In the US, the rate is five times this at 500 per 100,000. But black men in the U.S. are incarcerated at an eye watering rate of 3,074 per 100,000.This is not because black men are somehow genetically more pre-disposed to crime, but thanks in large part to the school to prison pipeline.  The average state prisoner has a 10th grade education, and about 70% have not completed high school. The U.S. Education System delivers disadvantaged children over to prisons for profit.The American Civil Liberties Union described the School to Prison pipeline of the U.S. Education System like this: A disturbing national trend wherein children are funneled out of public schools and into the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Many of these children have learning disabilities or histories of poverty, abuse or neglect, and would benefit from additional educational and counseling services. Instead, they are isolated, punished and pushed out.  Zero-tolerance  policies criminalize minor infractions of school rules, while high-stakes testing programs encourage educators to push out low-performing students to improve their schools  overall test scores. Students of color are especially vulnerable to push-out trends and the discriminatory application of discipline. The School to Prison pipeline starts with underfunded public schools. The schools are generally overcrowded and lack funding for qualified teachers, counsellors, special educational needs resources and even textbooks.  The children are clear from the get-go that their education is not being invested in   and these schools are normally in disadvantaged areas in the first place. There is no hope, no aspiration, no encouragement, no learning.The implementation of  zero tolerance  policies in schools have turned minor infractions into criminal offences.  This saw suspensions treble between 1974 and 2001  rising from 1.7m to 3.1m, and disproportionately impacting children of color.A combination of major under-resourcing and fear of school-based shootings has seen an influx of police in schools. Instead of teachers, many U.S. schools now have  School Resource Officers patrolling the hallways, criminalising standard misbehavior. Again, children of color are disproportionately represented in the statistics   making up 70% of school arrests made. So, what were these children arrested for?Where children should be being educated about positive and negative behaviours, they are being criminalised as young as six years old. Their educations are being suspended or ended due to these punishments and they are gifted to the prison system.The truth is, disadvantaged children in the U.S. have become a source of profit for the private prison industry.  Over the past four decades that private prisons were rolled out across the US, there has been a simultaneous explosion in crime. Did citizens suddenly become more criminal? No. Poverty was criminalised, and it made its way all the way into the school system.So, while it is shocking to see the nakedly paternalistic language of the NY Times profile from 1990, and think how much has changed   the situation remains staggeringly similar to the majority of the black community of the United States.Featured image from Vox",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 President Makes Surprise Appearance After Super Bowl – And He Has Jokes (VIDEO),"President Obama made a surprise appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert after Super Bowl 50 concluded and didn t come unprepared. While carrying a football with him, he also came with a few jokes as well. Nobody knew he d be on the show, so it was definitely a shock to everyone watching. President Obama: After every Super Bowl, I call the winning team to congratulate them, and sometimes I also call the losing team, especially if I bet on them.Colbert: Sir, I hate to break this to you, but betting is illegal.President Obama: Ehh, I m the president. I hereby pardon myself.Colbert: Okay, fair enough.When he first came on the show via a video feed, it wasn t clear to the audience that the show wasn t being cast live. That soon became very obvious after a few more moments. They actually pre-recorded the interaction an entire week ago.He then made a few jokes about every Super Bowl winner being put on the back of the U.S. Constitution. We re sure a few conservatives out there will take that as an opportunity to take a few jabs at the president for not knowing the Constitution. To them we say, lighten up.Colbert:  So, let me get this straght, you don t even know who won the game, sir?President Obama: Of course, I do. It was the Denver Broncos.Colbert: What? If this is a pre-tape, how could you possibly know that?President Obama:  Stephen, I am the president   and it turns out all the Super Bowl winners for the next 50 years are written on the back of the Constitution. That s the plot of National Treasure 3. After throwing the football to First Lady Michelle Obama, she can be seen doing her  very best touchdown dance  in a room full of kids. Turns out, Mr. Obama isn t supposed to be throwing footballs in the White House. Mr. President, shame on you.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Marcobot Malfunction: New Data Shows Rubio’s Campaign In Crisis (PHOTOS),"A new poll of New Hampshire voters could show an alarming collapse for Senator Marco Rubio. The poll, conducted by a pro-John Kasich super PAC, may change the trajectory of the 2016 Republican presidential campaign.The poll, conducted by the pro-John Kasich New Day for America Super PAC, shows Rubio plummeting to fourth place in the primary here, with 10 percent of the vote. Most of the polling conducted in the immediate days before the debate showed Rubio in second place.The survey, which was based on phone calls to 500 likely voters (margin of error plus or minus 3 percent), was conducted Sunday, the day following the latest Republican debate. Rubio came under scathing attack from Chris Christie, who cast the first term Florida senator as too unready, ambitious, and superficial to occupy the Oval Office.By comparison, the most recent average of polling in New Hampshire shows Rubio pulling in 15.1 percent, in second place behind Donald Trump at 31.3 percent.While the super PAC poll may be a statistical outlier, Rubio received criticism on both the left and right for his performance in the Republican debate on Saturday night. After Governor Chris Christie pointed out that Rubio had performed the same mini-speech twice before at the event, Rubio again returned to his comfort zone.The next day, the nickname Marcobot began circulating for the senator, and video of his exchanges with Christie went viral.A pro-Democratic super PAC constructed robot costumes out of cardboard and appeared outside a Rubio event with the label  Marco Roboto. Rubio's new tag alongs: Marco Roboto +Rubio Talking Point 3000. ""The costumes came out about as well as his debate."" pic.twitter.com/jpswCAKYwX  Jane C. Timm (@janestreet) February 7, 2016In a post-debate appearance on ABC s This Week, Rubio tried to do some damage control on his mistake by doubling down on it:Shown a video of his repeated remarks produced by the Clinton super PAC  Correct the Record,  Rubio said he  would pay them to keep running that clip. That s what I believe passionately,  he said.  It s one of the reasons why I m not running for re-election to the Senate and I m running for president. This notion and this idea that somehow all this is an accident   Obamacare was not an accident, Dodd Frank was not an accident, the deal with Iran was not an accident. Even if the poll results end up being just a super PAC leaning too hard on the scales, the glitch in Rubio s delivery has opened up a line of attack for Democrats, along with his extremist position that women shouldn t be allowed to have an abortion, even in cases of rape and incest.Many in the media have continued to hype Rubio as a winning Republican  establishment  candidate, even though he only mustered a third place finish in the Iowa caucus. If he fails to win in New Hampshire, the path to the nomination will continue to be filled with obstacles he never anticipated.Featured image via Flickr",News,"February 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Lady Gaga Gives Most Amazing National Anthem In History, Homophobes Lose It (VIDEO)","If you happened to miss Lady Gaga give the national anthem before kick-off at Super Bowl 50, you missed one of the most spectacular national anthems in recent history, probably the best ever. Some are saying she did better than Whitney Houston, even. In any case, no matter how well you rate her performance it was certainly up there. She absolutely slayed it, making it her own, and that s no understatement.If you don t already know, Lady Gaga has been a long time advocate of gay rights. The Queen of Twitter had everyone in an uproar after hearing her performance and for all it s worth, the only people who hated it, are, you guessed it, anti-gay homophobes.

 ‘Most Beautiful Girl In The World’ Is Only Ten – And Already Dealing With Sexist Attacks (IMAGES),"Widely hailed as  the most beautiful girl in the world,  10-year-old Kristina Pimenova is no ordinary child, not by any measure of the word. She has already appeared in photographs by heavyweights in the modeling industry such as Vogue Italia, Dolce & Gabbana, Robert Cavalli, Armani, and others. She also just landed a lucrative contract by the ultra-prestigious agency LA Models, and will be relocating to Los Angeles to further her modeling career at a faster pace than probably any child ever has before.On Instagram Kristina has over 1.2 million followers, and on Facebook she s fast approaching 4 million. But, with success, comes consequences. Already Kristina is being objectified by grown men claiming among other things, that they ll be  waiting  for her. Considering her tagline is  Remember beauty is inside,  it doesn t appear everyone is that deserving.Last year her mother was accused of posting  provocative  and  sexualized  photos of little Kristina, but her mother Glikeriya Pimenova says such accusations are baseless. If anything, people were  paedophiles  if they think her photos made her look like a  babe.  We d have to agree with her. It s not uncommon to go to a swimming pool and see little girls swimming in their bathing suits, or wearing things that little girls simply wear. This is just another example of men accusing beautiful women of being at fault, merely because they find them attractive.It s pretty sick and it s this type of double standard that men have that really needs to be called out   especially because this is a child. Kristina is only ten-years-old and already getting the kind of attention normally reserved for adult women, and it s only going to get worse from here. That s why society needs to be aware of it, and men need to know it s not okay. Let a 10-year-old girl be a kid. Be aware of your inner prejudices that are prone to attack or vilify simply because of your own inner issues, not theirs.#kristinapimenovaA photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Jun 7, 2015 at 7:35pm PDTPic via Instagram.Pic via InstagramKristina is now represented by @lamodels and @newyorkmodels A photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Feb 3, 2016 at 10:24am PST#portosbakery we love this place A photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Nov 25, 2015 at 4:09pm PSTWhile we will admit, adults need to be careful of what images they upload of their children, it s not her fault she s beautiful.Featured image from Instagram.",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Anthony Anderson Burns Stacey Dash: She’s ‘Ann Coulter Dipped In Butterscotch’,"In an amazing take down of Fox News contributor Stacey Dash, comedian Anthony Anderson compared her to Ann Coulter.Dash has received heavy criticism ever since she called for ending BET and the NCAA Image Awards in her backwards solution to ending racism in response to the condemnation of the Oscars for the lack of diversity. We have to make up our minds,  Dash said on Fox News. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you re only awarded if you re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It s a double standard. There shouldn t be a Black History Month,  the Clueless actress continued.  We re Americans. Period. Well, the backlash was swift and merciless as BET and others responded by reminding Dash that she has made several appearances on television shows and music videos aired on the channel.But Anthony Anderson also chimed in on Friday while hosting the 47th Annual NAACP Image Awards and it s fair to say that Dash got totally roasted by the Black-ish star. Everybody give a round of applause for Stacey Dash!  he began. What the hell is she doing here? Doesn t she know that the Fox network is using her? She s just an Ann Coulter dipped in butterscotch. That s all she is. Baby, don t let them use you! Come back to the black people and get back to work on some of those beautiful C-movies that you used to do! Anderson must have hit a nerve, because Dash responded with a weird post on Twitter.Well it s funny how woman who weighs 105 wet! Can get grown ass men to act like llittle girls! Haha  Stacey Dash (@REALStaceyDash) February 6, 2016Stacey Dash deserves the criticism she has been getting lately and Anthony Anderson made a spectacular comparison.The fact is that without BET or the NAACP, African-Americans would be even more underrepresented in the entertainment industry than they are now. Perhaps one day, there won t be a need for the Image Awards or BET. But that s going to depend on whether or not mainstream awards show like the Oscars get their act together and start treating black actors and actresses with the respect they deserve.

 Hillary Gives Rubio A New Name After He Says She Kills Babies On Their Due Date (VIDEO),"Marco Rubio is making a name for himself in the Republican Party. Some think (actually most) that he s the GOP s best chance to defeat the Democrats in a general election. He s young, he s Hispanic, he s from an important swing state like Florida, and he s not as crazy as Donald Trump (at least by appearance).But, what most people don t know, is that Rubio s views on abortion make him an absolute nightmare of a candidate. And, people within his own party even are calling him out on it. During Saturday night s Republican debate Senator Rubio made the craziest accusation against Hillary Clinton on abortion yet. He levied the charge that  Hillary supports aborting babies on their due date. When Hillary was asked on Face The Nation what she thought of the comment, here was how she described it, among other words: Pathetic. That s one way to describe Rubio, for sure.We can t say these kinds of attacks are not typical of Republicans, cause then we d be lying. Hillary wasn t even surprised in the least and didn t even flinch when offering her rebuttal.  Here was her full response: I think it s pretty pathetic. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio is going as far as he can to try and buttress his credentials within certain parts of the Republican constituency. I ve been on record for years of where I stand on making abortion safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into, and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to very excruciating kinds of decisions. And, to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season to try and raise false charges and look like he s going to try and make sure Roe v. Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded is just a tried and true tactic by those on the right. Clinton followed this up by pointing out that Rubio should probably brush up on the law first before bringing this up again in the future.Senator Rubio may very well be the GOP s best chance to go up against the Democrats, but with comments like those in a debate, you can be sure Clinton will be ready to shut him down again if she has to. We rate her description of Rubio as  pathetic  to be accurate and right on the money.

 Cop Who Killed Mentally Ill Teen Sues Victim’s Family For $10 Million Dollars (VIDEO),"Chicago police officer Robert Rialmo shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier, a mentally ill college student, in his family s home the day after Christmas in 2015. One of the police officer s rounds also struck and killed their 55-year-old neighbor, Bettie Jones. Now Rialmo is suing LeGrier s family for emotional distress. Ther are 911 calls that show that LeGrier called the police three times only to be hung up on by the dispatcher.How much does Rialmo think that the emotional distress he has endured is worth? $10 million dollars. Seriously, this cop thinks that he can kill this family s son and neighbor, get away with it, and then make away with a fortune.The Chicago Tribune reports: Rialmo s lawsuit provides the officer s first public account of the Dec. 26 shooting in the West Garfield Park neighborhood. It says Rialmo opened fire after Quintonio LeGrier twice swung a bat at his head at close range, and LeGrier was shot when Rialmo saw him raising the bat again and thought LeGrier could kill him if LeGrier hit him in the head with the bat.LeGrier s father, Antonio LeGrier, had filed a wrongful death lawsuit saying his son wasn t a threat, and Rialmo s lawsuit, which asks for damages of more than $10 million, is a countersuit in that case. Rialmo also fatally shot Antonio LeGrier s neighbor Bettie Jones, 55, in the confrontation, but police have said her death was accidental. In 2015, the police killed more than 1,000 people in the United States. That s a staggering figure. What s even worse is that none of those police officers have been prosecuted for any potential wrongdoing. In the United States, if you are a cop   you can kill someone and not have to worry about the consequences. Apparently that is not good enough for some cops. They saw how fast Darren Wilson got rich after he killed Michael Brown and have decided to get in on the action.You can watch a video report on the story, below.

 Superstar Marc Anthony Rocks Madison Square Garden By Shouting ‘F*** Donald Trump!’ As Crowd Cheers (VIDEO),"If Donald Trump had been at Madison Square Garden during this Marc Anthony concert, he would have been booed out of the building.During the concert, the popular Latino singer took aim at the Republican billionaire by shouting at the top of his lungs about his pride at being a Latino before telling Trump to go f*ck himself, which drew a loud cheer from the thousands in attendance. I m proud to be a Latino,  Anthony told his fans. I just want to say, we re proud of our country. We speak a little differently. We have our own food, we have our own way of being. But here, no matter where you come from, we re Latinos. And we have to take care of each other, no matter where we come from. There s only one f*cking box to check when you come to this country, and it says  Latino!' There s some crazy movement coming from some  Anthony began to say while motioning with his hands. He then wanted to say two things. First,  F*ck Donald Trump!  Anthony then told the crowd that he wants Trump to hear it from his house.  Wake that motherf*cker up.  And then the concert resumed.Here s the video via YouTube.It s understandable why Anthony has a problem with Donald Trump. Throughout his run for the presidency, Trump has repeatedly launched unfair attacks on Latinos. During his official campaign announcement Trump characterized all Mexicans as rapists, and promised to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep Latino immigrants from entering the country. Ever since, he has blamed Latinos for the crime and violence in the United States and called for a renewal of  Operation Wetback,  a deportation initiative under the Eisenhower Administration, a consequence of which resulted in the use of  wetback  as a derogatory term against Latinos and the displacement of thousands of men, women, and children.The fact is that, like Donald Trump, Marc Anthony is an American citizen and a native New Yorker. But while Trump clings to a racist version of America, Anthony believes in the historical diversity that has made America great over countless generations.That being said, Republicans should tread carefully if they really want Latinos to vote for their candidate in November.

 Texas Governor Wants Christian Crosses On Cop Cars,"In a brief sent to the state Attorney General s office on February 5, Texas Governor Greg Abbott insisted that putting Christian crosses on police vehicles is a Constitutional right.In his brief, Abbott wrote: Even under the U.S. Supreme Court s expansive interpretation of the Establishment Clause s limited and unambiguous text, the Court has never held that public officials are barred from acknowledging our religious heritage. To the contrary, the U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized the demographic and historical reality that Americans  are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Of course that an absolute lie. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled against any government sponsorship or endorsement of religion.Abbott goes on to claim that Christian cross bumper stickers on police vehicles  neither establish a religion nor threaten any person s ability to worship God, or decline to worship God, in his own way. I wonder if he would feel the same way about Islamic symbols on police vehicles? What about symbols used by the church of Satan? Do those belong on police vehicles?Like most Americans, I am tired of hearing the religious right whine about how their religion is under attack in the U.S., every time a judge tells them they cannot use public funds and resources to promote their personal religious beliefs.There is a big difference between the state oppressing Christians and the state banning Christians from promoting or endorsing their religion with taxpayer dollars and/or taxpayer property.If you want to put a Christian bumper sticker on your personal vehicle, no-one is standing in your way. If you want to put one on a publicly owned vehicle, that s an entirely different story.Why is this so difficult for right-wing Christians to comprehend?Much to the dismay of the Christian right, the government is not a vehicle for enforcing their hypocritical religious beliefs on the public.In light of the Christian right s constant attempts to use government to force their religious doctrine on others, it makes perfect sense that they would try to slap Biblical bumper stickers on police cars.When state legislatures pass laws banning oral and anal sex, denying rights to the LGBT community, attempting to ban non-Christians from practicing their religious beliefs, making atheist marriage illegal, even suggesting laws that would make not going to church a crime, it s already frighteningly clear that they want police to act as the armed enforcers of their religious doctrine.In spite of Governor Abbott s ill-informed brief on this subject, even the slightest semblance of police being used as the  enforcers of Christianity  is a clear violation of the Establishment Clause.Over and over and over again these right-wing nuts whine about how their religion is being oppressed in the United States.Let s get something straight. Religious oppression is when the government attempts to keep you from practicing your religion on your own time and using your own resources. Barring you from using the stuff other people paid for to promote your religion, is not oppressive.If the government were to force all Christians to wear a special ID badge designating their religion, that would be oppressive. Or if the government were to bar Christians from entering the country, simply because of their religion, that would be oppressive. Or if the government were to create a special database for Christians so that they could be easily identified and closely watched, that would be oppressive.Only the government does not do that to Christians.On the other hand, right-wing Christians in government, including Texas Governor, Greg Abbott, sincerely want to do those things to Muslims.Thankfully, the establishment clause was created to protect Christians from experiencing the kind of government oppression they would gladly inflict on others.It s also there to protect the rest of us from right-wing Christians who would use our government, our tax dollars, our public property and our public employees to force their skewed version of Christianity down everyone s throat with a police-issued revolver.Image from johndoeforty1 on Flckr, cc 2.0. *Some changes were made to this image",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Won’t Believe The Mailer The Rubio Campaign Just Sent Out Of Jeb Bush’s Mother (IMAGE),"The Republican presidential race has gotten so heated as well as sleazy that not even the presidential candidates  mothers are left alone. With the New Hampshire primary just around the corner, a potential voter showed a mailer a super PAC backing Florida senator Marco Rubio sent out to New Hampshire voters.The mailer features a photo of Jeb Bush wearing a golden crown next to a white haired and bejeweled Queen Elizabeth II, who bears a striking resemblance to Jeb s mother and former First Lady Barbara Bush.And in case it wasn t obvious that the mailer is linking Queen Elizabeth to Jeb s mom Barbara, the mailer includes an old quote from Barbara below the photo of Queen Elizabeth. It reads: We ve had enough Bushes.   Barbara Bush. The mailer, which is headlined What happened to the  Coronation  of Jeb Bush?  is clearly linking the idea of monarchy and the seeming monopolization of power by the Bush family, who ve already had two previous presidents and are vying for a third. The mailer has images of Henry VIII who represents George Sr., and and the Burger King mascot, who represents George Jr.The back of the mailer reads: Most pundits claimed Bush/Clinton general election match up was inevitable,  reads the back of the Rubio super PAC mailer.  They said the 2016 election would be a choice between these 2 dynasties. One has to admit, this is quite a clever mailer as the Bush family is attempting to put yet another son in power. We re still reeling from the mistakes of Jeb s brother, who plunged the country into chaos in the eight years he was at the helm and we don t need Jeb, who has been unapologetic for the mistakes and crimes of his brother.However, we definitely don t need Marco Rubio, the conservative, robotic, and unappealing Florida senator. Let s continue to watch in glee as all of the candidates continue to cancel each other out with antics that lack in the most basic of human integrity.

 Trump Flip Flops On Super Bowl Pick After Finding Out Peyton Manning Supports Jeb Bush,"As usual, Donald Trump s support only goes as far as who he thinks supports him. After a week of claiming he was rooting for Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl, he shamelessly switched sides to the Carolina Panthers after his arch-rival Jeb Bush claimed Manning as his own.During the Republican debate, a smug-looking Jeb Bush announced that  Peyton Manning is supporting me, and I m for Denver. He wasn t kidding, Manning has reportedly donated the maximum amount, $2,700, to Bush s campaign. That had to sting the other candidates, because Manning is a well-known conservative who loves throwing cash at his favorite politicians. He gave money to George W. Bush during his re-election campaign in 2004, gave $5000 to Mitt Romney in 2012, and regularly gives checks to Republican politicians in his home state of Tennessee. His brother and fellow NFL quarterback Eli Manning also maxed out a contribution to Jeb Bush.This was an embarrassing moment for Trump, who up until last week was boasting about Manning.Who is Donald Trump pulling for in Super Bowl 50? https://t.co/XbptyG0CGJ  Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) January 31, 2016 I ll stick with Peyton,  said Trump at the time, just one week before he very much didn t stick with Peyton.Both Trump and Bush s other rival, Marco Rubio, appeared openly bitter about Manning during the debate. While Trump let his flip-flop speak for itself, Rubio noted that he  was rooting for Peyton Manning, but now I m rooting for Carolina. As Addicting Info s Oliver Willis recently reported, it s not just Peyton. The Denver Broncos organization, like many football teams, is itself a massive backer of the GOP.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Broncos have donated $112,475 to conservative candidates and political committees. By comparison the Carolina Panthers have given $17,000 to support the right. While both teams have also contributed to liberal candidates, the numbers are much smaller   $3,500 for the Broncos, $4,000 for the Panthers.It s fun to watch how quickly Trump will turn on a person who so recently praised just because he can t get anything from him or her. It s clear that Trump s opinions about people change at the whims of his fragile ego.Feature image via Flickr/Papa Johns",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Clarifies One Of His Most Divisive Talking Points (VIDEO),"One of the most critical issues facing the United States is the role that big money plays in financing elections. This has been a major issue that has been discussed by all Democratic primary candidates so far in the election. During an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper on The State of the Union, Bernie Sanders clarified some of the language he has used during his campaign so far.Bernie Sanders has made campaign finance reform a major part of his platform. In fact, he has even eschewed financial support from Super PACS. This has led to some very weak criticisms from the right-wing, who say that he has taken money from groups like the National Nurses Union, which has endorsed him. Those criticisms are absurd, and only seem to show that they do not understand the issue, nor the type of support that Sanders is receiving from the union.During the interview, Sanders says that money is controlling Washington. Studies suggest that this is partly true. A well-known study done by Princeton showed that the United States, to a large degree is a no longer a democracy, but rather an oligarchy. They note that the whittling away of democracy in the United States has been going on since the 1980 s. The rise of the Super PAC, plus the Citizen s United Supreme Court decision that has lead to the flooding of money into elections, is simply the next stage of cancer that is the collusion between government and corporation.The United States has a long history of money, big and small, creeping into elections. Once people decide that they have had enough, they send that corrupting influence into remission. It just so happens that this issue is reaching a boiling point right now, as are so many other issues.You can watch the interview, below.

" Hillary Absolutely SKEWERS Rubio’s Anti-Choice Bullsh*t, Calling Him ‘Pathetic’ (VIDEO)","If there s someone who has always stood up for the rights of women, it s Hillary Clinton. In fact, it s been pretty much her life s work. So, when a robotic, mansplaining candidate like Republican Sen. Marco Rubio decided he would throw jabs at Clinton and her stance on abortion rights, as well as abortion rights in general, she did not hold back her opinion of the Florida Senator.On ABC s  This Week  she said: It s really quite sad to see what Senator Rubio is becoming in this campaign. Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can. I ve been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal. And I ve had the same position that I ve had for a very long time. But what s really going on here is an effort by the Republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn Roe v. Wade, to defund Planned Parenthood, to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme It s just so unfortunate that politicians like Senator Rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of concerns and I don t think he should be allowed to get away with that. Rubio had stated that Clinton would support abortion  even on the due date of that unborn child  during Saturday night s GOP debate.While appearing on CBS  Face the Nation  Clinton reiterated her disgust in his comments, saying: I think it s pretty pathetic. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio has just been going as far as he can to try to, I guess, buttress his credentials with certain parts of the Republican constituency. I ve been on record for years about where I stand on making abortions safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into. And the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to excruciating kinds of decisions. Decisions Rubio, sans uterus, will never have to face.It s disgusting that women and their reproductive rights are politicized each and every election cycle, because it s pretty much they only social issue the GOP has left to get people to the polls, especially now that marriage equality is law of the land.What a woman does with her body is her decision, and her decision alone. No ifs, ands or buts about it. And unless these Republican men are cool with restrictions for their bodies as well, they better STFU.Hillary Clinton calls Rubio's comments on her abortion stance ""pathetic"" & an attempt to ""buttress his credentials"" https://t.co/u7wY0TcpCn  Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) February 7, 2016Video/Featured image: CBS News",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Zoolander And Hansel’s Hilarious Critique Of Presidential Candidates’ Fashion Choices (VIDEO),"Owen Wilson as Hansel and Ben Stiller as Zoolander stopped by Saturday Night Live s Weekend Update to offer their professional advice and commentary about the fashion choices of the 2016 presidential candidates and it was hilarious.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QM7UYi9mA]The pair began the segment by teasing Democratic  front-runner Hillary Clinton. Well, you know, Hillary is from the  90s, which is really hot right now,  Hansel said. Then Zoolander compared her attire  to that of one of his  all-time fashion icons  Kim Jong-un.  Not to name drop, but I m pretty good friends with his sister, Kim Kardashi-un. But the real fun began when the pair mistakenly confused Ted Cruz for Tom Cruise. Using Cruise s past movie titles, the pair said: Next, we ve got Tom Cruise. Oh, he s totally let himself go. This is a real Mission Impossible for a stylist. Makes me keep my Eyes Wide Shut. He should take his Top Gun and do some Risky Business with a Cocktail. And finally, they ended with none other than Donald Trump and his fashion choices. When asked what they thought of Trump, the pair said: Oh, we love him. Donny is just like us. He has the classic male model look. Donny has orange mocha crapaccino.   And this one is called hot mess. When all was said and done, the funniest jokes were on the Republican front-runner.

" After Iowa, Trump’s Fragile Ego Totally Preparing For Being A Loser Everywhere (VIDEO)","According to Donald Trump, he didn t  lose  in the Republican Iowa Caucus. He came in second, which is really the same thing as winning when you really think about it. Except it s not. However, to Trump s fragile ego, and what he tells himself in the mirror each night, is that he really won, because Ted Cruz was a meanie and cheated.Now, to prepare himself for loss everywhere he goes, Trump has now taken to telling everyone he doesn t actually have to win a state. In this case, New Hampshire. Someone should probably let Trump know that in order to win the Republican Party nomination he s going to have to not only win states, but win a lot of them, not come in second, but actually, in all legitimacy, win.However, Trump being Trump, and with his narcissistic personality disorder preventing him from being able to wrap his giant head around a loss, even losing is a win   to him. He even told CNN s Jake Tapper on State of the Union: I want to win New Hampshire, but I don t think I have to win it. He s clearly preparing himself for a loss, despite having a monster lead in the Granite State, but after Iowa, he s probably thinking all bets are off.Donald Trump will never admit to losing, now if he does lose, well, he can say he called it and claim he never needed it:  I told you guys I didn t need it!  He s creating a bit of an insurance policy for himself as really any good businessperson would: you have a contingency plan.Oh, Trump. If not for your ego, you would be a very lonely man. Your love for yourself is unending.

" Marco Rubio To Rape Victims: Sorry You Were Raped, But Have Your Rapist’s Baby Anyway (VIDEO)","Not content with being a mere robot who repeats the same scripted line over and over during a debate, Marco Rubio demonstrated that he is a cold heartless robot on Sunday.Everyone knows that the Florida Senator is an extremist when it comes to a woman s right to choose an abortion.Last July, Rubio vowed to outlaw abortion  at home and around the world,  making clear that women are only voting against their own freedom if they vote for Rubio to become president.Rubio s position on abortion is one of the most strict among the GOP field, especially since he opposes exceptions for rape victims, whom he would gleefully force to carry their rapist s baby for nine grueling months with the risk that her rapist will claim parental rights and terrorize her for the rest of her life.And Rubio did little to soften that position on Sunday, telling George Stephanopoulos that he would look a rape victim in the eye and tell her to carry her rapist s baby to term. Abortion to me is not a political issue,  Rubio said.  It s a human rights issue. He then said that he would sign an anti-abortion bill with exceptions, but only because it would be a step toward banning abortion altogether. I do require an exception for life of the mother because I m pro-life. Number two, as I ve said, if they pass a law in Congress that has exceptions, I ll sign it. Because I want to save lives. The ABC host then asked Rubio point-blank what he would say to a woman who gets pregnant through rape, to which Rubio replied that he would tell her how sorry he is but she should have the baby anyway. It s a terrible situation. I mean, a crisis pregnancy, especially as a result of something as horrifying as that, I m not telling you it s easy. I m not here saying it s an easy choice. It s a horrifying thing that you ve just described. I get it. I really do. And that s why this issue is so difficult. But I believe a human being, an unborn child has a right to live, irrespective of the circumstances of which they were conceived. Rubio conceded that most Americans disagree with him on this issue, but nevertheless, he said he would still sign a bill banning abortion despite the opposition from the people.Here s the video via YouTube:Indeed, the Washington Post reports that support for the right to choose has never been higher, and even 40 percent of Republicans support choice.Rubio is clearly echoing former Republican candidate Rick Santorum, who called a rape pregnancy a  gift from God  four years ago. Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock felt the same way. And both men lost their bid for public office because of their extreme stance.As you also recall, the Republican war on women cost the GOP dearly in 2012 as women flocked to the voting booth to give their overwhelming support to President Obama. And seeing as how the GOP has only become more extreme against women s rights, it looks like 2016 will at the very least be a repeat, but could end up being a landslide for Democrats if an anti-abortion fanatic like Rubio becomes the GOP nominee.Women should always have a choice when it comes to making decisions about their bodies. But Republicans want to force women to have babies against their will even if that pregnancy was forced upon them by a rapist. That makes Republicans no better than the  Make Rape Legal  activists who are only becoming more emboldened as the conservative anti-women fervor gets more extreme.By forcing women to give birth to their rapist s baby, Republicans would reward rapists with progeny and give them even more power over their victims, while subjecting women to months and years of trauma. We do not need these kinds of men running our government. They only contribute to the rape culture that is plaguing this country, and that means most of the Republican field of candidates are unfit to be president.Featured Image: Woman Survival",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch What Happens When A Rapist Pedophile Tries To Panhandle In The Wrong Guy’s Town (NSFW VIDEO),"Our street corners are filled with people in need carrying cardboard signs and asking for food or cash. The majority of them are legitimately struck with hard times. In many cases it s the only source of income for their family after a job is lost. There are also those out there who are taking advantage of the generosity of others, collecting money for no reason than it s easier to work. Those people, of course, make it more difficult for those with genuine issues.As you ll see in this video, there s a third kind of person out there collecting money, and his name is Lloyd Baker. Baker was arrested in October of 2012 and charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl in connection with a kidnapping. He is currently out on bail and awaiting trial. In the small town of West Warwick, Rhode Island, people like Lloyd Baker don t just blend in with the scenery; somebody is bound to recognize him.That s exactly what happened. The man who shot the short clip confronted Baker, who at first denied who he was but then admitted it a short time later. It doesn t really matter what this man s circumstances are, he doesn t deserve the charity people are affording him, especially if they don t know who he is or why he can t find work.Please be warned, the man who made the video isn t pleased with Baker. His language is harsh.

 Watch SNL Hilariously Mock Ted Cruz Over Iowa ‘Win’ (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz is a guy who s easy to make fun of and SNL had a field day with him and his campaign last night. Taran Killam, who played the Republican presidential candidate, delivered a hilarious performance. Kallam as Cruz said:  Some of you may have seen me in tonight s Republican debates in New Hampshire. And if you missed it, here s a quick recap: I won. I also won the Iowa Caucuses thanks to endorsements from strong conservatives like Glenn Beck and God almighty. Cruz s  win , of course, had nothing to do with God but more to do with some nasty trickery. For example, there was Cruz s campaign telling voters that Ben Carson had dropped out of the race. Then of course, there were the mailers sent by the Cruz campaign which tried to manipulate voters into voting for him.Killam as Cruz said he was an  unconventional candidate : I didn t get where I am today because I was born wealthy or handsome or charismatic or nice. I am not cool or likable or even fine. Cruz shouldn t be blamed for his looks, being born without wealth, or even his lack of charisma. However, there are certainly some things he can do to make him more likable to folks. People don t like being lied to, nor do they like to be manipulated and it looks like Ted Cruz is a master at that. It s quite crazy to think that people actually vote for this guy!Killam concluded: Isn t it time for a president who s just a nasty, little weasel?

 Trump Tried To Give $100K Bribe To Vets To Be ‘Props’ At His Rally – They Told Him To Screw Himself,"Five-time draft deferment Donald Trump tried to buy the love of American soldiers so he could use them at his rally, and it went about as well as one might expect.It s obvious why Donald Trump would want to appear as if he had the troops on his side: He s spent much of his campaign insulting them. Whether it was implying that POWs were  losers  or mistakenly featuring the servicemen of other countries (including Nazis and Russian soldiers) in his political ads, it s clear that Trump has only a surface-deep appreciation of all the sacrifices America s military has made.Needless to say, his pandering in the face of his reprehensible actions didn t go over well. In a bombshell exclusive by The Daily Beast s Tim Mak, Trump was exposed as having tried to bribe a veterans charity  to be his political prop  for a promise of $100,000.On Friday, Liberty House executive director Keith Howard received a call from a Trump campaign staffer, who conveyed that Trump would like to publicly present them with a six-figure check at a Londonderry rally on Monday, right before the Granite State primary.It s an enormous amount of money for a small charity. But Howard said he wouldn t do it risking the entire, substantial donation on a point of principle.Howard was right to question Trump s donation. Apart from being manipulated by the Republican front-runner to serve his agenda, the charity would have probably lost its  nonprofit  status by appearing at a Trump rally. After Trump s convoy pulled out and headed towards their next rally, the charity would have been left with a sizable check but without legal standing. Not that Trump seemed to care what would happen if the group actually accepted his bribe.Even worse, Trump was running this bribe through his  Donald J. Trump Foundation  which, as Mak notes, is very likely considered an illegal campaign contribution to himself.The campaign utilizing the foundation to help support and promote campaign events is a potential legal problem for both the campaign and the Trump Foundation,  said Larry Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center.The value of the work the foundation did to assist the campaign event could be considered an illegal campaign contribution. And the foundation is barred from getting involved in political activity, such as supporting a campaign rally, he continued.  Neither the foundation nor other charities should be working hand-in-hand with the campaign to promote Trump s campaign events. Which is exactly what Trump s charity is doing. It hasn t escaped the attention of some in the media.When will Republican Congress have hearing on @realDonaldTrump Foundation violating IRS charity rule last night? https://t.co/3FbAXzNN5E  Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) January 29, 2016Hilariously, Howard later called Trump s campaign and told them that if they were serious about helping veterans, they wouldn t mind giving him the contribution behind closed doors and not, say, at a giant political rally. This of course would defeat the whole purpose for Trump. What good is charity if you can t brag about it to pander to voters? For days, Trump s campaign signaled that they were very disappointed that the veteran s group wouldn t help Trump look good   but finally, sensing a losing battle, they relented. Howard got his money, but on his terms.So much for Trump being an expert  deal maker,  as he just got played by a small charity to the tune of $100,000.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chris Christie Takes Marco Rubio To The Woodshed For Being A Scripted Robot (VIDEO),"Marco Rubio was looming large in New Hampshire, but Chris Christie made Marco Rubio look very small on Saturday night.In a span of only a few minutes, Christie knocked Rubio off his game so badly that he ended up repeating the same line on multiple occasions even after the New Jersey governor accused him of being scripted.And it all started when Christie absolutely shredded Rubio s lack of leadership experience. You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable,  Christie said.  You just simply haven t. And the fact is   the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you weren t even there to vote for it. That s not leadership, that s truancy. Indeed, Rubio has been roundly criticized for not doing his job.According to Gov Track, Rubio has missed 14.1 percent of votes since 2011, and that percentage skyrocketed last year. Currently, he has missed up to 88 percent of votes in the Senate because he would rather be out campaigning. And that disqualifies Rubio from being president, Christie says. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don t come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.I like Marco Rubio, and he s a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. Rubio responded by bringing up Christie s own lack of leadership during natural disasters and then he used a line that would get him stuck like a broken record for the next several minutes. Let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing. He knows exactly what he s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking an effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world. Christie responded by accusing Rubio of memorizing a 25-second speech that his advisers gave him, and Rubio only helped Christie by repeating it again and again. Let s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing,  Rubio said later on.  He knows exactly what he s doing. He is trying to change this country. And again Here s the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he s doing. Here s the video via YouTube:In the end, Rubio looked a like a robot who was pre-programmed with key phrases prior to the debate but went haywire upon being challenged.This was not a good performance by Rubio, especially since he had been rising in the New Hampshire polls. But after the beating he took from Christie on Saturday night, Rubio can probably kiss his presidential aspirations goodbye.Featured Image: NBC Latino",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch The EXACT Moment Marco Rubio Saw His Presidential Hopes Die On Super Bowl Sunday (VIDEO),"Marco Rubio might have been flying high after the results from Iowa, but he well and truly crashed hard at Saturday night s ABC GOP debate in New Hampshire. Like Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson before him, Rubio watched his Presidential hopes die.There s no way to sugar coat this one   Rubio choked. He likely over-rehearsed, came prepared with his lines all ready, but was then totally unable to respond to spontaneous questions during the debate. The result? He churned out the exact same line four times in a row, word-for-word, within minutes, unable to expand on his soundbite.Someone had clearly told Rubio to hit Obama hard, and so he had to keep saying that  Republicans need to dispense with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing.  It landed the first time he said it, but then he just couldn t stop saying it. It was truly awkward to watch, and you could see the panic in his eyes. Think about a child in the school play who forgets their next line, so just keeps repeating the last one over and over to a silent audience. That.Further down the panel, Chris Christie smelled blood and went in for the kill. He has maintained an attack on Rubio for being too polished and inauthentic, and this played right into that. But instead of Rubio taking the opportunity to come back at Christie with a counter-attack, he literally went back and repeated his Obama line again. We re not kidding. Watch.As AL.com s post-debate roundup puts it:Instead of responding, Rubio repeated the same statements and made Christie looked like his criticism was spot on. It was a strange exchange and one that seemed to taint the rest of Rubio s debate   he ended up repeating himself over and over and looked lost. He did better later in the debate but it could very well be Rubio s Howard Dean moment.The morning after the debate, with all eyes on Rubio to rally back, the candidate may well have killed his campaign. Appearing on ABC with George Stephanopoulous, Rubio was asked to respond to critics of his  robotic  performance. His answer looked great first time: I would pay them to keep running that clip. Because that s what I believe passionately. It s one of the reasons that I m not running for re-election in the Senate. I m running for president. But then Stephanopoulos followed up with a rebuttal: But you re getting pounded for repeating that speech. And then it all fell apart. Because Rubio had scripted one line, and one line only, to respond to critics that he scripts his lines. So, he went on repeat again. I hope they keep running it,  he replied.  And I m going to keep saying it because it s true. And then he said it again. It s what I believe and it s what I m going to continue to say, Because it s one of the main reasons why I am running. If you watch the video closely, you might just be able to spot the exact moment where Rubio realizes his Presidential hopes just died.

" Jeb Bush Finally Got The Best Of Trump, Until Trump Hushed Him Like A Toddler (VIDEO)","If you have the stomach to actually follow the Republican debates that seem to happen every other day now, you know that Jeb Bush has a singular mission at this point in his campaign: Attack Donald Trump. Bush, long considered the establishment favorite to win the Republican nomination, has been pushed around by Trump since the very first debate with very little success at firing back.That s not for a lack of trying. Bush, whose natural posture is slumpy and whose speech is frumpy, can t help but look like a bullied kid when he tries to defend himself against Trump. His debate performances have been so lackluster he was even scolded publicly by his Mommy, who probably wishes she had another Dubya right about now. The dumber brother obviously got all of the charisma.This latest round of  attack each other and say Hillary Clinton  a lot   also known as a  debate    saw Jeb finally come up with a successful attack against Trump. When Trump started talking about the government taking private property by eminent domain to construct roads and bridges, Jeb fired back with a story about Trump s attempt to take the property of an elderly woman in Atlantic City by eminent domain so he could provide a nice parking lot for limousines outside one of his casinos.Jeb had the crowd fired up. Finally, an exchange between Trump and Jeb was going his way. That is until Trump was offered the opportunity to respond. As Trump tried to  make America great  his way out of yet another sordid detail of his past, Jeb chimed in, interrupting him mid-sentence, only to be shushed by Trump, who had already twice asserted that Jeb  wanted to be a tough guy. After his shushing of a grown man, which admittedly was a bit hilarious, Trump got his share of boos, hitting back hard with  that s all of his supporters and special interests. Other than the ridiculously botched introductions, it was the only part of the debate worth watching:Featured image via screen capture ",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Women Are Breast-Trolling Twitter In Support Of Susan Sarandon’s Cleavage (IMAGES),"A week ago, Susan Sarandon attended the 2016 SAG awards looking absolutely fabulous. She proudly wore an outfit that showed off her cleavage because she s Susan Sarandon and she doesn t care what you think. The internet promptly melted down in worship at the sight of this feminist icon doing what she does. But a few days later, Piers Morgan inexplicably took issue with Sarandon s wardrobe choice on twitter:Would Susan Sarandon wear this to a funeral? No. It was thus horribly inappropriate for an In Memoriam tribute. pic.twitter.com/hMoGChJY8D  Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) February 3, 2016This is slut-shaming, pure and simple. I m not entirely sure why the sight of cleavage in public places offends some people and I understand even less why they think anyone cares about their opinion on the matter.Still, Sarandon decided to tease Morgan and sent out the following Time Warp:Today s #TBT is dedicated to @piersmorgan. pic.twitter.com/InU7d6qhC0  Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) February 4, 2016After this, the women of twitter caught wind and took exception with Morgan s attempt to shame cleavage. Their solution to the problem? #CleavageSolidarity and numerous tweets of their own cleavage:@piersmorgan EMBRACE THE BOOOOOOOOOBS #CleavageSolidarity pic.twitter.com/7kb4sr6NlG  Hirallll (@MonkeyShoulder) February 6, 2016a cleavage shot for @piersmorgan as part of #cleavagesolidarity hope you like this one xx pic.twitter.com/TV516oHdKK  Sexybbwfun (@sexybbwfun) February 6, 2016Instead of shaming women lets realize it s 2016 .

They re only  scandalous  because we ve been conditioned to think that way. Sarandon clearly didn t think it was inappropriate and there s exactly zero reason she, or any other woman, should be beholden to anyone else s prudishness.Featured image via twitter.",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Just Brutally DISMANTLED Ted Cruz For Knowingly Lying About Their Reporting (VIDEO),"There are many certainties in life. Grass is green. Water is wet. If you place an electric eel in your bathwater and climb in, the results will not be positive. Ted Cruz is a liar. Recently, Cruz played a trick even dirtier than sending out a campaign mailer falsely accusing Iowans of  voting violations  that feature  data  the campaign completely made up. Continuing his tradition of never telling the truth about a single thing, he convinced people rival Ben Carson had dropped out of the race. The press is reporting that Dr. Ben Carson is taking time off from the campaign trail after Iowa and making a big announcement next week,  Team Cruz said in a campaign email.  Please inform and Carson caucus goers of this news and urge them to caucus for Cruz. Cruz has, numerous times, cited faulty reporting by CNN as the reason his lackeys immediately began spreading the  news  that Dr. Brain had quit. In reality, the rumor came from Rep. Steve King, who retweeted a message from a CNN reporter and opined  Carson looks like he is out.  Carson had previously announced that he will be skipping New Hampshire, where he polls lower than even Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina, and South Carolina   the same state  that is currently building a multimillion dollar shrine to a shameful symbol of slavery. Here s what was actually said:Carson won t go to NH/SC, but instead will head home to Florida for some R&R. He ll be in DC Thursday for the National Prayer Breakfast.  Chris Moody (@moody) February 2, 2016One thing that is missing   quite notably   are the words  Carson is dropping out  or any variation thereof. There s not even a suggestion that Carson intended to drop out.  During coverage, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash called the news  unusual,  but made no suggestion that Carson was quitting. In fact, the very same tweet King and Cruz used to dupe people informs people who know how to read of his next campaign stop: the National Prayer Breakfast. Unfortunately, we re not exactly dealing with geniuses in the Cruz campaign. Last night when our political team saw the CNN post saying Dr. Carson was not carrying on to New Hampshire and South Carolina, our campaign updated the grassroots leaders just as we would with any breaking news story. That s fair game,  Cruz said in a statement following his crafty little ruse.  What the team should have done is send around the follow-up statement from the Carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out. That was a mistake from our end, and for that I apologize to Dr. Carson. Unfortunately, Cruz ignored some very crucial follow-up tweets that appear to be intended to clear things up for people who were too stupid to grasp the meaning of the initial tweet.At this point, it s clear to everyone but Ted Cruz that Cruz lied. Carson is going to skip two states that he stands no chance to win and instead relax in Florida. There s no mystery,  no controversy, no quitting. Cruz even grudgingly admitted that  CNN got it correct. My political team saw CNN s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television,  Cruz claimed, arguing that CNN had incorrectly reported that Carson was suspending his campaign   from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15,  and  didn t correct that story until 9:15 that night.  The Texas Senator s blatantly false claim prompted a scathing reply from CNN, who pointed out that Cruz s continued use of the narrative  was especially notable because Cruz had walked back his accusations against the network earlier this week and said,  CNN got it right.' In a statement, the network blasted Cruz s  astonishing  ability to commit to the lie: What Senator Cruz said tonight in the debate is categorically false. CNN never corrected its reporting because CNN never had anything to correct. The Cruz campaign s actions the night of the Iowa caucuses had nothing to do with CNN s reporting. The fact that Senator Cruz continues to knowingly mislead the voters about this is astonishing. It s amazing that Republicans are so willing to commit to their various lies even after reality destroys any illusion that they could be correct. From Carly Fiorina still clinging to her  baby parts  propaganda after the videos were shown to be heavily-edited right-wing propaganda and their creators indicted by a federal grand jury, to Cruz s remarks about Ben Carson and CNN, to pretty damn near everything that comes out of Donald Trump s mouth (though we do believe him when he says he wants to bang his daughter), the representatives of the Stupid Part of America carefully craft a bubble of their own reality   and refuse to leave it even when the facts threaten its existence.Watch CNN tear Cruz apart below: .@tomforemancnn fact-checks @tedcruz on his false claim about @CNN https://t.co/082mLVxpTs  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 7, 2016Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SNL’s ‘Bern Your Enthusiasm’ Explains How Bernie Sanders ACTUALLY Lost Iowa (VIDEO),"After this past Monday s Iowa Caucus where the results on the Democratic side were in a statistical dead heat, many were left wondering how Bernie Sanders couldn t seal the deal and left Hillary Clinton to walk away with the victory. Well, Saturday Night Live has filled in the gaps and explained what truly may have happened this past Monday in Iowa.SNL created  Bern Your Enthusiasm,  an obvious play on host Larry David s show Curb Your Enthusiasm. A show that is greatly missed, but that is neither her nor there. And on this week s episode of  Bern Your Enthusiasm,  it showed David as Sanders not fully committing to all his voters who presented themselves to him in precarious situations.Sanders didn t want to shake the hand of one Iowa voter because she sneezed into her hand right before she was about to greet the Senator, thus leaving her and her family just standing there angry. Then later, as Sanders went to get coffee, because he didn t want the 2% milk his office had for him, he refused to help another one of his voters in a medical emergency.Flash forward to the Caucus results, and it shows Sanders lose by .2% which his staff estimated was about five voters. In other words, the voters that he pissed off that day.It was the perfect hybrid of Curb Your Enthusiasm and the frustration Sanders must have felt that cold day in Iowa when he lost by just a few votes.Things might be looking up for Sanders in New Hampshire this coming Tuesday, but until then, at least this week s SNL will keep him warm with laughter as he heads back to New England from the Saturday Night Live set where he also had a cameo in another sketch.Watch here for Larry David s spot-on performance as Bernie Sanders:Video/Featured image from YouTube",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch The Hilarious GOP Debate Intro Fail (VIDEO),"Saturday s GOP debate got off to a hilarious start as candidates Ben Carson and Donald Trump both failed to appear on stage after their names were called.Video posted to YouTube by the Washington Free Beacon shows an obviously confused Ben Carson hovering off stage for several minutes, after he apparently failed to hear his name called during the introductions.At this point we see a man at the end of the hallway frantically gesturing to Carson to walk out onto the stage.After a long, awkward pause, during which the cameras were honed in on Carson, the announcer goes on to introduce Ted Cruz.Carson begins to walk toward the stage, then suddenly stops, realizing that it was Cruz s name, not his own, that was called.Carson moves further off stage, and Cruz walks past him, patting his arm.After Cruz takes to the stage, the man at the end of the hallway appears again. Yet again he can be seen waving wildly at Carson, prompting him to walk out.But nope. Carson remains dazed and confused.The announcer then calls Donald Trump.Trump saunters slowly around the corner, but he also fails to walk out on the stage.With Carson and Trump both hovering in the hall, the announcer goes on to introduce Marco Rubio.Rubio walks past both of the other candidates, as Trump stands awkwardly near Carson.Jeb Bush is called next. Bush glides right on past Trump and Carson, who clearly have no idea what they re supposed to doing.After all of the other candidates have finally taken to the stage, the moderators personally invite Carson to come out of the hallway.A moment later they call Donald Trump, noting that  he s standing back there as well. Trump misses it again. He finally gets it right the third time around.Watch the hilarious video, courtesy of the Washington Free Beacon on YouTube. Those who watch the GOP debates hoping for substance or serious policy discussion are sure to be disappointed, every time.But those of us who watch expecting nothing more than a good laugh are rarely disappointed.Image credit: video screen capture via Washington Free Beacon on YouTube",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas Trailer Park Shootout Leaves Four Dead After 19-Hour Standoff With Police,"At the beginning of the year, a new law went into effect in Texas authorizing  responsible gun owners  to carry their weapons around pretty much anywhere as long as they have gone through the incredibly easy process of obtaining a concealed carry permit. As the NRA tells us   constantly   these individuals, these  good guys with guns,  are ready to leap into action at the first sign of danger to protect the innocent from  bad guys with guns. Unfortunately, the problem is that the  good guys  often can become  bad guys  the moment they get a little bit angry  something we saw unfold on Friday and Saturday in Uvalde, Texas. Four people are dead after a 19-hour standoff with police at a trailer park.  It s a mess in there right now,  a Uvalde County Sheriff s Office deputy told News 4 San Antonio.Details are scarce, but police have announced that no officers were hurt in the battle with an unannounced number of gunmen and/or women. Uvalde County Sheriff s had responded to reports of shots fired at the trailer park. After police arrived, the suspects opened fire on responding officers   none of whom were hurt, fortunately. People in the trailer park and in neighboring homes were not permitted into the area while the blood battle between  good guys with guns  and police.Unfortunately, the mass proliferation of guns in the United States creates a situation where no one is ever truly safe   not in their homes, not in church, not walking down the street, or anywhere else. The lie that a  good guy with a gun  will save the day is a gross misrepresentation of reality. In fact, they re just as likely to score a headshot on the person they are  saving  as to actually save someone.While many argue that it s their right to carry their self-confidence on their hips, the fact is that keeping a gun around actually makes you less safe than having no gun at all  and then, of course, there s the chance that any  responsible gun owner  could snap at any time and start shooting. While it s true that we don t know what sparked this shootout, we can safely assume that the people who turned their guns on police surely thought of themselves as the  good guys.

 Ted Cruz’s College Roommate Just Won The Internet With His Brilliant #GOPdebate Trolling (TWEETS),"By now you have all heard that Republican candidate Ted Cruz is absolutely loathed by the people he attended college with   including his former roommate. Craig Mazin, a screenwriter who worked on films like Scary Movie 2 & 3, has an entire Twitter page dedicated to how much he hates Ted; it literally it goes back years. On Saturday night, Cruz s former roommate stepped up his trolling game and leveled attacks against all of the GOP candidates.Here s a sample of his trolling:Ted is listening to Carson and thinking,  What is this road? It is not a low road. It is a  high road? DO NOT UNDERSTAND.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016 Uhhh, someone played the same tape in Rubio s head.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016Maybe it s cuz I m from Jersey, but I enjoy Christie s swagger.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016 Okay, Christie  TOO MUCH JERSEY  declare victory and pull out!  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016I am enjoying President Cruz  plan to build a time machine and undo NK s missile plan.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016 Jeb ate his Wheaties this morning.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016The moderators know that Carson is still on the stage, right? Does Carson know he s still on the stage?  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016  I will deport them by forcing them to listen to my voice. They will flee that very night.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016Ted responds to  Maybe you have no heart  with a heartless, calculated chuckle.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016 This is amazing. Trump is attacking the crowd. It s almost admirable.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) February 7, 2016Mazin is my new hero. He was absolutely hilarious, and he was spot-on so many times. The New Hampshire debate was filled with so much bullsh*t it was hard to wade through it all. I literally screamed at my television several times, and at least twice it was Cruz who turned me into a demon. In one statement, the Iowa Caucus winner told the crowd that he did not believe that waterboarding fit the definition of torture. Seriously, he doesn t believe that putting a mask on someone and pouring water on their face to simulate drowning is torture. He doesn t believe that making someone think they are going to die over and over and over again is wrong. I guess that means he d be totally cool with a foreign government doing it to our citizens then? The second thing he said that really pissed me off was when he brought up his sister dying of a drug overdose. Wait, no. I m sorry his  half-sister  who died of a drug overdose. You see, he began his monologue about her horrible death by referring to her as his  sister,  but then he quickly corrected himself and made sure everyone knew that they had different mothers. So, he was exploiting her death, but also trying to distance himself from it. Pretty f*cking despicable. The rest of the candidates had the same kind of night. Unlike the other yellfests you could almost feel the desperation of candidates like Ben Carson and Jeb Bush who failed so miserably in Iowa. No matter how bad it was, though, Craig Mazin definitely provided us with some much-needed comedic relief. I hope he shows up for the next debate.

" As Poverty Soars In Michigan, Governor And Wife Eat Cake","On February 5, MLive posted a series of photos detailing Sue Snyder s birthday cake. For those who aren t aware, Sue Snyder is the wife of Michigan governor Rick Snyder.Considering the state s declining income levels and climbing poverty rates, its crumbling schools and failing infrastructure, not to mention the Flint water crisis, the cake is a grotesque display of luxury and opulence that has many Michigan residents fuming.image credit: MLiveAccording to MLive, it took 30 hours for local cake designer Heather Anne Leavitt to create the cake, which features a bag from Chanel, a box from Tiffany & Co., a diamond necklace, a box from Nordstrom, and a designer handbag bearing the Michael Kors logo.Leavitt refused to disclose the cost of the cake, saying only that her customers include  a lot of high end clients. In December, the U.S. Census Bureau released its most recent five year report on the status of Michigan residents.The data showed that poverty rates increased by nearly 20 percent under the leadership of Governor Rick Snyder. Two-thirds of the Michigan communities saw the number of people living at or below the federal poverty line increase between 2010 and 2014.Snyder was elected Governor of Michigan in 2010. He was reelected for a second term in 2014.During the same five year period, the median adjusted household income for Michigan citizens declined by 8.7 percent. Some areas of the state were hit harder than others.MLive reports:Among the state s largest cities as counted in the 2010 census, median household income fell 20 percent in Detroit, 8 percent in Grand Rapids, 15 percent in Warren, 11 percent in Sterling Heights and 14 percent in Lansing.In Ann Arbor, one of the few areas of the state that did not see a decline in median household income, the increase was a whopping 1 percent.According to the 2010   2014 Census data, more than one in six Michigan residents now lives in poverty.It s not just the rising poverty rate or declining household incomes that Michigan citizens are struggling with under the leadership of Rick Snyder.Snyder s austerity cuts have gutted vital services for the state s largest cities, including Detroit and Flint.Schools are crumbling and Michigan s infrastructure is in desperate need of repair.As if that isn t bad enough, 100,000 Flint residents have no access to clean, safe water, thanks to decisions made Governor Rick Snyder. In that city, 200 children under the age of six are confirmed to have irreversible lead poisoning. Another 9,000 are awaiting tests.At least 87 people have been sickened from exposure to waterborne bacteria. Ten of those people died from Legionnaires disease, an illness contracted by breathing in particles of contaminated water.It is grotesquely inappropriate for the governor and his wife to be dining on cake shaped like shopping bags, designer handbags and diamond jewelry, while the citizens of their state struggle to deal with the real life consequences of Snyder s destructive austerity policies.Not since the French revolution has a piece of cake been so symbolic of so many things.Featured image from MLive",News,"February 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Just Promised Torture Worse Than Waterboarding If Elected (VIDEO),"At this point, it could be said that Donald Trump is just trying to see how awful and extreme he can truly be. He s already got the bigot vote locked up, including white supremacists and those who really don t want Mexicans anywhere near the United States. Now, it seems he s also totally cool with torture to gain intelligence.Trump is totally trying to get us to believe that he will be incredibly tough on suspected terrorists or those who may hold valuable intelligence. Not only did he say that waterboarding is absolutely A-OK, but he s also insinuating that he s going to be even more extreme in regards to torture and interrogation. Ethics and Geneva Convention be damned, right?When asked what s worse than waterboarding by Los Angeles Times reporter Chris Megerian, Trump responded with: Uh, you ll find out. Umm  how evil does that sound?  You ll find out.  Holy crap. That could mean anything. And we have to wait until he s elected? Thank goodness that will never happen because Democrats will get their act together and unify behind one candidate if Trump or any GOP nominee is the candidate they are facing.The fact that a candidate for President of the United States is advocating torture is outright horrifying. We are better than that as a nation and we need to prove it on election day. What s worse than waterboarding?

 Man With History Of Mental Illness Was Able To Buy A Gun And Kill This Woman Who Told Him ‘No’,"Christopher O Kroley was a co-worker to Caroline Nosal. Christopher wanted Caroline as his girlfriend, but Caroline said no. Two days later, Christopher murdered her in the parking lot where they used to work, saying it was  easy  to kill her because she ruined his life.It wasn t just saying no one time. Caroline had to deal with harassment from Christopher over a period of time where he wouldn t take no for an answer. It got so bad that Caroline had to report his behavior to management, which in turn got Christopher suspended then eventually fired.Christopher admitted that he bought the gun right after he was fired, but waited a day before murdering Caroline because he wanted to practice using the gun. He shot her three times in the parking lot of the grocery store where they used to work together, when he found out her work schedule from a co-worker. After the murder, Christopher texted a co-worker,  I killed Caroline and I m about to kill myself, so don t be surprised when I don t respond anymore. Madison police officer Michele Walker got onto the scene quickly though, and exchanged gunfire with the murderer, resulting in him being taken alive instead of letting him finish his plan.This entire situation could have been prevented, if we only could take our gun laws seriously. A former girlfriend of Christopher said that he had a history of severe mental health issues, and attempted suicide once before in 2014. There is no excuse for a person with a history of severe mental illness and a suicide attempt being able to procure a firearm so easily. Not only did he get one, but he got one as if he was buying a loaf of bread at the local mini-mart. While it s true that a mandatory waiting period may not have stopped this, it certainly couldn t have hurt anything.Republicans keep squawking that we have to address the mental health issues in this country, but their  address it but cutting it  is yielding no results. If this gun was purchased with a background check, the mental health history was not flagged in the report. This is courtesy of the NRA. They literally do everything they can to block the things for which they keep calling. Perhaps the real spot we need to improve mental health is among Republicans, and then it would trickle down from there.Featured image from Huffington Post",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ten Lessons We Should Learn From The Flint Water Crisis (VIDEO),"On January 16, President Obama declared a federal emergency in the city of Flint, Michigan. The president s declaration was issued even as evidence mounted that officials in the state s government had willfully and knowingly allowed tens of thousands of Flint residents to consume poisoned water for more than a year.As a result of decisions made by Michigan governor Rick Snyder, 200 children under the age of six have been confirmed to have irreversible lead poisoning. As testing continues, another 9,000 children are likely to be diagnosed with elevated levels of lead in their blood.Emails and leaked documents from the Snyder administration show that the governor and his appointed emergency managers were aware of the problem with the city s water for more than a year.As Addicting Info reported here, an in-depth report by the ACLU of Michigan shows that state officials falsified documents and rigged tests, to purposely mislead the EPA regarding the amount of lead in Flint s water.In addition to poisoning thousands of people with lead, Michigan officials, including the governor and his hand-picked emergency managers, not only ignored a massive spike in cases of Legionnaires disease, but blocked attempts by health officials to determine the cause or take appropriate steps to protect public health.Ten people died from exposure to the waterborne Legionella bacteria.In spite of the fact that state officials knew that the water was likely contaminated with this deadly bacteria and poisoned with lead, they repeatedly assured Flint residents that it was safe to drink.While it is tempting to believe that what happened in Flint can t happen to any of us, the reality is that unless we learn from this unprecedented disaster, it not only can happen to us, it likely will.Here are the ten most important things that Americans must learn from the Flint water crisis.Michigan s emergency manager law, passed by the state s republican/Tea Party legislature and signed by Governor Rick Snyder, provides for the establishment of a puppet government across the state. The law gives Governor Snyder the legal authority to remove elected officials (democrats) and replace them with a single, unelected  manager. Every emergency manager in the state is hand-picked by the governor.The state s emergency managers are bestowed with unlimited power to make decisions on behalf of the local government. In the meantime, the people elected by the citizens are stripped of power, and their voices are silenced. In Flint, Detroit, Pontiac, Benton Harbor and elsewhere across the state of Michigan, local residents have been shut out of the decision-making process entirely.Make no mistake, the state s emergency manager law not only allowed the citizens of Flint to be poisoned, it allowed Snyder officials to cover up the contaminated water for more than a year.As republican governor Chris Christie advances a Michigan-style emergency manager law in New Jersey, it s vital that residents of Atlantic City understand how this law set the stage for the Flint water crisis.Flint is a horrifying example of what happens when right-wing extremists are allowed to make decisions that impact the lives of thousands of citizens.The decision to use the Flint river as a water source for the city was made by Snyder s appointed emergency manager in Flint, Ed Kurtz. There s also evidence that this decision came down directly from the governor s office.The story of how 100,000 people were poisoned by their own government is best understood in terms of right-wing ideology. The people who were charged with making decisions for Flint can be described as typical right-wing extremists. They are EPA-haters, regulation-opposers and Science deniers.These underlying beliefs allowed them to justify their illegal actions, both to each other and to themselves. To them, rigging tests, falsifying documents and flat-out lying to the environmental protection agency was just a way to get around the  evil EPA  with all its  oppressive, costly and unnecessary regulations. Did they believe that their actions would cause harm to tens of thousands of people? It s possible they did. But it s more likely that their underlying anti-federal government, anti-regulation ideology allowed them to convince themselves that their actions would not really harm anyone. These are people who really believed that  evil government regulations  only exist to oppress the free market, not protect the public.Those beliefs are exactly why politicians who subscribe to right-wing ideology can never, ever be trusted to make decisions that could potentially impact the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.A long list of people, all appointed by Michigan governor Rick Snyder, played a role in the Flint water crisis. All of them were uneducated, inexperienced and unqualified for the positions they were appointed to. Not a single person who played a role in the switch of the city s water source to the Flint river had any knowledge or experience in this area.Nowhere is that more evident in the fact that emergency manager Ed Kurtz eliminated the use of corrosion control, to save roughly $80.00 a day.That single uneducated decision virtually destroyed the city s infrastructure, and created the lead contamination Flint residents are facing today.To understand the level of ineptitude this plummets to, bear in mind that Flint is the only city in the United States that had no plan for corrosion control whatsoever.Corrosion control for all municipal water supplies is mandatory under the Safe Drinking Water Act.In order to cover-up for the fact that corrosion control was eliminated by Snyder appointed officials, state officials lied to the EPA.As reported by Dr. Marc Edwards of the Flint Water Study program here,On February 27th, 2015, MDEQ s Stephen Busch unequivocally and falsely responded to EPA that: The City of Flint Has an Optimized Corrosion Control Program <and> Conducts quarterly Water Quality Parameter monitoring at 25 sites and has not had any unusual results. This was a flat-out lie.It wasn t until much later that the EPA learned that Michigan officials had been deceiving the agency about the use of corrosion control in Flint.As MLive reported nearly a year later, EPA officials were stunned when they discovered the truth. I was stunned when I found out they did not have corrosion control in place,  Miguel A. Del Toral, regulations manager in the EPA s ground water and drinking water branch, said in an interview with The Flint Journal-MLive today, Jan. 21. In my head, I didn t believe that. I thought: That can t be true that s so basic. That s not possible. Unfortunately, it was possible.It was also the direct result of Governor Snyder appointing a list of unqualified, uneducated and inexperienced businessmen to be in charge of the city s water supply.A close examination of Michigan government shows what can happen when a single political party seizes control of all branches of government.The two-party system of government is essential to a healthy democracy. Not only is the system meant to safeguard against the kind of dictatorship being imposed in Michigan, but a second party with at least some amount of political power is necessary to keep government in check.In Michigan, the right wing has virtually succeeded in suppressing any voice that is not its own.Michigan s single party rule has eliminated from government anyone that could reasonably be expected to investigate corruption or hold state officials accountable for their actions.Michigan has a right-wing Attorney General, Secretary of State and Governor, along with a legislature that is entirely controlled by Tea Party and republican representatives. There is virtually no  other party  with any power in Michigan. Because of that, there is no-one to act as a watchdog for state government and there is no-one to hold state officials accountable.When Attorney General Bill Schuette finally announced an investigation into the Flint water crisis, Michigan residents laughed. No-one was surprised when Scheutte chose a private lawyer, who is not accountable to the public, to conduct the investigation. Nor was anyone surprised when it was revealed that the recently hired investigator is a republican party donor, who helped elect Rick Snyder.As Democracy Web explains it:There are ideological movements that reject the central tenets of multiparty electoral democracy but exploit the system s freedoms and processes to seek power. These include fascism, communism, and some forms of religious fundamentalism and ethnic or racial nationalism. Generally, parties with such ideologies use a utopian vision for the future to justify the imposition of a dictatorship once they reach government. While other parties are sometimes allowed to exist under their rule, real political power is exercised solely by the governing party. In these single-party systems, the ruling party is also a source of patronage, the main vehicle for personal advancement in politics and society, and a mechanism for strictly enforcing conformity to the dominant ideology. Underground parties or movements often organize against such regimes, but these are subject to severe repression.The Flint water crisis could not have happened without this total imbalance of power in the state s government.Michigan citizens apparently voted for Rick Snyder because of his  business experience.  That was their first mistake.Snyder s experience as a venture capitalist and corporate CEO did not make him more qualified to govern a state. If anything, it made him less qualified.Throughout his career, Snyder has been driven by the corporate doctrine of shareholder profit above all else. The only thing considered  unethical  in the corporate world is losing money.We got a first-hand glimpse into the corporate decision making process in 1968. That year leaked documents showed that the Ford Motor Company had compared the cost of recalling the company s Pinto to the cost of letting people die when the car s engine exploded. The company s analysis showed that it would be cheaper to let people die than to recall the car. So they did.Corporate ethics revolve around doing whatever you can get away with to protect or increase shareholder profits. This is the world that CEO s like Governor Rick Snyder live in.In relation to Flint, the media narrative has been that the source of Flint s drinking water was switched to the Flint river to  save the city money.  This narrative is simply not true.A feasibility study ordered by former Michigan State Treasurer Andy Dillon showed that switching the source of Flint s water would cost the city more. That report was thrown out by state officials.Emails released earlier this month, however, verify that it would have saved Flint hundreds of thousands dollars to stay with the Detroit Water and Sewer, even in the best case scenario.After the switch, Flint residents experienced a massive hike in their water rates. The increase in cost left many citizens unable to afford to keep water on in their homes. But those citizens who lost access to Flint s poisoned water may have been the lucky ones.If Snyder considered the citizens of Michigan his  shareholders  than none of these decisions make sense. He wasn t saving the city money as he repeatedly claimed. He wasn t doing the citizens of Flint any favors, either.But Snyder s decisions were never based on what was best for the city of Flint, nor the residents of that city.There s a whole different set of  shareholders  whose identities are not yet known.These are the people who Michigan s emergency manager law was set up to benefit.The law is formally known as Public Act 436. Embedded in the text of this law is the provision for state emergency managers to receive unlimited amounts of private cash.Section 141.1549 (f) reads:In addition to the salary provided to an emergency manager in a contract approved by the state treasurer under subdivision (e), this state may receive and distribute private funds to an emergency manager. As used in this subdivision,  private funds  means any money the state receives for the purpose of allocating additional salary to an emergency manager.Snyder set up a fund for these secret private donors, which he originally called the NERD fund. Cash was transferred through this fund directly into the pockets of Snyder s emergency managers.After a public outcry over the NERD fund, Snyder told the citizens of Michigan that it had been eliminated. That was another lie.Snyder simply changed the name of the slush fund from the NERD fund to the Moving Michigan Forward Fund.The same unnamed donors who have been lining the pockets of Michigan emergency managers for several years, are now footing the bill for Snyder s recently hired PR firms.Watch this video from WXYZ.The FBI and the Department of Justice criminal division are now investigating the Flint water crisis. Let s be clear, without the hope of an independent, outside investigation by federal authorities, Michigan citizens would be left without recourse.Michigan is one of two states in the country which exempts the governor and all state lawmakers from Freedom of Information requests.Any government that goes to these lengths to hide what it is doing from the public is a government that cannot and should not be trusted.Right wing lawmakers have no desire to make government work. They work to make government fail. Nowhere is that clearer than in the state of Michigan, where Snyder s appointed officials repeatedly broke federal laws, with devastating consequences. It s no surprise that republicans are now trying to use the Flint water crisis as proof that  government doesn t work. There s nothing more dangerous to a corrupt government than an informed and involved citizenry.Being informed doesn t mean getting your news and information from the same source or sources all of the time, either.Sometimes being informed just means talking to other people, reaching across the aisles and stepping outside of your usual comfort zone.The people of Flint tried for more than a year to get the public s attention. We should ask ourselves why we didn t listen sooner.If we are to make sure that what happened in Flint never happens anywhere again, then we have to decide that we will not let factors like income or race or political affiliation determine whether or not we are willing to listen to our fellow citizens.If we can learn anything from the Flint water crisis, it s how important it is for each and every one of us to use our voting rights now. If we don t, we can (and almost surely will) lose them later.Right-wing politicians like Rick Snyder do not believe in democracy. They do not support your right to vote, nor your right to participate in government.Make no mistake, the only rights the people of Michigan have left are those which are protected by the federal government. At the state level, the right-wing legislature has removed the people s ability to participate in local government. These same lawmakers virtually eliminated the citizen s ability to recall their elected officials. They have also made it impossible for the voters to repeal legislation.This is what the far-right has accomplished in Michigan in just a few short years.Imagine what they will do if they gain complete control of the federal government These are certainly not the only lessons we should learn from the Flint water crisis. But if we all just learn these ten, and we truly take them to heart, our society will be so much better off going into the 2016 election.

" Jeb Bush Receives Worst Endorsement Ever, Definitely Does NOT Want Anyone To Clap","Jeb Bush is desperate for people to support him and his fledgling campaign for the presidency, but he probably wishes the latest supporter of his campaign had kept his endorsement to himself.As you may recall, Jeb s brother George nearly destroyed the economy back in 2008 all while giving ridiculous tax breaks to the wealthy pricks who helped him crash it.Jeb Bush hasn t exactly been touting W s economic record, but one hedge-funder who has since become one of the most hated corporate tools in America is touting his support for Jeb s campaign.Last year, Jeb s biggest fan hiked the price of a crucial AIDS medication known as Daraprim to $750 a pill, a 5,000 percent increase from its original price, thereby guaranteeing that only rich patients would be able to afford the drug without fearing bankruptcy.Ferret face then went on television to defend the price hike in the most dickish way possible as if he s helping people by raising the price.And most recently, the greedy douchebag has been arrested by federal authorities for securities fraud and repeatedly dodged questions by lawmakers after being subpoenaed by Congress.As you have probably figured out, the Jeb endorser described is none other than professional asshole Martin Shkreli.Shkreli took to Twitter on Friday and posted a brief message announcing his support of the former Florida Governor who had to beg people to clap during a recent rally.@JebBush i m an avid supporter  Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) February 6, 2016Perhaps even more embarrassing if the fact that Shkreli rescinded his endorsement less than 24 hours later by blaming his alleged date for posting the tweet as a joke. My date made the tweet about Jeb Bush as a joke. I don t follow politics except for having a profound hatred for all politicians.  Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) February 7, 2016This creates a couple questions. First, who in this world would date a total asshole who screws around with people s healthcare? And second, how pathetic must Jeb Bush be if the only endorsement he can get is a fake one by the most hated man in America?",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michigan Republicans Pass Bill That Would Put Gay AND Straight Couples In Prison,"Conservative lawmakers are far too obsessed with how people have sex.In defiance of the Supreme Court, Michigan Republicans have passed a bill that makes oral and anal sex felonies punishable by up to 15 years in prison.State Senator Rick Jones, an old white right-wing guy who is apparently angry about all the sex he s not having, added the anti-sex language to SB 219, which is supposed to be an animal protection bill, included in a larger package of bills known as Logan s Law.Logan s Law is designed to block convicted animal abusers from owning any pets for five years, but Jones couldn t wait to use the bill to push his own belief that consenting adults who have oral and anal sex should be left to rot in a jail cell. He slipped in language revising the unconstitutional anti-sodomy law near the very end of the bill in a move that Jones probably hoped would go unnoticed.Here s a screenshot of Section 158 of Senate Bill 219.Despite calls for Jones to remove the section, he claims that to do so would hurt the animal protection bill as a whole. The minute I cross that line and I start talking about the other stuff, I won t even get another hearing. It ll be done,  Jones said.  Nobody wants to touch it. I would rather not even bring up the topic, because I know what would happen. You d get both sides screaming and you end up with a big fight that s not needed because it s unconstitutional. But Jones is the one who crossed the line in the first place by sneaking in his dream of outlawing oral and anal sex between humans into an animal protection bill. He s the one who willingly put the overall bill in jeopardy.Jones went on to claim that he believes the only way to repeal the sodomy ban is if the state passes a bill to do so, which he says he could  probably  vote for.The Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws in 2003, but conservatives across the country have been fighting to keep the laws on the books ever since. That includes Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia who tried to outlaw  carnal knowledge  between married couples in 2013 as he failed to become the state s governor.And just like Cuccinelli, it appears Jones is trying to insert Christian fundamentalist law into the civil law, which would create a legal clusterf*ck in this country since it would destroy privacy. In order to enforce such a law, it would take millions upon millions of dollars, a spying program, and a cop in every household to make sure women and men are only doing it missionary style and that their reproductive organs are in the place where they believe God intended them to be.In short, whenever Republicans say they support smaller government, they are full of shit, and so is Rick Jones. But I bet Justice Scalia is totally behind him all the way.

 Here’s The One Thing That Scares Trump And His Racist Followers (VIDEO),"We are all aware by now of Donald Trump s racist rhetoric. One young but very intelligent and articulate student understands how the media can at times sensationalize everything, so he decided to see for himself by attending a Trump rally. His findings were not surprising: Trump s followers are very racist. James Patterson, whose high school assignment was for him to volunteer at Trump s campaign as part of a student-based civics activity, perfectly analyzes the Trump phenomenon and he exemplifies what racists are afraid of: The baseline of his campaign is to make America white again. It speaks to fundamentalist Christian, white middle class Americans who feel like their power has been taken. Even though that s a false accusation, they feel like because minorities are making strides that they re losing power. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh8VGKqqunA]Patterson was also stunned to see just how many people actually support Donald Trump. He said: That s the scary part about the Trump campaign, they re everyday people, people we work with, people at schools, people who hold these resentments. As an African American, that s very scary  that I can talk to somebody and they can hate me because of my skin color. Patterson said that what concerned him the most was how nice people pretended to be to him, yet they were in favor of Trump s racist policies, policies that have come out against minority populations, specifically Muslims and Mexicans: They were very friendly, they were normal people but in the back of their mind, and openly, they were advocating for Trump s policies which are inherently exclusive for people who look like me. However, as he made his way through the crowd, Patterson said that the pretense of friendliness went away and he could feel the hostility: When I would bump into various members of the crowd, there were hostile looks when I would attempt to excuse myself. Many people in the crowd looked me up and down as I was walking. If I had to describe the feeling it would be that of isolation. This all reminded Patterson of what he s made to feel like as an African American in this country. The difference with Trump and his followers is that they normalize all this and make it fine.The most effective response to Trump and his racist army is for minorities to continue the march toward self-empowerment through education and activism. This young man is an excellent example and an effective counter punch to the racists.

 REVEALED: One Of Hillary Clinton’s Goldman Sachs Speeches (VIDEO),"For weeks, if not months, if not decades, those trying to highlight Hillary s connection to Wall Street have been focused on her relationship with Goldman Sachs and how much she was paid to speak for them. Transcripts of those speeches have also been requested. Well, here is one of those speeches.Clinton can be seen here on October 22, 2014 speaking in front of a large Goldman Sachs audience. However, she s not talking about giving them breaks or handouts or favors, she s proving the case for women entrepreneurs. As much as Wall Street NEEDS to be reined in and made to pay their fair share in taxes as well as be properly regulated, we need to also remember that there can be some good that comes out of companies with a lot of money. Clinton, recognizing this, has been trying to help raise capital to support women in business. Which, in 2014, was looking to raise up to $600 million in support of female entrepreneurs.This video, featuring Hillary making the case for women in business, which was before she decided to run for president, has the caption: The event featured a keynote address from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the business case for empowering women to ensure future economic growth. Pretty evil, right? Probably just another backhanded scheme to  eh, enough of the conspiracy theories.Clinton, during her speech stated: The work that we are doing is work that is absolutely essential for global economic growth. Followed by: There is no path forward that does not include the empowerment of women. As far as speaking fees, her fees were pretty standard for most any highly distinguished speaker, so when she responds with,  that s what they offered  and being a former First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State, it makes sense to pay her as much as they did, as obscene as that amount may seem.Clinton was speaking on behalf of women worldwide and trying to open doors to accessible capital to start businesses and advance gender equity as well as economic equality.Here s her speech in full: Video/Featured image from YouTube",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Responsible’ Texas Father Shoots His 9-Year-Old Daughter While Showing Her His Gun,"Republicans talk a good game about their supporters being  responsible gun owners.  As a matter of fact, to listen to them you d almost believe that every gun owner in America is super responsible, only concerned about protecting themselves and their family. However, when you turn on the news it becomes very obvious that this isn t the case at all. Actually, more often than not we hear stories that sound a little something like this one out of Texas.A 9-year-old girl who was wounded when a 9-mm gun her father was showing her discharged was in critical condition Friday in a Temple hospital. The girl, whose name has not been released, was struck in the left shoulder in the shooting at around 9:30 p.m. Thursday One officer said authorities believe the shooting was accidental.Let me be clear: A gun does not just discharge. Period.This ammosexual was showing off his gun to his 9-year-old daughter and he shot her because he is a f*cking idiot who does not know how to handle a gun. He didn t look to make sure there was not a bullet in the chamber of this gun he thought was so awesome.The same people who say that all of their supporters are  responsible  also say that we want to take their guns away. First of all, we don t but if we did could you blame us? According to Every Town, a gun control advocacy group:From December 2012 to December 2013, at least 100 children were killed in unintentional shootings   almost two each week, 61 percent higher than federal data reflect. And even this larger number reflects just a fraction of the total number of children injured or killed with guns in the U.S. each year, regardless of the intent.That s an astronomical amount of kids and the right-wing thinks there isn t a problem in this country. When hundreds of our kids are dying and thousands of adults are meeting the same fate in what is arguably the most powerful nation on earth, we clearly have an issue. What s worse is that the vast majority of  accidental  shootings could be prevented if people, like this father, just used common sense and took a safety course.

 The Right Celebrated Trayvon Martin’s Birthday…By Being Disgusting A-Holes (SCREENSHOTS),"The story of Trayvon Martin may be one of the saddest we as liberals have ever had to endure. Harassed and profiled because of the color of his skin, Trayvon was murdered by a man who had no business following him from a local store where he had just partaken in the nefarious business of purchasing an iced tea and some Skittles.We then had to watch as his murderer, George The Animal Zimmerman, got off scot-free, only to lead a despicable life of domestic abuse and more weapons charges. As if that weren t bad enough, we had to endure the gloating from the right-wingers, proud of their champion for murdering a teenage  thug  in cold blood because he defended himself against the man who was stalking him with a loaded gun.Friday was Trayvon s birthday. He would have been 21 years old. His life hadn t yet begun, but because he was black and wearing a hoodie, he was fair game for a lunatic. When Trayvon s birthday arrived we were reminded of the heinous crime that took his life for no reason as we saw memorials and tributes come across our newsfeeds. The right, being the insufferable a-holes that they are, couldn t help but take yet another opportunity to gloat.Ben Shapiro, big shot right-wing blogger for such  reputable  propaganda mills as Breitbart and The Daily Caller, decided to use his Twitter account to remind us of his official position in life as douchebag extraordinaire:Trayvon Martin would have turned 21 today if he hadn't taken a man's head and beaten it on the pavement before being shot.  Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) February 5, 2016No, jackass. Trayvon would have turned 21 had he not been followed for no reason and accosted, forcing him to defend himself from an armed lunatic because he was guilty of walking while black.John Nolte, another Breitbart loser, decided to join in the festivities of rubbing a family s noses in the death of their loved one.:Had he not tried to smash the wrong man's head in Trayvon Martin would've turned 21 today.  John Nolte (@NolteNC) February 5, 2016Maybe if he had just been loft alone too walk home and watch some TV with his soft drink and candy, dumbasses like you wouldn t be able to consider a complete tool like George Zimmerman  the right man. These idiots sparked a slew of sentiments from across the conservative world, each more disgusting than the last. Here s the perfect example:Twitter is sponsoring an ""In Memoriam"" of Trayvon Martin. Disgusting. Celebrating thug culture.  andieiam (@andieiamwhoiam) February 5, 2016That s right, kids. According to the right, as long as you re black, you re a thug. Trayvon was a kid minding his own business, but he was black. Thug. He was carrying dangerous candy and a drink. Thug. When confronted he didn t back dow but fought for his own safety. Thus. Then he was shot by a madman for walking while black in the wrong neighborhood. Thug.It wood be so much easier if they would just be honest and go back to using the N-word.Featured image from Twitter ",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Jeb Bush Brings Mom To Rally, Cracks Awkward Joke About Her Abusing Him As A Child (VIDEO)","Barbara Bush recently accompanied her youngest son to a campaign rally in New Hampshire, and judging from his performance she probably wishes she d stayed home! Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush tried to make a joke about his childhood and instead turned it into an incredibly awkward moment for his entire family. Even worse, he made his mother look like a child abuser.Talking to his supporters, Jeb commented on how many people tell him how much they love his mother. Jeb s mother smiles in the audience, but quickly starts to look uncomfortable as she hears her son say,  She s not as great as everybody thinks she is. I can tell you that one.  He continued: I jokingly say, that when we were growing up in Midland and Houston that mom was fortunate not to have a child abuse hotline available, because the discipline of learning right and wrong was her doing. Jeb then goes on about how amazing of a man his father, former president George H. W. Bush, was   and almost chokes up while doing so. You can watch this disaster of a family moment play out below: Bush has told awkward stories about his family before   even about the father he speak so favorably about. Last year, Bush disturbed a bunch of middle schoolers by venting to them about how his fear of disappointing his father would send him into a  deep depression for days. And to this day, it seems that Bush is still reliving his childhood struggles. Last night, Bush and his mother gave an interview with CNN, which resulted in even more crippling family criticism. During the interview, Bush s mother actually started giving Jeb advice on how he should be running for President, and shamelessly pointed out his weaknesses. Accusing the media of not mentioning Jeb nearly as much as the other GOP candidates because he is a  non-person,  she said that Jeb was too nice,  too polite  and needed to interrupt more. As this was happening, Jeb looked completely defeated and helplessly sat in silence.Featured image via Gage Skidmore and CBS screenshot",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher Slays Ted Cruz And GOP Science Deniers With Amazingly Hilarious Groundhog Day Ad (VIDEO),"There s been a meme spreading across social media that says  Only in America do we accept weather predictions from a rodent but deny climate change evidence from scientists. Sadly, that meme is more accurate than Punxsutawney Phil could ever hope to be as conservatives continue to deny climate science outright as they flock to see if a groundhog sees his shadow or not to predict an early spring or more winter.Of course, groundhogs are not scientifically accurate at all. It s a complete myth that they can forecast the weather. This is explained particularly well by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who put together a nice chart comparing Phil s predictions with the actual temperatures that occurred following them. From 1988-2015, NOAA found that,  The table shows no predictive skill for the groundhog during the most recent years of this analysis. While Groundhog Day is a way to have a little fun at mid-winter, climate records and statistics tell us that winter probably isn t over. Climatologically speaking, the three coldest months of the year are December, January, and February, so winter typically still has a bit to go when the groundhog comes out in search of his shadow on February 2. And that s why Bill Maher had a field day on Friday mocking conservative climate science deniers with a hilarious attack ad aimed particularly at Ted Cruz.Maher noted that Groundhog Day fell on the same day as the Iowa caucus vote, and said that because Punxsutawney Phil predicted warmer weather,  naturally, conservatives now think that Punxsutawney Phil is in the tank with the liberals on global warming. They re crazy about this issue,  Maher said, which is why he introduced an ad mocking climate science deniers in which conservatives attack Phil for being just another scientist propped up by liberal media. The ad also took a masterful shot at Iowa winner Ted Cruz.Here s the video via YouTube:Conservatives probably are crazy enough to believe that a groundhog can predict weather and they are certainly crazy enough to attack the groundhog for predicting warmer weather. But not believing actual science is truly crazy and it s the kind of crazy that is dangerous as Republicans continue to ignore that many of our coastal cities are going to be under water if we don t act.

 ‘Millennials Rising’ Republican Super PAC Almost Entirely Funded By One 72-Year-Old White Guy,"If there is one thing that s immediately clear by attending a Republican presidential rally or looking at the demographics of Fox News it s that the modern Republican Party is not so  modern  after all. They are old. And each year, they lose more of their supporters to Father Time, while being replaced by a far more progressive youth.Understanding the basic math of this problem can sends shivers down the spine of a Republican political operative. How can they expect to compete with the Democratic Party with their supporters entering their 70s? Sadly, the most obvious answer   update your archaic policy positions, stupid!   never occurs to them. Instead, they are going to try to  fake it.  They ll pretend to be cool.One shot at this sad new attempt to cling onto relevancy comes in the form of  Millennials Rising,  a conservative Super PAC that aims to show the youth that the Republican Party can be  hip  and  dope  and  on fleek.  Their ads are pathetic as they sound.Here s one supporting Jeb Bush:Seems like it was made by an old guy desperately trying to figure out what is cool, right? That s because it kind of was.In an investigation by The Intercept, reporters found that  Millinnials Rising  is 95 percent funded by old rich guys. The principle backer is a 72-year-old billionaire who  earned  his fortune by being the grandson of an oil baron.Of the $54,960 total raised by the Super PAC, $50,000, or 91 percent, comes from the snowy-haired, 72-year-old billionaire Robert A. Day. He is the grandson of Superior Oil founder William Myron Keck and a former investment manager. Day has also given $1 million to the pro-Bush Super PAC Right to Rise.The rest of the Super PAC s backers are all about equally far into their golden years.Zooming out, the silliness of a bunch of rich old guys funding a Super PAC intended for 18-year-olds is exactly why the Republican Party is such a mess. Rather than come to accept that things like homophobia and regressive social safety net positions are out of sync with where America   especially its young people   are at, they try to throw money at the problem. Unfortunately, all the Instagram filters and Vine loops in the world can t convince young people that Republicans aren t the party of backwards policies.To give us a sense of what is coming, Mitt Romney desperately tried to win the  Millennial  vote in 2012 by throwing a fortune into ads at them   he still lost them 2 to 1.Obama easily won the youth vote nationally, 67 percent to 30 percent, with young voters proving the decisive difference in Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, according to an analysis by the Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.It wasn t even close.Feature image via YouTube",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ROFL: An Adult Film Company Just Offered To Make Ted Cruz’s Bizarre Dreams Come True (Letter),"A video that recently surfaced of a young Ted Cruz has raised some eyebrows. The creepy little Cruz, aside from declaring his aspirations to be rich, powerful and to take over the world, also expressed an interest in making a  teen tit film,  because he s the perfect Christian. Yes, your sarcasm alarm went off for a reason.Well now Ted Cruz has been given the opportunity to make his dream come true, thanks to adult film giant, Vivid Entertainment. Big shot at Vivid, Steve Hirsch, has extended an offer for Cruz to star in his very own XXX movie that would most certainly be quite a tad more risqu than an 80 s  tit film.  Hirsh offered to send $1 million to the super PAC of Cruz s choice in exchange for his services.This letter to Senator Cruz, obtained by TMZ, lays out the offer, along with a suggested headline for the film, which is nothing short of brilliant and hilarious:Courtesy of TMZThe crack about his home country was a great touch. This is what is called trolling the turd. Mockery at its finest. Ted Cruz, fast becoming the most hated man in Washington, deserves every bit of ridicule he gets.

 Super Bowl QB Peyton Manning Bankrolling This GOP Presidential Candidate (IMAGE),"When you sit down to watch the Super Bowl contest between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers, you may want to know that the man leading Denver to the field is a hardcore right-wing Republican.Peyton Manning, the Broncos quarterback and former superstar for the Indianapolis Colts, doesn t just occasionally donate to the Republican Party. In fact, Manning is a maxed out contributor to Jeb Bush s 2016 presidential campaign.In October of 2015 it was revealed that Manning donated $2,700 to Bush s campaign, the most an individual can contribute. While Manning may want his money back based on how the Bush campaign has underperformed so far, it s part of a pattern for the veteran player, who has often contributed to the Republican cause.Over the last ten years, Manning has donated $22,400 to political campaigns, all of that to conservative Republicans. He gave $10,200 to Senator Bob Corker, from Tennessee. Manning was a superstar player for the Tennessee Volunteers. Manning also gave money to Dick Lugar, who served as a senator for Indiana, around the same time Manning played for the Colts.At the presidential level, Manning gave money to George W. Bush in 2004, and was a maxed-out $5,000 donor to Mitt Romney s failed 2012 presidential campaign.Manning s wife Ashley joined her husband in supporting Republicans. According to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, she donated to Senator Corker as well, and also gave to Jeb Bush. Between the two Mannings, she was the only one to ever donate to a Democrat, former Senator Mary Landrieu, who hailed from Manning s birth state of Louisiana.His brother, Eli, the New York Giants quarterback, is also a maxed-out Jeb Bush donor.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Broncos have donated $112,475 to conservative candidates and political committees. By comparison the Carolina Panthers have given $21,000 to support the right. While both teams have also contributed to liberal candidates, the numbers are much smaller   $3,500 for the Broncos, $4,000 for the Panthers.Unlike Manning, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has not been a political donor.Overall the NFL leans heavily in favor of Republican donors, most of that money coming from the billionaire owners who own the teams.Featured image via Flickr",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Bill Maher Doesn’t Hold Back Defending Bernie Sanders On Foreign Policy,"During a segment of Real Time with Bill Maher, the comedic host went all out in his defense of Bernie Sanders  foreign policy experience.During the segment, the lefties at the table agreed that Sanders is excellent on economic issues. Though some seemed skeptical that Sanders has the same grasp of foreign policy issues.  Maher was asked by MSNBC s Alex Wagner if he seriously thinks that Sanders is fit to lead the nation as president when it comes to foreign policy matters. Wagner asks Maher: Do you want Bernie Sanders getting off Air Force One, making a deal on foreign police with ? Do you think he s at the level that we need? Maher responds to Wagner s question, saying: Fuck yeah! The guy who voted right on the Iraq war? Yea, I do. Then, Armstrong Williams, an advisor for Ben Carson, decided to chime in. Williams implies that it doesn t actually matter how well Sanders knows foreign policy. That s because Sanders would be surrounded by experts.Maher says that might be good enough for Carson, who once repeatedly and publicly referred to Hamas, as  Hummus.  Maher recounts the time that Carson said that we need to build a coalition of Arab nations, in order to combat the Islamic State. When asked what nations he would have been a part of this coalition, Carson couldn t name a single nation.The idea that Sanders wouldn t be strong on foreign policy issues is ridiculous. Both Hillary Clinton and Sanders, have not been extremely illustrative about their views on foreign policy. That might have to do with the fact that Democrats are not that passionate about foreign policy issues this election cycle. There may be a few areas where the two candidates diverge, though, they both seem to mainly differentiate themselves by tone on issues like the Islamic State.You can watch the segment from the show, below.https://youtu.be/62YiMIGmAdc?t=4s Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube.",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Modern Medicine Explains Why Your Desire To Punch Ted Cruz In The Face Is Completely Natural,"Germans call it Backpfeifengesicht. It s a colloquialism which translated means  a face that needs to be hit.  However, you don t need to be German to want to punch Ted Cruz in the face. While there hasn t been any formal polling on the question, I personally would feel safe wagering money on it being over 50 percent of America. But what does this all mean? Are we a nation of unreasonable bullies for wanting this?Doctor Richard Cytowic has taken some time to explain to America why they are not a nation of bad people for their burning desire to smash a knuckle sandwich into Ted Cruz s jaw. It turns out this is all a very natural and very scientific thing we are experiencing.While I would never actually suggest someone would do something like punch Ted Cruz in the face (I m not suggesting they don t either), the feeling that you want to means you are operating at a normal mental state   so just enjoy the feeling and embrace it within reason.Dr. Cytowic explained that humans learn to read facial expressions from the day they are born. It s one of our most rudimentary and instinctual means of communication. Our brains have had a million years of practice at reading facial expressions, generating an instant like or dislike of the person that they are attached to. To put it more simply, it s an evolutionary survival trait to determine friend from foe, and our brains are extremely good at it by now.With this in mind, it explains a lot about why practically everyone hates Ted Cruz. It isn t just his policy. There are oodles of idiot Republicans we could hate for that same reason. Ted brings out a more visceral and emotional reaction, unlike most others. Even among his fellow Republicans nobody likes him, and that says a lot.Dr. Cytowic goes on to describe how Cruz s facial expressions do not shift the way normal Human expression does. He has rarely observed a normal smile from Ted Cruz. In a normal smile the corners of the mouth go up, and the muscles circling the eyes contract making them narrow and forming crow s feet at the outside corners. When it comes to Ted, his mouth just tightens into a straight line, and on the rare occasion that it deviates from this, the corners bend downward.  The outside of his eyes bend downward as well, which is completely opposite of what is normal, as the eyebrows typically bend upwards.To put it simply, Ted Cruz has a look of disgust on his face that only gets worse when he tries to look happy and smile. It s like he is some kind of anti-politician, because you would think that someone who has his kind of fan base would naturally be able to express themselves more pleasantly. So remember, when you see Ted on TV and you want to throw something at the screen, it means you re ok because it s only natural.Featured image from Twitter ",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" White Supremacist Trump Fans Are Calling People, Then Leaving This Message (VIDEO)","It has been well documented that Donald Trump s presidential campaign has been endorsed by multiple white supremacist groups. One of the groups supporting Trump is the American National Super PAC. A branch of the organization, the American Freedom Party, is directing a new robocalling effort to try and connect their message with voters. They called Iowans before their caucus, and they are now calling voters in New Hampshire.Here is the message people are hearing when they answer their phones: We don t need Muslims. We need smart, educated, white people. I am a farmer and white nationalist. Support Donald Trump. Here is a video that lets you hear the three different voices that have contributed to the message.https://www.facebook.com/cnnpolitics/videos/1068444389864060/?fref=nfOne of those voices is that of Jarod Taylor. Tayler is well known white supremacist leader. He is the editor of the white nationalist media outlet, AmRen. Taylor has ties to various white supremacist organizations and has been very vocal in his support for Trump. During a segment on CNN, Taylor attempted to justify his views, saying: Why would we want more Muslims? Muslims have been a terrible problem for Europe, and here they want to pray five times a day, stop the assembly line, they want foot baths before they go to prayer, they want women-only swimming pool hours, and some of them want to kill us! Why should anyone want more Muslims? Trump has denounced the endorsement by the group. That being said, it isn t surprising that hate groups have latched on to Trump s campaign. So far his campaign has been largely built by exploiting the anti-brown hatred held by many conservatives.The trend has been that as more GOP candidates drop out of the race, their followers flock to Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. So, it seems like Taylor and this group of racist friends may have backed the wrong horse to drive home their  white advocacy  agenda. Despite getting the media attention, Trump s stance on immigration is only nominally different that Iowa GOP caucus winner, Ted Cruz. Since the group s efforts appear to only be hurting Trump, let s hope the group decides to keep up their efforts, backing whoever eventually gets the nomination, in the general election.Featured image from video screenshot via Facebook",News,"February 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jeb Bush Confronted On Why He Wanted Rubio For VP In 2012 – Gives Worst Answer EVER (VIDEO),"Jeb Bush is campaigning against Marco Rubio   we all get that. When a person becomes your rival in a presidential contest, all the gloves come off. Yet   you d think the arguments presented would be somewhat in line with what that candidate s own thoughts were in the past. Not so in this case.Jeb Bush is trying to say Marco Rubio is  inexperienced,  but when confronted on why he recommended Senator Rubio to be Romney s Vice Presidential choice back in 2012, Bush became visibly flabbergasted.Here was the exchange between him and Fox News Bret Baier:Bret: Well, (Rubio) had enough experience that you recommended him for Vice President when Mitt Romney was looking.Jeb: Yeah, except he doesn t have the experience to make a tough decision.Bret: But, why recommend him for Vice President then if he didn t have the experience back then?Jeb: Because he would have earned it.What does that even mean? Look   it s obvious Jeb is trying to wiggle his way out of this one, and on that front he failed, big time.For some more context on this, here was what Jeb said back when Romney was still mulling over his options for VP: Look   he has more experience than Barack Obama had when he ran. And the practical experience   he s certainly got the intelligent acumen and fortitude to be a good president and I have a special place in my heart for him. It s hard to describe the pride I have for his incredible success and how he has moved in to the job of being a U.S. senator with humility, not trying to be an arrogant guy, to learn the trade if you will. And people in Washington really admire him. Those are some very kind words. Not only that, but Bush even went further in another interview with Newsmax in April of 2012, when he said Rubio was  probably the best choice  out of every potential candidate. For Bush to now try to play the experience card is just absurd. He picked the wrong battle to fight on this one. This is just another reason people don t trust anything politicians say.Featured image from video screen capture.",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hyperventilating Christians Freak Out Over Ban On Prayer At Phoenix City Council Meetings (VIDEO),"The Satanic Temple just forced a total shutdown of all prayer at Phoenix City Council meetings, by requesting that they also be allowed to offer prayers at the start of meetings like their Christian counterparts.Phoenix lawmakers have been trying to figure out what to do regarding the request for weeks. They couldn t allow all prayer, because it would have meant they supported Satanists in some people s minds. They couldn t allow only Christian prayer, due to inevitable lawsuits, so ultimately they came to what shouldn t be   but is   a very controversial solution: Banning prayer completely from the meetings.Lawmakers decided in a 5-4 vote that council meetings will now begin with a moment of silence instead of a Christian prayer. The moment of silence is intended to allow individuals to pray to whatever god is their personal choice, and leaves it out of the public domain completely. This is a pretty reasonable solution, since there isn t to be any mingling of church and state. However, these are red state Christian extremists we are talking about. Their struggle is REAL.The objections have been emotional, loud and generally ignorant. Christians are pushing for their right to pray, but they don t seem to understand the fact they can t allow their prayers while banning others. The Phoenix council had an option of either allowing the alternate prayers, or banning them while facing a First Amendment-based lawsuit that is practically a guaranteed loss for them. They chose a third option of banning all prayer (the best option) completely. Now they are being threatened with even more lawsuits from Christians that want to insert religion into government   as long as it s only Christian religion.The blubbering outcry by the Christian extremists is almost comical. Councilman Sal DiCiccio said: This is what that Satanist group wants. A moment of silence is basically a banning of prayer. It s to agree to the Satanic goal to ban prayer. Yup, that s it alright. They just let The Devil win! Actually, the Founding Fathers had the crazy idea to ban religion from public governance, but hey, facts don t really matter when it comes to religion.There were a great deal of gasps and clutching of pearls, but somehow Phoenix was not consumed by the desert in a massive sandstorm by the wrath of God. Frogs have chosen to not fall from the sky and the firstborn of Arizona are currently safe from the angel of death. Funny isn t it, how Republicans claim America is a  Christian  nation, but the only ones who care about the Constitution are the atheists, agnostics, and Satanists these days.Watch Christian outcry on the victory of Satan over Freedom below:Featured image from video screen capture",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Chris Christie Admit To Rachel Maddow’s Face That He’s Terrified Of Her (VIDEO),"Nothing shows a person s character more than their willingness to be properly interviewed. Because a proper and honest interview is going to yield proper and honest answers. This is something New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is apparently very nervous about doing, because he just told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, to her face, that he won t go on her show.While at a Christie event, Maddow tries to grab the governor s attention, but he responded: Rachel, you beat the crap out of me for years, you expect me to voluntarily come on your program, come on. So she replied: Oh, come on  You love the back and forth And you know that he does, because he loves to argue. However, instead he admits he s absolutely terrified of the MSNBC host by saying: With a lot of people, maybe not with you. He s likely terrified of her because she doesn t let him get away with any of his asshole shenanigans that he loves to regularly display. Maddow holds him to facts and doesn t let him finagle himself away from what s being discussed. Between his hatred for Hillary Clinton, and his fear of Rachel Maddow, it seems powerful women make him very nervous. Good thing he ll never be president.Does he seem surprised? He was probably surprised. :) Watch tonight! pic.twitter.com/CHe5FBKzl6  Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog) February 5, 2016Featured image: Twitter /Video: Twitter",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 How Female Execs Are Striking Back At Pharma For Using Women As ‘Eye Candy’ (VIDEO),"Women in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries have had it with executives working with firms that truck in scantily clad women to populate cocktail parties being held at their industry conferences.And now those women are circulating a letter in order to get the men that head those firms to stop the practice, most recently seen at a healthcare conference held by mega-firm JP Morgan.The impetus for the letter, which was initiated by two women who have high profiles in the biopharma world, was yet  another cocktail party in which inappropriately clad women served as eye candy  during the week-long festivities surrounding the recent JP Morgan health care conference.The event, which is arguably the most important stomping ground for biopharma executives and investors, attracted some 9,000 people last month to San Francisco, where countless receptions and parties were held in hotels and restaurants dotting the city s Financial District.Kate Bingham, a managing partner at venture capital firm SV Life Sciences, and Karen Bernstein, whose company runs BioCentury, a news site, created the letter.In it they ask,  Are we still working with people who think of women as chattel? What compelling business rationale could there possibly be for that kind of entertainment? Perhaps anticipating sexist counterarguments or an attempt to escape blame, the letter notes,  It doesn t matter who, or what kind of company, organized these events. If biotech executives attend, they endorse them. That reflects not only on them as individuals, but on us as an industry. One company in particular, LifeSci Advisors, an investor relations firm, was called out in the letter for a party where  young, female models were brought in to escort the guests on buses  bound for the Exploratorium science and art museum in San Francisco. Once there, the models were also used  to mingle with the crowd. The letter also points out that the recent ROTH Conference had a promotional video that  flaunts its use of scantily clad female dancers, who appear alongside cool male rock stars and skateboarders, and images of professionally dressed businessmen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N_Xvla_5loThe industry in question, along with tech, already faces major criticism of its inability to include women and minorities in what is already one of the fastest growing fields in America and the world. Cocktail parties with female entertainment are something straight out of the 1960s male-dominated mad men point of view, and most likely serve as a major turn off for women who might think about pursuing a career.Data shows that businesses benefit from hiring women and minorities, so if we want to excel against the world, it might be smart to ditch the boy s club.

 Republican Bill Would Force Girls To Submit To Genitalia Exam To Use Women’s Restroom,"If you didn t think Republicans could stoop any lower, think again.Because if they have their way, there will be a state law in Washington that will guarantee that even our private body parts no longer remain private.In their effort to persecute transgender people, Washington state Republicans have chosen to push legislation that would force everyone to show their genitalia before they are allowed to use a bathroom.According to Pink News,Senate bill 6548 would amend equality legislation to state:  Nothing in this chapter grants any right to a person to access a private facility segregated by gender, such as a bathroom, restroom, toilet, shower, locker room, or sauna, of a public or private entity if the person is preoperative, nonoperative, or otherwise has genitalia of a different gender from that for which the facility is segregated. And because the bill solely relies  on the presence of genitalia  to determine who can use which bathroom, it means girls and boys would have to show their vaginas and penises to whatever stranger is guarding the bathroom in order to be let in.Imagine going to a library, a theme park, a theater, a business, or even school and having to stand in line for the bathroom with the horrifying thought that some strange person is going to have to examine you below the belt to determine which bathroom you can use. It s sounds pretty damn embarrassing, not to mention cruel.But this is the strategy Republicans have come up with to discriminate against transgender people.The same kind of perverted legislation has already been proposed in VirginiaThat bill was strongly blasted by civil rights advocate Tim Peacock: This is what the conservative movement has devolved into: forcing children to allow adults to examine their genitals out of misplaced fear that transgender kids and adults might commit a hypothetical never-before-seen act of violence or sexual aggression (that would still be against the law with or without transgender protections). Human Rights Campaign spokesperson Sarah Warbelow called the Washington bill urged people to demand that the bill be killed. We urge all fair-minded people across the state to demand their lawmakers immediately stop these offensive assaults on fairness and equality, and we call on the Senate to vote down these dangerous measures if they come to a vote on the floor. Republicans might as well announce to pedophiles everywhere that this is their chance to legally examine the private parts of children, because that s what this bill basically does. An adult would be required to look at the private parts of children to determine which bathroom they can use so that a transgender child doesn t use what conservatives claim is the wrong bathroom.It s not hard to see that if this bill passes the lawsuits are going to pile up and clog our judicial system even more than it already is. It s also not hard to see that this is a conservative dream come true, and it s a sick dream at that.Featured Image: Pixabay",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Former Classmates Slam Ted Cruz: He’s About As Telegenic As An Undertaker,"Ted Cruz may have won Iowa but that doesn t make people hate him any less.The Texas Tea Party Senator is so universally despised that even moderate Republicans and Fox News can t stand him.Ever since being sworn in as a Senator, Cruz has shut down the government and attempted to shut it down on multiple other occasions. He has single-handedly blocked legislation that even his fellow Republican colleagues support and has told lie after lie to the media and the American people in order to position himself as some kind of savior.Just this past Sunday, Cruz was called out by Fox News for telling lies about Obamacare. That s how much Ted Cruz is hated. Conservative media is actually starting to defend Obamacare against his lies.And that s why it isn t very hard to find someone who hates Ted Cruz. It s especially not very hard to find a former Princeton classmate of Ted Cruz who also hates him.While searching for classmates to corroborate a rumor about Ted Cruz, Jezebel heard from several of them, many of which didn t fondly remember their fellow alum.According to Jezebel s Ellie Shechet,Many Princeton alums I interviewed, speaking under conditions of anonymity, had harsh words for their former classmate. One such person, who studied with Cruz at Princeton s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and asked not to be named in this story, referred to him as a  monster geek  who was  constantly dominating the conversation in order to get the attention of the professor.  She reported having such intense feelings of dislike towards Cruz during a public policy conference their junior year that  I had a complete allergy towards the [law] profession when it was over. I was stunned that he would be the one that ended up [running for] president out of our class,  she added,  because he s about as telegenic as an undertaker. Leonard Nalencz, who didn t mind not being anonymous, shared that,  Everyone in my class that I ve talked to is horrified that he s a candidate. Ouch. That has to sting.But you re not alone, Leonard. Most people are genuinely horrified that Ted Cruz is a candidate.After all, we re talking about a man who denies science. A guy who palled around with Sarah Palin for a time until she ditched him for Donald Trump. A guy who urged House Republicans to let America default on the debt, a move that would have crashed the economy. A guy whose supporters long more for him to crown himself king rather than be a president.Let s just hope Cruz only gets as far as being a candidate. Because anything more would be a disaster for this country.Featured Image: Nation of Change",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Girl Tells Ted Cruz She’s Gay .02 Seconds Before Taking This Photo, His Reaction Is Priceless","You know when you re told to smile for a photo but the person next you just let one rip? Well, that s pretty much the expression on Ted Cruz s face right after being told by a person taking a photo with him that she is gay.This new Wonder Woman was able to snag a photo with Cruz at one of his events and clearly took the anti-gay Republican Texas senator completely off guard, and it is spectacular.According to Pride.com: At a Ted event, a young queer hero approached him, and said,  I am gay.  Flash forward to .02 seconds later, she took a selfie with Mr. Cruz, where he looks frozen in his awkward and uncomfortable face via pride.comHe looks as though he is literally about to catch gay cooties. And her face is absolutely amazing. It reads,  Yeah, I just punked you, you bigoted jerkface. As you may or may not be aware, Cruz is steadfast in his hatred of all things gay. Not only is he against marriage equality and the protection of LGBT citizens from discrimination, but he even hates Pride parades. What kind of monster hates a joyous parade? Apparently the guy who looks like the ignorant fool in this picture next to a new brand of American hero.Kudos to this young woman who was courageous enough to come out to Cruz s face and then be even braver to snap the photo less than a second later.

 Paul Ryan Quotes Mel Gibson In A Desperate Attempt To Not Be The Next John Boehner,"Paul Ryan is learning quickly that John Boehner had good reason to cry all the time. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the leader of his or her party. The third most powerful person in the free world. Speakers enjoy visibility and influence above and beyond any other representative in the chamber.That s how it used to be, anyway, when the speaker was a position respected by their own party. From the days of Tip O Neil and Tom Foley to Dennis Hastert and even Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House commanded respect.Unfortunately for Republicans, their base began to die off and they needed to replenish, so they decided to go ahead and back the super-zealots of the Tea Party, who have now morphed into the  Freedom Caucus,  and things will never be the same. There have always been fringe-right congressmen and women. Michele Bachmann wasn t the first complete moron to deny science on the house floor, but she was one of the first to be counted among dozens who have actually come together to mold the Republican party platform into something even more conservative and stubborn than we re all used to.They pushed John Boehner right out of office and back to Ohio. They held the seat hostage until they found someone they could agree would do as much damage as possible. They grudgingly allowed Ryan to be elected, lest Nancy Pelosi steal the seat out from under the party, but promised that the honeymoon wouldn t last long.So far it s been easy for Ryan. Everything coming down the pike has been party-line and cut-and-dry. All of that will change when the budget process comes around again and the deal struck last year to pass the omnibus package has to stay glued together. The last thing Ryan and the Republicans want is for the Democrats to be able to point at them and laugh, yet again, because they couldn t be bothered to put aside their internal differences and govern. To quote William Wallace in Braveheart,  Paul Ryan said on Wednesday morning,  we have to unite the clans.  It was the single sound bite he released to the press before a meeting of congressional conservatives. Uniting the clans, as he is finding out, is going to take a lot more than condescending looks towards the President during State of the Union addresses.He was fresh out of a meeting just half a day earlier that the Huffington Post said  did not go well  with those Freedom Caucus members whose entire purpose in Washington is to return the United States to 1789 and force a do-over, with the several states ruling themselves and the Federal government being a non-existent figure-head good for dinners with world leaders and state funerals.Ryan probably expected a long run when he accepted the job as speaker. If he can t gain control of his own party, he may be looking for a new job sooner than later.Featured Image by Gage Skidmore ",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Let Fly With The F-Word During A New Hampshire Stump Speech (VIDEO),"It was only a matter of time before this happened. The very first instance of an American presidential candidate in the modern age dropping the f-bomb during a stump speech occurred this week. And, naturally, it was Donald Trump who broke through the taboo then backed over it just to make sure it s dead.Indeed, Trump let fly with the f-word on Friday during one of his stream-of-consciousness rants that pass for stump speeches. And, frankly, I don t know whether to scowl or cheer. In spite of Trump s general awfulness, I m leaning  cheer. We re gonna bring businesses back. We re gonna have businesses that used to be in New Hampshire, that are now in Mexico, come back to New Hampshire, and you can tell them to go f*ck themselves! Because they let you down, and they left![youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr-_Nwi2FyY&w=560&h=315]Yes, let s tell corporations that send jobs to places like Mexico and China to go f*ck themselves. You know, corporations like Trump s.There s something particularly exciting when  f*ck  becomes demystified. It should be. It s just a word. We can t say it on non-pay cable or on the radio   or on websites because advertisers don t like it   but we can show unspeakable scenes of violence and other horrors all the time. There s something perverse and unjust about that. So, in that regard, Trump can feel free to let the expletives fly. But if he s elected, I wonder if his FCC appointees will be equally lenient. On the other hand, Trump s use of  f*ck  is another step away from presidential decorum on the Republican side, and one step closer to amateur-hour composed of reality show hacks running for the highest office in the land. I m honestly torn.For the record, Trump has said  f*ck  in public before, but not during a presidential stump speech.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cruz’s Latest Shameful Fundraising Scam Is So Absurdly Illegal It’s Like He Wants To Be Caught,"To compete with his frenemy Donald Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz has hit upon an old, if dubious, campaign strategy: Lie, cheat, and steal his way to victory.In what is becoming a pattern with the Tea Party conservative, Cruz has yet again sent election officials scrambling to their rulebooks.Desperate for money to fund his campaign, Cruz told supporters that a group of super-secret  mega-donors  had personally promised him that they would match ALL of Ted s donations dollar-for-dollar within the next 48 hours. Cruz begged for people to join on this campaign buy one, get one.I just got off the phone with a few very generous supporters who   after our big win in Iowa last night   have pledged huge support for my campaign.For the next 48 hours, these most generous supporters have agreed to match all online donations to my campaign made through the link below.If that sounds like a scam you might find floating between your most gullible Facebook friends, that s because it just might be.The problem, as The Intercept was quick to point out, was that either Cruz is lying or breaking the law. Pick your poison, Ted.Campaign finance experts, however, say there s no way Cruz could be doing exactly what he promised without violating the law. That s because there s no way  a few very generous supporters  could legally be matching a large number of contributions to the campaign.The operative rule is that individual donations to campaigns are legally capped.  If this money is going to his campaign, any one of those donors can only give a maximum of $2,700 [per cycle] including any money they have given before,  said Fred Wertheimer, a campaign finance expert at Democracy 21.In other words, rich donors and poor donors can only donate up to a certain amount. So what s a mega-donor to do? That s where Super PACs come in. But here s the thing: Cruz can t coordinate with his Super PACS without breaking the law. So how can he be instructing his rich friends to match his campaign contributions?The other option, of course, is that Ted Cruz is lying. There are no super-secret mega-donors. Cruz just wants to get people running for their checkbooks. This is a pretty strong possibility because blatantly spreading falsehoods is absolutely in Cruz s wheelhouse.Cruz has been fairly open about running a dishonest campaign from the very beginning. Already reviled by Democrats and Republicans alike, the only way he has managed to get a leg up has been through deceit and pandering. In Iowa, Cruz s propensity for sliminess came to a head when his campaign sent out fliers telling voters they had committed  Voting Violations  and   on the night of the caucus   maliciously spreading false rumors that Ben Carson, one of Cruz s biggest rivals, had suddenly dropped out.Is it so hard to imagine that Cruz would lie to the very people who support him in order to trick them into giving him more money? Sadly, it s completely believable.Feature image via Flickr",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Won’t Believe What Hit This Pro-TPP Politician In The Face (VIDEO),"George W. Bush was famously attacked with flying shoes. So was Hillary Clinton. William Kristol was hit in the face with a cream pie. Last month, Donald Trump barely escaped being hit with tomatoes.The takeaway? American projectiles are lame.In order to see how it s really done, we have to travel by video to New Zealand where Minister Steven Joyce was hit in the face this week with a flying rubber dildo hurled by a protester. Joyce is a conservative member of the island nation s House of Representatives who supports the infamous trade agreement known as  TPP    the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The unknown dildo-tossing protester was arrested by law enforcement.Joyce was holding a press conference in Waitingi on the North Island during which he was discussing the benefits of the TPP. That s when the dildo smacked point-blank in Joyce s face.After being hit, Joyce said astutely,  It would be unfortunate for being known for this incident.  As the New York Post quipped: too late.Of course, I stand by my position that assaulting public officials with projectiles or blood-red paint or, for that matter, sex toys is bad form and only serves to underscore how the respective protesters are clearly incapable of verbally expressing their dissatisfaction. Which case, they probably should seek out other hobbies because activism isn t their bag. But, I will admit, seeing a stuffy conservative politician get hit in the face with a flying penis is never not funny.Now that I m really thinking about it, part of me wishes this had been Ted Cruz? If there s one man in the United States who s in desperate need of being hit in the face with a giant rubber dick, it s Ted Cruz. Best case: Cruz getting hit in the face with a penis while he s doing his awful misquoted JFK impression. (I m joking of course. Hitting Ted Cruz in the face with a penis is wrong and illegal.)Featured image via video screen grab NY Post",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Woman Gatecrashes Own Funeral, To Great Surprise Of Husband Who Hired Hitmen To Kill Her (VIDEO)","This should be a headline in The Onion. But sadly, this story isn t fiction or satire   it actually happened.Mourners at the funeral of Noela Rukundo had the shock of their lives when the ceremony was gatecrashed by none of other than the presumed deceased. But no one was more stunned than her husband, Balenga Kalala, who believed he d gotten away with her murder.Five days before, Burundi-born Noela had left the home in Melbourne, Australia that she shared with her husband to attend the funeral of her step mother in her native country. She had no idea that Kalala had paid a gang of gunmen to make sure she never made it back to Melbourne alive.After hiring the gunmen, Kalala even played a major part in placing his wife in their sights. As the BBC reports:By early evening Noela had retreated to her hotel room. As she lay dozing in the stifling city heat of Bujumbura, her phone rang. It was a call from Australia   from Balenga Kalala, her husband and father to her three youngest children. He says he d been trying to get me for the whole day,  Noela says.  I said I was going to bed. He told me,  To bed? Why are you sleeping so early? I say,  I m not feeling happy . And he asks me,  How s the weather? Is it very, very hot?  He told me to go outside for fresh air. Noela took his advice. I didn t think anything. I just thought that he cared about me, that he was worried about me. But moments after stepping outside the hotel compound, Noela found herself in danger. I opened the gate and I saw a man coming towards me. Then he pointed the gun on me.She was thrown into a car, seated between two gunmen, a hood was placed over her head and face, and she was driven away at speed. After some time, the car stopped and the men began to ask her what she had done to make her husband furious enough to kill her. She refused to believe that her husband was behind the plot, so they called him and put him on loudspeaker. When they asked Kalala what to do with his wife, he answered simply: Kill her. Noela s life flashed before her. She had fallen in live with Kalala when he arrived in Australia as a refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2004. He had taken on her five children from a previous relationship, and the pair had since had three children of their own. Yet now, he was killing her?Just as Noela was coming to the conclusion that her life was over, the hitmen told her they would not kill her.Instead, they would extort more money from her husband, telling him their price had gone up   while giving her time to flee the country back to Australia. Noela says the gang told her: We give you 80 hours to leave this country,' Your husband is serious. Maybe we can spare your life, but other people, they re not going to do the same thing. If God helps you, you ll get to Australia.' And so it was that five days later, Kalala got the shock of his life. When Noela returned home, she found her husband receiving a steady stream of mourners at their home. She waited for the last to leave, and then approached her husband. When I get out of the car, he saw me straight away. He put his hands on his head and said,  Is it my eyes? Is it a ghost?' She replied: Surprise! I m still alive! Kalala was arrested, charged and eventually convicted of attempting to murder his wife. He was sentenced to nine years in prison.That same year, 63 other Australian women were not so lucky. Their male partners were successful in their plans to kill them. In the U.S., more than 1,400 women a year are killed by men they know, most commonly a current or former male partner. By contrast, women kill around 30 men a year. There is most definitely a gender component to this violence. This is an issue we must address, not only as a nation, but as a species.Thank goodness, in the case of Noela, that her assassins turned out to be her saviors.

" WATCH: Obama Celebrates Jobs Win, Drops Truth Bomb That Will Make GOP Squeal (IMAGE)","In January of 2016, the U.S. economy added 151,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.9%, the lowest it has been since February of 2008 as America dealt with the repercussions of the job-killing Bush Recession.Revisions also showed that 2015 was even better for jobs than initial reports had indicated.In terms of the revisions, today s report is the once-a-year report that revises every month from the previous calendar year. On this front, the news is also good: we previously believed the U.S. economy created 2.65 million jobs in 2015, but the new, final tally is 2.74 million.January was the 64th consecutive month of positive job growth   the best stretch since 1939   and the 71st consecutive month in which we ve seen private-sector job growth, which is the longest on record.President Obama took the opportunity of the successful jobs report to make an appearance before reporters today, and noted that  We should feel good about the progress we ve made  and that the U.S. economy is the  strongest in the world,  while at the same time  Americans were working and getting bigger paychecks. He also dinged  Republicans, who have opposed the economic reforms proposed during his administration, and in fact have tried their best to slow down the recovery. Obama noted that the positive figures are  Inconvenient for Republican stump speeches as their doom and despair tour plays in New Hampshire. I guess you cannot please everybody. He also pointed out that the right has not offered anything beyond rhetoric. Those who are running down the economy and adding to the anxiety don t seem to have any plausible, coherent recipe other than cut taxes for those who have been doing the very best in this economy and somehow magically, that s gonna make other folks feel good,  Obama said.  Or, alternatively they argue the reason you re feeling insecure is because immigrants, or poor people are taking more and more of your paycheck and that is just not true. The facts don t bear that out. MSNBC s Steve Benen released a chart showing the comparison between Obama s record on jobs and the situation he encountered when taking over for Bush. It gives an excellent picture of how far the economy has come, and a warning about what could be lost.US Unemployment: Bush vs ObamaFeatured image via YouTube",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 All Ammosexual Hell Breaks Loose On Twitter Because One Woman Dared To Make This Statement (TWEET),"When comedian Alison Leiby tweeted a pretty cute, common sense joke in December, she had no idea how violent the repercussions would be. Conservative extremists have been sending her threats of rape and death every since.On December 16 2015, Leiby tweeted her 10,000 followers a fairly straightforward gag:As a woman, I just hope that one day I have as many rights as a gun does.  Alison Leiby (@AlisonLeiby) December 17, 2015Leiby describes what happened next in a piece for Medium:Somewhere along the way an account with a large and conservative following retweeted it, an action that flooded my notifications page with people calling me  stupid  or a  moron  or, one of my personal favorites, a  retarded liberal.  Fine.Last Monday evening, however, the replies went from annoying and insulting to violent and threatening. Men were replying to me and taking my joke to a horrific, new place. Some said they wanted to ban me from public places and silence me. Others said they wanted to lock me in their closet when they re done with me. A few choice gentlemen suggested I, like their gun, have a  rough brush clean my holes. She is not exaggerating the backlash. Even by the darkest depths of Twitter standards, it makes truly grim reading. We won t give the losers the honor of the airtime here but you can check out the twitter conversation for yourself by clicking on the original tweet above.Obviously, this reaction is hyper-hypocritical from people who present the case for their guns as a freedom and liberty issue. If they want the right to bear arms, doesn t Leiby have the right to free speech? It s not like they have to read what she writes. They made a choice to read it. As she points out, If you don t like the taste of fish, you wouldn t go to a restaurant, order the trout, and then call the chef a stupid bitch for serving it to you. So why do people do it on the Internet? Misogyny is not a joke. It is not some hobby horse that  angry women  ride around to piss men off. It killed 18,000American women in the last 12 years. This means that more women have been killed at the hands of their husbands and boyfriends since 9/11, than Americans died during 9/11, and in all terror attacks and wars since.In a 2005 study, yet to be repeated, a leading cause of death among pregnant American woman was homicide by their male partner or ex. Only pregnancy-related complications ranked higher.This is a crisis. A crisis which Leiby came at from about the least offensive, lightest way possible. Yet she faced the united, violent reaction of the very same men who likely commit and defend these crimes. Their intention? To stop women from raising these issues in the public space. So we need to keep raising these issues, defiantly and relentlessly, until the day they are consigned to the dustbin of history   which is the only place they belong.

 ‘Make Rape Legal’ Blogger Whines To Cops From Mommy’s House Over Alleged Threats,"Daryush Valizadeh, a  neo-masculinist  movement leader and blogger who tried to hold events around the nation and world for like-minded men this coming Saturday is running scared. First, he announced that he could not guarantee the  safety and privacy  of other misogynist douchebags at his  Return of Kings  meet-ups, so he announced that this  International Tribal Day  would be cancelled, as would all future events. The internet, politicians, and various other organizations and public figures rightly condemned the gatherings organized by a man whose misogynistic writings include calls to make rape legal.Now, Roosh V., as he is known, is alleging that he is being threatened. Like most bottom-feeding lowlifes, it appears that this loser lives in his mommy s house, despite being a grown man who has been quite successful at peddling his anti-woman garbage under the guise of being a  pick up artist.  He contacted authorities after the cancellation of the worldwide meet-up events, and told police that at least one threat said, We will kill you if you come to our city. Now, death threats serve no purpose, and they are illegal. No one should be sending him or anyone else threats, though the urge is certainly more than understandable in this particular case. What he expected to happen, exactly, when he decided to organize events steeped in dangerous ant-woman teachings, I ve no idea. Of course any reasonable person would be disgusted and outraged at the prospect of such people gather in their cities and neighborhoods.One organization that had planned to protest the New York City meeting of Roosh V s event said that while they are glad that the horrific meeting was cancelled, their work is far from done: They took to their Facebook event page to say the following: We showed the entire MRA, PUA and neo-masculine movements that they are not welcome, and should we see them in person, they ll never forget the experience (to put it politely). But we are vehemently of the opinion that we shouldn t just pat ourselves on the back and call it a day. No, rape culture still permeates our society, and we re f*cking tired of it! Any reasonable person realizes that  Men s Rights Activists,   Pick-Up Artists,  and  neo-masculinists  are all the result of rampant misogyny and rape culture. These people are despicable, and need to go the way of the dinosaur, along with the rape culture that created them in the first place.Featured image from screen capture from Raw Story",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Lying Liar Behind ‘Baby Parts’ Videos Rejects Plea Deal, Demands Apology (VIDEO)","David Daleidan, the ringleader for the deceptively named Center for Medical Progress, is foolishly rejecting a plea deal after being indicted by a Texas grand jury for the illegal activities he took part in to create the infamous  baby parts  videos used in an attempt to discredit and destroy Planned Parenthood. Daleidan surrendered to police on Thursday, and held a press conference in which he held steadfast to his stance that the beloved women s health organization is some kind of grotesque baby part mill. As he spoke to the huge crowd by the courthouse, Daleidan told them: I think we all know that every day that goes by that the Texas authorities do not prosecute Planned Parenthood for their illegal trade in baby parts, they are sending a message to the entire country. The state of Texas right now is open for business in baby body parts. Daleidan s attorneys spoke to the media, insisting that their client would not be making any kind of plea deal with prosecutors, even though he would get no jail time, only probation. They went on to have the gall to actually put Daleidan s  work  on par with that of people from 60 Minutes. If we re going to be prosecuting undercover journalists, we are sending ourselves down a very, very dark path. This is fully in the tradition, a long storied tradition, of undercover journalism. Well, real investigative journalists don t doctor videos, and real journalists don t break the law, which Daleiden and his organization of rabidly anti-choice zealots did repeatedly. That was when the lawyer actually had the nerve to demand that Daleiden receive an apology for being charged in the first place: What we want is an apology. He deserves an apology at this point. He is innocent of those charges. No, what he deserves is a jail cell, and hopefully at the end of his trial, that is exactly what he gets.Watch the video below:Featured image from video screen capture via Raw Story",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 What Trump Just Said About The LGBT Community Will Make Conservatives Go Crazy (VIDEO),"In a stunning reversal, Donald Trump said that he will strengthen the rights of the LGBT community and bring people together. His new stance comes just days after he said that as president, he would   strongly consider  overturning Obergefell vs Hodges, the Supreme Court decision that found that same-sex couples have a legal and constitutional right to marry. I m a lesbian, we ve had some great progress for the gay and lesbian community,  NECN reporter  Sue O Connell told Trump. When President Trump is in office, can we look for more forward motion on equality for gays and lesbians?  Here is Trump s response: Well, you can. We re going to bring people together, and that s your thing, and other people have their thing. We have to bring all people together and if we don t we re not going to have a country anymore. Now that s one big flip-flop because in addition to Trump saying he would appoint judges to overturn Obergefell vs Hodges, he has stated in the past  time and time again that he only supports marriage between a man and a woman. He has said: I m not in favor of gay marriage. I don t feel right about marriage equality. Trump has even gone as far as to compare same-sex relationships to choosing the wrong kind of golf putter! He said:  It s like in golf. A lot of people   I don t want this to sound trivial   but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive. It s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can t sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist. In trying to rationalize the irrational, it s most likely that Trump is pandering to New Hampshire voters for the primary, 67% of whom support gay marriage. Whatever his reasoning, his  new position is going to upset his bigoted right-wing conservative following.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"February 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Voter Confronts Trump: How Could My Daughters ‘Look Up To President Trump As A Role Model?’ (VIDEO),"Yesterday, Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump got an unexpected question from a voter during a New Hampshire town hall on CNN.The man confronting Trump was Joseph Manzoli, who described himself as a father with three daughters. Manzoli asked Trump what every self-respecting parent in America should be asking themselves: what kind of role model would the next president be for my children? Manzoli asked: I have three wonderful daughters at home. And I want nothing more for them than to look as their president as a role model. Throughout the course of this campaign, you ve said some disparaging comments about women, about people from other countries, other religions, and about everybody who s disagreed with you. Explain to me how I can look at my daughters and have them look up to President Trump as a role model. You can see how Trump answered below:Trump joked and asked if CNN had put Manzoli up to asking such a question before trying to convince his audience that he had loads of respect for women and had employed a staggering number of female executives. He said: Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Thirty years ago, I had a woman building a major, major construction job in New York City. And that never happens. That just didn t happen.   I have so many women executives. I have been great to women. And women have been great to me. They ve done a great job. Trump clearly forgot to mention his infamous long-standing, one-sided feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, his appalling comments about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as his long history of misogynistic behavior toward women. He also failed to tell this concerned father that sexism is just as alive in the background of his campaign as it is in his interviews and speeches! According to a former staffer, Trump s only paying his female staffers HALF of what his male employees are making for the same job. What a role model!Trump was just as insincere when he addressed his own comments about minorities like immigrants and Muslims. In defending the extremely racist and offensive things he s said about immigrants, Trump answered: I do bring up things that people don t want to bring up. I talk about immigration   stronger than anybody else. I talk about building a wall. If you look at New Hampshire, you have a tremendous heroin problem. It s coming from the border! And then he had the nerve to claim that tons of people were  agreeing with  his proposal to ban all Muslims from coming in the United States. When I brought up the Muslim problem. You know, it s very interesting. I brought that problem up and all of a sudden, the world started going wild. And now the world is agreeing with me. We have to do something. There is a serious problem. If Trump is going to be the next role model for our younger generations, America is in deep trouble.

 Someone Added Up The Money The Rich Have In Offshore Accounts — Prepare To Vomit,"You ve heard about those offshore accounts the wealthy use as tax shelters, right? The Cayman Islands, Switzerland, the Bank of Evil from Despicable Me The super-rich have been funneling their assets away from their respective countries and into these havens for decades, avoiding paying their fair share while the middle and working class watch recessions happen and markets crash, powerless to save even their retirement funds.While it s impossible to know exactly to the dime how much money the greedy feel they need to hide, a study was conducted by James Henry, former chief economist at the consultancy McKinsey and a leading authority on tax havens and offshoring. It was commissioned by Tax Justice Network, a British activist group.Buckle up, you re about to hit a wall of  are you f*cking kidding me?!? According to the study, one-thousandth of the world s population are hiding $21 trillion from being taxed, an amount equal to the gross domestic product of the United States and Japan combined. Those numbers have almost certainly increased, as the study was performed in 2012. Henry estimated that if the sum of those accounts earned a simple 3 percent interest rate, they are saving the wealthy nearly $200 billion per year in taxes just on that interest income.What s more disturbing is that the cash itself is enough to rid the world of debt. The problem here is that the assets of these countries are held by a small number of wealthy individuals while the debts are shouldered by the ordinary people of these countries through their governments,  said the report. 92,000 people hold the bulk of the wealth for all 7.4 billion of us, and they aren t going to be sharing anytime soon.Their wealth is, as Henry states,  protected by a highly paid, industrious bevy of professional enablers in the private banking, legal, accounting and investment industries taking advantage of the increasingly borderless, frictionless global economy.

They, along with other groups who stood in solidarity with the union, were demonstrating against the budget cuts, lay-offs, and more.#CTU takes the street #brokeonpurpose pic.twitter.com/gfj4Buqt0K  Aaron Cynic (@aaroncynic) February 4, 2016 @ctuLocal1 #FairContractNow rally through #Chicago loop. #CTU #CPS #reportage #journalism pic.twitter.com/5sX0qdWVn3  Chris Riha (@TalentedMrRiha) February 5, 2016A major target for the CTU was Bank of America. They claim that BOA and the Chicago Public School system made a number of unwise financial investments that the teachers and students have been deeply hurt by. WGN reports:  CPS says it needs the bond money for existing debt payments to cover construction and repair projects.This all comes after the union rejected a contract proposal that would have required members to pay more toward their pension and health care.The district then announced it would slash $75 million from school budgets.According to a Chicago Tribune poll, three times as many Chicagoans side with the teacher s union versus Mayor Rahm Emanuel on how to improve public schools.The survey also found that Emanuel s approval rating on education has fallen to a record low as it has with his overall job performance and handling of crime in the city. #CTU #faircontractnow Sit in started at Bank of America building   Photos from inside @Sarah4Justice @CTULocal1 pic.twitter.com/LFxm8rP4wm  Bill Chambers (@Chgofenian) February 4, 2016Protesters filled the streets, causing traffic on the Loop to slow to a crawl. Many of the protesters carried signs that lobbed attacks at Chicago s mayor, Rahm Emanuel.The CTU released a statement, saying: Our goal remains the same: reaching an agreement that protects our children while treating teachers fairly. We know our work is not finished, and we are committed to building a mutually respectful relationship with the CTU and working at the bargaining table around the clock so Chicago children can remain in the classroom. In the meantime, because of our dire financial circumstances, we must proceed forward with painful cuts in the absence of an agreement. We are hopeful we can rescind these cuts by swiftly reaching an agreement. It looks like the Emanuel administration will be embroiled in just as much controversy this year as it was in 2015. Last year, The Nation released an editorial, calling for Emanuel to resign. Among Emanuel s numerous sins, is his terrible track record with educators.

 WATCH The Weird Ad George W. Bush Made For His Little Brother Jeb,"The people supporting Jeb Bush s quest for the presidency have invested millions in a candidate who has so far failed to inspire support from Republican voters, and has in fact continued to collapse in poll after poll resulting in a 6th place finish in the Iowa caucus with a measly 2.8% of the vote   behind Ben Carson and Rand Paul, who has now dropped out of the race.But when you ve wasted that much money, there s probably a temptation to salvage something, anything. So the geniuses at Right to Rise, the super PAC that Bush himself raised funds for and directed right-wing millionaires to pour their funds into, has released a new ad featuring the most infamous Bush ever: George W. Bush.In the ad, Bush touts his younger brother. And that s where the ad gets extremely bizarre. George, who lost more Americans to terrorism than any other president in American history, describes Jeb as the right person to  protect America. After touting Jeb s  heart  and  strong backbone,  he says Jeb will  unite our country.  Of course, during his presidency George W. Bush pioneered new techniques in dividing the country, particularly on the topic of a war of choice in Iraq he used as a political weapon   describing those opposed to the war as allies of terrorists, and directing his underlings like Karl Rove to insinuate that Democrats were soft on terrorism   despite his administration s failure to kill or capture Osama bin Laden.The elder Bush also claims that his brother  knows how to bring the world together  against terrorism   but what sort of standing does Bush have on that type of diplomacy? He failed to unite the world in support of invading Iraq, and in the wake of that failure chose to commit Americans to a war that would eventually kill 4,491 members of the U.S. armed services and thousands more Iraqis.George W. Bush even reminds people about how his administration crossed the moral threshold and utilized torture, claiming that Jeb Bush knows when  tough measures  must be taken. That kind of talk might help among Republicans, but it also reminds people of the abdication of moral leadership that happened on Bush s watch.It is highly unlikely that Jeb Bush will become the Republican Party s nominee. He has been exposed as a poor campaigner who let a playground bully like Donald Trump pull his pants down in front of the entire world without ever really fighting back.And now his big brother has come barreling into the election after sitting on the sidelines since his failed presidency, reminding everyone   left and right   just why it is the country moved on from the Bush clan.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Stuns Oil Companies With Crushing Proposal (VIDEO),"President Obama just announced another major shakeup in the last year of his presidency, and the oil companies aren t liking it   that much is for sure. On Thursday, Obama revealed his plan to place a $10 fee on every single barrel of oil produced in the country. Considering the current U.S. crude trading price of $31.72 a gallon, that s a pretty hefty tax.Also   this appears to be a death tax to oil entirely. And, it could make life for the oil companies unbearable. Remember   just one year ago, oil was going for nearly twice as much as what it is now. While in the midterm oil will fluctuate up and down, over time it s trajectory has been going downward. Who knows what the price of oil will be when the tax proposal goes through, if ever?While Republicans still control a majority of Congress and refuse to take up the proposal, Obama s declaration to get rid of oil has already had its impact on the markets. It didn t even take one day and already oil is down 2 percent after the announcement.Keep in mind, Russia and Iran   two major countries that Republicans say are our bitter enemies   well   their entire economies rely heavily on oil. When oil does bad, so do their pockets. Divesting ourselves from oil is a national security concern. If anything, Republicans are hurting our national security from this viewpoint.The idea is not just to penalize oil companies and Republicans (that s wishful thinking) though, the real issue here is thinking about the future of America s energy and what s in the country s best interest. Green energy is; carbon isn t.Here s what Obama plans to do with the money raised from the new tax:-Invest $20 billion to reduce traffic and improve commuting. Think about that   that s more funding than the EPA and Interior Department combined. A lot of this money will go towards alternative transportation options. Think about the Hyperloop being constructed between Los Angeles and San Francisco by billionaire Elon Musk. It s supposed to completely alter our thinking about traveling long distances entirely. And   it s 100% green. That s what this country needs.-Invest $10 billion into state and local transportation and climate programs.-Put $2 billion into research for clean vehicles and aircraft.The White House sees this as the first step in an ambitious new plan for the 21st Century of clean transportation: By placing a fee on oil, the president s plan creates a clear incentive for private-sector innovation to reduce our reliance on oil and at the same time invests in clean energy technologies that will power our future. Former Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania is calling Obama s plan the boldest transportation blueprint since Eisenhower. Considering many think Eisenhower is the last great Republican president to take the oath of office, that s quite the compliment. Since then we ve just been bumping along, doing short-term fixes, and I give them a lot of credit for laying out this kind of long-term investment. I also give them credit for having the guts to say how they would pay for it all. That s very unusual in this area. While it may not pass muster in Congress, that s not what matters here. This proposal is a vision for the future of the country. And, it makes sense. The only thing that s going to get something like this implemented in Congress is voters going to the polls and voting overwhelmingly to fire Republicans on the Hill, as well as seeing to it that a Democrat is sworn in as president. Only then will people be able to follow through on this future vision of change for our country. And, in the meantime, it is kind of fun pissing the oil companies and Republicans off by talking about it.Featured image from Public Domain Files",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Attacks Sean Penn For ‘Glorifying Homicidal Killers’ — Here’s Penn’s Brilliant Response (VIDEO),"At an addiction policy forum in in New Hampshire, Republican Senator and presidential contender Ted Cruz discussed the awful consequences of drug addiction by highlighting his sister s overdose in 2011. The conversation then turned into a political rant against undocumented illegal immigrants with Cruz calling them  undocumented democrats.  He blamed the media, Hollywood, and specifically Sean Penn for glorifying drugs and drug dealers, calling for a wall to be built between the U.S. and Mexico. Referring to Penn s recent interview with drug kingpin Joaquin Guzman, also known as El Chapo, Cruz said: El Chapo. You know, Sean Penn seems to think he is a sexy and attractive character. I so appreciate Hollywood for glorifying vicious homicidal killers. What a cute and chic thing to celebrate. Someone who murders and destroys lives for a living. El Chapo s organization brings vast quantities of drugs into this country, vast quantities of heroin. Penn s article did not glorify or celebrate El Chap or drugs, but in typical fashion, Ted Cruz has made a career out of half truths and all out lies. Cruz s statement didn t sit well with Sean Penn. In an email sent to  Mother Jones, Penn stated:  Ted Cruz is a generically funny and dangerously adept thought-smith. Clearly, he watches too much television and neglected to read my article before criticizing. It s understood. He s busy trading genius and raising aspirations with Mr. Trump. Blame Canada. Blame Canada is 1999 song from the film South Park. The song satirizes scapegoating.It s not the first time Penn has criticized Cruz. Responding in 2013 to an interviewer s question on whether Ted Cruz should be committed to a mental institution, Penn said:  He is, he is my American brother. I won t   I think we should take care of him, he is in, he s the trouble. Penn seems to have been on to something quite early. Ted Cruz s ideas are quite dangerous and if he becomes president, the country is in deep trouble. Featured image from YouTube Screenshot.

 BUSTED: Growing Evidence Supports Claim Cruz Intentionally Lied About Carson Dropping Out (AUDIO),"Ted Cruz has a lot of explaining to do regarding the actions of his campaign staff. Cruz s campaign took a report that Ben Carson was diverting to Florida after the Iowa Caucus, without heading to New Hampshire, and very selectively cherry picked it to mean that Ben Carson was suspending his campaign and/or dropping out of the presidential race. This was immediately followed by a plea to Cruz workers to tell all Carson caucus-goers this falsehood while encouraging them to caucus for Ted Cruz instead.Carson s own campaign clarified at 6:53 pm he was not dropping out of the race. Cruz s deputy Iowa campaign manager sent an email at 6:56 pm, 3 minutes after Carson clarified things, saying Carson was taking time off from the campaign trail after Iowa and making a big announcement next week.  The email also said to inform any Carson caucus goers of this and convince them to support Cruz instead. The first phone call by the campaign to a Cruz precinct captain in Iowa came in at 7:07 pm, with the same instructions to tell Carson supporters to caucus for Cruz instead. Another phone call came in at 7:29 pm. Both calls came after CNN also clarified that Carson was not suspending his campaign.The Cruz campaign has so far insisted that they were acting on an  accurate  report that Carson was suspending campaigning after the Iowa caucus. The thing is, there doesn t seem to be any accurate report that exists. Cruz had blamed CNN for reporting that Carson suspended his campaign, but CNN did no such thing. Iowa Republican Steve King linked to CNN s report then inferred on his own that Carson was quitting the campaign. King clearly was clueless, because CNN said no such thing. However, the fact Cruz took King s word for it without reading the actual article he linked is hard to believe. Cruz might claim they just made a mistake but it seriously strains credulity to think they are that inept.Nancy Bliesman, a precinct captain for Cruz received the voicemails because she didn t take the calls as they were coming in. This prevented her from unknowingly lying to Carson voters. It isn t immediately known how many other precinct captains or other campaign workers may have gotten the misinformation and acted on it. One thing is for sure, this puts a stain on Cruz s  win  and could prove problematic for him in future caucuses once voters get wind of his shenanigans.Listen to the voicemails that were sent by the Cruz campaign below:Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Teasing Stephen Curry For ‘Clowning’ Just Further Proof He’s The Coolest Ever (VIDEO),"One of the awesome things you get to do when you win a championship is visit the White House and meet the President of the United States. This is a long-standing honor that has been coveted by these outstanding athletes. And if we re going to keep things totally real, with President Obama in the White House, these visits are much more than just honorable, they re outright fun.The Golden State Warriors won the NBA Championship this past year, and President Obama spoke of how talented they are and what role models they ve become.

However, things got pretty hilarious when the president decided to throw a little light-hearted shade at Warriors star point guard Stephen Curry.The president teased Curry for  clowning  during the Warriors game against the Washington Wizards the night before. He said: For those of you who watched the game against the Wizards last night, he was   to use slang   he was clowning. He then mimicked Curry s jumps, and it was hilarious, making the whole team burst with laughter. Honestly, what other president would you ever see doing this, let alone do it so flawlessly and with great affect.

 This Activist Might Go To Jail For Criticizing Michigan’s Governor On Facebook (IMAGE),"A Michigan man just received a disturbing letter. The letter alleges that he has violated his probation for  threatening  Michigan s Governor, Rick Snyder, on Facebook.In 2013, Chris Wahmhoff, of Kalamazoo, Michigan was arrested for protesting the rebuilding and expansion of a pipeline that ruptured in 2010, creating the largest inland oil spill in history. In December 2014, Wahmoff was sentenced to probation, in lieu of a jail sentence.Wahmhoff received a letter from his probation officer, claiming that he has violated the terms of his probation on three counts. The first count is for his failure to pay back restitution. The second is for failing to provide his DNA for testing. The third count is where things get quite disturbing.The letter says that he has violated his probation for allegedly threatening Rick Snyder. The letter reads:Count 3: On 1.27.16 the defendant displayed threatening behavior on social media (Facebook) when he responded to a posting pertaining to the Governor of Michigan hiring two public relations firms in lieu of hiring to restore the infrastructure to provide clean water for Flint when he stated  so when y all are ready to march in and take his ass across the street I have my torch, I got warm socks. I m waiting on y all. This is in no way a credible threat of violence. In fact, it is actually quite tame compared to many of the things that have been posted about Snyder. Cher caught wind of the situation going on in Flint, Michigan before the story had reached critical mass. She called for Snyder to be put in front of a firing squad. A Michigan militia has even taken sides against Snyder.WTF IS GOING ON W/POWERMAD,GREED DRIVEN,KILLER,INCOMPETENT,POLITICIANS?THEY R CRIMNALS GOV.RICK SNYDER OF MICH.#FIRINGSQUADWORKSFORME  Cher (@cher) January 6, 2016Whether or not a Snyder and his cronies are found culpable for their role in the Flint water crisis, or not remains to be seen. That being said, the people of Michigan    well, people all over the U.S. and the world for that matter   have already found Snyder to be guilty. He has eroded democracy through his expansion of Michigan s emergency manager law. He has poisoned an entire city. At least ten people have already died from water contamination. When people refer to Snyder as a baby killer, it is by no means an exaggeration.I spoke to Wahmhoff over the phone. He says that he was publicly calling for a citizen s arrest of Rick Snyder. Wahmhoff is emphatic that he does not think that people should go into the Capital building  guns blazing.  He doesn t want any violence to come to Snyder. He does, however, think he needs to be removed from office immediately. Wahmhoff told Addicting Info: I never intended to call for violence against Rick Snyder.. But according to Michigan law 764.16 (b), I have the right to, and do intend to legally invoke the arrest of governor Rick Snyder for felonious child endangerment. Not just for Flint, but for Detroit, for the Kalamazoo River, and for the children who will continue to suffer as long as Rick Snyder is in power. The right-wing has usurped and bastardized the concept of government tyranny and the expulsion of tyrants, to the point where birthers think that President Obama should be removed from office by force. Those people are insane. I by no means support violence. Though I have to say, I am sure that the founders of the United States would consider the Snyder administration a domestic threat. As many have pointed out, the poisoning of an entire city s water supply is an act that any ISIS member would look upon with envy.There are mobs of people out there who actually would tear Rick Snyder to shreds, given the opportunity. In light of that, the idea that someone would actually take a person s vague comment from Facebook seriously enough to consider it a violation of their probation, is absurd. Especially when the person who made the comment is on probation for protesting a corporation that created the worst environmental disaster in Michigan s history   not including the current crisis in Flint, of course. Michigan activists are planning a protest, to stand in solidarity with Wahmhoff. Featured Image Credit: Donkey Hotey via Flickr. With letter screenshot added by Joe Fletcher.

 Exposed: These Republicans Blocking Help For Flint Got Disaster Cash For Their States (TWEETS),"Republicans in Congress are holding up a measure to provide relief to the citizens of Flint, Michigan whose water supply has been poisoned.Instead of acting to pass a provision which would remove the compromised pipes bringing water into the homes of the city s mostly black population, Republicans in the Senate are blocking progress.Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Democrats of Michigan, started pushing the issue last week as the Senate began debate on the energy bill. Their provision would provide $600 million in emergency funding to Flint to replace and fix the city s water supply infrastructure and establish a center dedicated to helping people in Flint recover from lead poisoning. Republicans scolded Democrats for using the crisis to play politics, and argued it is a state and local problem.Ahead of the procedural vote, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) delivered scathing remarks on the floor, accusing Republicans of abandoning the people of Flint. One hundred thousand people in Flint, Michigan, have been poisoned, and Republicans do nothing,  Reid said.  Nine thousand little children   all under the age of 6   have been poisoned, their brains attack by the contaminated water. Still, Senate Republicans refuse to help. Republicans are insisting that the money to help Flint must be  offset  elsewhere in the budget. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) blasted this tactic from Republicans on the Senate floor, noting: This is of catastrophic, almost Armageddon proportion, that an American city has been poisoned. Let s get real. We are now bogged down in Washington wonky budgeteer talk:  Where is the offsets?  What is this? What is this? Are we human beings? There was also considerable hypocrisy on the behalf of Republicans opposed to helping Flint. Igor Volsky of Think Progress pointed out on Twitter several instances of conservative Republicans who are blocking Flint relief who were all too eager to ask for disaster relief funds for their own states..@SenatorSessions requested fed disaster $ after tornadoes hit AL.

 This Anti-Abortionist’s Comment On Flint Crisis Proves ‘Pro-Life’ Republicans Don’t Exist (AUDIO),"A so-called  pro-life  Republican has yet again proven the entire concept of being  pro-life  is a total fraud   this time, with her comments on the Flint water crisis. Sandy Rios, who wastes her time fighting against both abortion and contraception, has declared the Flint lead poisoning crisis and the Zika virus as liberal conspiracy theories that are not worthy of concern.Rios actually made the incredible suggestion that neither of the health crises posed as great a threat as either ISIS or Latino immigrants. How Latino immigrants moving into this country are related to an entire American city being poisoned for over a year is beyond comprehension.A caller to her radio show asked her why she and other Republicans that are obsessed with the well-being of fetuses were mostly silent on the Flint water crisis. Rios had the following mind-numbing response: The whole issue in Michigan   the left loves to, they re now creating this, I m sorry, I m going to really go out on a limb here, this Zika virus which I haven t talked about. They love to come up with tragedies and they love to blame and they love to scare people. I think this issue in Michigan is a serious one, but I don t think it s the big issue that these other issues are. Source: RawstoryHere is a bit of context on what Rios said. Lead poisoning is not safe at any level for any person, but it s most harmful to developing brains and nervous systems found in fetuses and children. The Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly, which is a condition that causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development. It s causing such an epidemic in Brazil that at least one judge is planning on challenging Brazil s harsh restrictions on abortion, which only allow for exceptions of rape or life of the mother.These are real public health issues that are seriously endangering the unborn, and an absolutely rabid Christian anti-abortionist just blows them off, insisting they are not a serious problem. It s unreal how narrowly they define their concern for the unborn. They seem to only care about the act of forcing women to give birth. Whether or not the child is healthy is of no concern.Listen to Rios  ridiculous comments below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245269720  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image from Huffington Post ",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Calls Out ‘EVERY SINGLE’ House Republican For ‘SHAMEFUL’ Vote (VIDEO),"If you need reassurance that someone is truly fighting for your best interests in Congress, look no further than Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). She has been fighting for justice for the American people against a corrupt financial system since before she even took office. She is a champion for the unheard American voice that all too often gets drowned out by corporate cash and lobbying efforts from big banks.Republicans, of course, fall in line behind these lobbyists and take what they can get. They then turn around and vote in favor of those who crashed our economy rather than those who elected them into office   the people.No greater example of this is than what just happened on the floor of the House of Representatives. A vote was taken (HR766) to let fraudulent bankers off the hook and make it harder for them to be investigated and held accountable. Take a guess how Republicans responded Warren did NOT hold back in her disgust of what was happening before our very eyes:It s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car, while a CEO gets a huge raise when his company steals billions.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 3, 2016The American people remember who broke our economy & who made out like bandits   and they didn t send us here to help the bandits.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 3, 2016If anyone in Congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals, I promise you: The American people are watching.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 3, 2016Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis   but not a single Wall St executive went to jail.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 4, 2016You d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 4, 2016Nope   right now on the House floor, Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 4, 2016You read that right: The House is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate & prosecute bank fraud.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 4, 2016So she urged everyone to tell Congress to hold Wall Street accountable and vote  NO :Tell Congress: They work for the American people   not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 4, 2016And this is how House Republicans responded:Every single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 4, 2016It is remarkably shameful, corrupt and disgusting. Thank goodness for voices like Senator Warren and Senator Sanders for being in the Senate to call these corrupt politicians out and shine a huge spotlight on where Republican loyalties truly are. To know we live in a nation where people of color are locked up for minor offenses or even killed where they stand, but these corrupt bankers are allowed to destroy our economy as well as people s lives and not be held accountable is beyond shameful, it s reprehensible. Thank you for fighting for us, Senator Warren.

" Rick Santorum Endorses Rubio, But Can’t Actually Name Any Of His Accomplishments (VIDEO)","It s pretty rare that a presidential candidate would regret getting an endorsement while on the campaign trail, but such might be the case for GOPer Marco Rubio after what former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum did to him!Having recently dropped out of his own race for the White House, Santorum decided to throw his support behind the Flordia senator yesterday, giving the candidate his best wishes and a passionate endorsement. This endorsement followed Rubio s third-place win in Iowa on Monday, and the candidate is picking up speed for the New Hampshire primary taking place next week.But on Thursday morning, Santorum s endorsement had the complete opposite effect on Rubio s campaign. Instead of being a great boost, it just made both politicians look incapable and stupid, thanks to Santorum s appearance on Morning Joe. Host Joe Scarborough simply asked the question  What do you list as Marco Rubio s top accomplishment?  and it all went downhill from there! You can watch the awkward, embarrassing footage below:Santorum not only squirmed and danced around what was an understandable question, but failed to finally give any sort of satisfying answer. Some of Santorum s meek side-stepping remarks were that Rubio [Won] a tough election in Florida, pull[ing] people together from a variety of spots  and that  He s someone who brings people together! Meanwhile, the Morning Joe panel couldn t help but laugh at how absurd the situation was. In a final attempt, Scarborough firmly pressed the former senator, He s been in the Senate four years. Can you name his top accomplishment? And Santorum proved that even with the help of the show s hosts, he just couldn t come up with even one thing Rubio had done. Defeated and tired of smiling and shaking his head, Santorum eventually said,  The bottom line is there isn t a whole lot of accomplishments, Joe,  and accused the host of asking him something  I just don t think it s a fair question  (even though it was completely straightforward and logical).This interview was so awkward that at one point, Scarborough s co-host Mika Brzezinski said, Hold on.

 Email ‘Scandal’ Unraveling: Explosive NBC Report Blows Up Major Anti-Hillary Talking Point,"Well, they say all good things must come to an end and for Republicans, it s beginning to look like their favorite Anti-Hillary Clinton talking point is unraveling right before their eyes. It seems they may have to actually focus on the issues instead of obsessing over a manufactured scandal. (I m kidding, of course!)At first blush a new NBC News report seems like bad news for Clinton and her campaign. Journalists seemed to confirm that her emails contained  references  to CIA operatives who were conducting espionage overseas. Sounds bad, right?Right-wing media outlets certainly wanted to pretend like it was. Conservatives gleefully began spreading the narrative that this meant Clinton s servers could have led to American CIA agents getting killed. NewsMax, a cheap Fox News knockoff, blared:U.S. intelligence officials say  top-secret  emails Hillary Clinton kept on her private email server when she headed the State Department include the real names of CIA spies serving undercover overseas   a violation of federal law that has put the agents in harm s way The readers of NewsMax   and other right-wing sites   were led to believe Hillary s arrest was only moments away.Nope, not even close.The NBC News investigation found that this was a case of more smoke than fire and quite a bit of wishful thinking on the part of conservatives. Here s what they found instead (emphasis added):But contrary to some published reports, three officials said there was no email on Clinton s server that directly revealed the identity of an undercover intelligence operative. Rather, they said, State Department and other officials attempted to make veiled references to intelligence officers in the emails   references that were deemed classified when the messages were being reviewed years later for public release.Catch the differences?There were absolutely no direct references to the identities of undercover operatives. No  names  or distinguishing characteristics. No way to know who the emails were referring to. If a terrorist were to find these emails, they would be spectacularly unhelpful.Making matters even stronger for Clinton s case, the emails were only deemed classified years later. At the time she had them, they were considered mundane.This falls in line with what Clinton has been saying all along. She admits that having the server at her house was a mistake, but it was never a criminal act, and it ultimately put zero CIA agents at risk of any danger. The Republican charges to the contrary are evaporating under scrutiny.If this is all they have against her should she receive the Democratic nomination, they are   without doubt   utterly screwed.Feature image from Flickr",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black Teen Volunteers For Trump To See If He’s Really THAT Bad – This Is What He Found (VIDEO),"Whenever someone has been generous enough to give Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt, they re always met with disappointment. In a new video from The Young Turks, an African-American teen decided to volunteer at one of Trump s campaign offices in West Des Moines on Caucus Day to see if the candidate and his supporters were really as bad as the media makes them out to be.High school junior James Patterson explained his reasoning: I just wanted to make sure I wasn t critiquing out of ignorance. I saw what he said on TV, but I also know how the media works, so I wanted to see it for myself. As part of his volunteer work, Patterson spent his time making phone calls for Trump s campaign in an office of about 20 people. It didn t take him long to see the obvious: he was the only black person. Through his interactions with Trump s other supporters and volunteers over the course of the day, their overall attitude toward minorities became clear   their racism is quiet, but it s still very much there. Patterson said: Nobody used any racial slurs. Nobody called me  the n-word.  Nobody called me  coon  or anything, but it s, for lack of a better word, it s micro-aggressions. You know, the way they look at you. The way they talk about foreign policy and how they talk about oppressed groups when they don t think you re listening. Overall, Patterson felt that Trump s supporters were normal people who have these resentments towards minorities, not able to voice them because thankfully we have policed language to the effect that that s not acceptable. But they still hold these.  Patterson believes that supporting Trump is  their way to show that. Patterson also said that he found his fellow staffers and volunteers unnerving because while they were  very friendly , he couldn t ignore the fact that they support Trump s disgusting rhetoric. You can watch the young volunteer talk about his experience below:Overall, his stint as a Trump volunteer did not turn Patterson into a supporter. He said, Sure, everybody has the right to say whatever they want. However, there is something called respect. And Trump is not respectful. And there is something wrong with our society when we can glorify somebody openly that condemns minority groups like Mexicans and Muslims.Patterson feels that Trump has targeted his message to appeal to fundamentalist Christian, white, middle-class Americans that feel like their power is being taken  because minorities are making strides.  He added: When he speaks to that, there s no way he can be pro-black or pro-Hispanic or pro-minority, and have that campaign. Smart boy. Patterson isn t the only one who has tried to give Trump a real chance and found the experience severely disheartening. Last November, an African-American woman attended a Trump rally to see if The Donald was really as hateful, racist and horrible as she d heard. It didn t take long before she realized she d made a horrible mistake and decided to turn her presence into a protest in the most beautiful way.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Donald Trump Makes Pathetic, Racist Swipe At President Obama For Visiting A Mosque (VIDEO)","President Obama s speech from a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland this week was welcomed by most as an important and timely gesture to bring together Americans of all faiths and none. But for Donald Trump, is was a chance to sow the seeds of division with a truly pathetic, racist reaction.Obama s visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore was the first time in U.S. history that a President has delivered a speech from an American mosque. Given the rise of hate crimes against Muslim American and their places of worship, and unprecedented attacks on the faith from conservative lawmakers and media, this visit was much-needed.The center says on its website that it  aspires to be the anchor of a growing Muslim community with diverse backgrounds, democratically governed, relating to one another with inclusiveness and tolerance, and interacting with neighbors in an Islamic exemplary manner. Obama endorsed this message and made an impassioned call for moderates on all sides of the political and faith spectrum to come together around their common humanity. He explicitly rejected the inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans made by the likes of Donald Trump, and other Republican presidential candidates.He replaced their rhetoric with a powerful and unambiguous message of hope and community: Let me say as clearly as I can as president of the United States: you fit right here, You re right where you belong. You re part of America too. You re not Muslim or American. You re Muslim and American. What was Donald Trump s detailed, profound political response to this groundbreaking effort? Speaking on Fox News, in an interview with Greta Van Susteren, Trump responded: I don t know if maybe he feels comfortable there. Because he is a Kenyan Muslim Socialist? I mean, come on Trump. And how do we know it s just a case of Obama putting his Muslim brothers above  natural born Americans? We have a lot of problems in this country,  Trump explained.  We have a lot of places he can go and he chose a mosque. The reason Trump sinks to playing the race card with his reaction, is because it s actually the only card he has to play. He has no platform, no ideas, no vision for America. He only has a direct line to the prejudices of Republican voters and Fox viewers. It ll get him coverage alright, but it sure as hell won t get him to the White House.Featured Image via Screengrab/Screengrab",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" This Staggering Ruling Makes It Legal For Cops To Kill Unarmed, Homeless People (VIDEO)","A 43-year-old Cameroonian immigrant man was barely surviving on LA s infamous Skid Row when he was brutally gunned down by cops last year. Despite the victim being unarmed and vulnerable, the LA Police Commission has ruled this killing  justified.  Coming as it does, among a string of such killings, it seems it is now legal for LA cops to shoot unarmed, homeless people with impunity.Last March, Charly Keunang died after being shot six times by the LAPD. Officers claimed he was reaching for one of their guns, but a bystander video undermines this story. The LA Police Commission refuses to release their body-cam footage of the shooting, and the ruling seals the footage from public view permanently.As can be seen in the bystander footage, several cops charge into Keunangs tent while he is sleeping and begin swinging at him. He was known to be in a poor state of mental health, and it is little surprise at all that such a traumatic incident would have terrified him and provoked a fight or flight response. How might you react if you awoke with several men in your face who were hitting and dragging you? The cops then  reacted  to a crisis of their own creation.Members of the man s family are now suing the LA for $20 million.One would hope that a case like the horrific death of Charly Keunang would be unique. However, it is all too commonplace in LA. In September of the very same year, 37-year-old mentally ill homeless woman Norma  Angie  Guzman was gunned down by the LAPD too. Again, a mental health crisis was turned into target practice session by the LAPD.And it s not just LA. Over in Albuquerque, New Mexico, city police shot and killed 38-year-old homeless man James Boyd for the crime of camping in an unauthorized area of local foothills.In the same month, a cop in Miami shot and killed a homeless man in a public park. The man was well-known and liked by regulars of the park, and a maintenance worker at the park found it almost impossible to believe the officers account. He stated that the deceased man was a regular feature in the park with a routine: To sit down and go to the library and use the computer, read the newspaper, that s his thing every morning and wait for me to open up the door,  he said.  Man, for that to happen to a guy like that, no I don t understand that. This really is where the issues of under-investment in public services, and police brutality combine to create a perfect storm. Millions of dollars has been stripped form LA s homeless services budgets in the last five years, while homelessness has risen 12 percent in just the last two years. At the same time, mental health support services have also been cut. This means more people are on the streets, with less support, and when a crisis occurs  the police are getting called instead of mental health professionals.So while this is a problem for the police, it is also a matter for legislators and voters. If we want our streets to be safe, it serves us all to invest in the proper treatment and support of vulnerable people. While police and some civilians may perceive a homeless or mentally ill person as the threat, they are far more likely to become a victim of violence than to commit violence. Either from ruthless policing, or unscrupulous passersby.

 Jimmy Kimmel Imagines An Unlikely World In Which Jeb Bush Can Place Fourth In a Primary (VIDEO),"At this point, Jeb Bush s campaign is nothing short of pathetic. Recently, the would-be third president in the Bush dynasty surely received a rude awakening when he had to beg a New Hampshire crowd to clap for him.Unfortunately, even though his own mother doesn t think he should be president, Bush refuses to give up. With no chance to win unless almost every single one of his primary opponents spontaneously combusts   or unless he possesses some sort of supernatural ability like mind control   Jeb doesn t stand a chance.But what if Rand Paul s supporters join him? Paul recently dropped out of the race after a humiliating fifth place finish. Paul finished fifth among the GOP candidates with a rather unimpressive 4% of the vote, with thousands more supporters than Bush, who finished sixth. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel took a moment Wednesday to imagine a fantastical world in which Jeb has a chance to finish fourth in a primary. Jeb Bush is still running, but he doesn t know what to do,  Kimmel said.  You know, if he loses, he can t go home because his father and brother will laugh at him. I guess he s hoping that some of the people who supported candidates who are dropping out will get on board with him.  Fallon plays a mock ad encouraging those who wanted to  stand with Rand  to instead  ebb with Jeb. Jeb s still running, and he desperately needs your vote,  the narrator says.  If we join forces, who know   we might just make it to fourth place. Unfortunately, Bush is so wildly unpopular that even if Paul s supporters instead joined forces with him in Iowa, he would have finished fifth behind Ben Carson anyway. He s just that terrible. You have to admit though   with truly memorable GOP contenders like whatsisname, some guy, and another person dropping like birds in an acid storm, it takes a lot of guts for someone so grossly unqualified, unlikable, and pathetic to even consider staying in the race.Watch this hilarious segment below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jbVOzAe0rg?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Colbert Lays Waste To Fallen Candidates After Iowa In This Hilarious ‘Tribute’ (VIDEO),"The Iowa caucuses have come and gone, leaving in their wake a trail of fallen candidates no longer willing to have their dignity handed to them by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Not that Republicans have any actual dignity, so let s just go with the idea that they re tired of being embarrassed.Who can blame them? Mike Huckabee was the first to fall, joking that it wasn t due to low votes but to illness.  The voters are sick of me,  said the Huckster. Waka waka. Buh bye. Rand Paul went down in flames shortly thereafter, deciding to make sure he doesn t lose his senate seat instead, which is a valid concern.For the Democrats, Martin O malley dropped out, which comes as no surprise to anyone.That leaves the two major contenders for the Democrats and a still ridiculously large field of horrible governors, senators who don t bother voting and a few non-politician types who don t understand the first thing about how the real world works.Even with the dropouts and a Cruz victory proving devastating to Donald Trump, the real loser of the Iowa caucuses was Jeb Bush, who outspent every by dropping more than $12 million and walking away with votes in the single digits. None of the  establishment  favorites fared well with the exception of Marco Rubio, who stepped up in the absence of Donald Trump at the last Fox News debate and screamed at America every time he was given the chance.It s a circus for sure. Luckily, we have people like Stephen Colbert who know how to take the ridiculously irritating Republican field and turn them into the buffoons they are for our enjoyment. Stephen dons his Hunger Games attire, which includes eyebrows that his  forehead can t contain,  and spends a few minutes making asinine asshats look even worse than they already do.Watch Stephen Colbert lambaste the  fallen tributes  In this hilarious clip:Featured image from screen capture",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Internet Destroys Imbecile Who Wants To Make Rape Legal, Get His Meet-Ups Cancelled (TWEETS/VIDEO)","Misogynist blogger Daryush Valizadeh, better known as Roosh V., owner and operator of the He-Man Woman Haters site  Return of Kings,  is finally getting his comeuppance. Roosh had organized an  International Tribal Meetup Day,  for men like himself who believe that women are nothing more than property, and therefore rape should completely legal on private property. Some of the meetings of the rape supporting men were to take place in Seattle and Everett, Washington   that is until the public got wind of this douchebag s plans.Outrage quickly ensued, and rightfully so. Here are just a few of the tweets from citizens calling for Roosh s blood:This is sickening. @SPLBuzz a heads up~ 'Pro-rape' blogger organizes meetings for men across U.S.Seattle https://t.co/caQ8OJraUd via Q13FOX  Jasmine Boothroyd (@jazzvictoria) February 3, 2016Seriously.

There has also been a Whitehouse.gov petition to classify Return of Kings group as a terrorist organization. There was even a safety alert posted to social media by local police warning women to steer clear, and saying that there is concern that this may be a ruse to commit rape. Even heavily conservative Texas Governor Greg Abbott has come out in strong condemnation against the group when he learned of their plans to hold meetings in Texas, saying in a statement: This pathetic group and their disgusting viewpoints are not welcome in Texas. I ve spent much of my career protecting women from such vile and heinous acts, and it won t be any different on my watch as Governor. After the outrage continued, Roosh V. finally released the following statement, announcing the cancellation of all of the meetups: I can no longer guarantee the safety or privacy of the men who want to attend on February 6, especially since most of the meetups can not be made private in time. While I can t stop men who want to continue meeting in private groups, there will be no official Return Of Kings meetups. The listing page has been scrubbed of all locations. I apologize to all the supporters who are let down by my decision. While your fellow misogynists may be let down, Roosh, the rest of the world is breathing a collective sigh of relief. You should be locked up with the key thrown away, for advocating the commission and legalization of a heinous violent crime. You are nothing more than a misogynist hate group leader, and I, for one, am glad the sane people of the world spoke out and made sure that you d be too afraid to continue doing what you do.Watch a video news report below, via DFW CBS below:Featured image from Change.org",News,"February 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jimmy Fallon’s Trump Claims VICTORY As ‘The Winner And Champion – Of Second Place’ (VIDEO),"It can be said that Donald Trump was less than pleased that he came in second to Ted Cruz in the Iowa Caucus. However, that s putting it mildly. From his expressionless concession speech, to his next day blame game, to his temper tantrum against Cruz, he s been pretty much a loose cannon.Although, leave it to Jimmy Fallon to show Trump s true reaction to coming in second place that likely happened in a dream on Trump s flight from Iowa to New Hampshire. On Wednesday s edition of the Tonight Show, Fallon donned the infamous Trump wig and did his spot-on impersonation once again to have Trump declare he s  the winner and champion   of second place. He then tells everyone,  In case you re wondering, the  J  stands for genius.  Then after declaring victory, he says: It s just like children say: First is the worst, second is the best, third is the one with the hairy chest . Marco Rubio get that taken care of. I wouldn t want your hair to make you look ridiculous. Fallon then goes through how many wonderful things in life have the number two in them or come in twos, thus making him equally as spectacular. Of course.He ends by telling everyone: From now on, when you think Donald Trump, I want you to think YUGE No. 2  So watch out New Hampshire, because the deuce is loose. And it s true, Trump often does appear to be a giant piece of sh*t more often than not, so it fits.It will definitely be interesting to see what happens in New Hampshire after their primary vote next week. Will Trump still be the champion of second place? Or will he be able to finally declare a true victory? We ll just have to wait and see.

 #BlackLivesMatter Leader To Run For Mayor Of Racially Troubled Baltimore (TWEET),"The police shooting of black teen Michael Brown at the hands of then Ferguson, Missouri white cop Darren Wilson ignited a national firestorm regarding the fact that cops often shoot and kill unarmed black people for little more than existing. That birthed the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Then, there were the protests, unrest, and violence in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray, yet another African American man who died at the hands of the police. Since then there have been national protests across the nation. One man who has risen to prominence through his activism and advocacy for #BlackLivesMatters: activist DeRay McKesson.McKesson is currently an activist by both passion and trade. He is from Baltimore, and returned to his hometown a little more than a year ago. He became famous for his commentary on racist policing and anti-black violence on Twitter. His prolific use of social media and for his on the ground, live commentary meant that many people began to look to him as a man who could be trusted to provide them with the truth   even when the cops are busy trying to cover it up. Now, he has announced that he will be running for mayor of Baltimore.Calling himself a  son of Baltimore,  McKesson says his mayoral bid is about a commitment  to usher our city into an era where the government is accountable to its people and is aggressively innovative in how it identifies and solves its problems. The 30-year-old modern day civil rights icon tweeted his intention to run late Wednesday night, as he filed his papers to run for Baltimore s mayor as a Democrat. I Am Running for Mayor of Baltimore  https://t.co/tYQ58AOXYp  deray mckesson (@deray) February 4, 2016Godspeed, man. We need people who call out the system for what it is, and who are unafraid to explain how it is stacked against black people   how it costs so many of us our very lives.

 Watch Women Reverse Roles And Tell Male Republican Candidates What They Should Do With Their Bodies (VIDEO),"Many women have had enough of men in power telling them what they should or should not do with  their bodies. One would think that in 2016, it would be understood by presidential candidates that a woman simply has a right to her own body and the choices she makes are hers and hers alone.Not so with the current Republican clowns running for president. For some irrational reason, all the  candidates seem to believe that they have a right to tell women what to do with their bodies. A group of women decided to get together and teach the candidates a lesson by posing the following question: What would it be like for men in power to get schooled on what they should or shouldn t do with their bodies? The results in the video are effective as well as hilarious.The results in the video are effective as well as hilarious.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdXZd7VZTnI]One woman speaks directly to the camera and says: Guys, Republicans, picture this: Once a month, lots of blood just comes out of you d**k hole and if you want to prevent it, you just shove a tampon in your d**k hole. Now picture my trying to regulate your d**k hole. Another woman on screen continues with some advice for Donald Trump. She says:  Take as many selfies as possible. You ve got the duck lips that teen girls dream of. And there were some suggestions for lowly Jeb Bush: You basically want women to wear a chastity belt. We just want you to use your actual belt and wear your pants below your nipple line. By subverting power and reversing it, these women teach these candidates an important lesson. Although it s doubtful that someone like Donald Trump, who has said terrible and sexist things about women will heed the message and reverse course. It s also doubtful that someone like Ben Carson, who believes that abortion should be outlawed, even in cases of rape and incest, will heed the message as well. However, the hope is that Americans will be rational enough not to vote for a Republican for the presidency when the time comes.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Has Four Words For Everyone Claiming She Pals With Donald Trump,"Something we keep hearing about Hillary Clinton is that the former Secretary of State is pals with Donald Trump. Of course this line is perpetuated by the fact that Hillary did attend Trump s wedding in 2005. However, let s remember something, Hillary was pretty powerful in New York at the time as a Senator and was likely asked to attend in that capacity. But, myths being what they are, if it s repeated often enough that she s palling around with Trump, at some point it becomes a  fact  that they re besties.Hillary has a four word message for all those out there who insist she s BFF s with The Donald  We were not friends. She exclusively told PEOPLE for the upcoming issue: We were not friends. We knew each other, obviously, in New York. I knew a lot of people. Also noting that she really doesn t give a sh*t what he says about her either: I don t really care that much about what he says about me because I do see that as, you know, politics   not particularly the brand I approve of. Who would approve of Trump s brand of politics; it s smarmy, bigoted, abusive, and flat-out wrong in so many ways. And even though Trump said back in 2012: Hillary Clinton, I think, is a terrific woman. I have known her for years. I live in New York, she lives in New York, and I ve known her and her husband for years and I really like them both a lot. It lines up with what Hillary said about their relationship perfectly, and doesn t prove, whatsoever, that they re pals. What it shows is Trump doing what Trump does   do what s in the best interest of Trump. Which is say and do anything that will go to his favor. For all we know he could like the Clintons a lot, or he may loathe them. Trump says what he wants to at any time, and that could change at any given moment.At this moment in time, you ve really got to take Hillary at her word on this, because not only does her explanation make perfect sense, it lines up with Trump as well. So what if they know each other, she knows A LOT of people. A LOT. So does he. It doesn t mean that their all best friends forever.Featured image: flickr",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Host SLAMS Cruz Campaign For Making Up Absolute Bullsh*t And Bashing Network (VIDEO),"If there s one thing Senator Ted Cruz will go down in history for, it s being a smarmy liar. He says whatever he can to make himself look good, and gives all politicians a bad name. What he seems to hate more than anything is being call out on his bullshit, and Wednesday when asked a question about how he mislead Carson voters in to thinking the candidate was suspending his campaign, thus trying to make voters believe they should vote for Cruz, he went directly after CNN, saying: Is it a dirty trick to pass on your news stories? You re in the business! Would you think it was a dirty trick if I was forwarding an ABC story? Or is it just a dirty trick to pass on a CNN story? Basically, he was pissed CNN was reporting facts. So CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin, while speaking with Cruz surrogate Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), said: Just so we re all crystal clear here, when Sen. Cruz, with all due respect, tries to throw my network under the bus, let me stand up for my colleagues and my journalists here in terms of this CNN report Cruz keeps quoting. We reported it accurately and here are the facts. She then went on to say: Dr. Carson s staff told us that he would return home to Florida to, quote, unquote, take a breath from the campaign before resuming his activities on the campaign trail. That accurate report was disseminated on television and CNN digital and that was that. That was that. Then finished off with: Forgive me. When someone tries to take down the media and misreport something it gets me fired up. Then when Meadows tried to twist the conversation away from the subject, Baldwin brings him back to reality by saying: Congressman, forgive me, but I m going to call out B.S. if I hear B.S. And that was B.S. Cruz was purposefully trying to blame the media for his actions taken against the Carson campaign. It s lame, it s wrong, and Baldwin was perfectly spot-on calling him out on it. Well done.

 #TrumperTantrum: Twitter’s Brilliant Response To Trump’s Embarrassing Meltdown (TWEETS),"As you have all probably heard by now, Donald Trump had an absolute hissy-fit on Twitter, Wednesday morning. The Republican front-runner was very, very upset that he did not come out on top in the Iowa caucus and he decided that it was all because of Ted Cruz   the declared winner.To express his extreme displeasure Trump claimed that Cruz  illegally stole  Iowa (how one legally steals is not clear) and claimed that he was going to demand a recount.The Cruz Campaign laughed at The Donald s meltdown and Spokesman Rick Tyler said: Reality has hit the reality star. Since Iowa, no one is talking about Donald Trump. That s why he s popping off on Twitter. There are Twitter addiction therapy groups, and he should check in with his local chapter. But the Cruz Campaign wasn t the only ones to respond to the billionaire s epic temper tantrum, Twitter did too with the hashtag #TrumpTantrum   and it is brilliant:If you threaten to sue your neighbor because he has more friends than you, you might be having a #trumpertantrum  SherH (@shernajwine) February 4, 2016 #Trumpertantrum Everyone is being mean to me! pic.twitter.com/W8HXbZ1dFb  Politics Jim (@PoliticsJim) February 4, 2016. #Trumpertantrum best hashtag of the day!

 Creepy: Christie Is The Latest Republican To Fantasize About Spanking Hillary Clinton (VIDEO),"The Republican presidential candidates have been shamelessly revealing their deepest desires to spank a certain popular Democrat.While it s understandable that candidates will talk smack about their opponents and use more colorful language, the GOP candidates have completely crossed the line by repeatedly talking about how much they want to spank Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Following a loss at the Iowa Caucus earlier this week, Chris Christie went to New Hampshire to raise eyebrows and earn a few uncomfortable laughs by making a misogynistic joke about how badly he would  beat [Clinton s] rear end  if they were to ever go head to head against each other in a debate. The GOPer said: You know the last person she wants to see on that stage in September? You re looking at him. You know why? She s been running away from federal prosecutors for the last six months. She sees a federal prosecutor on the stage, I ll beat her rear end on that stage, and after I do, she ll be relieved because she ll just be worried I was going to serve her with a subpoena. You can watch Christie make the crowd shift uncomfortably in their seats below via ABC:WATCH: @ChrisChristie promises to beat Clinton s  rear end  on debate stage https://t.co/TYKQ3wwG72https://t.co/j3XMYAFXJA  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 3, 2016Christie has gained a reputation for making off-the-wall comments about his rivals, but the right s disturbing fascination with spanking   especially when Clinton is concerned   is getting out of hand. Just last month, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz revealed his own weird, creepy fantasy about spanking the former Secretary of State.As fully grown adult human beings, we all have thoughts that come across our minds throughout the day, and the majority of us know which ones should be kept to ourselves to maintain our own dignity and keep the environment around us respectful and peaceful. Unfortunately, this election has brought about the worst in the Republican candidates and it seems that every racist, bigotry-filled and misogynistic thought needs to be expressed loud and clear.

 Bernie Sanders Says You Can’t Be A Moderate And A Progressive (TWEETS),"Bernie Sanders on Wednesday attacked Hillary Clinton s political self-identification as a progressive. The Vermont senator posted a series of tweets defining for his supporters what it means to be a real progressive.You can be a moderate. You can be a progressive. But you cannot be a moderate and a progressive.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 3, 2016On top of defining the word  establishment  as a pejorative term, Sanders is now engaged in a game of ideological purity similar to the ongoing battle on the Republican side about what it really means to be a conservative.Contrary to Sanders  view of progressivism, it s absolutely possible to be a progressive on some issues and a moderate on others. Likewise, it s entirely possible to be a progressive while governing as a moderate   be it a moderate across the board or just occasionally depending on the issue. For example, what about the gun control issue? his campaign manager says he is  very moderate  on the issue.  https://t.co/5LX5Pkhuji  Alex Seitz-Wald (@aseitzwald) February 3, 2016So, Bernie s own adviser defined him as  moderate  on guns. How would Sanders score on his own ideological purity test?But, really, what does it even mean to be a progressive? Is there an agreed-upon set of qualifications for the label? Is Sanders talking about being a far-left liberal? A progressive reformer in the classical Teddy Roosevelt sense? What is it? Sanders elaborated via a series of additional tweets in an attempt to define what he means.Most progressives that I know don t raise millions of dollars from Wall Street.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 3, 2016Most progressives I know are firm from day 1 in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. They didn t have to think about it a whole lot.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 3, 2016Most progressives that I know were opposed to the Keystone pipeline from day one. Honestly, it wasn t that complicated.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 3, 2016Most progressives I know were against the war in Iraq. One of the worst foreign policy blunders in the history of the United States.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 3, 2016Fair points, but why do they have to be couched in the context of a purity test?It appears as if Sanders is taking on both the Clinton machine, the Democratic Party establishment and anyone who doesn t qualify as  progressive  in his view   ejecting them from his exclusively progressive club. It s difficult to see how this helps to build a unified, big-tent coalition necessary to not only win the nomination but, more importantly, the general election.One last thing. It s entirely possible that Clinton believes she s a progressive. The term is fluid enough to apply, even though she likely adopted the term in an attempt to win over voters to her left. But wasn t part of the point of a Sanders candidacy to influence the so-called moderate Democrats to do exactly what Clinton is doing   to be influenced by the strength of the Sanders message and to be pulled leftward? If so, he s clearly been successful at doing so. If he d rather not pull center-left Dems leftward, then he should say so. But he can t have it both ways.

 Watch Pres Jimmy Carter Go Beast Mode On Republican Candidates (VIDEO),"Former president Jimmy Carter denounced what he called the  legal bribery afflicting our political system, turning the presidential race into one that is influenced by a few billionaires, lobby groups, and corporate oligarchs who sponsor candidates by giving billions in exchange for influencing the candidates  policy platform. In an interview with the BBC, Carter said: The erroneous ruling of the Supreme Court, where millionaires and billionaires can put in unlimited amounts of money in to the campaign, it gives legal bribery a chance to prevail, because almost all the candidates, whether they are honest or not, Democrat or Republican, rely on these massive amounts of money in order to campaign. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZFc1QqRbbQ] President Carter has a very important point and one that should be taken into account: The democracy of the country is threatened and eroded when an elected official, especially a president, owes a handful of individuals who finance his/her presidential campaign favors.Take for example, the NRA. The NRA is a very well funded and organized lobby group that lobbies Washington officials in favor of lax guns laws. That, in turn, means easier access to guns, which translates into sales. Some people get rich as a result of gun sales, but the country collectively suffers, as has been documented, with record numbers of shootings around the country.Another example is individual donations. Republican candidate Marco Rubio s sponsor, the billionaire Norman Braman, has donated $15-25 million to Rubio s campaign. Braman is staunchly pro-Israel and has financed the building of settlements in the Palestinian West Bank. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, and US policy condemns settlement building in the West Bank. Yet, you can bet that if Rubio should become president, Braman will cash in his chips by ensuring that Rubio goes along with Israel s illegal activities. In the end, we will continue to have a mess in the Middle Eat, which hurts the region and the United States.The bottom line is that billions of dollars are being spent by candidates to win the presidency and much of that money comes from a few individuals. The only way to change that is to create a constitutional amendment that overturns the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that allows individuals and corporations to contribute unlimited sums to political races. Until we do this, a small number of individuals and corporations will continue to exert undemocratic influence over our country.

 What Obama Said At His First Mosque Visit Will Drive The Right Insane (VIDEO),"President Obama paid the first visit to a U.S.-based mosque and made a stirring call to unity between Islam and America s other major religions. In his visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore in Maryland, Obama cut through a lot of conservative Republican rhetoric about the role of Islam in America. Muslim Americans keep up safe,  Obama told the audience, crediting the contributions Muslims have made to communities.  They are our police. They are our fire fighters. They re in (the Department of) Homeland Security. President Obama has had to repeatedly, patiently explain during the course of his presidency that the United States is not at war with Islam, but in fact relies on practitioners of the faith to serve side by side in the war against international terrorism.By contrast, Republican conservatives have constantly demonized Islam, acting as if its followers are monolithically pro-terrorism, when in reality the violent acts have been carried out by an extremely small sect. Top tier Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has gone the furthest, calling for a Muslim registry and a ban on Muslim travel to the country.In the speech today, President Obama explained: We are one American family. We will rise and fall together. He specifically spoke out to young Muslim Americans, who may feel lost and shunned thanks to extremist right-wing rhetoric about their faith: You re right where you belong. You re part of America too. In the speech, Obama also called on the media to do more to include Muslims in films and television shows, pointing out that Muslims shouldn t just be cast in roles about terrorism, but rather in roles that reflect their diverse standing in American life. The President pointed out that this has been done before, as there once were not many portrayals of black Americans in film/tv.Featured image from YouTube",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Very Sorry He Cheated His Way To Iowa Win (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, the day after he won the Republican Party s Iowa caucus, presidential hopeful Ted Cruz admitted that his campaign had sent out an email alert implying that political rival Ben Carson was dropping out of the race.The email warned that Carson was leaving the campaign trail after Iowa, and said that he would be making a formal announcement next week. Recipients of the email were instructed to spread this lie among Carson supporters during the caucuses. Please inform any Carson caucusgoers of this news and urge them to caucus for Ted Cruz. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.As Addicting Info reported here on February 2, Ben Carson told his supporters in a speech on caucus night: For months, my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to detest the games of the political class, but in reality are masters at it. On Tuesday, Cruz sort of apologized for the deceptive emails, claiming it was all just an innocent mistake on the part of his campaign staff.According to Cruz s statement, circulating false rumors as  breaking news  is  fair game,  while circulating the truth just wasn t a priority.Last night when our political team saw the CNN post saying Dr. Carson was not carrying on to New Hampshire and South Carolina, our campaign updated the grassroots leaders just as we would with any breaking news story. That s fair game.What the team should have done is send around the follow-up statement from the Carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out.That was a mistake from our end, and for that I apologize to Dr. Carson.Ted s apology also didn t explain why Carson s follow-up statement, which made it clear that he was not dropping out of the race, wasn t seen as a  breaking news story,  by the Cruz campaign. But I think we can figure that out for ourselves.Carson wasn t the only candidate to be dogged by dirty republican politics during the Iowa caucuses.A post circulated on social media claimed that Jeb Bush was paying people $25 an hour to fill seats during the caucus.In Des Moines and need some quick money apparently Jeb Bush will pay you to listen to him. pic.twitter.com/NXExjSAB64  Jeff Sadosky (@JeffSadosky) February 1, 2016During Bush s Iowa rally, two men, who later claimed to be paid actors, stood up and began loudly demanding payment for attending the event. We ve been here for two hours and we haven t been paid,  one said.Bush responded by having the men escorted out of the rally. Here s video of the men being escorted out, courtesy of the UK s Daily Mail.After the uproar died down, Bush asked the crowd,  Have the YR s (Young Republicans) gone yet?  He went on to tell the audience  That s what we used to do back in the day, we would come to other campaigns and do what they did. Good old GOP family values. Teach the kids how to lie, steal, cheat and con people in order to get what they want.As Jeb himself so plainly put it, following the caucus night debacle,  Those are the tactics  used by the republican party.And as Carson pointed out, the more they point fingers and accuse others of dirty politics, theFeatured image credit from Gage Skidmore via Flickr ",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Lewis Black SLAMS Cruz: He’s So Creepy That No One Notices He’s A Bully Too (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, Lewis Black appeared on Comedy Central s The Nightly Show to hype his ABC special, Madoff, but made sure to take the time to be his lovable, crotchety self. Black says that the most surprising news that arose out of the Iowa caucuses was that Ben Carson seemingly left all of his clothes in Florida and had to fly home to get them. What s surprising is that Ben Carson flew from Iowa to Florida to get a change of clothes,  Black said.  That kind of leads into the other thing   that someone really that batsh*t crazy could score 10 percent in Iowa. Though Black agreed with the rest of the panel that Marco Rubio poses the most severe threat to Hillary Clinton, but Black questioned his ability to actually be President, noting that much of his time in office would be  on the job training  as with Barack Obama   But host Larry Wilmore disagreed, noting that Republicans  racist opposition to every single one of the President s initiatives played a bigger role in stifling any progress Obama may have attempted to make. It was absolutely that, but also it was dealing with   it s the same position of a guy who s in the Senate who hasn t been in the Senate long enough,  But when Wilmore pointed out that Ted Cruz, whose daughter recently snubbed him as he attempted to orchestrate a warm family moment for the cameras, had a similar background to Rubio, it was on. Black pointed out that both Trump and Cruz are bullies, but Cruz is far too creepy to be recognized as just as big a bully as Donald Trump: Here s what Rubio s problem is right now   both Trump and Cruz are both bullies. So I think that they re going to kind of punch him. What I really find interesting about Cruz, after everything else, is that people don t seem to have noticed that he is a bully. Trump is an obvious bully. Cruz is the bully who acts weird, and he s acting weird all the time, and so you end up doing what the weird guy wants you to do so he ll stop acting weird. Trump is such an amazing overbearing asshole that we can t see how creepy Cruz is,  Wilmore added, with Black noting that there s a  touch of ferret  in Cruz s family.Cruz is remembered as the creepy guy in school. His former college roommate, Craig Mazin, is almost addicted to telling people about it on Twitter, noting that the presidential hopeful leaves behind a greasy film on whatever he touches. They even had a nickname for it    Cruhz.  He was also fond of hanging out near the women s restroom in a bathrobe for reasons we would rather not imagine.Of course, it could be said that Trump is creepy, as well, with his numerous remarks about how he wants to sleep with his daughter   and the insanely unsettling ways they pose for photographs, so Cruz does have some competition in that department. At least Cruz can say, completely honestly, that he doesn t want to sleep with his little girl.Watch Black lay the smack down, below:The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore Get More: The Nightly Show Full Episodes,The Nightly Show on Facebook,The Nightly Show Video ArchiveFeatured image via screengrab",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Another One Bites The Dust: GOP Candidate Hangs Up Presidential Run (VIDEO),"Another Republican has dropped out of the race. This time, it s  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. In a released statement, Paul said: It s been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House. Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of Liberty. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08M7ASDe7F8]The self -described libertarian-ish  Paul touted himself as an alternative to establishment Republicans, marketing himself as a grassroots guy.However, Paul finished 5th place in the Iowa caucuses and and although he was one of the first to announce his candidacy, his campaign never gained any traction. Since the beginning of his candidacy, polls consistently showed Paul in the back of the pack. Paul always failed to break away from Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, and even the lowly Jeb Bush.Paul struggled to raise money from both large and small donors, resulting in a cash strapped campaign that was never able to spend and then replenish through donors, whether big or small. His ideas of a non-interventionist and non-violent approach in U.S. foreign policy apparently didn t sit well with Republicans. Ted Cruz, the guy who plans on killing lots of folks, especially in the Middle East, is the current front runner for the Republican nomination.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Loser Trump EXPLODES On Twitter, Claims Ted Cruz ‘Illegally Stole’ Iowa (TWEETS)","When Donald Trump stepped on the stage in Iowa Monday night, we almost thought he might behave like an adult after being defeated by Ted Cruz. He gave a very, very short speech (a strange breath of fresh air after Rubio s), and stayed pretty upbeat and positive   until Tuesday.The day after his loss Trump started tweeting whining about losing. In one tweet he claimed that the people of Iowa didn t appreciate that he hadn t taken money from super PACS. He even implied that he was wasting his money by self-funding his campaign.On Wednesday morning, Trump continued his temper tantrum and tweeted that Cruz  stole  the caucus. Ted Cruz didn t win Iowa, he illegally stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong any why he more votes than anticipated. Bad! Shortly after the tweet went out, he deleted it and posted one that left the word  illegally  out.Ted Cruz didn t win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016But he couldn t leave it at just one tweet, he kept going:During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and  choice    a total lie!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016The butthurt is so strong there.He is acting exactly the way we thought he would act if he lost, only it s even more pathetic than we could imagine. Instead of behaving like an adult and moving on, he is literally acting like a raging toddler. Ted Cruz came out on top because the Republicans in Iowa are  ber conservative   Trump is not. Perhaps he also lost because of his brilliant dumbass decision to skip the last debate (over more hurt feelings).Whatever the reason, voters are not going to look at his recent behavior and think, Yep, this is the guy we want with the nuclear codes. This meltdown is just solidifying the fact that he definitely doesn t belong in the White House.

 Ted Cruz Was Snubbed For A Job In The Dubya Administration–You’re Gonna LOVE The Reason,"It s no secret that nobody likes Ted Cruz.. He s an arrogant, self-important elitist who believes he speaks for God himself. His face is one of the most punchable on the planet and his screechy voice makes you cringe with disgust. When he starts on one of his  righteous  rants you can t help but hope a light fixture falls on his head, leaving him forever incapable of speaking.Donald Trump wasn t kidding when he said that everyone in congress hates Ted Cruz. Cruz refuses to deal or compromise within his own party, nevermind across the aisle. A Cruz presidency would be nothing short of a disaster for this country.That s today s perspective. Today, we know all about the whiny toddler that is Ted Cruz. But what about his past? Is he somehow new to the idea of being hated? According to an article in Mother Jones, apparently not:A prominent aide to George W. Bush s 2000 campaign could barely contain himself when we asked him to discuss Cruz, who worked in the campaign s policy shop. This person described Cruz as hyper-arrogant and widely despised, and he emphasized over and over that the pervasive dislike of Cruz within the Bush ranks had nothing to do with ideology. (Cruz, he noted, never objected to Bush s call for compassionate conservatism, immigration reform, and national education standards, and no one on the campaign regarded him as an ideologue.) The problem was simple: his personality.So before Ted Cruz took on the role of ultra-conservative nutbar teahadist, he was a moderate conservative inside the Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign. As the aide inside the campaign tells it, Cruz isn t just a big jerk now, he was a big jerk then: Ted thought he was an expert on everything,  says this campaign veteran, who asked not to be named.  He was a smart and talented guy, but completely taken with himself and his own ideas. He would offer up opinions on everything, even matters outside his portfolio. He was a policy guy, but he would push his ideas on campaign strategy. He would send memos on everything to everyone. He would come to meetings where he wasn t invited and wasn t wanted. He sounds a lot like that guy who shows up for the neighborhood cookout uninvited with a tin full of liver and onions and a six-pack for himself. Apparently, the best way to end a meeting was for Ted to walk in.  People wouldn t go to a meeting if they knew he would be there,  said the aide,  It was his inability to be part of the team. That s exactly what he was: a big a**hole. Well isn t that enlightening. Ted Cruz isn t just an a**hole, he s ALWAYS been an a**hole. His complete lack of personality and inability to maintain personal relationships came back to bite him, however, when he was denied a job in Bush s administration.. Nobody wanted to work with him. Imagine that.Ted Cruz took off for Texas where he could find the most ignorant constituents to pander to, managing to get himself elected on a Tea Party platform of stupidity and zealotry. Since Tea Partiers don t really count ass  people  per se, it s safe to say that Ted Cruz just might go down in history as the most hated man in history.Featured image from Gage Skidmore ",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Richard Dreyfuss Uses GMA Interview To Troll Dick Cheney, The Host Never Saw It Coming (VIDEO)","Legendary actor Richard Dreyfuss has been hitting the interview circuit to promote  Madoff,  a movie in which he stars as the infamous financial swindler. In an sit-down with Good Morning America, Dreyfuss took exception to the idea that Bernie Madoff, as bad as he was, should be considered the  most despicable man  in modern history. Dreyfuss had another, far more influential, man in mind.GMA host Amy Robach: You ve certainly played a lot of roles in your long career, but what was it like playing arguably the most despicable man in modern history?Dreyfuss: Actually, he s the second most despicable man because I ve already played Dick Cheney.Boom.The host, probably told repeatedly by producers to keep it light and certainly not alienate Republican viewers, can barely contain her laughter despite her efforts.Dreyfuss went on to again clarify that Bernie Madoff is the  second  worst real-life person he s played, but that he loved playing both the disgraced investor and the disgraced former vice president.By this point, the host is cracking up. You can actually hear others on the set laughing as well. Robach tells Dreyfuss,  I m recovering from that last response right now. Dreyfuss isn t exactly overstating things when he points out that Cheney is far worse than Madoff. Setting aside the level of moral failings that led Cheney to involve America in a disingenuous war in Iraq and his full-throated defense of torture, Cheney also gave rise to people like Madoff by consistently advocating for deregulation of financial institutions.Madoff, to be sure, was reprehensible. He stole around $20 billion from investors using a complicated Ponzi scheme. He ultimately cost his victims around $65 billion before going to prison. On the other hand, Cheney s boss, George W. Bush, oversaw the largest financial collapse since the Great Depression. All in all, there really is no comparison.Watch Dreyfuss s hilarious interview with GMA s Robach below:Feature image via YouTube",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jesus Appears On Kimmel To Read GOP Quotes And It’s Gloriously Awkward (VIDEO),"Republicans often claim Jesus as one of their own, but if you read what Jesus said in the Bible, it s clear that Jesus is nothing like them.And Jimmy Kimmel demonstrated that even further on Tuesday night by bringing a guy dressed as Jesus on the stage to read quotes uttered by Republican presidential wannabes.As Jesus read the quotes, it became increasingly awkward. After all, we ve read the words of Jesus, but hearing him say things that seem contrary to his message slammed home the point that none of the GOP candidates practice what Jesus preached.Here are just a few of the quotes recited. You don t lock your doors because you hate people on the outside. You lock the doors because you love the people on the inside.  ~Marco Rubio We need appropriate vetting, and I don t think orphans under five are being you know, you should be admitted into the United States at this point.  ~Chris Christie You don t stop bad guys by taking away our guns, you stop bad guys by using our guns.  ~Ted Cruz I would bomb the sh*t out of them!  ~Donald Trump When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families! They care about their lives, don t kid yourselves. They say they don t care about their lives. But you have to take out their families.    Donald Trump I ll take the votes of everyone who loves machine guns and bacon!  ~Ted CruzHere s the video via YouTube.Yeah, that s a long way from what Jesus has said. The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.  ~Jesus in John 13:16 Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  ~Jesus in Matthew 7:1-2 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.  ~Jesus in Matthew 5:9 But whoever has this world s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?  ~Jesus in 1 John 3:17 Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  ~Jesus in Matthew 11:28 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.  ~Jesus in Matthew 25:34-40Clearly, Jesus and the Republican presidential candidates are nothing like each other.

 ‘Good Guy With A Gun’ Threatens To Shoot McDonald’s Drive-Thru Worker (VIDEO),"Not a day goes by when a prominent figure on the Right doesn t remind us that  good guys with guns    basically anyone carrying a firearm at any given moment   will act as our saviors whenever a  bad guy  threatens. These glorious figures, Sent from God herself,  act as paladins of justice, dispensing it in the form of hot pieces of lead at a speed of 2,500 feet per second. Unfortunately, at a moment s notice, someone thought to be a  good guy  could easily reveal himself to be anything but that.Police in Murray, Utah were called after a McDonald s drive-thru customer pulled a gun out and threatened to shoot employees. The unidentified man can be seen on video arguing with an employee. At first, a white Subaru Outback can be seen pulling away, but the vehicle stops about 40 feet from the window. Three men exit the car and the driver of the vehicle walks back to the window, pointing his gun inside. I don t need this,  the gunman yelled, apparently failing to realize that he probably didn t need to bring a Second Amendment Solution to an argument over food.Fortunately, one of his friends pulls him away before he has a chance to open fire. It makes you think, if he was going to shoot one person, how do we know he wasn t going to jump through and do the rest,  employee Michela Spikes told FOX13.  I ve got a 15-month-old son I got to think about. Watching the video, she remarked that it   looks like he was actually serious about to do something  right before the man in the gray-hooded sweatshirt pulls the angry ammosexual away from the confrontation.It s nice to think that the average human is responsible enough to carry around a weapon that can end numerous lives in seconds. Unfortunately, all too often guns are used to resolve minor conflicts, to chase down shoplifters, end abortion forever, solve disputes over roadkill, express displeasure at getting stuck behind a snow plow during a blizzard, or check who s downstairs. Everyone wants to think of themselves as a  good guy.  In fact, in many situations, the  bad guy  still views himself as the opposite. Think about it: the average man can t be trusted to put the toilet seat down reliably, and we re trusting him to carry around something that gives him the power to decide life or death? [Author s Note: If you accept this as a scientific argument, you re an idiot.]A study published in the American Journal of Public Health notes that for  each percentage point increase in gun ownership, the firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9%.  Researchers could not determine causation, but  found that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides. Of course, it s also important to consider that the presence of a gun in the first place increases the likelihood of this sort of incident. Guns not only permit violence, they can stimulate it as well,  Leonard Berkowitz, Emeritus Professor of Psychology, University of Wisconsin, said after conducting a 1967 study on the effect of weapons on aggression.  The finger pulls the trigger, but the trigger may also be pulling the finger. Psychology Today notes:In 1967, Leonard Berkowitz and Anthony LePage conducted a fascinating study. First, participants were angered by a person pretending to be another participant (called a confederate). Next, participants were seated at a table that had a shotgun and a revolver on it or, in the control condition, badminton racquets and shuttlecocks. The items on the table were described as part of another experiment that the researcher had supposedly forgotten to put away. The participant was supposed to decide what level of electric shock to deliver to the confederate who had angered them, and the electric shocks were used to measure aggression. The experimenter told participants to ignore the items on the table, but apparently they could not. Participants who saw the guns were more aggressive than were participants who saw the sports items. This effect was dubbed the  weapons effect. Fortunately a  good guy without a gun  stepped in and prevented his friend from doing real harm.Watch a report on the incident below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Nominated For Nobel Peace Prize Despite Being Most Bigoted Kid On Playground,"Seldom in life are there truly head scratching moments that make you question all life and sanity, but Donald Trump being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize is definitely one of those moments. And no, this isn t satire.According to the announcement of those who have been nominated: US Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has also been nominated for the prize, according to Nobel watcher Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo.According to a copy of the nomination letter Harpviken said he had received, brash tycoon Trump   who has attracted international condemnation by calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States   deserves the prize for  his vigorous peace through strength ideology, used as a threat weapon of deterrence against radical Islam, ISIS, nuclear Iran and Communist China . However, it was definitely made known that anyone can be nominated, so his nomination is not indicative of his actual actions and behavior. Thousands of people around the world are allowed to make nominations for the Peace Prize, including members of parliament and government ministers, former laureates and some university professors.The Nobel Institute accepts all valid nominations, so having one s name on the list is not to be taken as a sign of approval. Further proof that anyone, and I mean anyone, can be nominated can be found in the fact that right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh was also nominated many years ago.Clearly, Trump shouldn t be a top contender considering his play for peace is through hate and war. Which, of course, in fancy-speak would sound something like  vigorous peace through strength .. but no, it s rather sanity through means of insanity, and it doesn t add up.Other nominees include  Germany s Angela Merkel, Pope Francis, and the Greek islanders who helped desperate migrants.  Edward Snowden, the man who leaked intel for the sake of fame reform is also a contender.At the end of the day, anyone can be nominated, but it doesn t mean that they ll win. However, the fact that Trump was even nominated is terrifying in and of itself. We ll find out this October who actually takes home the prize. Hopefully, it will go to someone most deserving.

 Nazi-Ranting Man Accosts MSNBC Host At Iowa Caucus,"A man ranting about Nazi Germany had a strange encounter with MSNBC host and college professor Melissa Harris-Perry at the Iowa caucuses this week. Perry was with some of her students in a hotel lobby in Des Moines where a man she doesn t remember ever speaking to came up to her and began speaking, oddly acting as if they were in mid-conversation.Harris-Perry wrote about the odd incident on her website.When he started he speaking it was like he was picking up in the middle of sentence, finishing a conversation we had begun earlier, but I couldn t remember ever meeting him. So what is it that you teach? I am a professor of political science. My wife is a professor of communications. Does she teach here in Iowa? What I want to know is how you got credentialed to be on MSNBC. I am not sure if it is how he spat the word credentialed, or if it is how he took another half step toward me, or if it is how he didn t respond to my question, but the hairs on my arm stood on end. I ignored it. Told myself everything was ok. Well. It is not exactly a credential  I began. But why you? Why would they pick you? Perry said the man now sounded angry and began to get closer to her. As the victim of a previous violent crime, she became more upset and agitated at the provocation. The situation escalated:I freeze. He speaks. And moves closer. Is there a knife under the coat? A gun? Worse?And I can t hear all the words. But I catch  Nazi Germany  and I catch  rise to power.  But I can t move. I am lulled by a familiar powerlessness, muteness, that comes powerfully and unexpectedly. It grips me. Everything is falling away. Until in my peripheral vision I catch sight of a ponytail, the movement of an arm, the sound of familiar young voices and I remember  my students.She jumped up and rejoined her students, telling the hotel authorities about the bizarre encounter, though they don t appear to have taken any action.While he only got second place in the caucuses, Donald Trump s campaign has made an appeal to extremist racists and bigots, speaking in a racist manner that was previously only done behind closed doors. Now they re coming out into the light, and apparently trying to intimidate progressive figures like Harris-Perry, who have often been the target of attacks and ridicule by conservative and conservative media outlets like Rush Limbaugh and Fox News.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Tenn Republican Flips Out, Calls Female Reporter A ‘B*tch’ Over A Taxpayer Funded $614 Picture Frame","A Tennessee Republican has quit his job after he flipped out on a reporter who wanted to know why he was spending taxpayer money on lavish treats for himself.Ron Buchanan, the GOP election commission chair for Davidson County had a run in with WSMV-TV reporter Alanna Autler, last Friday. The reporter asked him to explain a $123 dollar charge for a dinner in Nashville last June. Buchanan, clearly not happy that he was being called out for his spending said, That charge was for a business meeting to discuss the budget on June 30 when the budget was approved July 1 and it was a very legitimate purchase. Autler asked him why he didn t go to a less expensive restaurant and he replied, That s it,  and started to walk away. Unperturbed by his briskness, the reporter asked about a large picture frame that was bought with the county credit card: Can you explain the picture frame that was $614? This is when the Republican got really pissed off and responded by calling her a vulgar name: That s it. That s exactly the b*tch I thought you would be. Autler asked him to repeat himself, You want to say that again, Mr. Buchanan?  When she asks him that, a commission spokesperson gets in between the two.  She asks, Do not touch me. Do you want to say that again for the camera? Buchanan then storms into another room to get away from her. After the interview was aired the Republican  apologized,  but not really: I should not have used that terminology, but as the media has the freedom of press, individuals have the freedom of speech. And I can tell her what I think about her. And I did that, and I don t apologize for it. There are people that don t think I should have done it and that it hurts politics in this area, and so be it. The irresponsible, abusive man resigned shortly after and Nashville Mayor Megan Barry (D) has revoked the county credit card until an audit can be performed.Republicans pride themselves on their fictional  fiscal conservatism,  so it s always amusing when they are exposed for the liars that they really are. This jackhole was so angry that he was called out for his exorbitant spending that he had an on camera temper tantrum.

 ‘Christian’ Dad Beat Daughter With Frozen Bacon While Quoting Bible — For Jesus,"It s always amazing how many folks who claim to be Christians are exactly nothing like Jesus. On Tuesday, an 11-year-old Michigan girl burst into tears intermittently as she testified in court that her father, 45-year-old Jonathan A. Powell,  beat her with frozen bacon as he quoted the Bible.In January, the girl and her sister went to stay with Powell at his home for the weekend when her father, for one reason or another, decided to dish out some good, old-fashioned Biblical punishment. He was hitting me with his elbows, his upper arms, and his hands,  the girl said while describing an assault that began in the kitchen, adding she didn t know why he had decided to beat her Her father pulled bacon from the freezer and began hitting her over the head with it: He was hitting me with frozen bacon and he was pushing me back and I fell right over the dishwater. I broke it. He was just yelling that the dishwasher was broken. The girl retreated to the bedroom, but the assault continued: I ran over to my room and my sister was asking me what was wrong. I was in my room for a while. I heard him swearing, saying,  You B-word, you broke my dishwasher.' Her father began banging on her door, the girl recalled as she burst into tears. She explained that Powell entered her room and pulled on the bed, causing her to hit her head on the wall. He then  threw a tantrum  and began hitting her with his hands and arms, bloodying her nose. This new assault, which lasted approximately 10 minutes, was justified with the Bible: He said,  It s OK to do that, it s from the Bible   if you spare the rod, you spoil the child.  He just said that. Or, in this case,  bacon  rather than  the rod. She says she then texted her mother and let her know she wanted to go home early, but Powell refused to take her home until she finally told her mother what had been done to her. The mother contacted the police, who took photographs that showed injuries to the side of her face.Powell is charged with one count of third-degree child abuse, for which he faces up to two years in prison   where he ll have plenty of time to pray about what he did.Featured image via Michigan Live",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 McConnell Lets Slip Republicans Plan On Doing Nothing In 2016 And The Reason Is Infuriating,"If you ever find yourself struggling to explain to a foreign friend why the U.S. Congress is so universally reviled, look no further than this bit of political cowardice.In an explosive report by The Hill s Alexander Bolton, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s office freely and openly admitted that his party s legislative goal for the next 11 months is to do absolutely nothing.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), seeking to protect his majority in a tough cycle for Republicans, is leaning toward holding back several measures that have bipartisan support but are divisive in his conference.Some of these  divisive  bills that Republicans want to shove under the rug until they win their re-elections? A crucial justice reform bill. A long sought after authorization bill to combat ISIS (Remember when Republicans said they were serious about fighting terrorism? Ha!). A minimum wage increase? Any action on immigration? Nothing. They ll show up to their office to collect their paychecks, hold a few fundraisers, but don t expect them to do their jobs. Not this year.Astoundingly, McConnell s  Do Nothing  strategy is being praised by fellow Republicans. Here s The Hill again: McConnell is smart to wait on issues that divide us until such time as we can achieve a consensus,  said a senior Republican aide.  There s no question that some members want to turn to some things sooner than others. But McConnell s duty is to do what s best for the entire conference. Seems what s best for the conference is to focus on the things that unite us. Yeah, sitting on his hands until they go numb, what a hero.But if cowardice permeates every corner of the Republican Party, it s not without reason. For years Republican politicians have been held hostage by a radical fringe of their base that says any bipartisan cooperation means you aren t a  true  conservative. Just passing a bill to give more support to veterans is considered a  betrayal  to the party if it means working with Democrats. You accomplish exclusively conservative goals or you don t accomplish anything at all.McConnell, with all the backbone of a snail, isn t taking any chances. He ll wait out the election and hope that voters focus on how his party never once compromised with  the enemy,  and not, say, on the fact that they hadn t done their jobs for 12 months.How does he plan to cover his tracks? It s shameless   but kind of clever. McConnell plans to intentionally slow down and string out the dozen annual appropriations bills. Those can be addressed individually and, if time is properly squandered, can go on pretty much indefinitely. By the end of the year, with 12 appropriations bills in hand, he can brag about having done something. Just not very much.When we think about how the election cycle brings out the worst in politicians, we typically picture the attack ads, the rat race, the pettiness. There s another side: The craven attempt to cling onto jobs by a group of people who demonstrably do not deserve them. It means in this crucial year, when the United States faces a ton of major challenges, Americans will be treated to nothing   and all because a few politicians are worried what their most toxic supporters would think if they actually bothered show up to work.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr ",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Right-Wing Terrorist Found With Shrapnel-Filled Bombs Has A Facebook Page Filled With Crazy (VIDEO),"The Republican Party has spent more than seven years pushing anti-government ideas. After President Obama was elected in 2008, there was an explosion of right-wing domestic terror organizations in the USA. The Southern Poverty Law Center released a study that found these organizations experienced an eightfold growth from 2008 (149 groups) to 2012 s 1,360 radical militias. A young man in Tampa, Florida belonged to one of these  patriotic  militias and now he is in jail   for making bombs.A potential right-wing terrorist was arrested this week after his business partner reported that he d seen bombs inside his house. Kenneth Ray O Neill recently went to his partner Michael Ramos  home and saw a crate with about half a dozen pipe bombs in it. Ramos, who s a member of the United States Patriot Army,  told O Neill that he made the bombs from materials purchased on Amazon with his girlfriend s credit card. According to Fox 13 News:Ramos said he made the  black powder  filler with supplies and chemicals purchased from Amazon.com, then added  bird shot  to the powder. Written in the affidavit, Ramos said  it would kill the neighbors if one of the bombs went off. O Neill told police that he warned Ramos that if he did not get rid of the bombs, he was going to go to the police. Ramos became hostile when his partner and his brother, Ryan O Neill, issued the ultimatum. According to Kenneth, Ramos was standing next to an AK-47 assault rifle when the conversation took place. Ryan calmed Ramos down and the brothers left   that s when the authorities were informed.On Monday search warrants were executed on the  patriot s  home and agents found eight pipe bombs, tear gas and smoke grenades. They also found the AK-47, a pistol and a large quantity of ammo.After his arrest Ramos told police that he had the bombs for preparedness/protective  reasons.A look at Ramos  Facebook and you can see that he is clearly a nutjob: I m sure he s totally harmless and just needs security. Right.This is a common excuse among the insane right. They claim that they stockpile weapons because they need to protect themselves, but it s not exactly clear who they are protecting themselves from. If it s from Obama you have to wonder why? It s been seven years since he was elected to office and he has tried exactly zero times to take over the world and confiscate their guns.I imagine it is really hard to walk through life with so much fear .and stupidity. Thankfully, Ramos  business partner did the right thing and contacted police before someone was hurt.

 The Website Loser.com Will Now Redirect You To Trump’s Wikipedia Page Following Iowa Loss (IMAGES),"After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suffered a truly embarrassing second-place loss to rival Ted Cruz in Iowa, the internet was quick to humble the usually overly-confident front-runner.On Tuesday morning, the website Loser.com joined those trolling Trump by hilariously redirecting its domain name to Trump s Wikipedia page   clearly rubbing it in considering Trump had been especially cocky about winning the Iowa caucus for several months.Trump s Wikipedia pageBrian Connelly has been the domain s owner since 1995 and has routinely been using it to mock whoever happens to deserve it based on current events in the news. This particular redirect, as almost anyone with half a mind would agree, was certainly well-earned.Licking his wounds, Trump was also busy on the internet on Tuesday. He went into recovery mode by spending his entire morning reaming and blaming voters for his loss in Iowa. Shaming both voters and media alike, Trump tweeted: I don t believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it! The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! In all honesty, Trump s loss to Cruz was so much celebrated by the internet and social media, that one of Trump s own tweets from 2014 was repurposed for an entirely appropriate revival:Trump twitterAnd brilliantly enough, one other website has joined in the redirecting fun after the caucus: the website nobodyrememberswhocameinsecond.com is now leading people to a particularly unflattering YouTube video of Trump.This devastating loss in Iowa has definitely had an effect on Trump. Now moving onto the New Hampshire primary, Trump s previously unshakeable confidence seems to be somewhat deflated. Clearly missing half the ego he used to speak with, Trump said, I think we re going to be proclaiming victory, I hope.

 This Ego-Killing Jeb Bush Infographic Shows How Expensive It Is For Billionaires To Back Losers,"Jeb Bush was supposed to be the adult among the children in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. He was even considered the inevitable nominee by some, particularly due to his fundraising capability. They sure were wrong, as you will see below.Jeb never really caught fire among voters, but somehow he did among billionaires and other corporate interests looking to pen a 4-year lease on an American president. Jeb had a total of $155.6 million raised for his presidential bid as of February 1st, 2016. $31.9 million was by him directly, with nearly $124 million more by PACS. On the night of the first caucus in the nation, he had spent a total of $24.3 million   about $14 million of it in Iowa alone.For all the inevitability his money supposedly ensured, Jeb ended up with a humiliating 2.8 percent portion of the vote during the Iowa Republican Caucus. This worked out to just over a measly 5,000 votes, which netted him one whole delegate. Ouch. Going with just the Iowa money for the ad-buys leading up to the caucus, Jeb ended up paying about $2,800 per vote.Dang, Jeb. https://t.co/RGVSCgsJaL pic.twitter.com/6tJjkEZMZS  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) February 2, 2016To put this into context, Ted Cruz spent under $250 dollars per vote he received, and Trump spent even less. The pair claimed both first and second place at the end of the night. This begs the question,  Have we hit the limit of how much money is able to influence an election?  While you can t deny the effect that vast sums of corporate money have in politics, all the money in the nation won t polish everyone to an acceptable level of shine. Jeb is an embarrassing example of that in the 2016 election cycle.While technically Jeb has a possibility of finding new footing for himself in New Hampshire, the likelihood of a campaign resurrection is low. Trump is looking far stronger there with a 38 percent lead, as Cruz comes in second at 12 percent. Jeb is in the rear guard again at a weak 10 percent. He has the most money to burn, outside of Trump. Do you think it would help him at all, or is the Bush legacy too much of a curse for him to bear?Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin Oddly Brings Up Justin Bieber During Abortion Talk – Watch Jake Tapper’s Face (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin is back at it again. Only this time, Jake Tapper was caught in her crosshairs. While discussing Donald Trump s flip-flopping on the issue of abortion, Palin somehow was inspired to bring Justin Bieber into the debate. Let s just say CNN host Jake Tapper, wasn t exactly prepared for that. It took him completely off-guard.Here was their exchange, in part:Tapper: Donald Trump is somebody who clearly has had different positions on issues than he has today, including an issue very near and dear to your heart, the issue of abortion and life.Palin: I am so glad Trump has seen the light.There are groups that are pro-life; they are giving Trump a hard time on his views of abortion while they re celebrating others like, umm, I was going through a list, like Justin Bieber, and umm, gosh Tapper: Justin Bieber?Palin: Yeah, yeah .Pic via screen capture.We can only imagine what was going through his head when she said that. The expression on his face, though, was utterly PRICELESS. That much is for certain.So, why then, was Palin bringing up Justin Bieber? We were curious. We did some digging, and apparently the teen heartthrob made some past statements about  waiting until you re in love  before you do anything with a girl, and,  I don t really believe in abortion .It s like killing a baby.  He said that back in 2011. Why that s relevant, we still don t know.We re also not sure what s going through Donald Trump s head by his continuing to let Mrs. Palin stump for him. Why is she still doing interviews? Personally, we love it. We hadn t laughed this much since, well, when Trump began running. It s like every single interview is a skit straight out of Saturday Night Live. Laughter is the best medicine, they say.Featured image from screen capture.",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin Just Openly Admitted She Prefers Being Interviewed By Children Over The Press,"At this point, pretty much everyone knows that failed vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin hates the media. She hates being called out, and she hates being asked questions she just doesn t know the answer to   which is pretty much every question. She clearly gets embarrassed, and instead of owning up to the fact that she just simply doesn t know an answer, she blames the press for depicting her as a moron. Little does she know, she does that to herself.However, people with narcissistic personality disorder seldom see the error in their own ways and will often shift blame. You can see this with Donald Trump and in his new #1 fan, Sarah Palin. They only see themselves as perfect and anyone who dares make them look otherwise is clearly just wrong.Case in point: Palin, upon leaving Iowa, met up with some lovely students at the Des Moines airport. She could have just left it there and said something nice, but instead she had to throw a jab at the press calling them  media jackals.  She also openly admitted that she prefers being interviewed by these children over credentialed professional journalists.Palin wrote on Facebook (as she does): Willow and I find it nice to be stuck in Des Moines airport with great kids like this Santa Monica class that traveled to the Iowa caucus on a field trip. (Preferable to some media jackals weather-delayed in here, too. I asked a few of them to take lessons from these 6th graders.) Such polite students, asking the best questions about our political system! Told them it was the best interview of the week! // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Willow and I find it nice to be stuck in Des Moines airport with great kids like this Santa Monica class that traveled Posted by Sarah Palin on Tuesday, February 2, 2016And while some may say that going after her for this post is pretty petty, let s think about that for a second. Palin has consistently gone after the  lamestream media  for asking her  gotcha questions  all the time.  Gotcha questions  of course being questions she has no clue how to answer and doesn t want to be perceived as an idiot, so she flips the script back on those posing the question.It makes perfect sense that Palin would want to be interviewed by a bunch of 6th graders. Individuals that she may actually know more than   or at least they won t know when she s lying and making things up. Even better that they won t call her out. So, if Palin is going to make a point of telling the world that she prefers 6th graders over the  media jackals,  well, she deserves to be called out on it. She hates the media, because the media holds her accountable.Featured image: Flickr",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Poll Shows A Huge Chunk Of Federal Employees Would Quit Under Trump Presidency,"A huge number of federal employees wouldn t be able to stand their jobs if Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump won the next presidential election. According to a survey done by the Government Business Council, a quarter of government employees find Trump so unbearably repulsive that they would actually quit.The breakdown revealed that 14% of workers surveyed would definitely jump ship, and 11% stated that they d consider leaving their jobs   resulting in a potential 25% of federal employees terminating their positions. It could be disastrous, when you imagine all the government agencies   such as the post office and our VA system   which are normally understaffed to begin with   trying to function with 25% fewer people. The results of Trump s presidency could be damaging on every level.When broken down by party, 42% of Democrats said they d consider leaving, compared to just 8% of Republicans. The survey also revealed that regardless of their political party, almost 60% of federal employees admitted they d be  embarrassed  to call Trump their boss. This was much higher than any of the Democratic candidates such as Hillary Clinton (49%) and Bernie Sanders (37%).To make matters even more embarrassing for the GOP, survey participants were also asked how they felt about their current boss, President Barack Obama   and the majority (56%) of Democratic employees said they would be honored to support him for a third term (if he was permitted one).So while Donald Trump might continue to be popular in the polls, this study reveals that many Americans are still level-headed and quite humiliated by the idea that he might be given the chance to lead this country. You can t get a much clearer sign than 1 in 4 people quitting their jobs to demonstrate just how vile the idea of Trump in the White House is.This poll was conducted at the end of January, and used data from 688 federal employees with a margin of error give or take four percentage points. Of those surveyed, 42% called themselves Republicans, 31% identified as Democrats, while 8% said they did not know and 19% wouldn t state their party.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Has Some News As To Who She’s Endorsing,"If there s one person who is loved by all in the Democratic Party, it s Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Her no-nonsense attitude and get it done approach to policy and politics are things that cannot be matched. She is so loved that her endorsement of any particular candidate is one that is sought after and coveted.People have been waiting on pins and needles to see who Warren will endorse in the Democratic primary. Will it be Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton? And after the Iowa caucuses, where Hillary and Bernie were in a statistical tie, people would like to know now, more than ever, who she will pick in hopes that it will push one candidate ahead over the other.However, Warren, being the magnificent person that she is, is choosing to focus on the issues  and not to politicize things by muddying the waters with support for any one candidate, said: No endorsements now. I think that what the Democrats are doing is terrific. We re out talking about the issues. I look at the Republican debates and the difference between what they re doing and what the Democrats are doing that really shows who s on whose side. Warren knows that when you pick a particular side of the debate the message can sometimes be lost. Both Hillary and Bernie are talking about the economy. Both Hillary and Bernie are talking about making healthcare and college affordable. Both Hillary and Bernie are seeking to continue progress in the United States and not let the reins fall back in to the hands of Republicans. Warren is letting the issues be explored, and solutions be offered, while letting the people decide for themselves.Both candidates running would love a Warren endorsement. She s showed support for both Sanders and Clinton in their approach to Wall Street and what needs to be done. So, while many supporters of either candidate will love to say that she s  hinted  at one candidate or the other, cases can be made for both. So, like Warren said in regards to if she ll announce who she s endorsing,  we ll see.  And everyone knows that s code for,  I m not telling you either way.

 Rubio Copied One Of Obama’s Most Famous Speeches – And Obama’s Speechwriter Just Called Him On It,"Marco Rubio may have come in third in the Iowa caucus behind both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, but for reasons that remain unclear his team   and the media   are treating it like he just locked up the presidency. (Don t break out the champagne just yet, Rubio fans, third place finishers almost never end up winning the nomination.)But clearly thrilled with the narrative that he had pulled off a political upset by coming in third Rubio delivered a tone-deaf  victory  speech about how no one thought he could do it  come in third, that is. So this is the moment they said would never happen. For months, for months they told us we had no chance. For months they told us because we offer too much optimism in a time of anger, we had no chance. For months they told us because we didn t have the right endorsements or the right political connections, we had no chance. They told me that we have no chance because my hair wasn t gray enough and my boots were too high. To political insiders watching the speech, there was growing bafflement. Anyone with any familiarity with one of Obama s most iconic speeches   when he won the Iowa caucus in 2008, a very real upset   noticed immediately that Rubio was pretty much plagiarizing the sitting-president almost verbatim.Here s Obama s: They said this day would never come. They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose. But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn t do. Like any copy-cat, Rubio s version paled in comparison to the original. Obama s speech was forceful, aspirational, and concise. It set the tone for Obama s entire campaign. Here was an underdog who no one believed could do it, handily beating the favored choices. As a result, Obama s comments felt earned. Rubio is using a more  fake it til you make it  approach.Hilariously, Obama s former speechwriter was one of the people scratching their heads at Rubio s carbon copy. He scorched Rubio s campaign in a tweet.He could've at least thanked Obama for the opening line https://t.co/meP627U6pv  Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) February 2, 2016Obviously, Rubio couldn t thank Obama for giving him his speech. Rubio has, like all Republicans, continually bashed the president to score cheap political points. Ironically   and this really is shaping up to be the year that irony jumped the shark   Rubio may owe his entire presidential campaign to Obama s history-making one just eight years ago. Like Obama, Rubio is young and relatively inexperienced in national politics. He s considered a long-shot, but one who hopes to appeal to younger generations.However, before we start viewing Rubio as a conservative Obama, let s remember the things that separate the two: Obama was young, but he was also a great magnetic personality. The vibrancy of his campaign and his own charisma gave him a huge boost, where so far Rubio blends into the background of nearly every stage he takes. He also has a history of politically-motivated flip flops, a Romney-esque ability to change with the direction of the wind and come out looking like both a moral coward and a shameful opportunist.But perhaps the most telling sign of Rubio s paper thin comparison to Obama is the fact that he has so little to say that he needs to borrow the words of Obama just to have a coherent message at all. Obama   love him or hate him   was his own man, Rubio is whoever you want him to be. And that s pretty sad.Feature image via Flickr",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s The Excuse Trump Made For Losing Iowa – Says Running No Longer ‘Worth It’ (IMAGES),"Donald Trump didn t exactly have the best showing in Iowa, at least, not for a guy who said just before the caucuses began that he would have a  tremendous victory.  He ended up finishing 2nd, a full 4 points behind Ted Cruz and ended up tying with Marco Rubio for seven delegates.While he didn t throw a huge tantrum on stage, he isn t exactly being that presidential about it, either. Behind the scenes you know he must be fuming mad. Rarely is he silent on Twitter, and after the loss he didn t tweet a word; there was just silence for 14 long hours. Losing Iowa finally brought Donald Trump back down to earth, and if you re able to gather anything from his latest tweet, it s that he doesn t handle losing very well. Instead of preparing himself for the oath of office, and acting presidential, he had to find a way to offer an excuse. And, boy did he.Pic via Twitter.Trump has been known for quite some time for saying anything and everything on the popular site, and normally we could care a less, but he needs to be called out for being a sore loser. Shortly afterwards, he also posted a cryptic message that made it seem like he wasn t as interested in running for president anymore. Really? Here was what he said, in part: I will keep doing, but not worth it! What exactly does this mean? It must mean he doesn t think running for president is worth it unless people give him credit for things. That, or self-funding his campaign isn t worth it enough for him to be president. Either way, if Trump doesn t self-fund his own campaign he d be beholden to outside groups and special interests, and has already said himself that he doesn t want that. So, according to his own rules, he has to fund his it. There s no other way according to him. And, to make matters worse, it s already been proven that he is, in fact, NOT self-funding his campaign. Go figure. So, what he says is not even true. For more on this, visit HERE. He s in this for the attention and nothing else. He could care a less about  Making America Great Again. Pic via Twitter.Here s news for you, Donald: being president is much harder than this. You don t give up after the first contest. And, you sure as heck don t complain. That  loser  front page cover from the New York Daily News must have really got to him.Featured image from Facebook",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FBI Joins Investigation Of Michigan’s Governor Rick Snyder Over Flint Water Crisis,"After months of people calling for the arrest of Michigan s governor Rick Snyder, the FBI is now getting involved with the ongoing criminal investigation into Snyder s possible culpability in the Flint water crisis.Gina Balaya, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney s Office in Detroit, told Reuters that Michigan prosecutors will be  working with a multi-agency investigation team on the Flint water contamination matter, including the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the EPA s Office of Inspector General   and the EPA s Criminal Investigation Division. In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster. There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water.One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. There is legislation crawling through Congress that would provide Flint $600 million dollars to help repair Flint s water system.There has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one. When evidence was shown that Flint s water had become contaminated, Snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act.The news that the FBI will be joining the investigation into the Snyder administration comes just one day before central figures are scheduled to testify before the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The Detroit News reports: Former Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley may refuse to testify before a U.S. House hearing Wednesday on the lead contamination of Flint s water supply, according to two congressional sources.Earley, the current emergency manager of financially ailing Detroit Public Schools, oversaw Flint when the decision was made in April 2014 to switch the city s drinking water supply to the Flint River.The other officials are Joel Beauvais, acting deputy assistant administrator of the Office of Water at the EPA; Miguel Del Toral, a water expert for the EPA s Midwest Region 5 Water Division; and Marc Edwards, professor of environmental and water resources engineering at Virginia Tech University, who discovered high lead levels in Flint s water. The FBI has not yet made a public comment on what federal laws the Snyder administration may have broken.One thing is for certain, Snyder and his cronies are not going to get themselves out of this mess with a slick public relations scheme. They seem to think differently, as Snyder recently hired two PR firms. People are calling for Snyder s arrest and this move from the FBI sends another signal that they might just get their way.Featured Image Credit: Michigan Municipal League via Flickr",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michele Bachmann Confuses Direct-To-DVD Movie Plots With Reality In New Obama Antichrist Theory,"Picture it. A marginalized but divinely inspired individual (Michele Bachmann) makes the HUGE discovery that the Bible predicts a global conspiracy. It s engineered by the Antichrist (President Obama) to get the world to declare war on Israel, steal their energy and usher in the end of the world. Will Michele be able to beat the odds and save us all from destruction?SPOILER ALERT   She already did. It seriously sounds like the plot to a 99 cent movie in the discount DVD bin, but sadly it isn t anything so harmless. Right Wing Watch reported that America s most adorable prophetic savior, Michele Bachmann, announced how the Bible told her the Syrian civil war is just a false flag operation to cover up a plan by Obama to kick-start Armageddon. Bachmann also said that world leaders were set to grant  legitimacy to the Islamic State,  Russian and Iranian intervention in Syria was a setup to invade Israel by those nations and China will be helping Russia and Iran to help make sure it matches biblical prophecy better.Bachmann then linked this all to President Obama becoming the Antichrist by transforming into an  evil world leader  secretary-general of the United Nations. Bachmann was quoted as saying Obama would only  go into an empowered, powerful UN, that was powerful enough to see the United States come under the UN s authority. Since we won t be getting anything sensible out of Michele, Right Wing Watch thankfully found where she got her idea. It turns out it wasn t from the Bible but from a report in the right-wing rag Investor s Business Daily. IBD cited what may be a non-existent report from Al-Jarida that this is happening. Al-Jarida is the same publication that suggested Obama will shoot down Israeli aircraft if they try to attack Iran, so their credibility is dubious at best. Either way you look at it, it seems Michele saved the world yet again by letting Obama s secret out and ruining his plans.Listen to Michele Bachmann tell you about Obama, the Antichrist, and all that nonsense below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244927649  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Literally NOBODY Is More Upset About Trump’s Defeat In Iowa Than Ann Coulter (TWEETS),"Christian Conservative extremist and blowhard Ann Coulter took to Twitter after Donald Trump s surprise defeat in Iowa on Monday night, with a lengthy and hysterical rant that suggest literally nobody is more upset about this loss than her.Poor Ann Coulter. She s been having a fabulous time riding on Trump s coat tails these last few months, and then out of nowhere, defeat. Let s face it, her last brain cell died of loneliness some considerable time ago and she simply has neither the real nor emotional intelligence to deal with such a shock to the system. Plus, she has access to Twitter. Let the lunacy commence.She sowed a little lie ahead of time, just in case Trump did get a drubbing. Apparently, Fox News are trying to keep Trump out of the White House. You know, those liberal hippies at Fox!GOPs just show up & vote. Fox trying to suppress Trump vote by telling 1st time caucusers that GOPs bicker all nite. https://t.co/9UTwAGYpdf  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 2, 2016Then she spent some considerable time attacking Marco Rubio for coming such a close third to Trump. With Trump on 24% and Rubio on 23%, there was just 1% in it. Coulter refers to the son of Cuban immigrants as  the sweaty little Mario .Fox is slyly denigrating Cruz by ignoring him. IT APPEARS HE'S ABOUT TO WIN. But it's all hands on deck for the sweaty little Mario.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 2, 2016But although Trump lost, he won to the only people who matter to Ann Coulter. First, the evangelical Christians. Coulter wants a Christian Conservative champion in the White House, hence her denigration of Rubio and her reluctant acceptance of Ted Cruz as Plan B.CNN's John King just explained that TRUMP is winning the most heavily Evangelical areas of the state! GO CHRISTIANS!  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 2, 2016Not just Christians that Coulter prefers though is it? No, Coulter seems to think the ethnicity of voters makes the vote more powerful too.Trump is the leading GOP vote-getter tonight, among natural-born-American candidates.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 2, 2016Who are these  natural-born-American  candidates? The likes of Trump and Huckabee of course. To a thoroughbred racist like Coulter, Rubio, Carson and Cruz might well make themselves Evangelical enough, but they will never make themselves white enough. They just aren t good old-fashioned European immigrants to the United States, like the other children of immigrants in the race.So after a quick outburst of vitriol against Ted Cruz for winning and being a bit too Cuban and Canadian Has Cruz stopped speaking yet? I went out to get a sandwich 40 minutes in.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 2, 2016 she turned on the caucus itself.Yes, I can barely remember Reagan, Bush, McCain & Romney   all lost Iowa caucus, then became nominee (i.e. 1st!). https://t.co/o292AWWymj  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 2, 2016Finally this morning she was reduced simply to tweeting seemingly random numbers. To which some Twitter users had some brilliant responses.@AnnCoulter The number of babies you've eaten?  Donald J. Trump (@Re_lDonaldTrump) February 2, 2016 @AnnCoulter pic.twitter.com/Hj2DSD6Rk5  neilsaavy7099 (@714_319) February 2, 2016@AnnCoulter Is that the number of times you've pegged Hannity or the caliber of handgun you're going to use on yourself when Sanders wins?  Duke St. Rollins (@DukeStRollinsv2) February 2, 2016Sadly, not much sympathy around for Ann Coulter or her patron Donald trump this morning. But despite Coulter s bleating, choosing a Republican in this race is like choosing death by hanging, gas chamber or firing squad. You might have a personal preference, but every one of them is going to be fatal. The GOP s domination by extremist candidates is a death sentence, whichever candidate carries it out.

" Fox News Yuks It Up, Taunts The Donald Over The Reason For His Iowa Loss","Donald Trump has been gallivanting across America for months now talking about his own popularity and boasting about poll numbers. He gave the impression that he was invincible and his bid for thew presidency infallible. There s one thing you can t take from Donald Trump: He s extremely confident.Regardless of how he performed in the polls up until about a week ago, Trump made a mistake that an unlikely enemy to a Republican, Fox News, couldn t help but gloat over. Whether you call it ego, narcissism, pride or the delusional rantings of a bloviating blowhard, Trump s decision to boycott the last GOP debate may have just jumped up and bit him on the ass.It was just the Donald missing in South Carolina. It was his supporters; the idiots who will clap and shout for him no matter how stupid he sounds, creating a mob mentality and increasing his popularity among the fools who vote Republican in this country. In his absence, Ted Cruz and his supporters were able to steal the show, catapulting his campaign to a win in Iowa Monday night.Fox wasted no time gloating about the fact that trump s little bout of butcher is most likely what handed him his first taste of defeat. Fox correspondent John Roberts told anchor Bret Baier that Marco Rubio s surge with people who were later in deciding who to vote for showed that Trump s refusal to be in the same room with Megyn Kelly probably cost him the win.Baier, being the good little puppet that he is, ran with that theory and began polling other Fox actors and actresses how they felt. Charles Krauthammer was hesitant to give all the credit to the skipped debate, adding that Rubio s performance was worthy of a bump, meaning he was watching a different debate than people who live in the real world. Rubio did nothing but yell generalities at the crowd in an attempt to seem less timid.Other Fox hosts were more eager to give their network at least some of the credit. According to Talking Points Memo:Baier floated the idea to conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, asking her to look  at the numbers and the surge that perhaps other candidates, Ted Cruz, Rubio had,  and weigh in on  the debate had any effect on these numbers? Baier presented the question to Fox News contributor Stephen Hayes as well, asking him if  can we definitively say that not going to the debate hurt Trump, a strategic error, that close? Pundit Kirsten Powers suggested that  Trump missed an opportunity to make his closing arguments  and  it looks like he s paying a price for it here. Fox News commentator Dana Perino argued that two polls that showed Rubio gaining traction were a  direct result  of the debate, comparing it to the last cycle, when  45 percent of people decided after the last debate in 2012. I think that looks like it could be true this time as well,  she said.While skipping the doom and gloom of a Fox News debate may not seem like a big deal to normal people, It certainly doesn t seem to have helped Donald Trump out at all.Featured image by Media Matters screen capture ",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Photo Of Donald Trump And His Daughter Will Creep You Out (TWEET),"Donald Trump is definitely a controversial figure and his run for the Republican nomination for the presidency has been a source of revulsion to many as a result of his racist and misogynist ways. Well folks, get ready to be repulsed even more! Here s a photo of the Donald and his natural born daughter Ivonka in 1996:A picture of Donald Trump, with his daughter Ivanka, perched atop two concrete parrots having sex. pic.twitter.com/TFse8gM1An  Tim Ireland (@bloggerheads) January 31, 2016Now, there are several things that are clearly wrong with this photo that would cause an involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one s stomach through the mouth.The most important reason: It s his daughter! Ivonka is sitting in between her dad s legs while he has his arms around her waist. This is not a photo of a loving father with his daughter. Rather, it s an older creepy looking dude with a very young woman.There are simply too many sexual messages in this photo that make it unnatural and wrong. For example, what the hell are those parrots in the photo doing? You guessed it, the big parrot is f***ing the little parrot!Ivanka Trump was born in 1981 and this photo was taken in 1996. That means that Ivonka was around 15 at the time the photo was taken. That means she s underage! Why would any parent allow his underage daughter to wear such an outfit knowing that millions of people will potentially see it? No responsible parent would do such a thing with his kid.Donald Trump has said some pretty creepy things about his daughter in the past. Here s what he said in 2006 on ABC s the View when the host asked him about how he would feel if Ivonka posed for Playboy: It would be really disappointing   not really   but it would depend on what s inside the magazine. I don t think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. I ve said if Ivanka weren t my daughter, perhaps I d be dating her. In 2003, Trump bragged about his daughter s body on the Howard Stern Show: You know who s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She s 6 feet tall, she s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model a tremendous amount. And this guy, folks, is leading the polls for the Republican nomination for the presidency of the United States. It tell us a lot about the Republican party.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons.

 Ben Carson Has A Very Public Meltdown After Getting Trashed In Iowa (VIDEO),"It hasn t been a very good time for Ben Carson s campaign to become America s first Black Republican President. But his very public meltdown after getting trashed in Iowa might suggest that he has no place anywhere near the red button anyway.Carson crashed badly in Iowa, picking up just 9% of the vote, leaving him in fourth place behind Ted Cruz (28%), Donald Trump (24%) and Marco Rubio (23%). His explanation? According to Carson, it s all a big conspiracy to keep him out of the race for President. He told supporters in a speech which felt rather more like a public nervous breakdown: I was reasonably happy today until I discovered the dirty tricks that were going on. And people spreading rumors that I had dropped out and that people should caucus for somebody else,  he continued.  I mean, do you think that that is something that s acceptable? Apparently, Carson is arguing that people didn t vote for him because Ted Cruz told them not to.The candidate insisted his campaign was not over, and yet boarded an early flight home to Florida for  rest    meanwhile, the other candidates headed straight to New Hampshire or South Carolina to battle the next stage of the Primaries.So while his opponents were off developing their strategy for the next battleground states, Carson decided to write an email to his supporters, and continue his meltdown in public. For months, my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to to detest the games of the political class, but in reality are masters at it,  he wrote. Even tonight, my opponents resorted to political tricks by tweeting, texting and telling precinct captains to announce that I had suspended my campaign   in some cases asking caucus goers to change their votes. What is considerably more certain than this conspiracy theory, is that Mr. Carson will be making that exiting from the race announcement soon. Hopefully with a little more grace than he could muster in Iowa.

 Donald Trump’s Hollywood Walk Of Fame Star Defaced With Brilliantly Appropriate Symbol (IMAGE),"Donald Trump is about as a racist as they come, no matter his claims to the contrary. His entire campaign has been a nod to the most vile elements of white supremacy and all manner of bigotry that the bowels of American culture has to offer. After all, he kicked off his circus of a campaign by declaring that  all Mexican immigrants are rapists, and later called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States   even those who are citizens but simply traveling abroad.These examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Trump s racist rhetoric, and some brilliant person decided to call Trump out for what he is in an amazingly brilliant way: by defacing his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a swastika. The vandalism apparently occurred on Friday and has since been cleaned up   but not before someone snapped a photo of it and uploaded it to social media site Reddit. Here is the image:Via RedditWhoever did this deserves a medal. Trump s rhetoric is definitely reminiscent of the tone that was the preamble for the horrors that occurred in Nazi Germany, and it needs to be called out for what it is.To the anonymous brave American who did this   sincerely, thank you.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NY Daily News Mocks ‘Bozo’ Trump’s Iowa Caucus Defeat With Yet Another Brilliant Cover (IMAGE),"Donald Trump, who notoriously called people who finish in second place  losers,  just had his words come back to bite him in the ass, and, as could be expected, the New York Daily News was right there to give him some much deserved mockery. They referred to Trump as  Dead Clown Walking  in the headline, and went on to call him a  bombastic Bozo  in the article.The paper, which has become known for its brilliantly blunt covers, didn t cut Trump any slack at all. They called it like they saw it once agains, and ran an absolutely delicious cover depicting Trump as a clown. We all know that Donald Trump is far too thin-skinned to be running for any political office, much less that of the presidency, and will likely blow a gasket and throw his gazillionth childish Twitter tantrum, as he always does when anyone mocks or criticizes him. Without further ado, here is the brilliant cover:via NY Daily NewsThis is nothing less than absolutely perfect. Trump s campaign has turned an important part of the American political process for a major party into little more than a circus. That s why people are calling them the GOP Clown Car. That s exactly what they are, and Trump has been in the driver s seat the entire time, driving that car straight into a hell of humiliation. Trump s remarks afterward may have been humble, but there was also a touch of fear to them. He said he was  really honored,  and then remarked on going to New Hampshire: We love New Hampshire. We will go on to win New Hampshire, we will go on to win the nomination. He then seemed to admit that he may not win the general, and even mused about his post-defeat plans: Who knows, I think I might come back here [Iowa] and buy a farm. Watching this buffoon lose is just the most delicious brand of schadenfreude imaginable at this point in time, and I, for one, will make sure to pop plenty of popcorn in anticipation of the inevitable Twitter tirade that is just waiting to burst forth.

 Trump LOVES To Bash Second Place Finishers And The Internet Couldn’t Wait To Remind Him,"Donald Trump came in second place in the Iowa caucus, and while it may not seem like a bad position to be in, it s a disaster for his campaign. Trump has always positioned himself as a  winner  and painted everyone lower than him in the polls as  losers.  He used his supposed popularity in the polls to justify all manner of nasty hate speech and shameful policies. His entire candidacy is hinged on him being the  best.  And he just lost.Second place might as well be last place. And nobody seems to believe that more than Donald Trump   and the internet couldn t wait to remind him about it.During Trump s long, mind-numbing, career on Twitter, he s repeatedly recycled a favorite quote of his from Walter Hagen: No one remembers who came in second. He tweeted it in 2013, and liked it so much that he then tweeted it again in 2014.Needless to say, the silly message stuck in people s minds, especially tonight when Trump found himself falling short to his rival Ted Cruz by a considerable margin. He may very well become the second place finisher that no one remembers.LOVE THIS QUOTE Cited by The Donald, Especially Tonight: Think It'll Haunt His Campaign? #IowaCaucus #uspoli #Iowa pic.twitter.com/zGOt7GiUib  Jim Harris (@JimHarris) February 2, 2016It will be fascinating to see how Trump handles losing. If history is any indication, he ll react very poorly. Throughout his campaign, we ve seen that any time his poll numbers started to slide or another candidate started to emerge as a threat, Trump has lashed out with ugly aggression. In a telling example, Trump was very friendly with Cruz when Cruz had no chance, but as he established himself, Trump quickly turned on him   even going full-birther on the Canadian born senator.Even more embarrassing for Trump, his  No one remembers who came in second  tweet began going viral. Having been dormant for years, suddenly just after Trump s loss in Iowa, the 2013 tweet began getting thousands of retweets. No one remembers who came in second.    Walter Hagen  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2013Perhaps, that will be Trump s legacy. Paradoxically taken down by the very blustering egomania that gave him a platform in the first place. Trump has gained thousands of fans by loudly claiming he wasn t a loser   what happens when they start to wander if maybe he is one after all?

" ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Road Rages, Threatens To Shoot Motorcyclist (VIDEO)","The National Rifle Association tells us that all we need to ensure our safety is a  good guy with a gun    a  responsible gun owner  who carries his weapon around with him, ready to leap into action at the drop of a hat and save the day when a  bad guy with a gun  causes trouble. Unfortunately, a  good guy  and  bad guy  with a gun look exactly the same until someone pulls out a weapon with nefarious intent.A Nevada man narrowly escaped an encounter with a good-guy-turned-bad-guy as he was riding his motorcycle with some friends along the highway. A man in a red pickup truck in a lane flipped a man who told KTNV he wishes to remain unidentified  the bird,  prompting the biker to confront him at a stop light. The man politely tapped on the window of the pickup truck in an effort to inquire as to what he did to enrage the men in the pickup truck. Unfortunately, there was no chance of diplomacy.As the passenger rolls down the window, he wells the driver Get that goddamn gun out, motherf*cker.  The driver, of course, listens. The driver immediately points the gun at the motorcyclist and demands,   Get the f*ck away from me. Asked why he flipped the motorcyclist off, the driver accuses a member of the group of wildly crossing through traffic  something that is not visible on the video the motorcyclist uploaded to YouTube. You re all about to f*cking get shot,  the passenger yells. Fortunately, no one was shot during the incident, and it is being investigated by the Henderson police. The motorcyclist says he regrets approaching the vehicle: No matter how big and bad you are or how much weight you lift, there s always somebody that s bigger and  badder  than you are that will put you in your place real quick. Unfortunately, in this situation, no one was  bigger  or  badder.  He encountered a small man whose own feelings of inadequacy caused him to react with threats of violence rather than words   a small man who happened to have a gun.Watch the incident unfold here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upcvq_n03LY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]And a news report here:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Cliven Bundy Takes Charge Of Remaining Oregon Militiamen, Says They Will Continue Occupation Indefinitely","With his son Ammon Bundy in jail with most of the the militants who had been occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon, Cliven Bundy has decided to take matters into his own hands. In a letter addressed to the authorities responsible for the arrests of many of the militants and the death of one, Cliven Bundy says that the folks still occupying the refuge will fight to the death. The letter read, in part: This is notice that We the People of Harney County and also We the People of the citizens of the United States DO GIVE NOTICE THAT WE WILL RETAIN POSSESSION OF THE HARNEY COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER. Harney County Resource Center  is the name the militants have given to the refuge in place of its original name.The letter was posted to the Bundy Ranch Facebook page, in full:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Notice to Harney Co. Sheriff.Share share share ..Posted by Bundy Ranch on Monday, February 1, 2016This stunt shows that Bundy is even more of an idiot than his son, who had requested that the occupation end after the arrests and after the death of LaVoy Finicum. Bundy said to the media during an interview: What this is saying is that Cliven Bundy is taking control of things. If we don t retain it, then we ve lost everything that we ve done in the last two months. We re not gonna give up. This is not Ammon s message. This is my message   We ve made a decision to retain it   The feds are going to get out of there. Remove all federal and state policing agents out of Harney County. So, with his son in jail along with the majority of supporters jailed as well, Cliven sees fit to make demands of all authorities. He also says that he does not believe that Ammon really wanted the occupation to end, but said that he did under duress: That s what he said, but I never believed it. I don t think that s what s in his heart. He probably got his arm twisted. Ammon Bundy s statement, however, seems to run contrary to what his father wants: To those who remain at the refuge, I love you. Let us take this fight from here   Please stand down. Go home and hug your families. This fight is ours for now, in the courts. The four who are left are choosing to remain, demanding that they not be prosecuted despite the huge number of crimes they have obviously committed.Bundy and all involved in emboldening this ridiculousness all need to go to jail for a long, long time, their demands be damned.

 Why Ted Cruz Winning The Iowa Caucus Could Doom The GOP,"Texas Senator Ted Cruz has won the 2016 Republican presidential caucus in Iowa. Cruz won with 99% of Iowa precincts reporting in. He earned 28% of the vote, with about 46,400 Republicans casting their vote for the social conservative.Cruz beat out Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, beating out the result of the highly respected Des Moines Register poll, that had put Trump ahead of Cruz by 5%.Many observers believe that Cruz was able to overcome Trump s constant media appearances and a campaign that sucked up a lot of the oxygen in the political world.While Cruz has won the caucus, history has not been kind to recent winners. The last two winners, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, received a bump in support after winning the caucus, but were not able to martial the religious right on to success in other states like South Carolina and New Hampshire.Cruz also faces headwinds from Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who did better than expected in a third place finish. It can be expected that money from the Republican establishment will flow to Rubio, continuing the stampede away from Jeb Bush who only managed a single digit in Iowa and is not expected to be a strong contender in New Hampshire.In a strange turn of events, Trump could act as a spoiler candidate, wedged between Cruz and Rubio but without being beholden to big ticket donors or the party elite.For the general election, many Democrats are probably salivating over a candidate like Cruz. He is anti-choice, a darling of the extremist right, and a candidate who has based his entire run on turning out far right voters instead of even remotely attempting to appeal to moderate, swing voters. Trump may have scared the party so much that Cruz now appears  acceptable  to them, but not to America.Featured image via Flickr",News,"February 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Martin O’Malley Suspends Campaign After Predictably Crushing Iowa Caucus Loss (TWEET),"Democratic presidential candidate Martin O Malley likely never really had a chance against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, but he has to be admired for staying in the race for so long, despite such consistently terrible poll numbers. However, all of that change the night of the Iowa Caucuses. Even before all of the votes were in, ABC News tweeted that the former Maryland governor is suspending his campaign.JUST IN: Sources close to Martin O'Malley campaign tell @ABC O'Malley will suspend his campaign tonight.  @maryaliceparks  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 2, 2016According to Town Hall, O Malley got less than one percent of the votes at the all-important caucus. This result is unsurprising, as nobody really thought that O Malley was a serious candidate.This is actually a good thing, because it s not like O Malley would have had a snowball s chance in hell of winning a general election against any serious GOP candidate, even if by some crazy twist of fate he had managed to beat both Bernie and Hillary in the primary to cinch the nomination.In short, Martin O Malley s candidacy was never anything more than an early election cycle distraction. No matter what one might think of his political positions, the guy was really never going to get very far, and thanks to the stakes being so high with the people we re up against on the crazy right, it s time to focus on the folks who can actually win.You had a good run, Governor O Malley.

" Trump Tells Fans To ‘Knock The Crap Out’ Of Protesters, Promises To Pay Legal Fees (VIDEO)","At a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump prefaced the caucus by inviting his loyal supporters to  knock the crap out of  protesters   and that he would take care of the legal consequences of any resulting violence.Trump began his invitation by saying he d received a warning from his  wonderful security guys.  He continued by referencing a recent incident where a heckler threw a few tomatoes at him during a rally: There may be somebody with tomatoes in the audience. So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell   I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise. It won t be so much  cause the courts agree with us too. Here s the footage of Trump encouraging his fans to be violent at his rally:This isn t much of a surprise from Trump   and without a doubt his supporters will be more than happy to take him up on that request. Trump s supporters have earned themselves a reputation for roughing up protesters, and Trump has done little to stop the violence   in some cases, he has even supported it and egged the crowd on.Previously, Trump came to the defense of his fans after they kicked and punched a #BlackLivesMatter protestor when he said,  Maybe he should have been roughed up.  In another instance, Trump ordered security to throw a protester out of an event in Vermont without the heckler s coat, enthusiastically noting that  it s about ten degrees below zero outside. By the way, it s illegal to encourage people to commit violent crimes. According to Iowa state law, anyone  directing abusive words or making a threatening gesture which the person knows (or reasonably should know) is likely to provoke a violent reaction by another  can be charged with disorderly conduct. In a perfect world, Trump would be forced to spend 30 days in jail because his minions just can t resist following his orders. Unfortunately, what will actually happen is his approval rating will go up.

" Duck Dynasty Star Stumps For Cruz, Says ‘Rid The Earth’ Of Marriage Equality Supporters (VIDEO)","Monday marked the all-important Iowa caucuses, and every candidate on the right is busily competing for the votes of as many religious bigots as possible. One such candidate was, of course, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. He also had his celebrity supporters helping him along, and one such person was Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson, who likely enjoyed his role in Cruz s Iowa efforts, as it allowed him to do what he loves to do most: hate on gay people in public.Today s topic for Robertson was the evils of allowing two people who love each other but happen to be of the same sex to get married. Robertson said of equal marriage: It is evil, it s wicked, it s sinful and they want us to swallow it. He wasn t done there, though. He went on to actually attack any and all people, particularly politicians, who support equal rights for everyone: We have to run this bunch out of Washington D.C. We have to rid the earth of them. Get them out of there. When it was time for Cruz himself to appear before the crowd, he actually endorsed the idea of purging the planet of all who disagree with him and his bearded supporter on this particular issue, and called Robertson  a joyful, cheerful, unapologetic voice of truth.

 Sad Sack Santorum Visited Over 70 Pizza Ranches In Iowa – And The CEO Endorsed Trump,"Nobody seemed more desperate to win Iowa by sheer force of will than Rick Santorum. The perennial Republican also-ran staked his entire campaign on convincing enough ultra-conservative Iowans that he was their guy, and didn t just come up short   he hardly came up at all.But if Iowan voters didn t know Santorum was running, the hapless employees at the state s ubiquitous Pizza Ranch restaurants sure did. For some reason   some very, very insane reason   Santorum decided to almost exclusively stump in the pizza chain s locales. By the close of the primary, Santorum had racked up an impressive (or sad, depending on how you look at it) 120 visits, that s nearly two visits per location.CNN s Chris Moody covered the Santorum s Iowa bid, and while he clearly tried to remain objective   and we give them an  A  for effort, really   his recollection of Santorum s sad campaign radiates a sense of bafflement and failure.About forty die-hard Santorumites joined together in a private room at a Pizza Ranch restaurant. The evening was full of nostalgia, sadness and hope, and a pinch of denial, to celebrate a man who hosted more than 700 events in the Hawkeye State. It has been an honor. It really has,  Santorum said.  I hope we have another opportunity, but my guess is that when we come in on Air Force One, we re not going to have these types of deals because we re going to have a country to run. The crowd laughed, lovingly, knowing that what he said wasn t true and probably would never be.There may be nothing more fatalistic than holding what is probably your last campaign rally in the back room of a greasy pizza shop and joking about how someday you may be unable to come in because you re too busy on Air Force One. It s never going to happen   that s the punchline.To twist the knife of failure just a little bit harder, Santorum s Pizza Ranch base of operation is actually already spoken for. The company s CEO, Adrie Groeneweg, announced just weeks ago that he would be endorsing Trump.Groeneweg has never endorsed a candidate before and he has also never caucused.  It was just something my dad has always done,  he explained. This year, Groeneweg said he d go to caucus for Trump in February.Hilariously, Trump didn t even have to show up beforehand. In trademark fashion, Trump only decided he liked Pizza Ranch after he learned the CEO endorsed him.Meanwhile, all the pizza slices in the state couldn t buy Santorum some love.But there is one silverlining to this story. Taking pity on poor Santorum, Pizza Ranch did throw him a bone. They gave him a t-shirt and made him an  honorary employee.

 Sarah Palin Accuses Ted Cruz Supporter Rep. Steve King Of ‘Huffing Ethanol’,"Sarah Palin is having a rough day. It began with an awkward interview with NBC s Today Show when Palin fumbled and gibberished her way through a softball question about whether she really blamed Barack Obama for her son Track s PTSD (she clearly did).And then, during her introduction of Donald Trump during an Iowa rally on Monday, she attacked a longtime ally, Iowa congressman Steve King, and accused the far-right member of the House Crazy Caucus of huffing ethanol.From TPM: It s dirty business but why would a conservative guy want to say something that he knows isn t true?  Palin asked the crowd.  Maybe he s forgotten some of his heart in the heartland. Maybe he s been hanging out in a corn field too long huffing ethanol. Steve King endorsed Ted Cruz and, during an appearance on MSNBC, King accused Trump of buying off Palin in exchange for his  assets  and  resources. A few things here.1) The first rule of conservatism remains: Don t try to be funny. It never works.2) You might recall how Palin expressed admiration for King during her infamous off-prompter speech in which she inexplicably blurted,  Steve very strong, he goin  rogue. 3) If anyone knows the impact of huffing fumes, it s Palin. In fact, she might ve been high or drunk during her Trump introduction today   like always.4) I wonder how Iowa residents feel about Palin insulting their famous congressman, while also insulting ethanol as being nothing more than something one can  huff. 5) It s worth repeating: Stop trying to be funny, conservatives.6) Now, Ted Cruz? Ted Cruz might actually be more tolerable if he huffed something. Anything.7) Palin thinks it s smart politics to emphasize the notion that huffing ethanol can get you really, really high. I m sure the children of Iowa Republican caucus-goers will thank her for it.

 Bette Midler Has Theory As To Why People Ignore Ted ‘Jackass’ Cruz Is Canadian (TWEET),"It s pretty much common knowledge at this point that Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz wasn t born in the United States. In fact, he was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1970 to a Cuban immigrant. Now, people have been saying that since Cruz s mother was an American citizen, this automatically makes the senator a citizen as well. However, as Talking Points Memo has pointed out, Cruz s mom was eligible to vote in Canada, thus making it seem as though she was a Canadian citizen at some point.The entire scenario of Cruz being born in Canada and being considered a  natural-born  citizen as the Constitution stipulates has been a bit of a gray area for some time now. While some say it s a closed issue, others say he s not eligible to run due to the true nature of  natural-born  meant as defined by the Founding Fathers.While all of this is still being discussed at great length, one person has come up with a pretty damn valid theory as to why so many think Cruz is a  natural-born  American. Bette Midler took to Twitter to pose a very good question. She asked: Are people ignoring the fact that Ted Cruz isn t a natural-born American because it s impossible to believe such a jackass came from Canada? Are people ignoring the fact thatTed Cruz isn t a natural-born Americanbecause it s impossible to believe such a jackass came from Canada?  Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) February 1, 2016This could be entirely true. Canadians are generally very kind-natured and not at all known to be the slimy, bigoted narcissists that Ted Cruz most definitely is. After all, we re stuck with Justin Bieber, too.Since no one has come to a definitive conclusion regarding Cruz s citizenship status, Midler s theory holds as much weight as anything else. Very good question indeed.

 Huckabee Says ‘Hello’ To Iowa In Creepy Adele Remake (VIDEO),"As Iowa voters prepare to head to the state s caucuses on February 1, candidates on both sides of the political fence are ramping up their efforts in the state. That s to be expected.What wasn t quite as expected, however, is this absolutely cringeworthy attempt by conservative candidate Mike Huckabee to  appeal  to Iowa millennials.The ad seems to be trying (somehow) to capitalize on the popularity of Adele s 2015 hit song,  Hello. The singer attempting to imitate Adele in this video does a really terrible job. That may not be entirely her fault, though.The bizarre lyrics are a truly terrible, swiss-cheesy attempt to string together a bunch of really awkward keywords like  pizza ranch,  and  selfie stick.  But it s not just that the lyrics are bad. They also don t fit the music. That means the singer is stuck trying to try to fumble through lines like: Hello Davenport. Amish chairs, Casey s jerky, Quad cities has quite a port. And then there s Huckabee. His desperate attempt to seem cool or relevant or  in the know  just leaves everyone who sees this shaking their heads, saying,  Please no. The Wall Street Journal published the video to YouTube on January 28. If you want to know how bad it is, just watch it for yourself below. Adele filed a copyright infringement notice against Huckabee over the use of the song, which he arrogantly ignored.During a January 28 interview on Fox, Huckabee stated that it s his right to use the song, even though the singer has specifically said he can t. According to Huckabee, the bizarre video is supposed to be  political parody,  which he says is protected by free speech.When told that the Attorney General says otherwise, Huckabee claimed that people not wanting their work mangled and distorted by his trashy political campaign are just  overly sensitive. Not surprisingly, Huckabee likened the singer s right to protect her copyrighted property to  an attack on American freedoms. You see, it s his God-given right to infringe on her copyright.This is so typical of how the right wing operates.  I m entitled to everything that belongs to others. No-one is entitled to anything that belongs to me and my billionaire buddies. Huckabee s not the only Republican politician to use Adele s music without her permission. As Addicting Info reports here, Donald Trump has also been using her music during his campaign events.On February 1, a spokesman for the musician told the UK Independent that she does not want her music associated with any political campaigning.Here s a bit of advice. Get Ted Nugent. He s one of the few musicians that actually agrees with the republican party s agenda. Why not play one his formerly-popular tunes, like  Jail Bait,  for example?I bet Huckabee could even get his good friend, Josh Duggar, to do a parody of that one.Featured image credit: video screen capture from Wall Street Journal on youtube",News,"February 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Bashes Michelle Obama In Lame Attempt To Be Student Body President (VIDEO),"You know things are getting bad on the campaign trail when you have to appeal to the child in everyone by offering French fries for everyone. Well, that s exactly what happened at a rally in Iowa over the weekend while presidential hopeful Ted Cruz was apparently trying to appeal to the future voters of America. This is the stuff you have to do when you don t really have any accomplishments to speak of besides shutting down the government and pissing people off.In a lame attempt at throwing First Lady Michelle Obama under the bus, Ted Cruz decided healthy food is for suckers, we need to bring back all the stuff that makes our kids fat and lazy, so Cruz says: Let me say something to the school-aged kids here. When Heidi s first lady, French fries are coming back to the cafeteria The last I checked the cardboard was supposed to be on the tray and not in the food! Yeah! When Ted Cruz is president, it ll be French fries and sugary soda for everyone!! Yeah!! Then recess all day! And no more homework!Cruz honestly sounded like he was running for student body president of the 6th grade. Which probably isn t completely dumb, considering that the average Republican voter hasn t gotten past that reading and maturity level.So, everyone   a vote for Cruz is a vote for French fries  YEAH!Video/Featured image from Vine",News,"February 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Unlike Hillary, Cruz’s Campaign May Have ACTUALLY Just Broken The Law In Iowa","In Ted Cruz s last-ditch effort to scare primary voters into voting for him, he may have accidentally pushed his campaign passed the point of scummy campaigning and straight into criminal enterprise.Last week, Iowa residents woke up to find a disturbing envelope in their mailbox. Inside they found what looked to be an official document that announced that they had committed a  Voting Violation. The mailer, sent by Cruz s team,  graded  the person based on their supposed voting track record. Below their own grade, was that of several of their neighbors. It also let the recipient know that their own grade had been sent to those neighbors. The implication was clear: Your neighbors will know you committed a  voting violation  and will be ashamed of you.Pretty scummy, right?Well, it may also have been against the law.In a fiery rebuke of Cruz s pathetic ploy, Iowa s secretary of state Paul Pate released an official statement condemning the actions and strongly suggesting what Cruz s team did bordered on illegality (emphasis added).Accusing citizens of Iowa of a  voting violation  based on Iowa Caucus participation, or lack thereof , is a false representation of an official act. There is no such thing as an election violated related to frequency of voting. Any insinuation or statement to the contrary is wrong and I believe it is not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses.In more straightforward terms, what Cruz did was mislead voters into believing that they had done something wrong by intentionally posing as an official office (in this case the Public Records office). As legal analyst Dan Abram s Law Newz website points out, that s a HUGE no-no.Notice that Pate used the words  false representation of an official act  in his statement.  We looked through Iowa code, and a potential false representation is, in fact,  a violation of criminal law.  The law reads (Section 720.5)  any person who represents any document or paper to be any public record or any civil or criminal process, when the person knows such representation to be false, commits a simple misdemeanor.  (Side note: this is part of the Chapter of Iowa Law entitled Interference of Judicial Process)Obviously, faking official documents during a contentious election could be considered both unethical and possibly criminal manipulation of the democratic process. It s not clear whether Pate will go after Cruz s campaign, but what is clear is that the state of Iowa certainly has grounds to.Meanwhile, Cruz is only making matters worse for himself. While it is possible that Iowa was willing to look the other way, Cruz has since repeatedly appeared unapologetic for the pathetic campaign tactic. Following the outrage from Iowa s secretary of state and on the heels of even his own backers suggesting that this tactic was so abhorrent that they couldn t believe Cruz would do it, Cruz refused to apologize. I will apologize to no one for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote. This follows a general pattern of Republican candidates refusing to ever concede a single mistake, even when the errors are blatant and egregious.Ironically, Cruz and his fellow competition have spent countless hours blasting Hillary Clinton for her supposed criminal actions involving her emails. Despite all of this energy being poured into destroying her reputation, not a single charge has been filed against her. Her investigators can t even decide if she did anything ethically, much less criminally, wrong. So it s more than a little absurd to find that Cruz has been willfully and unapologetically breaking Iowa state law while criticizing Clinton for manufactured ones.You know what they say about people who throw stones in glass houses   they don t tend to end up in white ones.Feature image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"February 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox Guest: The GOP Shouldn’t Bother With The ‘Black Vote,’ They’re ‘Slaves’ To The Democrats (VIDEO)","It is no secret that the Republican Party is incredibly racist. It s also no secret that the people over at Fox News frequently bring their token minorities on for interviews in the hopes that this will somehow justify their vitriol. That s exactly what they did on Monday when Crystal Wright, founder of the Conservative Black Chick blog, appeared on Fox & Friends. Hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman asked the blogger if she believes there is a GOP candidate who could steal the African-American vote (93 percent in 2012) from Democrats. Wright responded by saying that Donald Trump is that candidate because he is the only person running who is  bothering to talk to black people and ask for their vote.  She explained that his help would come in the form of mass deportation of the undocumented immigrants who are  stealing  jobs from black Americans.Nevermind the fact that there are few Americans of any race who are flocking to farms to harvest crops   a job that is performed by-and-large by immigrants.As if that statement wasn t stupid enough, she went on to say: I think it s so sad when it comes to the black vote. Blacks have shown a slavish support for the Democrat [SIC] Party for over 50 years. And part of me wonders if the Republican Party should even bother asking for the black vote,  Wright added,  because black Americans seem to like being political dummies. We re the only race that has voted lock, stock and barrel for the same party for over 50 years. Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that the Democratic Party is the one who supported the Civil Rights Movement fifty years ago, while Republicans retreated into racism. (And please do not try to say that it was the GOP who wanted equal rights for all minorities, we all know about the Southern Strategy.)Wright s ignorance is breathtaking. If this is who Fox goes to for advice about the African-American community, it s no wonder the Democratic Party has secured their vote.Watch the rest of her interview below:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"February 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Adele Wants NOTHING To Do With Donald Trump And Has A Message For Him,"When on the campaign trail, those running for office like to use music to bolster enthusiasm from the crowds, help spread their message, and look as though they re hip to modern day pop culture. Often times, what these politicians don t think about is the fact that the artists that make the music might not want their music to be used, especially by specific people. Such is the case with Donald Trump and his use of music by the singing sensation (and goddess) Adele.Trump has continuously used Adele s song from her  21  album  Rolling in the Deep.  Of course, the key lyric from that being  We could ve had it all.  Basically, implying that a vote for Trump is a vote for everything you could ever want.However, as it turns out, Adele does NOT want Trump using her music, and a spokesman for the singer told The Independent: Adele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning. It can also be implied that every time Huckabee tries to use Adele s song  Hello  in the bizarre way that he does, that this too is frowned upon.Adele has actually chosen to stay out of the political scene altogether, especially after a comment she made in 2011 where she stated that she was a  Labour girl.  And if you re unaware, the Labour Party is a center-left party in the United Kingdom.She s not the only one to take issue with politicians using their music. REM even went so far as to take to Twitter in a very verbose rant, with frontman Michael Stipe saying to Trump and Co.: Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you you sad, attention grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign. Aerosmith also told Trump to f*ck off in so many words.Lesson from all of this   ask permission.However, it must be frustrating when all the good music out there comes from the left side of the aisle.

 Heckler Crashes Ted Cruz Speech By Shouting ‘Ted Cruz Looks So Weird’ And Pretends To Barf (VIDEO/TWEET),"Hecklers at GOP rallies rarely disappoint   after all, the Republican presidential candidates have given them so much material to be inspired by. On Sunday, at one of his last rallies before the Iowa caucus, Ted Cruz had an experience with a heckler he probably won t ever forget.As Cruz gave his stump speech, an audience member shouted that he didn t feel so well while pretending to vomit in a trash can, stating that his illness was because  Ted Cruz looks so weird!  This brave heckler wasn t far from Cruz and he repeated it loud and clear just in case the candidate missed it the first time. Scott Bauer, a reporter for the Associated Press, fortunately captured part of this hilarious interruption on video and tweeted it for all to see:.@tedcruz enters Des Moines rally pic.twitter.com/06Itp606hN  Scott Bauer (@sbauerAP) February 1, 2016Of course, security removed the heckler out of the rally almost immediately and Cruz said,  I guess the bars let out early.  On social media, some people in the audience expressed sadness that the heckler was taken away, as the rally certainly could have used him.twitterCruz then used the moment to take a jab at one of his rivals and joked, Is that Donald Trump yelling in the back?  The joke was completely appropriate, considering that Trump and Cruz are competing with each other for the Iowa Caucuses later tonight.It was actually reported by the Associated Press that the heckler was in fact ill   so perhaps it was really Cruz s creepy appearance that set the protester off. It would make perfect sense, considering the unpleasant, cringeworthy effect that Cruz s face had on his own daughter! To top off Cruz s disastrous, rejection-filled weekend, his tour bus got stuck in the mud in Iowa and he had to hitch a ride with his aides.We ve seen some pretty creative hecklers during the GOP candidate s campaigns so far, and Cruz has had more than his fair share. Earlier this month, two hecklers actually made it onto Cruz s stage at a gun event, making for a completely awkward moment. But he s not the only one   recently, front runner Donald Trump got treated to tomatoes being thrown at him.

 WATCH: Female Cop Halts Sex Offender’s Violent Rampage,"Earlier in January, 31-year-old Michael Cox was found guilty of sexually abusing a five-year-old girl.After the jury read the verdict, attorneys for the prosecution and defense approached the bench for a sidebar with the judge.As the attorneys were making their way back across the courtroom, Cox suddenly attacked Deputy District Attorney Scot Key in a violent rage, shoving him to the ground, before leaping on top of him.As the courtroom erupted in chaos, Transport Officer KaeDea Smith burst onto the scene.Video of the incident shows the female officer shooting like a bolt of lightning through the double doors leading into the courtroom.Within seconds she has the rampaging pedophile pinned to the floor.Thankfully, Cox did not have a gun on him during his courtroom rampage.Here s video of the attack, courtesy of KOB.This is poetic justice at its finest. Since Cox is clearly used to victimizing helpless little girls who can t defend themselves, let alone others, it s fitting to see his rampage brought to an end by this heroic and incredibly badass female officer.Unlike many of the cops we hear about today, Officer Smith put the safety of others before her own, rushing in to protect the attorneys, judge, jury and others.Instead of firing her police-issued weapon into a crowded courtroom, she used non-lethal force to subdue the threat.During an interview with KRQE, Officer Smith told reporters she was just doing her job. I was able to get a hold of the defendant and use the least amount of force possible to go ahead and detain him to get him under control. While the law does require police officers to use the least amount of force necessary to get a suspect to comply with orders, it s not often in today s news cycle that we hear of a cop actually doing what the law requires.The violent rampage was caught on camera in Otero County, New Mexico s 12th Judicial District courtroom, on January 20.The best part of this is knowing that someday, when Cox s 5-year-old victim is old enough to understand what happened in that courtroom, she ll get to watch the man that molested her get taken down by someone who was a little girl once, too.Featured image from video screen capture from KOB",News,"February 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Palin Loses It After Hosts Dare Asks About Son’s Arrest Instead Of Letting Her Shill For Trump (VIDEO),"On the day of the Iowa Caucus, Sarah Palin visited the Today Show to stump for her new best friend, Donald Trump. Unfortunately, Palin seemed under the impression that she was allowed to dictate what the hosts asked her about. Hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie weren t having it.Palin, who often claims the media is against her by asking her questions she doesn t know the answers to, got off to a rocky start almost immediately, when the hosts challenged her on several issues that made both Trump and Palin look like raging hypocrites. At one point, a frustrated Palin asked the hosts  Who are we to judge one another s level of Christian faith?    the scalding steam of irony coming from a person who once spent a great deal of time trying to suggest President Obama was a secret Muslim was hot enough to melt steel.But things took a dramatic turn when Guthrie asked about her son Track, who was recently just arrested for beating his girlfriend and threatening to shoot himself in the head with an AR-15. Palin, ever the spindoctor, blamed the ugly incident on wait for it Obama. At a Trump rally, the one time vice presidential candidate claimed Track came back from Iraq messed up because Obama didn t respect the troops enough.When Guthrie asked her to clarify those baffling remarks, Palin became extremely angry. You guys brought me here to talk about Iowa politics and the caucus tonight, not to talk about my kids,  she fired back. And that was a promise. But as things go in the world of media, you guys don t always keep your promises, evidently,  Palin added.Watch @SarahPalinUSA speak out on TODAY in exclusive interview. #IowaTODAY https://t.co/Kbol2A7w9x  TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 1, 2016She went on to claim the media lied when they said she blamed Obama then IMMEDIATELY doubled down. What I have blamed President Obama in doing,  she said, putting her foot slowly in her mouth on live television,  is this level of disrespect for the United States military that is made manifest in gutting budgets and not trying to beef it up and let our military do the job that they are trained to do. To be clear, the  budgets  that Obama has cut have been on the level of wasteful spending on, say, military vehicles that even the Pentagon says it didn t need. On the flipside, Republicans in congress have killed the budget for supporting veterans, like Palin s son, when they come home. Repeatedly, conservative lawmakers have cited  big government  and  out of control spending  to justify slashing funds to Veteran s Affairs and other bills meant to help wounded servicemembers. There is certainly a lack of respect for the soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan   but it s not coming from the White House.As usual, Palin uses her own victim-complex serve as a security blanket she can hide under when questions get to tough. Palin has repeatedly blamed President Obama for hurting the troops. That s a serious accusation and a fair one for reporters to question. The criticisms themselves may be pathetic, but her refusal to tolerate any pushback on them is even more embarrassing.If Trump had hoped Palin would be a big asset to his campaign, so far it hasn t appeared that way. At almost every appearance, Palin s performance has been a trainwreck. On the TODAY show, she was at least able to string two sentences together without devolving into a hopeless wordsalad, but it s pretty sad that this is considered a victory for her. She still came across looking angry, bitter, and clueless.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Lunatic Glenn Beck Prepares To Move His Show To Israel Ahead Of Government Collapse (VIDEO),"Glenn Beck is a paranoid lunatic, and he has just done one more thing to further cement that idea. Beck announced on the Friday edition of his show that his staff is, on his orders, preparing to move his entire broadcasting network out of the country. Why? Because this idiot thinks that the America that we all know and love is on the brink of collapse, and when that collapse comes, the new government will silence him. Beck told his equally idiotic followers: We have to pick up our pace on finding another place to broadcast. I need to know if I can get to Jerusalem, where they won t shut this down and we can be able to broadcast into the United States. This could end quickly. The worst part of all of this is that this announcement came after an audience member asked what she could do to prepare her family for the coming apocalypse. She has already relocated from California to Texas   on Beck s lunatic suggestion. She has also followed more of Beck s terrible advice, and is reading the Left Behind series to her children, which warns of coming worldwide disaster.As if all of that is not bad enough, Beck s child was present during these doomsday prepper declarations, and of course was alarmed. Instead of comforting her and anyone else who might be rightfully disturbed by these ideas, Beck says that today s children should be warned as well because they re the giants that are going to fix this, they have to know.  He went on to warn that reading Left Behind is important because  they have to know that this might be the time   You have an army on earth now that says they are the army of the Antichrist, they are the army of Armageddon. This is about as irresponsible as it gets, and Beck doesn t seem to be slowing down this crazy train anytime soon.Watch the insanity below, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image from screen capture via Right Wing Watch",News,"February 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Republican: Porn Is Worse Than Cocaine, Gov’t Has To Act On ‘Public Health Crisis’","A Republican state senator in Utah believes that porn is such a threat to public health that he is proposing legislation to make the state take his aversion to skin flicks official. Whatever happened to limited government?Sen. Todd Weiler introduced his legislation on Friday, asking that the state recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard. He called for a reform to take on the  pornography epidemic that is harming the citizens of Utah and the nation. The politician told the Daily News that porn was more addictive than powerful drugs, and the public needed to start seeing adult films as a national epidemic. I have read books and I have experts tell me pornography is more difficult to overcome than cocaine,  he said.Weiler, 48, compares public attitudes on adult films in 2016 to early 20th century feelings about cigarettes, where doctors openly smoked and airplanes had smoking sections. He believes that his legislation will help to shift public opinion.The state senator made another strange comparison in an interview with a newspaper. Despite most Republican conservatives denying the existence of climate change, Weiler said denying the negative health effects of adult films was like denying climate science:  These are scientific facts, just like global warming. The legislator cited his experience as a divorce lawyer in providing him with an expert, insider point of view on the purported destruction that adult material can inflict on married couples.Weiler did draw a line in the sand for his proposed bill:  We re not going to outlaw masturbation in Utah. Even in a religiously conservative state like Utah, Weiler probably faces an uphill challenge in changing public attitudes. The state ranks as the #1 buyer of adult films in a 2009 survey, and a Harvard study showed that more than 5 out of every 1,000 households in Uitah paid for adult content online.

 Ted Cruz’s Tour Bus Gets Towed In Iowa – Has To Hitch A Ride (IMAGES),"This is not how Ted Cruz must have envisioned his campaign would end up heading into the nation s very first caucus in Iowa on Monday. His  Cruzin to Victory  tour bus wasn t exactly the epitome of its name, either. While he visited the Johnson County Fairgrounds earlier, it needed to be towed after getting stuck in the mud.This is very ironic, indeed. Just a bit over a week ago Ted Cruz was quoted as saying,  I m not going into the mud with personal insults and attacks (on Donald Trump). Well, Senator, you just went into the mud, quite literally.Pic via InstagramAccording to a report by Phillip Elliott from Time magazine, Cruz had to hitch a ride with aides to his next tour stop while his bus was towed. That s not the kind of image you want to project just before the voters of Iowa nominate the next future President of The United States. It certainly can t be good public relations; draw as many analogies as you must.Pic via Twitter.Cruz needs every bit of good press he can get right now. Virtually every poll shows Donald Trump having a huge lead on him. And   Cruz can t afford that. Whoever wins Iowa would get a must needed head start in the race. With Trump up in practically every state, Iowa is the momentum Cruz has been desperately seeking. Unfortunately, the only momentum Cruz is getting right now is coming from the back of tow truck.You d think the Cruz campaign would, at least, try to play damage control and be the first to report it, instead of being outed by the media. It s possible they could have made a joke out of it   but they didn t. They didn t even mention it. That s no way to run a campaign.

 Why Mike Bloomberg Running For President Will Bring Us President Trump,"While having a third independent option for president is surely a democratic thing to do, the implications surrounding someone like former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg jumping into the race are huge.What would Bloomberg running as an independent on the ticket mean? Well, it would pull votes from a major party candidate, and in this election, that candidate will be the Democratic one. Because while Bloomberg could appeal to wealthy conservatives, he s staunchly pro-heavy gun regulations, which will turn the remainder of the Republican base off in a heart beat. So, any votes he pulls will be from moderate to right-leaning Democrats, as well as independents who may be leaning towards the Democratic candidate. This is especially true if Bernie Sanders is the nominee and people are apprehensive about a Democratic Socialist in the White House. However, it d be true of Hillary Clinton as well.So with the center votes missing from the Democratic candidate, and surely not enough votes for Bloomberg taken from either side, this leaves the Republicans with a clear path to victory, and with Donald Trump trouncing his opposition in the polls, we re looking at a Trump presidency.Now, unless Bloomberg has some secret, backdoor deal with Trump that no one is keenly aware of, the former mayor of New York City needs to put his dreams of the Oval Office on the shelf, and likely keep them there for good. The last thing this nation needs is a President Trump. A person, who as president, would alienate not only all the minorities in his own country, but would alienate the United States from the rest of the world. We d be an embarrassment. Even more so than when George W. Bush was president.So, please, Bloomberg, if you happen to read this, take all that was just said to heart and think about what you really, truly want for the nation. If you want President Trump, then by all means, run. However, if not, please don t. Not just for you and the nation, but for the entire world.Featured image: Flickr/Flickr",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bigots Upset Their Daughter Was Taught World History Suing Maryland Public School,"John and Melissa Wood are typical right-wing loons. After their daughter told them about her class assignments, John Wood set off to LaPlata High School in Maryland in a fit of rage. His daughter, it seems, was taught about Islam as part of a world history course, which didn t sit well with the bigoted former marine or his wife.According to the Woods, their daughter was forced to accept Islam as her one true religion and was forced to memorize the five tenets of the faith. They argued that the class only spent a single day on Christianity and then moved on to two weeks of Islamic training.Learning to recite things in the course of a history class is what most people would call  studying,  but the dad found it so vile that she was being forced to convert to Islam that he went to the school and threatened the faculty, resulting in an immediate ban from the property and a no trespass order from local law enforcement.While the school contends that the reality of the situation doesn t fit the narrative the bigots have concocted, the Woods have decided to sue the school with the help of the Thomas Moore Law Center, the right-wing crackpot firm that unsuccessfully argues for intelligent design and Christian indoctrination in schools on a regular basis. The center said in court filings: A school cannot achieve diversity by punishing and alienating students who hold Judeo-Christian beliefs, while bolstering the doctrines and teachings of other religions. Parents must be ever vigilant to the Islamic indoctrination of their children under the guise of teaching history and multiculturalism. This is happening in public schools across the country. And they must take action to stop it. Yeah, that s not at all what s going on. As the school explained in a statement to WTOP: The particular unit in question is on the formation of Middle Eastern empires in which students learned the basic concepts of the Islamic faith and how it, along with politics, culture, economics and geography, contributed to the development of the Middle East. Other religions are introduced when they influence or impact a particular historical era or geographic region. For example, when reviewing the Renaissance and Reformation, students study the concepts and role of Christianity. When learning about the development of China and India, students examine Hinduism and Buddhism It doesn t matter how you try to explain teaching Islam to right-wing imbeciles. They see all Muslims as a threat the them. They hear the word  Muslim  in a public school and their heads explode, because the 1st Amendment says no religion in public places. Now tell that teacher to lead those kids in christian prayer before it s too late for them.The most ridiculous argument the suit brings is this: The course also taught false statements such as Allah is the same God worshiped by Christians and Islam is a  religion of peace' According to these people a religion of a billion people are out to kill us all. Considering if that were true they would only have to get about 6 people each to kill all non-Muslims, you have to wonder why it hasn t happened already. You also have to wonder how people can continue to call Islam a  pagan  religion when the tribe Mohammed came from was directly descended from Ishmael, son of Abraham, considered the steward of the faith to his tribe and brother of Isaac, patriarch of Judaism.I learned that from a high school world history course.The Woods are asking for injunctive relief barring the teaching of anything that has to with Islam from school grounds and for the trespass order to be lifted. It shouldn t be long before this case, much like all of the other zealot-friendly issues brought by the Moore Center.Featured image from Wikipedia",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Supporters Are Asked To Describe Donald Trump With Just One Word (VIDEO),"Is it really possible to describe Donald Trump with just one word? Certainly a few come to mind. Try and pick just one, though. Which one comes to mind first?The conservative media outlet The Blaze trolled a Bernie Sanders event recently and posted a video of Bernie supporters describing both Bernie and Donald Trump with just one word. It wasn t exactly a hit piece; all of Sanders supporters responding enthusiastically for their candidate while completely lambasting Trump. Not much news there. All it did was tell us what we already know, Bernie supporters don t exactly think Trump is all that amazing.First, here are the words most commonly used to depict Bernie Sanders: Inspirational. Consistent. Amazing. Awesome. Equality. Honest. Logical. Compare that to what they think of Trump: Disgusting. Dishonest. **shole. Racist. Bigot. Evil.  Insane. Sounds about right.It really just looks like The Blaze likes Bernie Sanders events. Maybe they re #feelingthebern, too? They seem to go there a lot. Although, they didn t particularly like a video of Sanders mocking Republicans  Family Values  during a speech he gave in Iowa on Friday.Here s what Bernie had to say about Republican s so-called values: They love families. Can t stop talking about families. When Republicans talk about family values what they are saying is that no woman in this room in this country, should have the right to control their own body. I DISAGREE. The race is tight and it s anybody s guess as to who will win Iowa. Bernie s campaign is counting on younger voters to help win the day for him   he does have far more of them than any other candidate from either party, after all. When these very same voters get older there will be a dramatic paradigm shift to the left on issues   but as of right now it s not clear if the younger vote will help Bernie defeat Hillary. Perhaps it s fitting that we get more of their opinions to see where this country is heading, though. It certainly isn t in the way of Donald Trump.Featured image from screen capture ",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Even Back In 2011, Trump Compared His Book To The Writings Of Our Founding Fathers (TWEET)","At this point in the presidential race, you ve either come to determine that Donald Trump is the person for you, because policy inexperience and racism are appealing for you, or you ve realized that Trump is a racist, misogynistic, egomaniacal ass. And if anything can be shown by the polls that have shown Trump holding a huge lead over his competition, it s that the Republican base prefers bigotry and bombastic hyperbole or facts, figures, and a solid plan for the future.Trump being as he is, isn t exactly new either. He s always been the narcissist that he actually, truly is. He s always thought his ideas are perfect and his shit doesn t stink. He s even gone so far as to compare a book he wrote to the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.Back in 2011, while pushing people to buy his latest batch of drivel, he made just that comparison:First there was the Declaration of Independence, then there was the Constitution. Now there is #TimeToGetTough. Available today.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2011His book Time to Get Tough  also held a very familiar tagline:  Making America #1 Again. Trump honestly sees himself as a savior of sorts, a deity that will magically solve all the nations problems. In comparing himself to the Founding Fathers he resorts to an emotion that those dumb enough to fall for the line, will see him as just as profound as those who sought to make freedom a national ideal and form a new nation.The thing is, he s no savior, nor is he anything like the Founding Fathers. He s a narcissistic businessman out for himself and wants to see how far he can go. Not for the nation, but for his own ego. Just listen to any campaign rally, he s obsessed with polls numbers and will talk the entire time about how  great  he is, and spend next to zero time talking about any sort of plans or policy.America is already great, and if you want to keep it that way, make sure you vote blue this November.Featured image: Flickr/Twitter",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Things Get Really Awkward When Fox Host Talks About How He Likes His ‘Meat’ (VIDEO),"Things got really awkward on the set of Fox & Friends on Sunday when host Brian Kilmeade surprised his fellow co-hosts by saying that he liked his meat  tight.  Here is the full quote below: I like my meat tight   not loose. Tighten up my meat! The only response they could muster was:  Okay.  Thanks for that information, by the way.Now, it s not like he just started talking about his  meat  out of nowhere. The exchange began when co-host Steve Doocy stated to Kilmeade that he s  got to try the loose meat sandwich  when he goes to Iowa later today.  It s like a sloppy joe with no tomato sauce. The look on his co-workers  faces is priceless because they just weren t expecting him to come back with something like that. Anything that includes the phrase  my meat  probably isn t the best way to say it, especially with that kind of enthusiasm.In any case, Kilmeade is never going to live this one down. He s already becoming an internet sensation for it, and not in a good way.Does anyone else like their meat tight, and not loose? I mean, there is a difference. And, no not that kind of meat. Get your head out of the gutter. This really is a thing. And as Steve Doocey was trying to say   Iowa s loose meat sandwiches are world famous. Anytime a sandwich is that good you have to try it no matter how you like your meat. Kilmeade needs to stop being so uptight and try a good sandwich every once and a while.

 Even Trump’s Own Ex-Organizer Accuses Him Of Discriminating Against Women,"Just a day before the Iowa caucuses, a former field organizer for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has come forward with accusations that Trump s campaign grossly discriminated against women, paying them less than the male employees doing the same exact work.These completely believable accusations were made by Elizabeth Mae Davidson and published by The New York Times. The 26-year-old staffer had been working for Trump s campaign in Davenport, Iowa but was fired a month ago   despite being previously described as one of the campaign s most effective organizers.On Thursday, Davidson filed a complaint about the discrimination with the Davenport Civil Rights Commission. Aside from the gender pay discrimination, Davidson reported that she was also given less opportunities to advance her career and skills. To make matters worse, female staffers were also subjected to inappropriate comments about their appearance   from Donald Trump himself. The Times wrote:[Davidson] said in a discrimination complaint that men doing the same jobs were paid more and were allowed to plan and speak at rallies, while her requests to do so were ignored. She also said that when she and a young female volunteer met Mr. Trump at a rally last summer, he told them,  You guys could do a lot of damage,  referring to their looks.In an interview, Davidson revealed that she was paid $2,000 per month. Because she was also working as a paralegal, she was considered a part-time staffer by the campaign. However, one of her male peers with the exact same role in the campaign was paid almost double despite the fact that he also has another job! Trump s campaign public filings state that several men filling the same role as Davidson were being paid between $3,500 to $4,000 a month.According to Dorothy A. O Brien, Davidson s attorney, the complaint will trigger the Davenport civil rights agency to investigate Trump s campaign, and after 60 days Davidson can choose to let the agency continue its investigation or follow suit in state court.Considering Trump s horrible track record of sexist, misogynistic comments toward women, it s not a big surprise to hear that his campaign was discriminating against its female staffers. When Davidson was asked if she would be attending Monday s caucuses, she was undecided. She said: Some of the bad things about him I dismissed, because I was working for the candidate. Now I m more critical, especially how he treats women. We don t blame her.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Is Donald Trump Actually A Fascist? Here Is What Experts Are Saying (VIDEO)," Another fact that allowed Fascism to gain power over men was their blindness. A man cannot believe that he is about to be destroyed. The optimism of people standing on the edge of the grave is astounding.    Vasily Grossman. I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose voters.    Donald Trump.In the United States, people prove Godwin s Law to be true way too often. Not every politician needs to be compared to Hitler, Mussolini, or any other well-known fascist. It s especially obnoxious when right-wingers call leftists fascists. Fascism is a right-wing ideology.Except when discussing Donald Trump. Trump is definitely a fascist. Or, at the very least, he is acting the part of one. That way he can gain support from actual fascists, and to dominate the vapid corporate media with his atrocious rhetoric.There is a great video going around the internet that asks the question,  Is Donald Trump a fascist?  The answer is yes. Trump is a fascist. The video doesn t overtly state that conclusion, though it does a great job of explaining why he might be, and why people are asking the question in the first place. Here s the video:https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostPolitics/videos/10153699583882911/Is Donald Trump going to lead America into a completely fascist state, where Muslims and other minorities are rounded up and exterminated? No. The political philosopher Sheldon Wolin struck gold when he coined the term  inverted totalitarianism  to describe the rise of the United States  predominately right-wing, corporate run, neoliberalist government. I d highly recommend every progressive read Wolin s book, Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism. The real danger of Trump s fascism is that he is normalizing the ideals of fascism. Facsist hate groups are loving every minute of Trump s campaign. They have their own bully, bellowing the hatred and intolerance that is largely considered taboo to speak of. This normalization of hatred and state violence is one of the first steps towards acts of genocide, and other horrific human rights abuses.Featured image from video screenshot via Facebook",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Is Finding It Hard To Even Get Love From His Own Daughter (VIDEO),"When thinking about who would be the best fit for President of the United States, Republican Senator Ted Cruz should be nowhere near the top of that list. It s pretty much openly known that he s not well liked in Washington, and the only thing he s really ever successfully done was shut down the government (which isn t a good thing, it puts thousands out of work and can be a potential national security risk).Even former Republican presidential candidate and longtime Senator Bob Dole told the NY Times regarding Cruz: I don t know how he s going to deal with Congress. Nobody likes him. Now, at a campaign stop, as Cruz was greeting his daughters after they came off the bus, it was almost poetic how even his own daughter wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. He reached for her and she shooed him away, then as he went for a hug and a kiss, she tried as best as she could to get away from him.Keep in mind, what you re about to see in no way is meant to attack Sen. Ted Cruz s daughter. It s just a video that caught a moment that seems worthy of showing. Children, often times, won t want anything to do with their parents. With that said, here s the clip of Cruz s daughter seemingly wanting absolutely nothing to do with her father, just like the rest of the country.

 Rapist Cop Daniel Holtzclaw Disappears From Prison Database (IMAGES),"In December of 2015, a jury found former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw guilty on 18 counts of sexual assault and rape. A month later, on January 21, 2016, Judge Timothy Henderson sentenced the serial rapist to a consecutive 263 year prison term.But on Friday, Oklahoma City s NBC affiliate KFOR reported that Holtzclaw s name had  disappeared  from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections website.On Tuesday the database showed the following information on Holtzclaw.Image credit, KFORThree days later, on January 29, the database showed no record of Holtclaw at all.Image credit: KFOR KFOR contacted the state Department of Corrections, only to be told by a department spokesperson  We are not going to comment, it is a matter of security. Holtzclaw was convicted of sexually assaulting seven women and he is believed to have victimized many others. All but one of his victims were Black women. His youngest victim was just 17 years old, while his oldest victim was a 57-year-old grandmother of 12.Under Oklahoma law, Holtzclaw s victims have very specific rights, including the right to know his location.The state Attorney General s office and law enforcement agencies provide this information via the VINELink website, which is supposed to be updated daily with changes in offender status.Holtzclaw still shows up in the VINELink database, but his location is now listed as  unknown. Image credit: KFORAccording to KFOR, Holtzclaw s victims have not been notified of any change in status or location, although Oklahoma law requires that crime victims be notified of any such changes.Alex Gerszewsk, an Oklahoma Department of Corrections spokesperson refused to provide KFOR with information on Holtzclaw s whereabouts, saying only that he was  processed at Lexington exactly as every other offender. Gerszewsk repeated the same  security  claim, saying  we cannot reveal his location for security; the security of the inmate and the facility. The state Department of Corrections and the VINELink publish the information of all offenders, including pedophiles, child abductors, serial killers and hundreds of other people who have committed every horrific and violent crime imaginable.There s little doubt that those criminals would like to have their information deleted from the Department of Corrections website as well. I m sure they d like to have their whereabouts kept confidential for  security reasons,  since those crimes are likely to get you beaten, raped or killed in prison.There s just one difference between Holtzclaw and every other serial rapist incarcerated in Oklahoma. Holtzclaw is a former police officer.The Oklahoma Department of Corrections seems to think it s OK to break the law and violate the rights of the women Holtzclaw raped and sexually assaulted, by removing his information from their database and concealing his whereabouts.This is completely unacceptable. It is the duty of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to protect crime victims, not serial rapists who just happen to be former cops.Featured image credit: VINELink ",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Tennessee House Speaker Warns Interns To Stay Far Away From Sleazy Male Lawmakers,"Apparently, male Tennessee Republican lawmakers are so sleazy and horny that the female House Speaker has warned interns to stay far away from them.In the wake of state GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham resigning his position as Majority Whip after getting caught creepily sexting female interns, House Speaker Beth Harwell is instructing the Director of the Internship program to institute new rules to keep interns safe from the wandering eyes of male lawmakers. As a precautionary measure, I have instructed the Director of the Internship program that interns are not to attend receptions or events related to the legislature, and they are not to give their cell phone numbers to members,  she announced on Monday.Harwell also announced the formation of a committee to review the 20-year-old sexual harassment policy that somehow hasn t been changed over the years. If any personnel have suggestions for improvement, I urge them to give the committee their recommendations,  Harwell said.  At the conclusion of this review, the members will go through sexual harassment training. But Talking Points Memo reports that Democrats are criticizing the new rules because they appear to be blaming the female interns for the behavior of male lawmakers instead of focusing on keeping the lawmakers in check. Signaling out one group of women and asking them to change their behavior is a completely inadequate and inappropriate response to a problem with alleged behavior by a lawmaker,  Rep. Mike Stewart said.Stewart does have a point. At the very least, new restrictions could be instituted regulating how lawmakers interact and behave around female interns. Instead of focusing on just the interns, focus on the lawmakers equally.As for Durham, Harwell and other GOP leaders have called for him to reign his seat entirely. If the rumors I continue to hear regarding Representative Durham are true, Representative Durham needs to focus on his family and receiving the help he needs,  Harwell said.GOP Chairman Ryan Haynes also called for Durham to step down. In light of these recent revelations, I do think it is important that Representative Durham step down from his position as a member of this body so that the legislators can continue to focus on the important work that Tennesseans expect us to focus on. Seriously, Tennessee. You need to get your act together because this is just embarrassing.

 Koch Brothers Hold Dark Money Conference To Plot Election 2016 Dirty Tricks,"The Koch Brothers arranged their meeting of wealthy right-wing billionaires this weekend in order to come up with the best strategy in order to move America further to the right.As befitting wealthy right-wing industrialists, the Kochs held their $100,000 per seat affair at a luxury hotel. 500 of the super rich right showed up, with about 150 of them new converts to the conservative donor network that already spent close to $400 million in 2015 to lay the groundwork for the 2016 campaign.Many of the Koch network members   which include some of the biggest-spending conservative families in America, such as Michigan s DeVoses and the Adelsons from Las Vegas   spend tens of millions each year advancing their favored politicians and causes.In his introductory speech, Charles Koch told the donors he had four goals to change the trajectory of American government and society.The first is to  reverse the policies that are moving us toward a two-tiered society,  which include corporate welfare.The second is to end  irresponsible government spending. Of course, the Kochs don t mind it too much when their multibillion dollar enterprises are the beneficiaries of government spending and regulation. The brothers and their allies spend heavily in order to ensure politicians, mostly Republicans, are in place to enact or oppose legislation that affects their bottom line.Charles Koch also told those attending the meeting that free speech is  under attack everywhere.  Of course, to the Kochs that isn t free speech in the way most Americans think about it, but rather laws and regulations requiring disclosure about who spends money on elections. The Kochs believe in the supremacy of  dark money  in politics, so that they can make their influence be felt without being held accountable for it.That s the reason why, after the Kochs were called out for their spending in the 2010 and 2012 campaigns, they have mounted a huge effort to advertise their company s philanthropy on television (often during news programming and especially on the influential Sunday morning talk shows). Charles Koch has also recently released a business book, with no mention of course of his company s underhanded practices, fines from the government for pollution, or the violations of election law that affiliates of the Koch network have been caught in.Featured image from Flickr",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Artists Took Over Trump’s Campaign Bus And Made A Few MUST SEE Changes (VIDEO),"A couple of artists purchased the bus that Donald Trump used while campaigning in Iowa. The artists have turned the bus into a spectacle of political satire. They have made many changes to the bus, including changing Trump s campaign slogan from,  Make America Great Again  to  Make Fruit Punch Great Again. One of the funniest things about the bus wasn t even added by the artists. The bus was initially rented from a party bus rental company, so it features a stripper pole. The artists left it in, as they saw it as a perfect metaphor for Trump and his campaign. The bus used to be used as a party bus and the Trump campaign leased it from them, but they never removed the stripper pole. So we re kind of using that as kind of a metaphor for Trump. Like all good satire, the bus is only changed slightly. The artists added elements that fictionalize reality, in order to better examine it. The small changes lead people to come look at the bus, with them not initially realizing what the bus actually is. People come over and they re all excited and they don t even read that it says Make Fruit Punch Great Again,  said Mary Mihelic, an artist who is part of the anti-Trump bus project according to the  The Guardian.  And they re just totally taking pictures and then you ll hear someone say,  Honey, it s a gag! It s a gag!  And we just crack up. The artists explain their intentions behind the installation in a video that is embedded below. They claim that their work is meant to be non-partisan. That being said, they say that they really, really do not want Trump to be the next president of The United States.You can watch a video about the mobile installation, below.

" Trump: If I’m Elected, I’ll Appoint Justices Who Will Destroy Marriage Equality","The nightmare that is Donald Trump just keeps barreling on, and there seems to be no end in sight. In fact, it seems that he just might become the GOP nominee for the 2016 presidential election. There are endless reasons that this is beyond scary, and he has given us yet another.Earlier this week, Trump showed just how ignorant he is of the law in a bumbling interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC s This Week. The host didn t go easy on Trump in a conversation about the Supreme Court and the appointment of justices, and Trump showed himself to be utterly unqualified to be in any position of political power, much less president of the United States and leader of the free world. Here is a transcript of the exchange, courtesy of The New Civil Rights Movement:STEPHANOPOULOS: Let s talk about some of the issues. Judges. What kind of judges will you appoint? Will they be conservative?What does that mean to you and how will you ensure it?TRUMP: Well, first of all, we have a lot of judges that have to be appointed because we have a lot of openings in terms of judges. And I m very happy about that, to be honest, because I think, you know, appointing judges is a very important and a very, frankly, a very, very important element of what we re doing.STEPHANOPOULOS: But Ted Cruz says he s going to appoint rock rib conservatives with a paper trail. What are you going to do?TRUMP: Well, I m going to appoint conservative judges. I m going to appoint people that have great reputations, that are great with the legal profession STEPHANOPOULOS: Like?TRUMP: Well, I can say like any   you know a judge who is a totally underrated and not spoken is Justice Thomas. I mean, if you look at   if you look at some of the judges that we have like on the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts turned out to be a nightmare for conservatives. I mean STEPHANOPOULOS: But how are you going to TRUMP: Wait, let me first say. Ted Cruz, was the one that really wanted Justice Roberts to go on the Supreme Court. You know that, right? Have you heard that?STEPHANOPOULOS: So, how are you going to make sure you don t get a Justice Roberts? Are you going to ask your appointees TRUMP: Well, excuse me, excuse me, how are they going to make sure? Bush appointed him. And Cruz was the biggest advocate. Cruz fought like hell to get Justice Roberts in there. Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster. He turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us Obamacare. So, you tell me, ask Cruz, why did he push STEPHANOPOULOS: I m asking you. How are you going to make sure?TRUMP: No, I m asking you, why did he push so hard to have a judge who has absolutely set the conservative movement back and said everything STEPHANOPOULOS: When I interview him, I ll ask him. How you re going to make sure you don t get betrayed by your appointees.TRUMP: I will study it carefully. I will work with people that I respect, conservative people, and we ll appoint judges that will be good. And I don t think I ll have any catastrophic appointment like Justice Roberts, which was really more than anybody else, pushed by Cruz and Bush.With this level of incompetency on full display for all to see, Trump went on Fox News Sunday to redeem himself on the same issue and this time, he did what every Republican does when trying to woo audiences and cover up for mistakes: he turned the discussion to those Fox viewers hate the most: LGBT people. In fact, Trump says that if he is elected president, the justices on his Supreme Court will be those who oppose marriage equality, and he would find a way to have them throw out the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that made equal marriage the law of the land.First, Trump dodged the question, simply telling host Chris Wallace: They have ruled on it. I wish it was done by the states. Wallace didn t let Trump off the hook though, and plowed on, finally forcing Trump to say to the conservative audience on the issue of justices who would overturn the marriage equality decision: I would strongly consider that, yes. There you have it, folks. We knew Trump was a bigot, but he had never come out and said he d actively work to roll back LGBT right on this level. Not surprising at all, though. Just another reason to make sure his fantasy of ruling America never becomes a reality.Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Unveils GENIUS Obamacare Alternative: ‘We’ll Work Something Out’ (VIDEO),"On Sunday, Donald Trump proved that he doesn t just endlessly complain about the affordable Care Act. He has ideas, big, beautiful ideas on how to better provide Americans with health insurance in a manner that  trumps  Obamacare, which has caused our nation to suffer(?) through having the lowest uninsured rate ever. Despite the overwhelming success of the President s healthcare law, Trump agrees with fellow 2016 candidate Ted Cruz s nonsensical assertion that Obamacare is destroying the country   though he takes exception to Cruz s claim that The Donald wants to replace it with single-payer insurance, which Trump supported wholeheartedly before becoming a Republican overnight.During a telephone interview with ABC s this Week, George Stephanopoulos asked Trump to respond to Cruz s statement that he intends to replace Obamacare with single-payer insurance. Of course, The Donald responded in his usual manner: Ted Cruz is a total liar. I am so against Obamacare. I ve been saying it for two years in my speeches. I m going to repeal and replace Obamacare. I don t know even where he gets this. But he s a liar. Yes, Ted Cruz is a liar, but so is every Republican candidate for President. Stephanopoulos reminded the billionaire that he is on record saying he wants everyone to have health insurance. But Trump stood firm in his denial: That s true. I want people taken care of, I have a heart. If people have no money, we have to help people, but that doesn t mean single payer. It means we have to help people. How would you do it,  the host asked the 2016 hopeful. We re going to work with our hospitals, we re going to work with our doctors,  Trump replied.  We ve got to do something. You can t have a small percentage of our economy   because they re down and out   have absolutely no protection so they end up dying. Yes, there are people who need health care   even with the amazing progress made through the Affordable care Act   and, if we were to replace it, Single Payer would be the way to go.  Trump could have said,  Fine   we ll replace Obamacare with single-payer  and struck a huge win with many Republicans and Democrats alike. Unfortunately, he just said he doesn t have any ideas:Watch the interview below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpKM_MXDDJo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image from screengrab",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Gets Owned By Fox News Host For Telling Lies About Obamacare (VIDEO),"Apparently, Ted Cruz is so hated that even Fox News is now defending Obamacare. It truly must be a cold day in hell.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace just before Iowans head to the polls to vote for their choice of who should be the Republican presidential nominee, Ted Cruz found himself being called out for his most persistent lies about the Affordable Care Act.Cruz has repeatedly claimed that Obamacare has caused massive job losses and that it has caused more people to go without health insurance. But both have been debunked by the facts, something Wallace pointed out much to the annoyance of Cruz. The fact checkers say you re wrong,  Wallace said. Since that law went into effect, the unemployment rate fell from 9.9% to 5% as 13 million new jobs were created, and 16.3 million people who were previously uninsured now have coverage. Don t get me wrong, there are plenty of problems with Obamacare, but more people have jobs and health insurance than they did before Obamacare. Of course, Cruz responded by accusing  unfair  fact-checkers of being  liberal editorial journalists  who  have made it their mission to defend Obamacare. Chris Wallace couldn t believe that Cruz would deny the facts so adamantly.  There s certainly no question that more people have jobs and more people health insurance,  he said. But Cruz continue to argue, and even treated Wallace like a child by telling him,  Don t interrupt me. Undeterred, Wallace continued to press the fact that  thirteen million new jobs have been created  and nailed Cruz for trying to change the subject.Cruz claimed that the 13 million jobs  is a historically slow rate of job creation  and went on to tell a bullshit story about how small business owners have come up to him telling him that they are praying for the repeal of Obamacare. And then he attempted to steal Bernie Sanders  platform by attacking the wealthy one percent and pretending to be a man of the people. Cruz even had the gall to claim that the income gap is President Obama s fault.Turning to what Cruz would replace Obamacare with, Wallace pointed out that conservative think-tanks agree that selling insurance across state lines, expanding health savings accounts and making insurance portable between jobs  would have almost no effect in giving people who are not uninsured health coverage. Faced with that fact, Cruz lashed out at the conservative think-tanks and claimed that they are not accurate. Basically, he threw them under a bus.Here s the video via YouTube.Cruz is dead wrong about Obama overseeing a  historically slow rate of job creation.  The fact is that 94,000 jobs have been created per month under President Obama and that ranks above Ford, Bush, Bush II, and Eisenhower. The true loser in this category is George W. Bush, who only saw 21,000 jobs created per month during his presidency.Here s a chart showing exactly that via USNews.In short, this was yet another terrible day for Ted Cruz as he desperately tries to rebound from the rough night he had during the last GOP Debate, a debate that Republicans say Cruz overwhelmingly lost.And continually repeating lies that most Americans know have been repeatedly debunked isn t helping his case at all. The media, fact-checkers, and conservative think-tanks all say Cruz is wrong and his healthcare plan isn t a viable replacement for a program that has insured 13 million Americans, many for the first time.Ted Cruz should be thankful that Wallace didn t continue pressing him because if the discussion about Obamacare had lasted much longer, Cruz would have embarrassed himself even more than he already did. Kudos to Fox News for actually calling out Cruz on his lies.

 FL Cops Face Prison After Brutally Beating Unarmed Man (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, a federal Grand Jury announced the indictment of former Marion County, Florida deputy Jesse Terrell. The charges stem from Terrell s involvement in the brutal beating of Derrick Price, a 44-year-old Black man, who was assaulted by a gang of white cops, in August of 2014.Video of the attack was published by WESH on January 27.The video shows that Price was initially trying to run from the police, who were pursuing in a black SUV.About ten seconds into the video, however, Price stops running and throws his hands into the air. He then drops to his knees, before laying facedown on the pavement.At this time the group of officers can be seen rushing at Price from several directions. The five cops immediately begin kicking, punching and otherwise assaulting him, as he continues to lay on the ground.Although it s clear from the video that Price was not resisting, the officers can be heard shouting over and over  Stop resisting,  as they continue to deliver blows to his head and body.At least one of the officers was wearing a body camera at the time of the assault. It appears that the cop s camera was purposely angled so that it would not capture video of the attack. It was later turned off.Watch the video below, courtesy of WESH.The other four officers involved in the beating all plead guilty to violating Price s civil rights.According to the Tampa Bay Times: Former deputies Cody Hoppel and Adam Ray Crawford admitted to beating Price, while two others, Trevor Wade Fitzgerald and James Louis Amidei, admitted they failed to intervene.Crawford also admitted to obstruction of justice, and Hoppel admitted to punching another man and lying about it in an unrelated case.The four acknowledged in court records that Price was not resisting arrest when beaten. Those deputies, who all resigned, are scheduled to be sentenced by Senior U.S. District Judge William Terrell Hodges in Ocala on April 20. The five former police officers are each facing up to ten years in prison, along with fines of as much as $250,000.*Featured image credit: video screen capture WESH",News,"January 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Model Outs Men To Their Moms & Wives After They Send Her Gross Illicit Pics,"If you re a guy who thinks sending unwelcome d*ck pics to women is cool, you better hope you ve never sent one to this model.Emily Sears is a model from Australia who often shares pictures of herself on social media, and because of her job, men often send her pictures of their junk even though she really would rather they didn t. I usually receive at least one or two d*ck pics per day, at minimum,  Sears told BuzzFeed.  It s just been consistently happening for so long. I became absolutely fed up with these kinds of disturbing and disgusting messages and comments online. Rather than allow gross men to continue sending her unsolicited pictures of their penises, Emily decided to fight back in the best way possible.Emily noticed that whenever these men sent d*ck pics to her, they did so using their social media profiles. So she looked at the profiles to see if these men had girlfriends, wives, or mothers who she could inform about the pictures.She then sends a message to the guys complete with images of the women in their lives and asks what they would think if she alerted them to the unsolicited photos. We send the photos as a reminder for them to have respect for women. I think it provides an accountability that people seem to lose online; being behind a screen gives people a false sense of anonymity. I have noticed since posting my responses as a warning that the number has been significantly lower. I think my followers are slowly getting the message. After realizing that Emily figuratively had them by the balls, the men would claim that they were sorry and said they wouldn t do it again.Here s a couple of samples of messages between Emily and the men who harassed her.And sometimes, she went ahead and informed the women in their lives anyway, since most of the creepy guys are just sorry they got busted. Their apologies always seem fake,  Emily said.  Sometimes they try and say their friend stole their phone, and that it wasn t them. I don t believe they re sorry so much as they re sorry you re putting them on blast. And because they are fighting back and holding men accountable for their actions, more harassment usually follows. But Emily has no plans to stop outing men who send her unwelcome pictures of their d*cks. I get messages from men who say we re  sluts who are asking for it , which can get pretty overwhelming. But I truly believe its a huge social problem reflecting the attitude many men have towards women and I want to keep trying to fight against it. Frankly, these men deserve what they get. Men need to understand that there are consequences and just because you re using the Internet, it doesn t mean you are anonymous. Apparently, men need to be taught these facts. And they definitely need to learn that sending dick pics to women is not okay.As long as there are women like Emily Sears around, that lesson will continue to be taught.In other words, keep it your pants, gentlemen.Featured Image: Instagram",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Liz Cheney Is Running For Congress Because America Clearly Needs More Foreign Policy Disasters (VIDEO),"Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is planning a second attempt at running for Congress, ostensibly after her Dad uses alien technology to transfer the remaining essence of his dark energy into her not-quite-yet poisoned soul, allowing her to continue his twisted Supreme-Leader-Snoke-like legacy beyond his own lifetime.Seriously, Liz Cheney is running for Congress in Wyoming s only congressional district. (Wyoming is basically an empty square on the map, and not enough population to facilitate any more than a single member of the House.) Cheney intends to run for the seat being vacated by the state s sitting GOP congresswoman, Cynthia Lummis, who s held that seat since 2009 and is retiring at the end of this term.And, of course, Dick Cheney held that seat for ten years, from 1979 through 1989 when he resigned to become George H.W. Bush s Secretary of Defense   long before his blood was replaced with sand, pumped through his corroded veins using ancient steampunk dials and cogs.Liz Cheney previously ran for Senate, primary-challenging Mike Enzi, but she was unable to capture to support of the party. Cheney faces an uphill climb against a field of eight GOP hopefuls, several of them being popular state legislators.Yes, what we really need in the United States is a Cheney Dynasty, consisting of generations of Cheneys holding public office and bilking taxpayers with unnecessary wars and no-bid contracts for buddies in the defense industry.Just for fun, here s a clip via Crooks & Liars of Bill Maher presenting a series of potential campaign posters for Liz Cheney s would-be run for president back in 2012. She, of course, didn t run, but this is pretty damn funny anyway. Note that Cheney was referred to in the press as  Palin with a Pedigree.

 All The ‘Proof’ Republicans Need To Confirm Obama Is A Super Secret Muslim,"Since President Obama took office in 2009, the right-wing has been awash with claims that he is a secret  Muslim foreigner who plans to bring Sharia law to America. Now, they are going to have the  proof  they ve been waiting seven long years for: the president is going to visit a mosque next week.Oh my sweet Allah!Never has a president ever spawned as many conspiracy theories as Barack Obama. During his tenure in the White House we have heard all kinds of crazy things, but perhaps one of the most asinine is the assertion that practices the Islamic faith. Conservative nutters have taken his education and used it to peddle lies to their bigoted base. Of course, even if the presOf course, even if the president were Muslim it wouldn t matter since we have this really old document called the Constitution that grants every person in the United States the inalienable right to practice (or not practice) whichever faith they want to. Furthermore, Article VI, Clause 3 of the Constitution says: ; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.They know that it doesn t matter if he is a Muslim, but they claim that he is because Islamophobia sells   just look at Donald Trump.So, perhaps with all of this speculation out there it s no wonder the president has never visited a mosque over the last seven years. However, that is all about to change as the White House announced Obama will make his first trip to a mosque on Saturday to show the community support. The president believes that one of our nation s greatest strengths is our rich diversity,  White House spokesman Keith Maley said.  As the president has said, Muslim Americans are our friends, and neighbors; our co-workers, and sports heroes   and our men and women in uniform defending our country. The GOP will predictably go wild. I m sure the whole  super secret Muslim Kenyan dictator Frenchman double agent  talk will rear its uneducated head again. Luckily for us as he finishes out his time in office he gives less sh*t about what the Party of Hate expects him to do and more about what needs to be done.Featured image via Salon",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cruz’s Desperate Last Minute Attempt To Win Iowa Is So Vile State Officials Just NAILED Him For It,"In the closing days before the Iowa caucus, the very first primary of the 2016 election, Ted Cruz is having a bit of a panic moment. Having enjoyed high polls in Iowa for months, his disastrous last debate performance and general unlikability have him falling fast. In his desperation to win, his campaign decided to try to lie and shame voters into showing up for him   and absolutely NOBODY is happy about it.This week, Iowans began waking up to find a scary looking note in their mail. On yellow paper made to look like a ticket, the letter reads  VOTING VIOLATION  and creepily names the homeowner and their neighbors. The instructions are even more pathetic.You are recieving this election notice because of low expected voter turnout in your area. Your individual voting history as well as your neighbors  are public record. Their scores are published below, and many of them will see your score as well. Caucus on monday to improve your score and please encourage your neighbors to caucus as well. A follow-up notice may be issued following Monday s caucuses.In other words, Cruz s campaign is trying to scare unknowing Iowans into voting (preferably for him) by threatening to make them look bad in front of their community. What s more, Cruz s name only appears in small print at the top of the envelope (and no where on the  ticket  at all). It would be easy to open this up and see  VOTING VIOLATION  blaring at you in read and think you were actually in trouble.How scummy is this tactic? So scummy, in fact, that one of Cruz s biggest endorsers actually swore Cruz would never do something as low as this. He didn t know it at the time, but Cruz s campaign had already confirmed that it had. Yes, they really are that desperate.It now appears that Cruz s underhanded tactics have even caught the eye of Iowa s state government   and they weren t amused. Iowa s Republican secretary of state, Paul Pate, released a statement strongly rebuking Cruz s campaign for trying to pull something like this. He has a personal beef with it too, because Cruz s campaign   in all of its hubris   decided to name his office in the mailer. It implied that Iowa s state government was complicit. Today I was shown a piece of literature from the Cruz for President campaign that misrepresents the role of my office, and worse, misrepresents Iowa election law. Accusing citizens of Iowa of a  voting violation  based on Iowa Caucus participation, or lack thereof, is false representation of an official act. There is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting. Any insinuation or statement to the contrary is wrong and I believe it is not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses. It is, of course, important in a democracy that people vote. (Ironically, Cruz has been instrumental in preventing people from voting. But only the ones he doesn t like.) However, there are any number of reasons why a person would have a  low score  in these ridiculous fliers and still have contributed to the voting process. Some may have been out of state residents who vote by mail. Others may have simply decided to not participate in a Republican primary in which all candidates don t seem to represent their values. In any case, it s not up to Ted Cruz and his desperate campaign to shame a person for not doing what he would like. Worse, making it appear as if the mail recipient is in violation of a law, can make people even more fearful of the voting process.Cruz s campaign has long been built on lies and smears, but it s becoming clear that in his frenzy to catch up with Donald Trump, he s lost all sense of perspective.Feature image via Jamelle Bouie/Flickr",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Takes On Walmart In This Speech And It Is Glorious (VIDEO),"During a campaign event at Iowa s Wesleyan University, Bernie Sanders spoke to the audience about how Walmart and other large corporations benefit from a  rigged economy. Sanders begins by saying that Walmart is very appreciative of all the support they receive from taxpayers: Just to give you an example of what a rigged economy is all about.  I mentioned the Walton family   the wealthiest family in the world   being very appreciative that you are supporting them. They re very happy about that.  And they asked me to send you their thanks. Sanders continues, saying: They re only worth 60 of 70 billion dollars and they do appreciate you paying taxes to help them subsidize their workers. This is how we re going to pay to put 13 million Americans back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. There has been a lot of criticism of Sanders that says that he does not have a plan to pay for the programs he is proposing. That is absolute nonsense. Here is a comprehensive funding plan for every policy Sanders has proposed.And to the right-wingers who shout the obnoxiously classist claim that people only support Sanders because he wants to give them  free stuff,  that s actually the opposite of what Sanders wants. What he wants is for corporations to stop getting free stuff from tax payers. As Sanders points out in the speech: Three major profitable corporations not only pay nothing in federal income taxes, they actually got a rebate from the IRS. Three major corporations made over $100 billion in profit, paid nothing in taxes, and in fact, got a rebate from the I.R.S. Right now we have a rigged economy where there is socialism for the rich, and unregulated capitalism for the rest.Sanders concludes his speech, saying that closing these loopholes will help fund one of his most inspiring programs. That s how were going to pay to rebuild our infrastructure and put millions of people back to work.

 Netanyahu Says ‘Respected Western Opinion Leaders’ Hate The Jewish People (VIDEO),"With world opinion of Israel at an all time low, and with the growing movement to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is getting desperate. So,what better way to shut down criticism of Israel than to make the accusation of anti-Semitism?[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUE9yNffy5U]This time, the accusation wasn t hurled at Palestinians or so-called  self-hating Jews  and others who criticize Israel. In a sign of the times, it was directed at Western leaders, historically supportive of anything Israel but who are growing increasingly impatient with Israel over its horrendous treatment of the Palestinians. During Netanyahu s official greeting on the occasion of International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Netanyahu stated: Islamic extremists incorporate the most outrageous antisemitism into their murderous doctrines. We see this in Gaza; we see it in Raqqa; we see it in Tehran. And it s not just Islamic extremists in the Middle East and Europe. Even respected Western opinion leaders have become afflicted with hatred for the Jewish people and the Jewish state. The charge of anti-Semitism has traditionally been used as a tool to muzzle those who speak out against Israel s nasty  policies toward the Palestinians and it s worked for a long time but there has been a slow but sure change that has alarmed Netanyahu and the Zionist establishment both in Israel and around the world. While Western opinion has indeed changed, its important to differentiate between being anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. Israel is a state worthy of criticism for its genocidal policies toward the Palestinians and its thievery of their lands and it s not anti-Semitic to criticize Israel but it s actually right and a just thing to do. However, when this happens, the anti-Semitic accusation immediately follows.For example, when Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstrom recently called for conducting an investigation into Israel s extrajudicial executions of Palestinians during the latest violence, she was attacked by Israeli politicians and the media through a campaign of hatred and incitement and was labeled an anti-Semite.  One former Israeli official even incited murder against her in an article, suggesting that Wallstr m deserved to be executed like Count Folke Bernadotte, a Swedish UN diplomat murdered by a Zionist militia in 1948. The aricle, by Zvi Zameret, headlined Margot Wallstr m s source of inspiration, was published in Makor Rishon, a paper owned by US Zionist billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson, an unconditional supporter of Israel and Benjmamin Netanyahu, and a guy who the Republican presidential candidates grovel to for money and support.Although the attacks can be frighting, Westerners are developing a backbone. The European Union has recently approved of labeling goods made in the West Bank as  made in settlements  rather than  made in Israel.  Israel called the move (take a guess) anti-Semitic. However, Israeli settlements are built on Palestinian territory Israel occupied in 1967 and are deemed illegal under international law.Even the United States, a country whose politicians grovel to Zionists more than any other country (it s quite embarrassing), have come out in criticism of Israel, most notably under President Obama s administration. US ambassador to Israel David Shapiro recently criticized Israel s failure to prosecute Jewish vigilantism against Palestinians and its differing set of laws for Jews and Palestinians in the West Bank, effectively calling Israel an apartheid state. During a speech in Tel Aviv, Shapiro, who is Jewish, said: Too much Israeli vigilantism in the West Bank goes on unchecked. There is a lack of thorough investigations   at times it seems Israel has two standards of adherence to rule of law in the West Bank   one for Israelis and one for Palestinians. The response from the Zionist establishment was nasty and typical. A former Netanyahu aide used a derogatory ethnic slur, calling Shapiro  yehudon,  the equivalent of  little Jew boy  used in Israel to describe Jews not living in Israel as not being  Jewish enough  or  pro-Israel. The bottom line is that the world is disgusted with Israel. Its Western supporters can no longer defend a crumbling system of apartheid and injustice that is coming to an end. The movement that calls for justice for Palestinians is growing and as Nelson Mandela, the great leader of the South African anti-aparteid movement, eloquently stated: We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.

 Oregon Militant’s Family Doesn’t Believe He Had A Gun (VIDEO),"On January 29, the family of LaVoy Finicum released a three page statement questioning the FBI s narrative of his death. While there s no doubt Finicum s family would like to remember him as a  hero  and a  martyr,  the difference between what actually happened and the fantasy-filled version of events outlined in the statement is both sad and scary.LaVoy Finicum was a member of an armed group of militants who seized control of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon earlier this month.On January 26, more than three weeks after the group first seized control of the federal property, authorities apprehended seven of the militiamen. Finicum was shot by FBI agents after he reached for a weapon, while attempting to escape arrest.Video of the shooting, taken from a helicopter which hoovered above the scene, was released by the FBI a short time after Finicum was shot.The video evidence destroys the narrative being pressed by right-wing extremists, who claimed Finicum was  gunned down in cold blood, while on his knees, with his hands in the air. Thanks to The Oregonian, we can see exactly what happened in the moments leading up to LaVoy Finicum s death.The video below shows the crucial moments from the FBI s footage slowed down and magnified. There is no doubt that Finicum went for a gun.Finicum s single  moment in the sun  came earlier this month, when he was interviewed by MSNBC s Tony Dokoupil at the Malheur refuge.During the interview, an armed Finicum told Dokoupil that he had no intention of allowing authorities to arrest him. Watch the interview here.In spite of an overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary, the three page statement released by the family of LaVoy Finicum attempts to portray Finicum as an innocent victim of the evil government. They blame everyone except the criminals   from the FBI to Oregon governor Kate Brown   for Finicum s death.The family claims that authorities were  not patient enough  with the militants. That s in spite of the fact that the armed group was allowed to remain at the refuge, unimpeded, for nearly a month. Over that time period, they were given warning after warning, and provided with every opportunity to leave. They continued to break the law and threaten the community.The statement also claims that a  peaceful solution was in the works. The first observation is that from what we understand, the occupation was on track toward a peaceful resolution. LaVoy and those he was with were en route to a public meeting in an adjoining county when they were stopped in something far different than a routine traffic stop,  as has been portrayed by the media. Unfortunately, the powers that be were not interested in being patient enough for the occupation to come to a peaceful end. Again, the truth contradicts this statement.In this video, posted to his own YouTube account on January 22, Finicum assured his followers that the group was not  getting ready to capitulate.  He went on to say  Rest assured, we are not getting ready to leave,  and  for those of you who are worried that we are about ready to negotiate with the FBI, that is not the case. That is not going to happen. The militants were also not on their way to any ordinary public meeting when they were apprehended by the FBI. They were on their way to hold a secretive mock trial of public officials, known within the sovereign citizens movement as a Citizen s Grand Jury. In other words, the threat the group presented to the residents of Harney County was escalating, not  being resolved  as the statement claims.But of all the fantasy-based ideas presented in the letter, the one that stands out the most is this: The FBI claims that LaVoy had a loaded firearm in an inside pocket of his coat. After re-reviewing the extended video, at this point we are not accepting at face value the FBI s statement that LaVoy was actually armed. At no point during the group s occupation of the Federal Wildlife Refuge was LaVoy Finicum not armed.He holstered a .45 caliber pistol to his side and slept with a shotgun on his lap.We know from his own public statements that he had no intention of being arrested alive.While Finicum s family is undoubtedly grieving his loss, the facts remain unchanged. The man was neither a martyr, a hero nor an innocent victim. He was not killed in cold blood by the FBI.Here s the family s statement, via Fox 13.Finicum Family Statement 1.29.2016G*Featured image credit: video screen capture LaVoy Finicum on youtube",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Bill Maher Explains How Republicans Get Away With Their Outrageous Lies,"At some point, Republicans learned that they can just lie and get away with it. No matter how many times that the lie is debunked, people still believe it.That was the topic for a hilarious segment of Real Time with Bill Maher. In the segment, Maher takes on Republican  zombie  lies. This is a topic that Maher has covered before, but given the amount of lying and half-truths that candidates riding in the GOP clown car have fired off   it s definitely worth reexamining. Especially when you consider, as Maher puts it,  Republicans have gone beyond even the zombie lie to just making sh*t up. Maher blames a lot of the problem on the internet. It today s age, conservatives are oftentimes locked into their own bubble where facts simply do not matter. It isn t even a problem where they are taking in biased information, it s just stuff that has been made up by Republicans, that RWNJ s latch on to.Last year, a poll found that 49% of Republicans believe that President Obama is a Muslim. Overall, 29% of people said that they think he is a Muslim. That s a lot of people who believe something that is just not true, even in the slightest. It s something that is extremely easy to fact check. There should be no reason for any reasonable person to believe that Obama is a Muslim.Maher cites a recent example involving Carly Fiorina who said that she saw a Planned Parenthood video that featured a  fully formed fetus on the table, its heart, its legs kicking, while someone says  We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.  Which is absolutely pure bullsh*t.Just take a look at Politifact s records on the Republican presidential candidates, versus their record on the Democratic candidates. The difference is very clear.You can watch the full segment of the show, below.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via YouTube ",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Trump Desperately Pander To Evangelicals In The Most Pathetic Way Imaginable (VIDEO),"When you re a salesperson, you try your best to identify the need of the customer to convince them to buy what you re selling. And in the case of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, he knows the Republican base has a  need  for someone who claims to be  Christian.  This was apparent at the last GOP debate when Rev. Senator Marco Rubio kept bringing up Jesus Christ time and time again, when Sen. Ted Cruz seems to claim to be the chosen one, and now when Donald Trump brings out his childhood Bible to prove how  Christian  he really, truly is.You see, there is no religious test in order to be President of the United States. In fact, it would be unconstitutional if it were to be required of candidates to prove their faith or deem themselves worthy of being elected. However, Republicans aren t known for following the Constitution, as much as they like to say they do, so we end up seeing things like this pathetic display to pander to evangelical Christians who are apparently so dimwitted that they can t see straight through the farce.Evangelicals, he s selling you a line.

" What This Georgia Republican Just Said About The KKK, Slavery And ISIS Will Blow Your Mind","A state Republican in Georgia made an astonishingly racist set of remarks, in his defense of the South s Confederate and racist history.State Rep. Tommy Benton has flat-out denied that the Civil War had anything to do with slavery, compared the Confederate leaders to the Founding Fathers, expressed his profound displeasure with what he called  cultural cleansing  of Southern history. He insisted that the KKK was not a racist organization   but rather  a vigilante thing to help keep law and order,  claiming that made a lot of people  straighten up. Where do we even begin here? Let s start with the assertion that the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery. We can refer to the Cornerstone Speech, which was given by Vice President Alexander Stephens of the Confederacy, a few weeks before the Confederacy started the Civil War.Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.He suggested that the Civil War was wrong because the North didn t address the loss of what was approximately two billion dollars worth of  property  that belonged to the South. Yes, he meant that the slaves were the property of the South.Benton also is critical of African-Americans for not denouncing their own African ancestors for selling slaves.Then comes the idea of  cultural cleansing.  The offensiveness of this kind of assertion is profound. Cultural cleansing is another term for genocide, the latter of which didn t exist as a word until the Nazi s tried to cleanse Europe of people they considered to be  undesirables.  No, the removal of a Confederate flag is not equal to the gassing of the Jews in Nazi Germany.Benton expanded on the cleansing remarks by saying that the removal of things like the Confederate flag or renaming of things like streets or buildings which were named after Confederate legacy is directly equivalent to ISIS destroying cultural sites in the Middle East. That s no better than what ISIS is doing, destroying museums and monuments,  he said.  I feel very strongly about this. I think it has gone far enough. There is some idea out there that certain parts of history out there don t matter anymore and that s a bunch of bunk. No. Nobody in the South is ripping up roads or smashing buildings after executing the local population in order to  cleanse  Confederate history. We are simply asking that it not continue to be glorified as some kind of noble cause.Our founding fathers would have hated the guts of Republicans like this guy. The Founders embraced things like science. Being smart, to them, was an advantage   not a liability. The KKK was also not ever in its history a  justice movement  meant to keep the peace. Its purpose through history was to restore white supremacy and terrorize former slaves, immigrants, Catholics, Jews, and anybody promoting the civil rights of the groups that the Klan hated.Remember: Republicans keep saying that their party is the party of Civil Rights because Abraham Lincoln was one of them. I sure am glad they cleared that up. Otherwise, people like Tommy Benton would make me think the Republican party is full of racists.Watch local news coverage of an interview featuring Benton below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxj8O9sL_4Y&w=560&h=315]featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Christians’ Who Leave Fake $20 Tips For Servers Draw Epic Response From Restaurant Manager,"Christian fundamentalists picked on the wrong restaurant to leave their fake $20 tips.For quite some time now, Christian fundamentalists have been angering waiters and waitresses by leaving religious messages disguised as $20 bills as the tip.The notes say that they can have something more valuable than money, which they claim is a belief in Jesus.But to the servers who receive such a tip, it s nothing more than a dirty trick that angers them. They worked hard attending to their customers in an effort to receive a well-earned tip that will help them pay the bills and put food on the table. A plain piece of paper masquerading as a $20 bill doesn t help at all. If anything, it makes religious people look like a bunch of jerks.Well, one restaurant manager chose to fight back after a similar trick was cruelly played on one of her employees.According to WCNC in North Carolina,Penny Craver, general manager of Dish in Plaza Midwood, says one of her employees, who s also a student, was really upset on Saturday after receiving a religious pamphlet from her guests and a less than 8-percent tip.Instead of just being angry, Craver actually did something about it. She looked up the church named on the fake $20, Harbor Baptist Church in Charlotte, and fired off an email to the pastor condemning the action and suggesting a Sunday sermon about fair monetary exchange.Here s the email in its entirety via WCNC.Pastor Simmons:I am the general manager of Dish (restaurant) in Plaza Midwood. Imagine one of my server s surprise when she received a small pamphlet (Every one of us will face eternity one day) instead of a tip when she served what I assume was one of your congregation. Her particular religious beliefs are not discussed at work; however, I do know that this pamphlet can not pay her mortgage or her electric bill. It concerns me that someone would consider a pamphlet fair monetary exchange. Suppose your congregation felt it was sufficient to tithe their personal writings instead of 10% of their income. Your church wouldn t be paying their bills for very long. I think it would be great if you used this in a sermon. Pride, one of the 7 Deadly Sins, is considered, on almost every list, the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins: the source of the others. It is identified as believing that one is essentially better than others, failing to acknowledge the accomplishments of others, and excessive admiration of the personal self (especially holding self out of proper position toward God). I think it could be educational for at least one member of your congregation. Thank you very much for your time.And it seems to have worked. Pastor Simmons has allegedly spoken to the congregant who left the crappy tip and says it won t happen again, and if it does, the church will make it right. Craver certainly hopes the church keeps their word, especially since this has happened several times in the last few months.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Homeless Veterans Group Asked Trump For A Donation, So He Sent Them Bumper Stickers","As we ve all heard from Trump, he didn t skip the debate because the thought of facing a woman who is willing to confront him turns his pants just a little brown, or because Fox News would not pay him $5 million for the appearance. Instead, he just wanted to do something nice for America s veterans. According to the billionaire, the rally he scheduled to air on Fox s competing networks during the debate raised a whopping $6 million for Veterans. Unfortunately, this money all went to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which has an abysmal history of helping those who have served our country, with less than 1% of donations going to that particular cause.While Trump is perfectly willing to hide behind our Vets as he pretends that he s not scared of being challenged by Megyn Kelly, a simply look at his recent history reveals how much he actually cares about people who, unlike him, put on a uniform and served our nation. Last year, New York-based Veterans-in-Command, an organization that helps homeless veterans, reached out to The Donald for a donation.More than a year ago, New York-based Veterans-in-Command, an organization that helps homeless veterans, reached out to The Donald for a donation.While one might assume that Trump would jump at the opportunity to help out, time went by and they received no response until just before Trump s little debate day stunt, when the cash-strapped organization got some mail from the Trump campaign. But what was inside was not something that can feed or house those in need   unless, of course, someone feel like eating or building a home out of bumper stickers. Unfortunately we are unable to make donations from the campaign,  reads a handwritten note in the envelope.  Team Trump.  The letter informs the organization that Mr. Trump is very passionate about giving veterans the best life possible!  Included was a few Trump campaign bumper stickers. Afterward, Veterans-in-Command began receiving emails from the Trump campaign asking them for money.via NY Daily NewsThe group finds this response puzzling because they did not write to the Trump campaign. We never wrote to his campaign,  said Veterans-in-Command President Larry Robertson.  Now they want us to get out there and campaign and be on his team? Without the veterans, he wouldn t be where he is today.  The news that Trump had raised money to help Veterans  groups further confounds Robertson and his membership. It just doesn t make any sense. He s campaigning for donations for veterans,  said Rodney Moore, a retired U.S. Coast Guard petty officer who works with Veterans-In-Command.  We were a little deflated. After taking a proverbial beating for funneling money to his own Foundation, Trump finally released a list of 22 groups the donated money will benefit. Veterans-In-Command was not on the list despite reaching out to the billionaire 2016 hopeful.But, hey, at least they got some bumper stickers and campaign emails. After all, they re sure to support him after all this, aren t they?Featured image via NY Daily News/screengrab",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Hypocrisy In Georgia: Teen Charged In Accidental Shooting Death, While Parents Largely Go Unprosecuted","A 17-year-old teenager is dead today after his 16-year-old friend accidentally shot him in the face with an unsecured gun. Now the teen who shot him is facing dire consequences.According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution a group of boys were playing with a loaded gun inside an apartment complex when the shooting occurred. Relatives of the boys, who ranged from ages 13 to 17, told reporters that they were all friends or cousins.The 16-year-old was apparently holding the gun just after midnight when it discharged and struck the older boy in the face. After the shooting the  suspect  ran home and told his family that he shot someone. The family members drove him back to the scene where he was arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter.In 2014, News 21 found that 28,000 children and teens are killed each year in the United States by firearms. To put this into perspective, that means that for every soldier who was killed in Afghanistan (over eleven years) at least thirteen kids were killed in America.Teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 made up over two-thirds of all youth gun deaths in America.The News21 findings are compiled in the most complete database to date from records obtained from 49 state health departments and FBI Supplementary Homicide Reports.Many of the children who are killed each year die in an  unintentional  shooting. Often times these  accidents  happen because they or another child get their hands on an unsecured weapon and it discharges. As a matter of fact, American children are SIXTEEN times more likely to be killed in an accidental shooting than their counterparts in other industrialized nations.Although the kid in this case was charged with a crime, negligent parents rarely are. Twenty-seven states (Georgia included) and the District of Columbia have child access prevention (CAP) laws; these laws hold parents responsible when their children access a gun and someone is hurt   but enforcement is almost nonexistent. According to the Shreveport Times police often feel guilty charging parents who are grieving the loss of a child.Slate reported:Even in states where these laws exist, they re both inconsistent standards and penalties for culpability vary widely from state to state and inconsistently applied, with prosecutors often choosing not to pursue cases against negligent parents out of sympathy, perhaps, or a sense that these cases are hard to win. And that s understandable: These shootings are tragedies, after all, and why compound a family s misery by sending a grieving parent to jail? But CAP laws are only effective as a deterrent if they re vigorously enforced.So parents get away with their negligence, but a scared 16-year-old kid is charged with a crime. As a mother, this appalls me. I would fully expect to be charged with a crime if my son picked up my gun and hurt himself or someone else. As adults we are responsible for keeping our little humans as safe as we can and if we do something that was so neglectful that someone dies as a result, we should be charged.To give us a pass, but prosecute a child is mind-boggling. Meanwhile, this shooting and this shooting and this shooting  all go unprosecuted in the same state.Featured image via Freakout Nation",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Trump? Masked Nationalists Beat Up Refugee Children (VIDEO),"A group of thugs marched through the main train station in Stockholm, Sweden and beat up refugee children and anyone who didn t appear to be ethnically Swedish. It is a shocking moment of anti-migrant violence as Europe deals with the fallout from the Syrian civil war.Wearing all-black balaclavas and armbands, the men  gathered with the purpose of attacking refugee children,  Stockholm police spokesperson Towe Hagg said. I saw maybe three people who were beaten. That was no football brawl or something similar. They targeted migrants. I was quite scared and ran away,  an eyewitness told the Aftonbladet newspaper.Before the attacks, the mob handed out leaflets with the slogan  It is enough now!  which threatened to give  the North African street children who are roaming around  the  punishment they deserve .The rhetoric of the attackers sounds unsettling like what we have been hearing every night at Donald Trump s presidential rallies. He launched his campaign with an explicitly white power message, blaming Mexicans for being  rapists,  then arguing in favor of a national registry of Muslims and banning them from traveling to the United States.Trump s rhetoric has already led to violence here. One group of Massachusetts men beat up a Latino man while citing Trump, while at his rallies Trump has egged on his supporters who have attacked and mistreated black protesters.The rise of the nationalist right in Europe has used mass migration as its excuse of the moment, blaming economic hardships and slowdowns on migrants with different colored skin and ethnic and religious backgrounds has been a trope of the extremist right for ages.The Republican Party and the mainstream press have both been afraid to call out Trump and his backers for their blatant hate, and while it seems unspeakable, we re not that different from the people in Europe. Maybe it could happen here.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill O’Reilly Hilariously Reminds Rick Santorum That He Is No Longer Relevant (VIDEO),"Rick Santorum has been whining about not getting attention from the media, so Bill O Reilly hilarious broke the news to the conservative extremist candidate that nobody cares about him anymore.Earlier this week, Santorum accused the media of  predetermining  the presidential race before Iowans vote. Santorum then complained about never being invited on Fox News to be interviewed by Megyn Kelly or Bill O Reilly despite announcing his campaign last May.As you ll recall, Santorum ran for president in 2012 and nearly captured the Republican nomination, which is in stark contrast to 2016 as his latest campaign is nothing short of an absolute joke. Santorum has been unable to climb out of the low single digits in the polls, even though he has name recognition and conservative voters surely remember who he is.But clearly, things have changed in four years and Santorum is no longer the golden boy of the conservative movement. That mantle is now owned by Donald Trump and to a lesser extent, Ted Cruz. A fact which O Reilly broke down for Santorum in simple words so he could understand: I feel Rick Santorum s pain,  O Reilly said. He is absolutely correct; we have not had him on The Factor. But there is a reason for that. We re not in the campaigning business. We do not put politicians on the air simply to spout their slogans. That s what ads are for. We cover the news and when a politician is in the news then they get on the program. That s why Donald Trump gets so much air time. He s dominating the news cycle by injecting controversy into the political arena. Then O Reilly dropped the hammer on Santorum and his remaining hopes to revive his struggling campaign. Honestly, we looked for a reason to put Santorum on, but we couldn t find any. His poll numbers are very low, his campaign strategy is what it was four years ago. There s simply nothing new. Here s the video via YouTube:Poor Rick Santorum. He ll just have settle for being number one on Google for all the wrong reasons.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Accepts Endorsement Of Pastor Who Says God Sent Hitler To Kill The Jews (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz proudly announced the latest endorsement of his presidential bid. It comes from Pastor Mike Bickle, founder and director of the International House of Prayer of Kansas City. Bickle is a figure well known for his attack on on same sex-marriage, calling it a sign of the end of times. He has also blamed the Jews for the Holocaust. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hE_AOR2JBE]In a 2011 speech, Bickle suggested that millions of Jews were exterminated during the Holocaust because they didn t accept  God s gift,  Jesus Christ. He quoted Jeremiah 16:16 from the Bible to explain why Hitler murdered millions of Jews. He said: The Lord says, I m going to give all 20 million of them the chance to respond to the fishermen. And I give them grace.  And he says,  And if they don t respond to grace, I m going to raise up the hunters.  And the most famous hunter in recent history is a man named Adolf Hitler. It doesn t get more anti-Semitic than this guy. His statement not only blames Jews for the Holocaust, but also justifies it: because Jews didn t accept Jesus, they deserved to die.Bickle also says that in the coming end of days, Jews will be put in prison and death camps. When all is said and done, 2/3rds of the Jewish population will be destroyed and off to hell because they didn t accept Jesus. Thus, not only were they murdered for not accepting Jesus, the Jews will be murdered again for continuing their rejection of Jesus.Ted Cruz is excited about the endorsement of the genocidal Bickle. He said: Through prayer, the Lord has changed my life and altered my family s story. I am grateful for Mike s dedication to call a generation of young people to prayer and spiritual commitment. Heidi and I are grateful to have his prayers and support. With the support of Mike and many other people of faith, we will fight the good fight, finish the course, and keep the faith. Cruz and Bickle are of the same ilk and ideology when it comes to religion and so it should come as no surprise to all of us that Cruz would be proud of this endorsement. Bickle s statements are not only anti-Semitic, but they are also genocidal. To actually believe that Jews have been and will be exterminated because they don t believe in Jesus (whatever that means) justifies the Holocaust and also justifies a future one for millions of so-called Christians.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons.",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 There’s One Thing Trump Is More Sensitive About Than His Hair – And It’s Hilarious (IMAGES),"Here s something not everybody knows about: Vanity Fair s Graydon Carter once called Donald Trump a  short-fingered vulgarian  in an article. Ever since that time, Trump has sent him odd little letters defending his small hands, digits, whatever you want to call them.You d think Trump does this kind of thing for more publicity (there s always that inkling of possibility) but not so, in this case, says Mr. Carter.Here he is in his own words, describing how much it bothers Trump, and the  lengths  Trump has gone to dismiss the writer s claims: Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a  short-fingered vulgarian  in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago. To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby. The most recent offering arrived earlier this year, before his decision to go after the Republican presidential nomination. Like the other packages, this one included a circled hand and the words, also written in gold Sharpie:  See, not so short!  I sent the picture back by return mail with a note attached, saying,  Actually, quite short.  Which I can only assume gave him fits. Now the internet is finally catching on, and in this day in age of social media, Twitter, Facebook, and internet memes to boot, the combination is quite hysterical. There s even an entire page on Twitter devoted to making fun of Trump s fingers, called, you guessed it, Trumpfingers.But, Trumpfingers isn t the only one getting in on the action. A simple search on Twitter of  Trump fingers  or  Trump small hands  will display all sorts of results. As if the internet didn t already have enough memes mocking Trump, now there s more on a different subject matter entirely.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Wikimedia.It sounds silly once you think about it, but the fact that it bothers Trump is even sillier. No one wants to worsen any further Trump s apparent body dysmorphic disorder, but nobody said politics was easy. If Trump was even halfway as nice to Muslims at his rallies as they are to him, we might lay off of it. But guys like him don t deserve any remorse from us.If everybody shows up to vote this November, you can rest assured Donald Trump will NEVER get the privilege of holding up his  short-fingered vulgarian  hands to administer the oath of office of president. Let s make sure that doesn t happen.Featured image via Facebook",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Did Not Send ‘Top Secret’ Emails On Private Server,"On January 29, the U.S. State Department announced that the agency had identified 37 pages of  top secret emails  among the 55,000 pages of emails contained on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s private email server.Not surprisingly, Clinton s GOP rivals went straight to work spreading half-truths and misinformation about the announcement.As former Chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Dianne Feinstein pointed out in a statement on Friday, several key facts are being left out of the narrative surrounding the announcement.For starters, the 37 pages of  top secret  communication actually involve only seven chain emails. Each of these seven emails was sent to a larger group of recipients, including the former Secretary of State.None of the  top secret emails  were sent from Hillary Clinton s private server.All of the emails originated from within the State Department s unclassified system. None of them contained the mandatory  top secret  label which is required for all classified communication.During a press conference on Friday, State Dept. spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the emails were being withheld because they meet the definition of top secret communication now.Kirby also stressed that the emails were not marked classified at the time that they were sent. Was the information contained in the emails considered classified at the time they were sent? Keep in mind that all 55,000 of Clinton s emails were sent between March 2009 and February 2013. Since the State Department regularly raises the status of unclassified material to the level of classified, it s more than likely the content of these seven emails was not considered classified when it was sent.According to Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon,  in at least one case, the emails appear to involve information from a published news article. The last time the GOP went wild with claims that Clinton had  top secret emails  on her private server, we later found out that the information had been retroactively classified by the FBI.To summarize:In other words, this is not the huge scandal republicans were hoping for. Instead, it s just another baseless right wing attack on Hillary Clinton that falls apart under even the slightest amount of scrutiny.Featured image credit: Pixabay",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 What Facebook Just Did About Guns Is Going To Drive The NRA Insane,"Facebook announced that it will be banning its users from arranging private gun sales over both the main Facebook site and its photo-sharing site Instagram.While these new rules do not apply to licensed gun dealers, who can still post with the stipulation that they do not conduct purchases on the site, it does apply to private one-on-one sales that do not require background checks in many states.What is very important is that the move covers gun parts and ammunition as well. The banning of ammunition sales is obviously effective since without massive amounts of bullets you can t have massive amounts of gun violence. The fact it applies to gun parts is significant as well. Federal law doesn t currently cover some gun parts, like an  unfinished lower receiver.  They are treated as  not a gun  if they are 80 percent or less complete. This allows them to be sold without serial numbers or background checks. If you provide the parts to someone who is experienced enough to complete them, you basically have what will make an untraceable gun. Afterward, they can be assembled with other parts into a fully functional firearm. Some websites even sell the machines to complete receivers and boast about the fact you can build unserialized firearms legally in your own home.Facebook s status as a non-governmental entity gives it more control over what it can allow on its network. It simply doesn t matter if a person s slightly unfinished gun parts are legal to sell to anyone without background checks. Facebook can restrict whatever they want, just like they do with marijuana, pharmaceuticals or other illegal material. This helps tremendously in curbing the ways federal law has failed us.Facebook s head of product policy, Monika Bickert, said  Over the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another. We are continuing to develop, test and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution. Do you think that any Republicans will be boycotting Facebook now? What will their alternative be?featured image via wikicommons",News,"January 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ammon Bundy Just Got Sweet Justice Handed To Him By A Federal Judge (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy and his armed ganged of militants have upset an entire nation over the last couple of weeks for their supposed special treatment by the police. While that did appear to be the case for the longest time, the raid was partially broken up by authorities after a shootout with one of Bundy s pals, LaVoy Finicum. Now, a federal court is refusing to give people that same impression   and they re sending the message loud and clear: There will be NO special treatment after laws have been broken, no matter who you think you are.On Friday, U.S. District Court judge Stacie Beckerman told Ammon Bundy and his brother that they would remain in jail and not be let out on bail pending their trial on federal conspiracy charges.If anyone knows anything about the court system, it s not a quick process. That means Ammon Bundy is going to be in jail for a long time. That should give him quite a long time to think about what he s done, and it should also discourage other so-called armed militants calling themselves  Federalists  out to protect peoples  rights from thinking they can get away with breaking the law, too.Pic via Twitter.The reason for the denial should come as no surprise, though: there are still four militants occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. If the judge released Bundy or any of the other perpetrators already arrested, they could simply return to the building. And   that s exactly what prosecutors communicated to the court before bail was denied. They also hilariously used the Bundys own words against them: This creates an inherent risk of flight. Moreover, [their] own statements demonstrate his unwillingness to comply with the terms of pretrial supervision.On August 16, 2015, Bundy posted on Facebook that  There is no justice in a federal court. The feds have used the courts to take rights, not protect them.' #breakingnews Read US Attorney s reason for wanting Ammon Bundy kept in jail #koin6news #Oregonstandoff pic.twitter.com/Yn6CZe5h8j  Dan Tilkin (@DanTilkinKOIN6) January 29, 2016We have a strange feeling Bundy didn t like the judge s decision. That s just a good guess.Meanwhile, the rest of the gang is refusing to standdown unless they re promised no charges will be made by the FBI. Take a look at the latest video posted below.

 WATCH: Ted Cruz Lies Straight To The Camera After Trump Calls Him A Canadian Anchor Baby,"Ted Cruz was approached at a campaign stop in New Hampshire and asked to give a response to Trump s latest attack, in which he calls Cruz a  Canadian anchor baby.  In and of itself, the question was not that fruitful   but what is important is how Cruz handled it. Basically, all it told us was that Ted Cruz is great at lying (not like we didn t already know that).Senator Cruz looked right at the camera and after giving out a jolly laugh, said: I like Donald. And   he s welcome to say whatever he likes. I like and respect him. That s all I got to say and right now its up to the voters to decide. He likes and respects him? How can that even be believable for a second? He didn t even say it sarcastically. No wonder nobody likes Ted Cruz; he doesn t even respect himself with the truth.While it s commendable that Ted Cruz would not resort to any further attacks, he s doing a greater disservice by lending further legitimacy to a guy that deserves ZERO political respect from the voters. And   he didn t even mean it. Next thing you know this clip will be used in another campaign ad by Trump as proof that he s a  respectable guy.  Yet   he s nowhere close to it. Ted Cruz needs to grow some balls.While it is true that Cruz and Trump had a bromance before Ted Cruz started rising in the polls, whatever love and affection they had for each other effectively ended when Donald began attacking him below the belt in every way imaginable. How can Ted Cruz respect someone who just a few weeks ago referred to him a  nasty guy.  The full quote is much, much worse than that: Look, the truth is, he s a nasty guy. He was so nice to me. I mean, I knew it. I was watching. I kept saying,  Come on Ted. Let s go, okay.  But he s a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Nobody in Congress likes him. Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him. He s a very  - he s got an edge that s not good. You can t make deals with people like that and it s not a good thing. It s not a good thing for the country. Very nasty guy.

 Hate Group Leader Claims Gay People Are Imposing Islamic Tax On American Christians (AUDIO),"Mat Staver, leader of the legal organization Liberty Counsel, has declared that gay people in America are imposing a  jizya  style tax on American Christians. Jizya refers to a tax levied on non-Muslim subjects living in a Muslim land under Islamic law.Since gay people have to date had zero successes in directly taxing only American Christians, the context Staver is trying to apply will need some explanation.Staver is trying to reclassify legal fines for  Christians  violating anti-discrimination laws as a tax on American Christians for  living their life by their spiritual beliefs.  A well-known example of this is the case of Sweet Cakes by Melissa. The bakery denied serving a same-sex couple and ended up paying over $135,000 in state ordered damages and fines.The line Staver is trying to draw between these two issues is completely ridiculous. Literally anybody who would deny service to a same-sex couple or even a gay individual, simply because they re gay, would fall under these civil laws. They could be an atheist who just has an irrational hatred and fear of gay people. It also isn t a tax, because a tax is something you pay regularly regardless of bad behavior or lack thereof. These bigots only pay the penalty when they do something wrong.Liberty Counsel has unsurprisingly been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, due to the fact they devote most of their time to defending bigots and other forms of persecution by Christians against Americans. Staver himself is a Young Earth Creationist who believes that  intelligent design  should be taught in public schools. He denies evolution exists and has fought in the past to deny women rights to their own bodies, as well as trying to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.It s worth noting that gay people used to actually pay a fee for being gay in some cases. One person shared a story of how she and her wife paid an extra $1,820 per year because their marriage was not federally recognized. This was due to her being on her wife s health insurance plan, and the company she worked for had to treat it as additional taxable income due to DOMA, when it was still active. Gay people didn t have a choice to pay this. Bigots always have a choice. They just make the wrong one every single time, and that isn t our fault.Listen to Stayers comments about gay taxation below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/243882433  params= auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true  width= 100%  height= 450  iframe= true  /]Featured image via youtube screen capture",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Carly Fiorina Made A Killing Off Of Those ‘Baby Parts’–Because All Cash Is Sacred (VIDEO),"Carly Fiorina has joined the ranks of the biggest hypocrites of all time. Joining the likes of Josh Duggar, Sarah Palin and Kim Davis, Fiorina has committed the ultimate of egregious errors: She worked for a company that profited from fetal stem cell research.In a scathing report from Al Jazeera America, Fiorina was exposed for collecting some $83000 working for a major pharmaceutical company:Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, a staunch opponent of abortion, made at least $83,000 serving on the board of directors of Merck & Co. at a time when the pharmaceutical company was producing vaccines using fetal stem cell lines derived from aborted fetuses, according to corporate documents reviewed by Al Jazeera America. The program  Inside Story  with Ray Suarez also obtained documents indicating that during Fiorina s tenure on the board, anti-abortion groups had asked Merck to stop producing such vaccines, and that the company had refused.How can someone be so openly  pro-life  and still cash a check earned at least in part by the use of fetal tissue? That s easy: She s a Republican. Republicans live by a different code. All things American should  follow the constitution,  unless it s something they don t like. They cherry-pick parts of the First Amendment to ignore. They ignore the 14th Amendment altogether. They don t recognize the power of the Supreme Court under article 3 section 2 unless you re talking about Hobby Lobby or Citizen s United.Carly Fiorina touts herself as a candidate from  outside of the establishment.  Sure she is. She s a multi-millionaire former CEO who will look directly into the camera and lie to our faces. She destroyed people s lives at Hewlett-Packard and refuses to take responsibility for it. She answers the bulk of questions she s asked with   Hillary Clinton emails.  She s exactly what the GOP loves to see. She fits in rather perfectly with the likes of Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich.Here she is at GOP debate Thursday night talking about just how much she loves those precious little fetuses and doubling down on her lies: Featured image by Gage Skidmore",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fractivists Claim Victory Against This Fracking Danger You’ve Probably Never Heard Of,"The Center for Biological Diversity just announced that they have won a major lawsuit against the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The lawsuit was settled in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The lawsuit will put a moratorium on fracking that is occurring off the coast of California. It may have future importance in determining the fate of off shore fracking in the Gulf Coast. This halt to offshore fracking is a huge victory for California s coastal environment,  said Kristen Monsell, a Center attorney.  Offshore fracking is a dirty and dangerous practice that has absolutely no place in our ocean. The federal government certainly has no right to give the oil industry free rein to frack offshore at will. A lot of attention has been paid to the fracking that is going on in people s backyards. That s under stable. Anyone who has seen the infamous fire faucet from Gasland, or heard about the increased number of earthquakes fracking related activity is causing, should be concerned about their back yard. Be that as it may, there has been a huge boom in offshore fracking that is putting North America s coasts in danger. Until now, America s coast has been a virtual free-for-all for the fracking industry.The fracking industry has permission from the federal government to dump 9 billion gallons of waste water from fracking operations into the ocean. That wastewater comes from their 200 oil platforms that are found off the coast of California. That waste water contains chemicals from the fracking process. Unfortunately, most of the chemicals commonly used in fracking process are considered  trade secrets  making it so that the public is not able to find out what chemicals are being used. Every offshore frack puts coastal communities and marine wildlife at risk from dangerous chemicals or another devastating oil spill,  Monsell said.  Once federal officials take a hard look at the dangers, they ll have to conclude that offshore fracking is far too big of a gamble with our oceans  life-support systems. They ll have to stop authorizing it for good. It might be a bit optimistic to say that settlement will lead to a complete end to federal authorization of offshore fracking. However, the new requirements that the fracking industry will have to go through in order to get authorization are substantial. This is a major paperwrench to the fracking industry, that will in the very least delay new offshore fracking operations.Featured Image Credit: By Ken Lund [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Chicago Cop Executes Mentally Ill Black Teen, Then Sues Family For ‘Emotional Distress’ (VIDEO)","Cops are out of control when it comes to getting away with murdering black people with impunity and without consequence. The case you re about to read about just got much, much worse, though.As we recently reported, Chicago cop Robert Rialmo shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier when the teen called the authorities for help three times, only to be hung up on. Another casualty of the trigger-happy Rialmo was 55-year-old Bettie Jones. As if the murders weren t bad enough, the cops already investigated themselves and cleared themselves of all wrongdoing, as seems to be so typical in these cases. But it gets worse. Much worse.As if this family hasn t been through enough, Rialmo is now suing the LeGrier family for  emotional distress  after he murdered their child.Also, it smacks of a potential cover-up, because Mayor Rahm Emanuel was forced to release text messages relating to the shooting. One string alluded to his probing to see what the media what up to, and what kind of coverage this story was getting. Emanuel s texts say, in part: Media acting breathlessly? You are positive no public negative reaction? Further, the LeGriers  lawyer, Bill Fourtis, has a very good point: Quintonio was shot in the back four times by this deranged cop. This lawsuit comes at an awfully convenient time   just as details that make what happened that night look less than kosher become public, and just as the LeGrier family sues the city of Chicago for the wrongful death of their loved one.This cop needs to be in jail, as does everyone involved what is clearly a cover-up.Watch a news report on this developing story below:Featured image via video screen capture from Latest",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This One GIF Perfectly Sums Up How Much Everyone Hates Ted Cruz (TWEETS),"Normally, it s not very nice to make fun of someone, but if you re someone as innately evil, smarmy, and calculated as Ted Cruz, well, that rule gets thrown out the window. To be blunt, he s not that likeable, and for good reason. He s the guy that wants to end marriage equality, repeal healthcare for millions, interpret the Constitution to his fancy, and make the Middle East  glow in the dark. Since the Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump decided he wouldn t show up to the debate on Thursday night because he was scared of Fox News Megyn Kelly, this left everyone s main focus of attack on the next guy in line   Ted Cruz. The poor Canadian-born senator didn t even seem to see it coming.And to sum up how everyone felt about Ted Cruz, not only at the debate, but pretty much in general, this GIF was born. It shows the senator being completely blown off by everyone, and on live television. No one even wanted to remotely entertain a conversation:The real takeaway from the #GOPDebate? This Ted Cruz snub. pic.twitter.com/WmUALKq4JD  Slate (@Slate) January 29, 2016From a different angle:As always, no one wants to talk to Ted Cruz https://t.co/4PftIi3Tp9 pic.twitter.com/lzaXUpUocp  Gawker (@Gawker) January 29, 2016And then to add insult to injury, Josh Barro chimed in with this:Lol Ted Cruz wandering awkwardly around the stage and no one wants to talk to him, like every party he went to at Princeton.

 ‘Black’ GOP Super PAC Is Secretly All-White,"A group of extremely wealthy white men are pretending to be black in order to help elect right-wing Republicans. The  Black Americans for a Better Future  Super PAC sounds like a political pressure group operated by African-Americans interested in politics, but documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) show that all the money behind the group comes from white men.According to new Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, the only people who donated to BABF last year (or at all   it was created in 2014) were super, super white. In fact, of the $417,250 in donations the super-pac received, $400,000 was from Robert Mercer, the hedge-fund CEO also known as Ted Cruz s sugar daddy.According to the Intercept, BABF exists solely for the benefit of Raynard Jackson, a Republican African-American political consultant based in Washington, D.C.Jackson is reportedly using the money pumped into the PAC in order to host events encouraging blacks to join the Republican Party. They need the help.In 2012, only 6% of black voters supported the Republican Party, while 93% of those voters supported President Obama s re-election campaign. The performance among Latino voters was not inspiring either. Only 27% of those voters backed Romney. And those votes came before many in the party s base had embraced the current party front-runner, Donald Trump. Trump of course has embraced a white nationalist approach to major issues, arguing that Mexicans are  rapists  and that Muslim travel to the United States has to be banned.A Super PAC masquerading as black voices while fueled by white dollars is sure to raise the already elevated suspicions of those who believe the conservative movement is disingenuous when it claims that it is interested in reaching out to minority voters.Instead the ploy gives the appearance of yet again another deceptive conservative enterprise, but with the added indignity of a financial minstrel show.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Leader Admits Benghazi Was Used In Plot To Get Hillary (AUDIO),"Benghazi was just a ploy to hurt Hillary Clinton s shot at the presidency, admits Rep. Darrell Issa. Like other senior Republicans who have also admitted the truth about the right s never-ending Benghazi investigations, Issa opened up and told the truth to a friendly right-wing radio show. You know, people often ask Trey Gowdy and myself, what did our investigations do?  Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) told Boston Herald Radio on Friday morning. Gowdy currently chairs the House Select Committee on Benghazi, while Issa conducted his own investigation in 2012 when he served as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Well what they did is that they opened up an opportunity for the American people to sort of smell what s in the garbage can,  Issa said.  And I think that s the reason that a devout socialist who wants to nationalize almost everything in America is close to and probably will beat Hillary here in New Hampshire. It s not because they like Republicans. It s because they don t trust Hillary. Multiple bipartisan investigations have repeatedly cleared Sec. Clinton and President Obama of malicious wrongdoing in response to the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. Those investigations found that systemic problems in the policies protecting ambassadors and other diplomats on foreign soil led to the tragedy that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and the contractors hired to provide security.That hasn t deterred the right from constantly invoking Benghazi, particularly in relation to Clinton s presidential campaign. Fox News and other conservative media outlets recently expressed the hope that the Michael Bay movie 13 Hours would provoke an outcry against Clinton outside of the circle of the right. Instead, the film has been a box office flop and is one of the worst-performing films ever released by the super-successful director.Just as screaming  Benghazi  failed to derail President Obama s re-election, it does not appear to be a potent force in halting Sec. Clinton s presidential campaign.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bernie Sanders Just Got One Of The Most Important Endorsements Of His Campaign, So Far","Bernie Sanders just picked up one of the most important endorsements of his campaign. No, it isn t a politician, pundit, or, celebrity. It is Eric Garner s eldest daughter, Erica Garner. She, like too many others, is a family member of one of the victims of police brutality, and the racism that drives it. Her father s death helped catalyze the Black Lives Matter movement. Erica Garner has since worked as an activist. She is the founder of the Garner Way Foundation.Garner s endorsement comes in the form of a powerful essay, published in the Washington Post. In the endorsement, she writes about her disillusionment with a system that has for so long been able to pretend that the life of her father, her own, and all people of color s lives have mattered.She writes that: If our lives really mattered, we d have equal access to decent jobs, good schools and affordable housing. If our lives mattered in this country, we d have equal access to clean air, clean water and real investment in black neighborhoods. If black lives mattered in America, those who routinely brutalize us wouldn t be the ones paid, with our tax dollars, to keep us safe.I trusted establishment Democrats who claimed to represent me, only to later watch them ignore and explain away the injustice of my father s death. I trusted the system; then I watched as politicians on both sides of the aisle   from Chicago s Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel to Michigan s Republican Gov. Rick Snyder   disregard the will of the people they were elected to represent and abdicate their responsibility to protect them. I ve watched as our system criminalizes blackness while allowing Wall Street to bilk the American people with impunity. Sanders has met with quit a few family members of family members of high-profile victims of anti-black state violence. After taking a tour of the neighborhood Freddie Gray lived in, Sanders was disturbed, if unsurprised, by the deplorable economic conditions that people survive in. Anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think you are in a wealthy nation. You would think you are in a third world country,  Sanders said after the tour.Then of course, there is the chance meeting with the mother and sister of Sandra Bland that occurred, and was not initially reported to the media, where Sanders promised to keep saying Bland s name. Sanders was the only candidate to say her name during the first Democratic debate. The lawyer for Walter Scott s family publicly endorsed Sanders.In her endorsement, Garner lays out who she think s will be the best candidate to serve black people, by saying: Who will address the criminalization of our people? Who understands that we re experiencing an economic crisis made worse by structural barriers to jobs and education? Who will bring us closer to real safety, freedom and power? Who has clearly shown us where they stand?The answer is someone who started this work well before campaign season, who understands our deaths as tragedies   not political talking points   and someone who will speak out against the wars being waged against our communities. Not someone who only pays attention to our concerns when it s time to collect our votes. Not someone who gives us bread crumbs and expects us to be full.Black Americans   all Americans   need a leader with a record that speaks for itself. And to me, it s clear. Of all the presidential candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders is our strongest ally. Earlier in January, Eric Garner s mother, Gwen Carr, endorsed Hillary Clinton. Her endorsement was put our in the form of a press release by the Clinton campaign. In the press release, Carr writes: Hillary seems to be the only candidate right now who s talking about how we can be strategic in trying to solve this problem. That s why I m endorsing her for president. In contrast, Garner sees Sanders as similar to President Obama. She writes that President Obama was decried as being too extreme and too inexperienced. I remember another candidate who dared me to believe in hope and change. His opponents said he wasn t ready for leadership. They said he couldn t win. He said, Yes, we can.  And we did. I still believe we can. That s why I endorse Bernie Sanders for president. There has been a stark generational divide between Clinton and Sanders supporters, this divide between two different members of the Garner family fits that pattern and shouldn t shock anyone. Both candidates have had some trouble when it comes to racial justice issues. Sanders has had trouble recognizing the non-economic ways that violence is inflicted on people of color. Clinton, (somewhat unfairly) has had to distance herself between the policies that her husband, former president Bill Clinton, ushered in in the 1990 s. Those policies led to the dismantlement of welfare as it was known, and in some ways helped create our current era of mass incarceration. Both candidates have  put out criminal justice reform packages. Here is Clinton s and here is Sanders .For some, the idea that anyone who works within the current political system will truly be an ally for people of color may be seen as wishful thinking. The politics of any movement that built on a collection of diasporic communities can be hard to nail down. Black Lives Matter is no different. But one thing is for sure, for many the  black vote  is no longer a guarantee for the Democratic Party.  That isn t to say that people of color are jumping ship to vote for Republicans. However, with snake people, especially those in more radical activist communities, you have to earn people s votes, and support.  Garner feels that Sanders has earned the title of being people of color s  strongest ally.  That status has a lot to do with Sanders  reaction to criticism of his racial justice package.Whether that proves to be true or not, only time will tell. Regardless of who is the eventual nominee, the public must continue to work towards pushing candidates to do more than pay lip service to traditionally marginalized communities. Change does not always come easy, but it does come when people remain persistent that their communities matter.

 Proof Ted Cruz Only Wants The Already Healthy And Wealthy To Have Healthcare (VIDEO),"It has been the life s work of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He s obsessed, really. And it really seems to stem from not wanting President Obama to get credit for being the president that completely overhauled the healthcare system. Proof of this is in his response to any question regarding what he would do instead. He wants to repeal it   to make it his own.However, when Cruz was asked directly about his plan for healthcare during the most recent GOP debate, he answered, or rather didn t answer, the moderator s question.Fox News  Bret Baier asked Cruz: Today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it. So the question, Sen. Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will: Will you be fine if millions of those people don t have health insurance, and what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured? And here s Cruz s non-answer, completely dodging the question: If I am elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need health care reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting between us and our doctors. Three specific reforms that reflect those principles: Number 1, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That ll create a true 50-state national marketplace while will drive down the cost of low-cost catastropic health insurance. Number 2, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine health care needs. And Number 3, we should work to delink health insurance from employment, so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you, and it is personal, portable, and affordable, and I tell you, Bret I think that s a much more attractive vision for health care than the Washington-driven, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions to hurt. To summarize: Cruz wants to make it so healthcare is only available on the free market, and with regard to what his plan for those who become uninsured due to the repeal of Obamacare, well, he doesn t have one.One of the key components to the Affordable Healthcare Act is making sure insurance companies can no longer deny coverage based upon preexisting conditions. If the law is repealed, healthcare companies will be able to go back to these harmful practices and leave control of coverage back in the hands of for-profit care. Thus, in the hands of those who see it in their best interest to deny care to those they may deem too expensive to cover, because it would harm profits. Cruz seems to be in favor of this happening, since he didn t even touch upon it in his response.In addition, Cruz wants to make it so those who are covered by their employers are no longer covered, and would have to completely pay out-of-pocket for care. This makes it remarkably hard for those in low wage earning positions to even remotely dream of having care. The only people Cruz s plan helps are the wealthy and business owners who will no longer be required to offer coverage to their employees. His plan is in no way whatsoever beneficial to the average American. However, he words it in such a smarmy, salesman-type way that the average American won t pick up on the scam.Cruz wants the government completely out of healthcare which sounds great on paper if you only think of things in black and white. However, the reality of the situation is millions of people rely on the government subsidies granted in the Affordable Care Act, millions also rely upon Medicaid, and even more rely upon the fact that Obamacare makes it so insurance companies can t deny a person based upon a preexisiting condition.Don t fall for the evils of Cruz in his effort to bring America back to an era of people dying because they can t afford coverage, which is exactly what he is proposing.

 Video Of Man Casually Doing Interview After Just Being Shot Goes Viral (VIDEO),"A Quincy, Il, man was shot in the hourly hours of Thursday morning and then right after, did an interview while smoking a cigarette, in what appears to be one of the most interesting interviews of the year.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_wMhAFL188]The Quincy man, Devon, was  in the room, kicking like I usually do, drinking,  when someone fired bullets through his apartment, striking him in the chest.Despite the danger, Devon said that he  wasn t trippin, it was a petty wound and sh*t.  The first thing he thought about wasn t his wound though. His main concern was to get his son out of the way. Luckily, his son wasn t hurt.During the interview, Devon lifted his shirt to show his bandages from the wound, casually shrugging off the event, saying some people  probably want [him] dead  and are  on some other stuff. One can t help but notice how unaffected, calm, and desensitized Devon seems to be, at least while conducting the interview. Even the journalist, Reyna Harvey, who was interviewing him is calm, which lead Chad Douglas a broadcaster at the studio to lament that the entire event was  incredible. While the event is indeed incredible, there seems to be something quite eerie about the desensitization of all involved in this almost tragic event. Let s hope that Devon makes a full recovery from his wounds.Feature Image Via YouTube Screenshot",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oklahoma GOP Bill Would Ban Suicidal LGBT Teens From Seeking Help From Pro-Gay Therapists,"If Oklahoma Republicans have their way, the suicide rate among LGBT teens will skyrocket.LGBT teens are, by far, the most vulnerable group within the LGBT community because they are not considered adults yet and therefore are subject to the will of their parents, teachers, and school administrators. Many teens are scared to reveal their sexuality out of fear that they will be ostracized and discriminated against.And that appears to be exactly what Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kerns wants since she has introduced several anti-gay bills this year as part of her ongoing hate crusade against gay people.The most egregious bill of the three is HB 3044, which forbids school officials from referring gay students in crisis to councilors or therapists who would actually treat them like human beings.According to Slate,The bill states that no public school  counselor, therapist, social worker, administrator, teacher or other individual  can  refer a student under the age of eighteen  to any  individual, organization or entity  if the referral  pertain[s] to human sexuality.  In fact, public school counselors can t even  provide the contact information, business card, brochure or other informational materials  of a gay-friendly organization to students.The only way students would get to see gay friendly therapists is if they notify their parents, which would out them as being gay, thus making the situation worse and opening themselves up to further ridicule and bullying that could push them over the edge.But that s not the only bill Kerns is pushing to persecute gay people.HB 1598 would protect ex-gay conversion therapy, even though the American Psychiatric Association opposes it. And this bill works perfectly with HB 3044 because it would funnel gay teens to anti-gay therapists who would likely pressure their patients to enter such a program.And then there is SB 733, which would ban anyone with HIV or other  communicable or infectious diseases  from getting married.These bills are specifically designed to discriminate against gay people. And the laws are particularly cruel toward gay teens who need understanding and caring professionals to talk to instead of hateful people who will only make things worse. It s like Republicans are literally trying to make sure these kids commit suicide and that should make every parent sick despite how you might feel about homosexuality.Featured Image: Children s Advocate",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Holds Children At Gunpoint, Lectures Them About Crime","On Wednesday, three young Washington teens received a terrifying  lesson  from one of the people the NRA says will save us from any and all danger. Kitsap Sheriff s deputies are investigating an incident in which a man held three 13-year-olds at gunpoint while he lectured them about crime in the area.The teens, who were playing an innocent game of basketball in a community court, say the man approached them. According to the kids, he had been dropped off by another man in a silver pickup truck with orange cab lights. He shined a flashlight at the children then pointed a semi-automatic pistol and told them he was not  playing around,  ordering them face-down on the ground.The Kitsap Sun reports that the man, who is described as a caucasian in his 60s or 70s with white hair, interrogated them about what they were doing, and informed the frightened teens that there had been a rash of car thefts and vandalism in the area. He told the kids he had been asked to  investigate  by a neighbor.After the interrogation, the pickup truck returned and another white man got, heavyset with grayish hair, got out and shook the kids  hands, patting one on the back. The gun-toting gentleman got in the truck and they drove off. Police are still investigating the incident.Unfortunately, this is where we are at in America. Two men, empowered by the NRA and Republicans  rhetoric that places them as judge, jury, and executioner, conducted their own firearm-assisted  interrogation  against three children who had done nothing worse than playing basketball in the evening.

 Carson Campaign Demands Gay Soldiers Go Back In The Closet Lest They Get Too ‘Militant’ About It,"Ben Carson is having a really bad week. He s had a lot of bad weeks recently, but this one is particularly bad.The last Republican debate was considered Carson s do or die moment and he died  unambiguously  while we all watched. The once rising star of the 2016 election went out, not with a bang, but with a characteristic whisper. A soft, monotone word salad. His trademark. By the end of the night, Carson was misquoting the preamble to the Constitution and perhaps slowly realizing that this would be the last time many people would ever remember he ever had run for president at all.The very next day, while Carson slept off his post-relevancy hangover and waited to come in 6th in Iowa, his campaign chairman Robert Dees was talking to reporters. Normally this would be a good thing, but Dees happens to be a raging homophobe and the questions happened to be about gay soldiers.Speaking with radio host Alan Colmes, Dees was insistent that gay people cannot be allowed to be open about their sexual orientation or risk destroying the entire military. Well the ultimate test for military effectiveness is readiness, it s cohesion, and anything that detracts from that is important. Dr. Carson often says it s important for people to have rights in accordance with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the U.S. Constitution, but no particular group ought to have extra rights. Why would the right to be yourself be considered an  extra  right? Dees explains: Where the extra rights come in is when the gays in the military become somewhat militaristic to the detriment of unit cohesion,  he said.Dees added that a question to be considered in determining policy toward gay people in the military was,  whether they, in the military, flaunt it and disrupt cohesion. Heaven forbid soldiers become too militaristic in the military. However, Dees was not talking about fighting. He was worried that gay people would use their secret weapon:  Flaunting  their gayness.What makes Dees  statements so cringeworthy is that he isn t just an idiot, he s an idiot who used to be a general in the military. As such, he might have bothered to read up on the military s own research into how gay people effect a unit s cohesion. All the way back in 2010, the Pentagon was telling the president and the nation that repealing  don t ask, don t tell  and letting gay people serve openly did nothing but bring the military in line with where the country already was. The general lesson we take from   transformational experiences in history is that in matters of personnel change within the military, predictions and surveys tend to overestimate negative consequences, and underestimate the U.S. military s ability to adapt and incorporate within it ranks the diversity that is reflective of American society at large,  the report concluded.Going further:This report confirms that  by every measure   from unit cohesion to recruitment and retention to family readiness   we can transition to a new policy in a responsible manner that ensures our military strength and national security,  Obama said in a written statement.Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen were also strongly in favor of dropping the ludicrous DADT policy. Since its dissolution, the military hasn t crumbled. Nobody is  flaunting  anything. The military continues to be one of the strongest and best trained fighting forces in the world.Dees is certainly living in a fantasy world, but it s hard to expect much who decided to ride Ben Carson s coat tails all the way to a massive loss in the very first primary and an inevitable campaign suspension. Carson s track record on talking about gay Americans isn t much better. During his brief moment in the national spotlight, he once floated the idea that prison rape turns people gay.Much of Carson s campaign has been predicated on the idea that he is above the fray. He s consistently pleaded with his fellow candidates and the nation more generally to stop the mudslinging. It s an admirable goal   which happens to be total malarkey. Carson has never had a problem with going after  liberals ,  gay people ,  Muslims , or any other group he feels doesn t align with his worldview. Gay people can t serve in the military. Muslims can t be president. Liberals can t well  do anything.In the end, the only group of people who seem safe in Carson s America are conservative Christians like himself. How brave.Feature image via Fox News screengrab",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Boycott Of Israel Just Got A Major Helping Hand – From President Obama,"President Obama made a change in policy this week that has added weight to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement against Israel.Moving forward, goods produced in the Occupied West Bank and sent for sale in the U.S can no longer be marked  Made in Israel . They must state their place of origin as the  West Bank . This will mean that, for the first time, Americans will be able to boycott Israeli goods produced in the West Bank. This option was not possible before the change, as consumers would have no idea whether the product was made in Tel Aviv or Ramallah. The clarification makes actions against Israeli companies that are occupying the West Bank much easier to target.The law itself has existed since the Clinton administration, but is rarely, if ever, enforced. As Forward notes:According to an April 1995 U.S. Customs and Border Protection notification, products made in the West Bank or Gaza  shall be marked as  West Bank,   Gaza,  or  Gaza Strip  and shall not contain the words  Israel,   Made in Israel,   Occupied Territories-Israel  or words of similar meaning.  Moreover, it states,  Failure to mark an article in accordance with the requirements shall result in the levy of a duty of 10 percent  of the product s value.However, the Obama administration has issued a memo stating that from now on, this rule is not optional for Israel. Now it s mandatory.Why the change? Obama has been notably opposed to the boycott movement since its inception.One contributing factor may be that US-Israel bonds are at their weakest after a number of mendacious moves by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu.First, Netanyahu had Israeli security services spy on private nuclear deal talks between the US and Iran, and sold the secrets to Republican lawmakers in Washington.Then, Netanyahu worked out a deal to deliver a speech in the U.S congress, just two weeks before the Israeli elections, in which he railed against Obama s deal with Iran. A foreign leader, undermining the foreign policy of America s president, from the floor of its own Congress, was unprecedented.Aside from these huge spats, the Israeli leadership have thwarted all attempts at bringing a just and peaceful solution to the Occupation of Palestine. Most notably, ordering the expansion of the illegal settlement program on the very days the John Kerry and Joe Biden flew in for peace talks. This total intransigence has meant that the situation for Palestinians is now markedly worse than at any time in the history of the conflict.The West Bank has been broken up into a series of open-air prisons, around which Israel has built its giant Apartheid Wall. The wall is higher and longer than the Berlin wall, and cuts across the West Bank, shutting off city, town and village from one another. The wall is controlled by Israel, meaning Palestinians are imprisoned in their own towns. Unable to travel to work, or see friends or family members cut off by the wall.Meanwhile Gaza on the west coast is penned in by a wall of its own, again controlled by Israel. In the last decade, Israel has launched no fewer than five large-scale military offensives against those living in Gaza. The Summer of 2014 saw Israel launch a 51-day air, ground and sea assault on the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces killed 2,104 Palestinians, of whom 1,462 have been identified as civilians, including 495 children. They destroyed the homes of more than 108,000 people and over 10,000 people (a third of them children) were left with life-altering injuries. I was reporting on the ground from Gaza during this period and what I saw amounted to nothing short of a massacre.If the world community is uncomfortable with Palestinians using the rudimentary armed response to these aggressions with which they are equipped   home-made rockets, or suicide attacks   then it is imperative that they support non-violent resistance such as the Palestinian-led, global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS Movement).The BDS Movement seeks to put economic and diplomatic pressure on Israel s apartheid state in a similar way to that applied against South Africa s apartheid state in the 1980s   only with aims to be more systematic and specific than its predecessor. It is starting to have a tangible impact that is being felt within Israel.In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared war against the BDS Movement. Last year, Strategic Affairs and Information Minister Gilad Erdan s office was given the task of fighting BDS, and awarded 10 additional ministers and an NIS100 million ($26.4m) budget increase to fulfil its mission. The propaganda efforts seem focused on branding all external BDS Movement support as  anti-Semitic, while deeming internal critics as  the enemy within. Israel s greatest threat is not the BDS movement, Obama or the Palestinians. The greatest threat to Israel is Zionism, and the rising fascism promoted by this ideology; an ideology which says Jewish people alone have the right to live in freedom, peace and dignity in a land which has been a melting pot of several religions and ethnicities for thousands of years.In order to preserve itself as a Jewish state, Israel must import Jews and exile non-Jews   and such conditions make democracy impossible. This is what anti-Zionist Israelis know in their hearts, and why they support the Palestinian-led BDS Movement despite such opposition at home   because they re consciences will not permit them to do otherwise.Featured Image via Flickr/INCOG",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Spokeswoman: I Called Obama ‘Head Negro’ Because Liberals Made Me Mad (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s ridiculous stunt on Thursday has garnered him quite a bit of attention   positive from the Stupid Part of America, and negative from everyone who is able to figure out how to operate a spoon without adult guidance. In an effort to hide the fact that he is scared of Fox News  Megyn Kelly, Trump pretended to care about our nation s soldiers for an evening with a  fundraiser  campaign event he scheduled in opposition to the debate he elected to skip.Of course, veterans  groups practically climbed all over each other to inform The Donald that the money would not be accepted, and donations were made to his Foundation rather than actual veterans. This is a problem, of course, because barely 1 percent of his Foundation s donations are given to Vets. On Friday, CNN s Jim Sciutto confronted Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson about the donations   specifically, which Veterans  groups would be receiving the millions of dollars in donations Trump had gathered for the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The money is going to a Trump organization now. Name one veterans organization that has agreed to accept that money,  Sciutto said. Pierson explained that the money would be  spread across the country  to Veterans  groups, aside from those who refuse to accept it. However, Sciutto didn t let her slide with that answer, asking her to name a single organization that has agreed to accept the money. I m sorry, I can t hear you,  Pierson s replied as the gerbils that perform her basic brain functions struggled to spin the wheel fast enough to enable the bullshit circuits in her head to connect. Pierson said there might be a list on Trump s website, but no such list exists. There is simply a donation form.Realizing that he was not going to get a straight answer, Sciutto moved on to another issue: Pierson s downright insane Twitter account. Pierson has previously complained that there are not enough  pure breeds  left in politics as she took a stab at Obama, who she calls the  head Negro in charge  and a  Jihadi    remarks that many have found questionable at best. Pierson, of course, took the tried-and-true conservative path of blaming liberals: So of course you could pull any of those tweets out of one of those heated discussions because a lot of times it s in the sphere of fighting off other liberal activists. I got to tell you. It s interesting that this has made some sort of news cycle when we have all of the things that are happening in the world, including a presidential race, to go back 36,000 tweets, pull them out of context of the discussion and try to make that a news story. That s right, she got angry with liberals so she called the President a half-breed, a  Negro,  and other awful things.Unfortunately, this behavior is typical of conservatives, who feel that anger is justification to spew slurs and hatred.Watch Pierson s flimsy excuses below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Hits Back At The Media In The Most Brilliant Way,"On Wednesday, The Washington Post published a harsh editorial that ripped Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for his progressive politics.The article, entitled  Bernie Sanders  Fiction-filled Campaign, said that the Vermont senator was guilty of making  fantastical claims  and peddling  his own brand of fiction to a slice of the country that eagerly wants to buy it, insulting the millions of Americans that support the anti-establishment candidate. The vicious piece ends with,  It merely proves that many progressives like being told everything they want to hear. The piece predictably gathered tons of support and backlash alike. Alternet even noted that the Post was probably somewhat biased against Sanders because its owner, Jeff Bezos, is an arch-libertarian worth $53.2 billion and has a whole host of investments in private health care. But regardless of others  defense of Sanders, the Vermont senator himself had the most brutal message of all. On Thursday morning at a Bloomberg Politics event, Sanders was asked about the piece and he didn t hold back. He absolutely ripped the Post s Editorial Board: That s not a new argument. We ve been hearing that months and months, and that s in a sense what this campaign is about. People are telling us, whether it s the Washington Post editorial board or anybody else, our ideas are too ambitious   can t happen. Too bold   really? Well, here s something which is really bold. In the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and working families of this country. The middle class has become poorer and trillions of dollars have been transferred to the top one-tenth of 1 percent Where was The Washington Post to express concern that the middle class was shrinking? Where was The Washington Post talking about this radical transformation of America? And he was just getting started. When the discussion went to foreign policy, Sanders took another opportunity to slam the media source. Sanders unloaded on the Post s previous record with the Iraq War, which had already received tons of criticism. Sanders quipped, Check out where all the geniuses on the editorial page were with regard to the invasion of Iraq. In 2014, it was discovered that the media source had published more than 140 stories aggressively promoting to war months before the invasion. That was a powerful comment from Sanders, as he had nearly stood alone in Congress when he voted against the Iraq War.Featured image is a screenshot via Comedy Central",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Without Trump, Ted Cruz Gets Dumped On During GOP Debate And Fails To Impress Iowans","Ted Cruz probably wishes Donald Trump had attended the debate last night.Because without Trump, all of the focus on Thursday night turned to Ted Cruz, who is in second place behind the billionaire real estate mogul.As seven Republicans took the stage for the official debate in Iowa last night, Trump held his own competing event. One would think that would especially benefit Ted Cruz, but he failed to deliver and the Des Moines Register declared that he had a  rough night. In other words, without Trump, Cruz took over the spotlight and everyone was able to witness him fall on his face as the other candidates and the moderators turned their attention on him because The Donald was not there to be a distraction. If that is what Trump planned for all along, his strategy to skip the debate was a masterstroke.Ted Cruz ended up being plastered on the front page of the Register on Friday morning with a headline that will be hard to swallow for the Cruz campaign, but the main story didn t go any better for the Texas Senator either. Without the dominant national front-runner in the room, the target was the candidate who inherited center stage for the night: Ted Cruz,  the front page read.  But the Texas U.S. senator largely forfeited this golden opportunity. Indeed, even Iowa Republican activists believe Cruz was the loser in this debate. Candidates and voters are not putting up with him tonight,  said Emily Grimm, a 22-year-old Republican activist from Des Moines.  I don t think there was a clear winner at this debate. But I think the clear loser was Cruz. Cruz always knows how to use standard Republican sound bites to garner applause. The moment he senses that he might be losing the crowd with policy, he just throws in a few grand words to gain applause,  said Grimm, a fiscal conservative who worked for Mark Jacobs  2014 U.S. Senate campaign.At one point in the debate, Cruz channeled Trump by complaining about the moderators like a toddler and threatened to leave the stage. If you guys ask one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage,  Cruz said.And that didn t go over very well at all.University of Iowa political science professor Tim Hagle said the attack  fell really flat. He seemed plastic and insincere,  said another Iowa Republican, according to Politico. His entanglement with the moderators was one of the worst moments for a candidate in any of the debates,  a New Hampshire Republican told Politico.And yet another Iowa Republican explained why Trump made a good move by sitting out while Cruz got hammered. Trump got exactly what he wanted. Nobody lays a glove on him, while the rest of the field beat each other up. Better yet, Trump got both former caucus winners to attend his event, and his main competitor, Ted Cruz, might have had his worst debate performance of the campaign. Ted Cruz clearly has his presidential aspirations tied to Iowa. Should he lose, he would be faced with overcoming Trump s 19-point lead in New Hampshire and his 16-point lead in South Carolina.Make no mistake, losing the last debate before Iowa votes is a disaster for Cruz and as previously stated, he probably wishes Trump had been present at the debate. Because if he had been, Cruz would not be the butt of embarrassing headlines today.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH Stephen Colbert Moderate A Hilarious Trump Vs. Trump Debate,"Stephen Colbert had his own solution to Trump skipping the debate on Thursday: Since  25 million  viewers were denied the opportunity to see Trump debate, Colbert decided to moderate his own hilarious debate where Trump debates Trump and where Colbert would would pick up those 25 million viewers for his own ratings.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpKiP_gmDS8]The Late Show host said that the GOP front-runner was  the star of this year s top reality show,  and renamed it  celebrity the president,  so it was only fitting that he have his chance to shine on the stage.Colbert used footage of  two Trumps  being asked the same question, but with contradictory responses on different occasions. For example, on Jan. 17, Trump had said that  no one likes  Ted Cruz  once they get to know him,  yet on  Dec. 11, Trump said that he liked the Texas senator  a lot. Trump had also said as recently as this month that he loved the people of Iowa but during a speech in November, he wondered  how stupid are the people of Iowa? In July, Trump said that Hillary Clinton was the   worst Secretary of State in the history of the United States.  However,  in March 2012, he said Hillary was a  terrific woman,  saying,  I think she does a good job and I like her. And of course, there was Megyn Kelly. This week, Trump said he had  zero respect  for Kelly, adding that she s  highly overrated  and doesn t do a good job. However, a previous clip shows that in 2011 Trump told Kelly during an interview that she has  done a great job, by the way, and I mean it,  he said, with a creepy smile.In his segment, Colbert is able to show the contradictions and hypocrisy that Trump exemplifies in a way that is hilarious but shocking in terms of how Trump, despite being Trump, continues to lead in the polls.Featured image via YouTube screenshot.",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The Brits Have Dubbed A Donald Trump Speech With A Cockney Accent, And It’s Brilliant (VIDEO)","British comic Peter Serafinowicz has made everybody s day by dubbing over one of Donald Trump s hate-filled speeches with a cockney accent   and it s brilliant.Serafinowicz, originally from Liverpool in England (home of The Beatles), is well known for serving up impressions of Al Pacino and other big name celebrities. But now he has set himself the challenge of punking Donald Trump.It began a short while ago, with the comic dubbing an interview Trump gave to Fox News with an aristocratic English accent, in a video he called  Sophisticated Trump.  But now it was time for the sequel, So on Friday morning, Serafinowicz tweeted the new video to his 750,000 Twitter followers, saying: I gave Donald Trump a cockney tough guy accent. I gave Donald Trump a cockney tough guy accent. Blimey    e loves  ittin that  illary! (all words verbatim) https://t.co/EBVGrWM0n7  Peter Serafinowicz (@serafinowicz) January 29, 2016Here are the results: In  Donald Thump,  Trump is given the voice of an East End gangster that wouldn t look out of place in a Guy Ritchie movie.It s fair to say that Britain hates Donald Trump almost as much as liberal America. But you ve not been punched until you ve been punked Brit-style.Even members of the UK parliament laid into Trump with typical British humor during a recent debate about banning the trust fund tycoon from entering Britain, under rules designed to prevent hate-speech.As Addicting Info reported at the time:The 3-hour debate was done more out of respect for the process of public petitions, and due to the huge number of signatures, rather than because they were legitimately serious about banning him. However, it did give Parliament time with which to vent their frustrations and engage in some brilliant Trump bashing, which is something we can all thoroughly appreciate.Using quintessential British putdowns such as  pillock ,  buffoon, and  wazzock , lawmakers from all sides of the political spectrum of our closest ally destroyed Donald Trump.It looks like it s not only American liberals that want Trump out of the Presidential race. Our allies around the world are holding their collective breath in hope too.Featured Image via Flickr/Flickr",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Reason This Republican Thinks His Opponent Is Unqualified Is The Most Disgusting Thing You’ll Hear Today,"Ohio State Senate Majority Leader Tom Patton is a term-limited Senator who has decided to run for the State House of Representatives to keep his political career alive. His opponent is a young woman named Jennifer Herold, who is the mother of 2 toddlers. Patton, proving that he has more than enough misogyny to be a card-carrying member of the Republican party, has decided Herold is unqualified to run against him.You see, Jennifer Herold isn t a 62-year-old man like Patton is. As a woman under 30 with two children, she has no business in politics. Patton said in a radio interview recently: The gal that s running against me is a 30-year-old, you know, mom, mother of two infants. And I don t know if anybody explained to her we ve got to spend three nights a week in Columbus. So, how does that work out for you? I waited until I was 48 and my kids were raised and at least adults before we took the opportunity to try. Well then. There are so many things wrong with that statement it s hard to choose where to begin. First, don t call her  gal.  It s insulting and cheapens your attack even more, if that s possible. Newt, Columbus isn t all that far; Mrs. Herold could easily make the commute if she wanted to. It s difficult to imagine a fragile little  gal  having the ability to oh, say drive a car, we know. Last, have you considered, Senator, that she may have a husband at home who doesn t believe it s the woman s job to take care of the kids 24/7?How old you are and your warped sense of how a modern family works is irrelevant, you insufferable douchebag.It gets worse. While talking polling numbers, Patton said: I want to tell her,  Hey Sweetie, I just got 27 percent of the pie in just my district, which is nine times what should have been done. Seriously?  Hey, Sweetie?  What is unfortunate is that his message will resonate with the sexists who populate his party. They don t like people who don t have penises representing them, because what could a woman possibly know about anything other than child-rearing and pleasing her husband? Patton is the perfect poster boy for the GOP.Herold responded with pure class and dignity in a statement: We realize the sacrifice that is involved in holding such a position. However, Tom Patton has crossed a line by trying to turn the fact that I am a mother of two children into a negative campaign issue. It s insulting for my opponent to suggest that motherhood is a liability. In fact, my experience as a mom is perhaps my greatest strength. Tom, only one man in my life is allowed to call me  sweetie.  From now on, I respectfully ask you to refer to me as Jen, Jennifer, Ms. Herold, or your opponent. Well said, Ms. Herold. Patton has since apologized, calling his words  poorly chosen.  What he doesn t seem to understand is that it isn t the words he chose that are disturbing, it s the way he thinks. It s the sexism and utter disrespect for Herold as a woman and a human being that make him so despicable.Too little too late, Senator. Hopefully you get your ass handed to you so you ll have no choice but to stumble off into the sunset and obscurity.

 Karma’s A B*tch: Judge Orders Anti-Gay Preacher’s Church Up For Public Auction Due To Unpaid Debts,"Pastor James David Manning is one of the most vocally homophobic preachers in America. He is the leader of Atlah Worldwide Church, and has made such disgusting public statements as  Jesus would stone homos,  and tried to accuse gay people of spreading Ebola through Starbucks coffee. Well, Pastor Manning is finally getting his comeuppance, because a judge has ordered that his hateful church be put up for public auction.The reason for the order is that Manning has not been paying his church s bill. DNA Info reports that Manning has nine tax liens against the church s property. The debts include, but are not limited to:Manning, however, is as delusional as ever, and insists that he didn t know about the auctioning of his church until last week. This seems to be a flat-out lie, though, as his lawyers responded to the case as early as October 2009, which is a month after the case was opened. Manning also plans to go against the auction order, which was filed by Judge Joan Kenny on December 17, 2015. Manning says of the auctioning of his church: I assure you, it s about a water bill and a tax that can t be levied against this church. I think it s a land grab quite frankly. Though the church is, like all others, tax exempt, Manning seems to be unable to comprehend that being a tax exempt religious institution does not mean that he does not have to pay his bills. To that end, whatever appeals he might make to stop the auction will likely prove fruitless. The auction will be held on February 24.This is all to the good, as the community can now be effectively free of Manning and his followers  constant and unending stream of homophobic hate speech. Harlem will definitely be a better place.Featured image via screen capture from the Manning Report on YouTube",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Voodoo Doughnut’s One-Of-A-Kind Dessert Is The PERFECT Mockery Of Ammon Bundy (IMAGE),"Voodoo Doughnut is a very unique dessert shop in Portland, Oregon. They have many one-of-a-kind desserts, in very creative designs. However, according to the one of shop s proprietors, Kenneth  Cat Daddy  Pogson, they usually stop short of engaging in political discourse via their dessert creations. But Pogson said they just couldn t resist when it came to the ridiculousness that was the Oregon militants engaged in a standoff with the authorities at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon.To that end, once the standoff was over and the group s leader, Ammon Bundy, was in custody, Pogson made his thoughts known in the way he usually does: with a unique doughnut depicting Ammon Bundy in a jail cell.via The Oregonian TwitterPogson revealed to The Oregonian his reasons for breaking his own rules regarding politics, saying: but this whole thing seemed like such a big deal   with them taking public property, armed to the teeth, making a stand that they thought everyone would join. It was a debacle that was on everyone s mind, left or right.  Once he heard Bundy had been arrested, he told his donut artist:  I want a face behind bars and the words  Welcome to Portland.' Welcome to Portland indeed. We re sure Ammon Bundy won t be getting any of Pogson s delicious doughnuts where he s going.Pogson also said that he wanted to make it clear that he was not mocking LaVoy Finicum, the vocal occupier at the refuge who perished in a shootout with police. Pogson said of Finicum: The death was senseless. I didn t want it to come off like I was ridiculing [Finicum]. He died for what he believed in. I don t believe in it. But I wanted to send this message. [Bundy] is no longer among his people. Now he s on the left coast. Likely, that s where Bundy will stay, as he should. Enjoy your time in prison, Mr. Bundy. The rest of Oregon will go on with their lives, and thanks to you, have a new doughnut to enjoy.Featured image via  voodoodoughnut. com",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Susan Sarandon Brutally Slams Trump: He’s Like ‘Your Drunk Uncle At A Wedding’ (VIDEO),"Award-winning actress and political activist Susan Sarandon has been busy speaking praises for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. After expressing her support for the Vermont senator at an Iowa campaign rally, Sarandon sat down with online network The Young Turks and told them what really frightened her about this election: Republican front runner Donald Trump.Noting that Trump has made the Republican party look like an absolute circus, Sarandon said she believed that there were some  sane Republicans  that would never even dream of nominating Trump, who is pretty much  like a figure from a Kurt Vonnegut novel. I cannot believe for a second that America would actually make Donald Trump the president. Republicans are not all bad, they re not all crazy, they re not all greedy. I think there s some very sane Republicans and they must be so embarrassed by what s going on right now. However, she is terrified of the amount of support the GOP candidate has gotten, and thinks he could be incredibly dangerous for America s future. She said: He reminds me of, like, your drunk uncle at a wedding who gets up and starts talking and just loves the crowd and just goes on and on and on and says whatever he can to get a reaction. The Oscar winner revealed that what really bothered her the most about Trump s rhetoric   the way he views minorities. She explained: What concerns me is that he has made hatred and racism normal   he s normalized it. He s taking this, you know, [THE]undercurrent of discontent that s looking to blame somebody and he s legitimized those feelings and that, I think, is a very dangerous thing. You can watch Sarandon s entire takedown of the racist front runner below:Sarandon has weighed in on Trump before, stating that she thought he appealed to Americans who were  really starved for something authentic  despite the fact that  he has no idea specifically what he s talking about.  She also said, I think it s great that the Republicans have to figure out how to deal with him, it s interesting. Meanwhile, Sarandon is trying to focus on supporting Sanders. She explained: For me, gender is not what s important. Issues are what s important. I want a candidate who has the courage to stand and do the right thing when it is not popular.

 This GOP Debate Answer Exposes How Much The Right Hates Women (VIDEO),"A strange answer offered by Governor Chris Christie during the Republican presidential debate showed how deeply hostile the conservative base is towards women.Asked to name  one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all  in order to cut spending so that the budget can be balanced, Christie made a strange reach and called for cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood.Christie was then pressed on whether he d cut  anything bigger than that,  since Planned Parenthood receives just $528 million annually; a miniscule sum compared with the kind of cuts needed to balance the budget. When you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can t think of anything bigger than that,  he said in response.The current budget deficit is a projected $474 billion. The funding for Planned Parenthood accounts for 0.11% of the deficit and an even smaller 0.01% of the $3.9 trillion budget for the country. Considering the women the organization helps, and their families, Christie should be praising the value taxpayers get for their spending on the organization.His follow-up response, designed to elicit sympathy from conservative  Christian  voters in Iowa, is even more ridiculous when you realize that Planned Parenthood is banned from spending any of its federal money on abortion services in the first place.Thanks to rules put in place by the right and kept there by Democrats, none of the abortion services can be funded with federal money, and Christie definitely knows this, he was just too busy pandering.But the answer and the positive reaction to it by voters at the debate, shows how deep-seated GOP animosity towards women s reproductive health is. They would cheer for a candidate vowing to eliminate a group supporting women s health, whose federal receipts are less than a rounding error on the balance sheet, all to satisfy their ongoing desire to control a woman s body.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Hillary BLASTS Anti-Woman, Anti-Immigrant Republicans In Glorious #GOPDebate Live Tweets","Thursday night marked the seventh GOP debate of this presidential election season. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton decided to take the opportunity to remind us all just what a GOP win in 2016 would mean for the country. She took to her twitter account to make sure everyone knew not to be fooled by any seemingly rational statements made by the clowns on stage.First the former Secretary of State blasted the misogynist men and their equally misogynist policies:Here you go, @JebBush: https://t.co/CNTHWnBzMs #GOPDebate  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016With every Republican attacking safe and legal abortion, women need more than an ally in the White House: We need a fighter. #ImWithHer  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016Reproductive rights are human rights. Women not any of the politicians on stage should make decisions about their own health. #GOPdebate  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016Then, she tackled their immigration positions:Trump isn t the only candidate missing from the #GOPdebate stage tonight. So is anyone who would protect DACA and DAPA.  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016Mientras los Republicanos no ofrecen ninguna soluci n, Hillary apoya una reforma migratoria con un camino hacia la ciudadan a. #GOPdebate  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016And of course, she rightfully condemned the Islamophobia that GOPers are so well-known for:Muslim Americans: This is your country, too. Islamophobic rhetoric isn't a tool against terrorism and it has no place in America. #GOPdebate  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016And of course, she attacked their anti-science stances on climate change:Want to hear presidential candidates discuss how they'd combat the global threat of climate change? You re out of luck at the #GOPdebate.  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016Then there was, of course, their ridiculous approach to fighting ISIS and other forms of terrorism:Said it before, will say it again: Bluster and chest-beating aren't a strategy to defeat terrorism. #GOPdebate  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016Of course, she had to mention Trump s absence, but reminded us all that his horrible ideas were still there, with the other equally regressive candidates:Donald Trump isn't on stage at the #GOPdebate but you can bet the same backwards ideas and out-of-touch rhetoric will be out in force.  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016In the end, this fabulous woman just straight out insulted them.#GOPdebate: Lots of bickering, no real plans to strengthen families or keep us safe. pic.twitter.com/HsojcMQUMq  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016And she s still tweeting. All in all, this is a very important message. We need to remember what is at stake if we do not vote blue in 2016. Any Democrat is better than these dangerous fools in the GOP Clown Car.Featured image via Hillary Clinton Twitter",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donations To Trump’s ‘Veteran Fundraiser’ Not Going To Vets (VIDEO),"Instead of participating in tonight s GOP debate, Donald Trump announced that he would be holding his own  veterans fundraising event  in Iowa.Trump created a special website for the fundraiser, donaldtrumpforvets.com.As of 8:30 pm, the site had already raised $380,000. According to the website, 100 percent of those donations are supposed to go to veterans needs.Here s a screen capture:screen capture: donaldtrumpforvets.comThere s just one problem. As reported by the Federalist, donations to the website aren t going to veteran s organizations at all. Instead they are going to his personal non-profit foundation, the Donald J. Trump Foundation.A disclaimer acknowledging that donations are made to Trump s private charity foundation appears at the bottom of the form.In addition, the Federalist reports that an email confirmation sent to donors reads: The Donald J Trump Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and acknowledges that no goods or services were provided to you in return for your contribution. This letter is your receipt and should be kept with your tax records. According to Forbes, less than one percent of donations made by the Donald J Trump Foundation between 2009 and 2013 (the most recent years for which data was available) went to organizations that help veterans. In fact, out of 298 organizations that received donations from Trump s foundation, only seven were veterans organizations.Even more telling, the donaldtrumpforvets.com website appears to have been created by the same Florida-based firm that created Trump s official campaign website. The site was created on Thursday morning, just hours before Trump s  veteran s fundraiser was scheduled to begin.While Trump claims that 100 percent of the donations raised during the Iowa event will go directly to veteran s needs, that claim seems dubious, at best.As Rachel Maddow reported in 2015, this would not be the first time that Trump had used a  veterans fundraiser  to scam his supporters.In September, Trump held a fundraiser for a group called Veterans for a Strong America. It was later discovered that the  group  had just one member. That member was also the organization s founder, a man named Joel Arends.Watch Rachel Maddow s report below, via YouTube.Trump is the worst kind of con-artist there is. It s bad enough that he repeatedly scammed investors and swindled students, but using our country s wounded veterans to generate profits and publicity is as low as it can get.Featured image credit: Michael Vadon via Flckr cc 2.0",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch The Unedited VIDEO Of Oregon Militiaman LaVoy ‘Tarp Man’ Finicum Being Shot By Law Enforcement,"WARNING: Disturbing image of a man being shot.The FBI released the official helicopter-based video footage of Oregon militiaman LaVoy  Tarp Man  Finicum being fatally shot by police while trying to break through a law enforcement road block in a white SUV.From the vantage point of the surveillance plane beginning at timecode 9:00, a truck driven by Finicum can be observed traveling at high speed on the abandoned Highway 395 toward the police barricade. Before colliding with vehicles arranged by FBI and Oregon State Police troopers, the SUV swerves to the left to go around the road block but is quickly thwarted by the accumulated snow. A man, presumably Finicum, emerges from the car with his arms outstretched.Officials begin to approach the man when he appears to reach into his coat and pulls out an object resembling a handgun. The FBI reported that the handgun was a 9mm semi-automatic firearm, carried in Finicum s left jacket pocket.It s at this point when we see the man fall limply into the snow, fatally wounded by one or more Oregon State Police officers.The official description of the incident from the FBI s Greg Bretzing:As the white truck approaches the roadblock, there is a spike strip across the road but it appears Finicum missed it as he attempted to drive around the roadblock. He nearly hits an FBI agent as he maneuvers to the left. The truck gets stuck in the snowbank.Finicum leaves the truck and steps through the snow. Agents and troopers on scene had information that Finicum and others would be armed. On at least two occasions, Finicum reaches his right hand toward a pocket on the left inside portion of his jacket. He did have a loaded 9 mm semi-automatic handgun in that pocket.At this time, OSP troopers shot Finicum.The video debunks claims by the Oregon militia that Finicum was surrendering to police on his knees.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGxDWKrjPQ&w=420&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Saudi Prince Epically Burns Donald Trump: Remember Those Two Times I Bailed You Out Financially?,"Donald Trump only has himself to blame for this one.Rather than watch what he says on Twitter, the billionaire Republican presidential candidate retweeted an obviously photoshopped image of Megyn Kelly posing with Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who owns a stake in Fox News, and his sister. @BradCross4: @Drudge_Report_ @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/Ur1qgG291Z  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2016Trump has been acting like a petulant child ever since he learned Fox News would be including Megyn Kelly as a debate moderator once again, even though he didn t like her tough questions in a debate last year that touched off a bitter feud between the two.But Trump apparently never learned to not bite the hand that feeds him, because his tweet came back to bite him on the ass on Thursday prior to his rogue event running at the same time as the GOP Debate he declined to attend.In an epic response to Trump s tweet, Prince Alwaleed fired back with a revealing tweet of his own reminding Trump of those two times back in the 1990s when Trump needed a financial bailout and Alwaleed came to his rescue. Trump:You base your statements on photoshopped pics?I bailed you out twice;a 3rd time,maybe? https://t.co/Raco0mvusp https://t.co/jStBl7Ghia        (@Alwaleed_Talal) January 28, 2016According to Buzzfeed, when Trump was $900 million in debt in 1991, it was Prince Alwaleed who purchased The Donald s Trump Princess yacht for $40 million.In 1995, Alwaleed would save Trump s ass again by purchasing New York City s Plaza Hotel from him for a whopping $325 million.In short, Donald Trump is an irresponsible businessman who has incurred massive debts and declared bankruptcy on multiple occasions. His decisions have been so bad that he needed to be bailed out by a Saudi national and you have to wonder how Trump would deal with America s debt. The last thing Americans need is to watch as their president sells the country off piece by piece to solve a debt that was created by Republican fiscal policies in the first place. And frankly, it s not hard to imagine that Trump would at least consider that option.Prince Alwaleed has previously called upon Trump to withdraw from the presidential race, and now he has given us even more reason to demand it as well.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Ted Cruz Opens The GOP Debate With A Wicked Burn On Donald Trump,"Fox News went completely predictable in opening tonight s Republican debate. Megyn Kelly addressed  the elephant not in the room,  asking Ted Cruz to comment on Donald Trump s absence. After some sleazy pandering to the people of Iowa, Cruz slung some mud at Trump with the kind of swagger and confidence of a boxer talking about his opponent at a press conference in his absence.Cruz got a nice chuckle from the crowd, and while his comments were witty, they were delivered by that screeching, whiny little voice through those annoying pursed lips. His egotistical little moment would probably have been smacked down with  you re not going to make America great  or something equally as clever juvenile had Trump been there.It was a fitting opening for the circus that was sure to come as another 2 hours of hate and fear was sold to the Republican base. Bravo, Senator. You managed to be responsible for the only 30 seconds of the debacle worth watching.Watch Ted Cruz take down Donald Trump below:Feature image via file photo",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SNL’s Rachel Dratch Exposes The Terrifying Lunacy Of Open Carry Laws In Less Than 2 Minutes (VIDEO),"Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America recently released their newest gun control PSA, and this one stars Saturday Night Live s Rachel Dratch. The commercial, which is less than two minutes long, starts out fine but takes a dark and terrifying turn at the end. The PSA is a satirical version of the life of a busy mom.The PSA is a satirical version of the life of a busy mom. It starts out with Dratch holding a laundry basket on the stairs in  her  house, saying: I woke up at 6:30 to walk the dog and pack a lunch for fourth grader with a peanut allergy and a seven-year-old who thinks bananas taste like butts! You then see her character s daughter walking past her with a pair of scissors in her hand. Rachel grabs the scissors to protect the little girl from getting hurt while continuing to talk about how busy she is. Her son rides by her on a scooter with no helmet on, so she doesn t miss a beat and puts one on his noggin.Basically, the first half of the commercial is a busy mom, protecting her children as best she can from being hurt in some sort of childhood related accident. At the end of the clip the family is at their favorite restaurant and suddenly the mood changes:The restaurant is filled with people drinking and they all have guns. The PSA is obviously targeting states like Texas where it is now legal for ammosexuals to bring their guns into eateries and scare the crap out of our children. What s worse is that this scenario is completely within the realm of possibility in states like Texas. According to Eater.com:Even though the open-carrying of weapons is still not allowed in bars and other establishments that make 51 percent of their revenue from alcohol sales, restaurants on the opposite side of the equation are left with a difficult question to answer.So if your local family restaurant makes less than 51 percent of its money on alcohol sales, crazy Bob from down the road can bring his weapon with him, get drunk and accidentally kill your kid with his penile extension.

 Republican Committee Passes Bill That Would Prohibit Almost All Abortions In Florida,"Florida Republicans  war on women is going strong this week. On Monday, Republicans in the House made the first step towards violating the Constitutional rights of every woman in the state by voting to allow a bill to progress that would ban nearly all abortions.The House Criminal Justice Committee voted 8-3 to pass House Bill 865, the  Florida For Life Act.  The bill defines life as starting at conception and would require two physicians to certify that an abortion is required to save the life of the mother. Chances of the bill actually making it to the House or Senate floor for a vote are slim, but Republicans claim they knew that when they voted on it. In fact, the only reason they proposed the bill was to appease Rep. Charles Van Zant. The lawmaker is in his final term and his filed the bill every year he has been in office.Rep. Ross Spano (R-Womanhaterville), who voted for the bill told the Associated Press that he was just wasting time by voting for it: The bill, probably, frankly, in all due respect, is never going to get a hearing in the Senate. Although this bill has a very small chance of making it through the other channels it needs to go through before it is brought to a full vote, there is a possibility that it may. Florida s is bleeding red at the state level and Republicans across the country have been chomping at the bit to destroy women s rights. The fake Planned Parenthood videos that were spread by alleged felons renewed the GOP s determination to outlaw abortions.According to the AP:The bill is one of several pieces of anti-abortion legislation now advancing in the Florida Legislature.Other bills that have received approval by at least one committee include measures that would prohibit Medicaid payments to any clinic where abortions are performed; require doctors who perform abortions to have local hospital admitting privileges; and require abortion clinics to meet the same construction standards and other licensing requirements as walk-in surgical centers; and prohibit use of fetal tissue resulting from an abortion for research.In other words, they are hitting women from every possible angle and trying to wedge their unwelcome elephant firmly in our uteri. They don t care that they are wasting time and therefore, wasting money by voting on these bills because ideology ALWAYS comes before the Constitution and fiscal responsibility in the mind of a Republican.Featured image: Instagram",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Whoopi Goldberg Opens Up A Can Of Whoop-A** On Trump (VIDEO),"At this point, America has become quite familiar with Donald Trump and his antics. He continues to show his racism and misogyny on a level unseen in the US political world since Jim Crow existed, when politicians were unchecked by political correctness. In his latest showdown with Megyn Kelly, Trump has decided to turn tail and run from the debates. Whoopi Goldberg, however, has a message for Trump. On ABC s the view, she said: You re a coward, Donald. You re a coward. If you re gonna be President of the United States, you have to go and talk to the people you may not like. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAlM_vT_frc] Coward  is definitely the right word to describe Trump, not only for skipping the debates but for being too afraid of doing what s right. Since the controversy with Kelly, tens of thousands of male Trump supporters have taken to twitter to call Kelly some of the worst names.  Bitch,  for example, was tweeted 423 times and counting. Trump doesn t have the courage nor the integrity to tell his supporters to have more class. In addition, Trump has shown a tendency of being afraid of strong women besides Kelly so hes reacts stupidly on multiple occasions.Joy Behar of the View pointed out that when women criticize him, Trump has a tendency to go ballistic.   The minute a woman does something to him, it makes his hair stand up straight,  said Behar, describing Trump s harsh reaction to her criticism of his hair as opposed to his silence when men criticized him.Referring to Kelly s questions and statements to Trump during the debates, Goldberg said: She didn t just attack Trump with just stuff she made up. This is stuff she said back to him. This is stuff he said and he couldn t take it. She got under his skin and he cut and ran. Only a coward cuts and runs. It s been apparent for a while that Trump is a certified coward.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michigan Silently Gave Clean Water To State Employees For Months Before Flint Crisis Broke,"Starting an entire year ago in January of 2015   long before the Flint water crisis broke into mainstream public awareness   the Michigan Department of Technology, Management & Budget determined that state employees needed an alternate source of clean drinking water. They began stocking water coolers on each floor of their offices for employee use.Flint residents were sent a notice that the level of trihalomethanes, which can cause liver and kidney problems, were exceeding federal limits   yet the city insisted the water was still fine and no actions needed to be taken to correct it. The notice followed two separate boil advisories in August and September of 2014. Despite assuring the citizens of the city that the water was safe, officials at the capitol gave state employees clean water to drink from coolers, instead of municipal sources like fountains and faucetsAccording to documentation, the coolers were to remain for employees to use  as long as the public water does not meet treatment requirements. via Progress MichiganThe residents of Flint, as you know by now, did not deserve such consideration. It took nearly an entire year for them to start being taken seriously by the state government. This came only after the story finally broke loose in the national media in a huge and embarrassing spectacle for state Republicans. If the media had not forced state Republicans  hands on this issue, people would still be drinking poison today. Water only started being distributed in January of 2016 in any kind of substantial way in the city, by the national guard.Even the excuse of  saving money  which was given by the Governor has been called into doubt. Recent emails which were released by Governor Rick Snyder under intense pressure by the media show that if Flint had simply stayed with Detroit water the city would have saved as much, if not more money, anyway.Featured image via pixabay",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Chart Captures Every Sexist Slur Trump Supporters Tweeted At Megyn Kelly (IMAGES),"On Tuesday, Trump announced that he would be skipping Thursday night s GOP debate because Fox News host Megyn Kelly would be moderating it, and Trump is scared sh*tless of her even since she made him look like a complete idiot the first time moderated the GOP debate.Since Trump got his ego handed to him on a silver platter, Trump has kept himself busy with a mostly one-sided feud against Kelly, solidifying the very sexist, misogynistic behavior the Fox host called him out on during the first debate. It should come as no surprise that Trump s supporters are just like him   disrespectful with unhealthy, hateful views toward women. And it couldn t be any more apparent than their activity on social media.VocativVocativThe tweets from Trump s supporters are hardly surprising   these are the same people who routinely attack protesters at Trump s rallies   animalistic, violent behavior which Trump sometimes even encourages.Because Trump has refused to participate in the debate, Trump s fans have been demanding that Kelly be removed from her position as moderator after Trump s initial demand for her exclusion was denied. Trump s followers are all sexist, misogynistic babies and it s easy to see why Trump appeals to these people.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Desperate A**hole Jeb Bush Exploits Image Of Terri Schiavo To Score Points With Far-Right (VIDEO),"Jeb Bush has raised well over $120 million with his utterly disastrous presidential campaign, successfully proving that money doesn t always buy support. On the upside, a lot of really wealthy conservatives pumped millions of dollars into a trainwreck campaign   money they ll never, ever see again.Currently, Jeb Bush is polling at four percent in Iowa, according to Nate Silver, and eight percent in New Hampshire.Knowing so much money is at stake, and that his campaign is perhaps the most pathetic effort on the GOP side, it s no wonder he resorted to a completely tasteless new commercial in which he exploits the image of Terri Schiavo to emphasize his pro-life record.TPM:Shiavo s husband, Michael, called the ad  disgusting  in a statement to the Tampa Bay Tribune. It is simply disgusting that Jeb Bush and his super Pac would exploit my wife s tragedy for his crude political gain,  Michael Schiavo said in the statement.  Shame on Jeb Bush. What the campaign video shows is that if he ever got his hands on the power of government again, he would do the same thing again, maybe next time to your family,  the statement continued.In case you don t know, Schiavo was a Florida resident who, due to a heart attack, lapsed into an irreversible persistent vegetative state. Her parents wanted to continue to keep her alive, while her husband vigorously pursued her wishes to die with dignity. When the story hit the news, the GOP scrambled to diagnose Schiavo from afar, turning her into a source of pro-life demagoguery.So, as if Schiavo and her husband weren t humiliated enough by Republicans, Jeb Bush chose to resurrect his party s shameless exploitation of a family caught in one of life s most harrowing episodes. All for the purpose of desperately trying to lift his failing campaign. The fact that it won t work illustrates how pointless it is.The only thing more disgraceful was the time Republicans used images of 9/11, including victims leaping from the World Trade Center to their deaths.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u-f9-wfs6c&w=420&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Veterans Send ‘Loser’ Trump A Brutal Message: Keep Your Donations (TWEETS),"On Tuesday, Republican front-runner Donald Trump shocked everyone by announcing that he was boycotting the Fox News GOP debate on Thursday, as it was being moderated by his nemesis, Megyn Kelly. And in his childish haste to get back at Fox News for giving Kelly another chance to make him look like an idiot, Trump sent the network a message of blatant disrespect: he would be throwing a competing event: a benefit for America s veterans on the very same day as the GOP debate.On Trump s event page for veterans and wounded warriors, the front-runner promised to raise money for the men and women who have been treated so horribly by our all-talk, no-action politicians . Well, it turns out that veterans have a message for Trump: We don t want your donations.On Wednesday, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America founder Paul Rieckhoff announced that his organization would not accept any contributions that came from Trump s event. He tweeted:TwitterTwo other veterans  groups have also decided they want nothing to do with Trump s publicity stunt. The Wounded Warrior Project, which has recently come under fire for using its donation money for wasteful purposes, has denied having any awareness of Trump s efforts to fundraise for the organization. VoteVets.org, however, was willing to send a more direct message to the GOPer. The organization, which boasts that it is America s largest progressive veterans group, issued a statement that said  Don t hide from Megyn Kelly behind us.  Iraq War veteran and chairman of the organization absolutely burned The Donald: Let me put this in language Donald Trump understands. You re a loser. You re a third-rate politician, who clearly doesn t understand issues, and is so scared of Megyn Kelly exposing it, that you re looking to use veterans to protect you from facing her questions. The veterans  scorn is honestly well-deserved   a look into Trump s past can easily prove that this is just a stunt for Trump and there s no sincerity in his charity event. The GOP front-runner has actually been whining about  homeless veterans  for decades, complaining that they bring his property values down. And before he ran for president, Trump actually wanted to get rid of America s troops. So don t be fooled by Trump s benefit for vets   he doesn t care about them and is just using them to gain more support.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin Defends Trump Skipping ‘Ballyhooed Media Debate’ With Indecipherable Word Salad,"Rarely in life do you see people go so perfectly together. However, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin are made for one another. They are the peanut butter and jelly of political duos. Unfortunately for America, though, most of us are allergic to nuts.After Trump decided to throw his hissy fit and not attend the Fox News GOP debate being moderated by Megyn Kelly, because apparently he is allergic to her cooties, Palin decided to take to Facebook (as she does) and lay down her defense of the hotel magnate.She starts the post with,  Media: Here, Let Me Define For You a Genuine  Game Changer .  You tell  em, Sarah! I m sure they can t wait to read what you have to say. After all, your opinion is so relevant and paramount to all of politics, or for that matter, THE WORLD.Palin doesn t want Trump to get bullied by the  ballyhooed media debate game.  She goes on and on  and on, rambling in an indecipherable word salad. She says things like: Enough is enough; Trump s victory on this issue proves we have a choice. The courageous GOP frontrunner is speaking for us with his  screw it, biased media  the people deserve better  red line. Finally. Trump will now lead others with this empowerment to go around media filters and egos and everything else that s stood between people with a heart to serve and the voters. As well as: We can go elsewhere to seek truthful information that includes a candidate s voting record, their responsibility in spending other people s money and balancing budgets, their record of negotiating to win, their private sector acumen and personal accomplishments, who they re beholden to, if they ve incentivized more illegal aliens to flood our borders with gifts and freebies   making America much less secure  oh, and so much more! Yes, that s all one sentence. Oh, and what s better than starting a sentence with  Like ? Like, if politics is their profession in perpetuity, which is the antithesis of our Founders  vision. She then goes on to say that she s studied journalism. Which, I guess, technically she has. However, she apparently didn t learn much along the way.Palin finishes her post with  P.S.  that is just pure gold as she throws shade at Fox News and Megyn Kelly for not kowtowing to Trump s demands: (P.S. Is it just me, or if a debate host has made himself or herself the principal in a story they re expected to objectively cover for the edification of the public, and they even acknowledge they re the reason the frontrunner chooses not to participate, then isn t it common sense (and courtesy to the voting public) to simply, humbly allow someone else to moderate the debate? With all due respect, what a strange game at play. It s at the expense of straight-shooting candidates gunning in competition for the nation s top administrative position, and more importantly, at the expense of Americans who deserve to hear them instead of the cries from a pity-partying press with noses out of joint because someone finally took a stand for common sense and an even playing field. Sarah Palin really shouldn t be the one to talk about  common sense  considering she has no sense at all. This is probably one of her more bizarre posts where she apparently used the  talk to text  feature on her mobile device. If there s anyone out there willing to decipher or translate this, have at it.Without further ado, here s the word salad in all its glory: // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ <span class=""mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span></span>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, <span class=""mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">fjs</span></span> = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3"";  <span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">fjs</span>.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', '<span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">facebook-jssdk</span>')); // ]]&gt;Media: Here, Let Me Define For You a Genuine  Game Changer Regarding Donald Trump honoring our U.S. Veterans instead Posted by Sarah Palin on Thursday, January 28, 2016Featured image: Flickr/Flickr",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cenk Uygur Lays The Smackdown On White Right-Wing Privilege (VIDEO),"The FBI is only just now beginning to take down the Bundy terrorists in Oregon, and Cenk Uygur is furious that it took them this long to take action.Ever since the redneck wannabe soldiers seized the federal buildings at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on January 2nd, many have pointed out that if the militants weren t white, the occupation would have been put down harshly on day one and most of the gunmen would have been killed.But because Bundy and his buddies were white anti-government right-wingers, they were treated with kid gloves by the Justice Department and law enforcement, and only time will tell whether they are actually punished for their many crimes or just receive a slap on the wrist.Cenk Uygur, however, didn t hold back on Wednesday while laying the smackdown on the FBI for treating the militants as if there are separate laws for white gun-toting conservatives. He became particularly upset after one militant outright called for killing law enforcement officials, something that would almost certainly cause police to drop the hammer if the militant were a Muslim or a black man. We re going to have a conversation with these guys? They were free to come and go for three weeks, there was no perimeter. The FBI says,  Oh don t worry, we just set up a perimeter  Why didn t you set up a perimeter the first time they captured a federal building, armed, talking about how they re going to murder people who come and try to take it from them. And here are these guys on camera saying,  We re going to murder the cops if they come to get us.  You stole, sh*t, you criminal, you thug! The Young Turks host then went off on how much leeway law enforcement have given to Bundy and his militants over the last three weeks just because they are armed white guys on the political right-wing fringe, pointing out that if a left-wing environmental group had done the same thing they would have been instantly executed without getting the opportunity to exercise their right to go in front of a judge or being heard by a jury of their peers. Look at the white privilege here, and it s not just white. It s right-wing privilege. Because if left wingers had taken over, environmental groups had taken over and say,  Oh, we re going to do this and we re going to do that.  It doesn t matter if it s a Latino, a black group or it s just white Greenpeace or animal rights guys, nobody gets to come and go and threaten cops and talk about killing them! This is white privilege. You can steal stuff, you can steal federal stuff and they don t even arrest you for three weeks! This is insane, man. There s two different laws in the country and we walk around pretending it isn t. Here s the video via YouTube. Uygur s remarked begin at the 5:30 marker.He s right, of course. If the militants had been Muslim or black there would not have been a standoff at all. Law enforcement would have fired every bullet they could get their hands on into the compound until every single one of them were killed. Now, federal law enforcement should be applauded for waiting out the terrorists and taking them down with little bloodshed. But the point is that police should have the same tolerance and discipline no matter what color a person is or what religion or political views a person holds. If anything, this standoff demonstrated perfectly that we live in two separate Americas, one where police will do everything in their power to not kill you as long as you are a white gun nut, and one where police will become trigger-happy monsters when they come upon unarmed people of color and then hide behind their badges while they do everything to justify their unlawful actions.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" If You Love Veterans So Much, Trump, Why Did You Try To Sweep Them Into The Gutter?","According to Donald Trump, he loves veterans. At least that s what he keeps telling people. And when you re running in an election for a party that constantly uses the service of men and women and uniform as political props, you re going to tout the line that you love veterans as much as possible. However, actions speak louder than words, and Trump apparently doesn t realize that people actually remember the actions he took back in 1991 when he tried to remove veterans from 5th Avenue in New York City. You see, Trump Tower is on 5th Avenue, and those gosh darn veterans trying to make a living as vendors were just too unsightly for Trump to have anywhere near his precious building.In a letter Trump wrote to the New York state Assembly in 1991, it said: While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax paying citizens and businesses? Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the world s finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area? And then again to NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg in 2004: Whether they are veterans or not, they [the vendors] should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street he image of New York City will suffer  I hope you can stop this very deplorable situation before it is too late. And in case that s not bad enough for you, he also wanted to make sure no one sat down near his building that may have taken away from the  beautiful ambience.  According to the New York Times he had large planters placed on benches. He said in 1984: We have had tremendous difficulties with respect to the bench   drug addicts, vagrants, et cetera have come to the atrium in large numbers. Additionally, all sorts of  horrors  had been taking place that effectively ruined the beautiful ambience of the space which everyone loves so much. To be blunt, Donald Trump is exactly what s wrong with the United States of America, and for him to even remotely be coming close to gaining the Republican nomination for president is outright horrifying. He only loves veterans when it s politically convenient for him to do so. To pander to a bunch of folks who are apparently so dumb to think he would actually make a decent president. His actions in the past with veterans only prove the continuing line that Trump is only out for himself and what s best for Trump. He doesn t want America to be great, because guess what, America is already pretty damn great. Trump wants Trump to be great, and he wants to stroke his ego inside the Oval Office. Smart Americans know better, and we need to make sure he stays as far away from the White House as possible.Featured image: Flickr/Wikimedia/photoshop",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Won’t Believe The Racist Image Trump Just Tweeted About Megyn Kelly (IMAGE),"Donald Trump is known for his controversial and often racist comments and he continues to be unrelenting. During his latest feud with Fox News and specifically Megyn Kelly, Trump tweeted an image of Kelly meeting with a Saudi prince and a woman dressed in niqab.@Drudge_Report_ @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/yjQSzw2GaR  Brad (@BradCross4) January 28, 2016As you can probably guess, the image is a fake and was retweeted by Trump from an unapologetic racist who has also tweeted images of Michelle Obama as a monkey and having sex with an ape.Not that Trump seems to care where he gets his information from.In the past, he has retweeted white supremacists, including fans of Adolf Hitler, and has promoted fake crime statistics fabricated by neo-Nazis, which he later defended as  very credible. In his latest racist tweet, Trump does what he does best which is to play on the fears of individuals. This time, just like many times before, Islam was used as a vehicle in which to do so. He has called for banning Muslims from entering the United States, stood by and did nothing while a Muslim woman was kicked out of one of his rallies for simply being a Muslim, and has attacked the religion and its followers to the point where there has been a surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the country because of his comments. Thus, the fake image of Megyn Kelly is designed to associate Kelly with Islam and Muslims, which in Trump s as well as his racist associates  warped minds means something terrible and something un-American.Trump is a disturbing and a disgusting individual who appeals to folks just like him. Let s hope that when all is said and done in terms of the elections, we can all look back and reminisce at the big bad joke that was Donald Trump running to be president of the United States.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Chilling Police Abuse Footage Oakland Cops Didn’t Want You To See (VIDEO),"On January 19, 2016, the city of Oakland, California, agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a wrongful death suit, filed by the family of Hernan Jaramillo, a 51-year-old man who was killed while being restrained by police.The Contra Costa Times obtained video of the moments before Jaramillo s death. The video shows the man repeatedly crying out for help, saying,  They re killing me!  and  I can t breathe. As one officer pressed his knee into Jaramillo s back, four others used their weight to hold the man down on the sidewalk. When Jaramillo cries out to his sister again, saying  They re killing me,  one officer responds  No-one s killing you. Before becoming unresponsive, Jaramillo again tells his sister  They know what they re doing. They re killing me. Jaramillo did not have a criminal record. Worse, he was not even accused of a crime at the time of his death.According to the family, Jaramillo s sister called police to report that her brother was being attacked by an intruder. When police arrived, they found him alone in his room.Although Jaramillo s sister insisted that he was not the intruder, police handcuffed him and led him to a waiting squad car.The officers claim that they wanted to take him in for a mental health assessment, but he  resisted  as they tried to get him into the police car. That s when they threw him to the sidewalk, compressing his body under their combined weight, until he stopped calling for help.Although Oakland police never released the footage, which was captured by one of the officers  body cameras, the video was leaked to Contra Costa Times this week. It was later published to YouTube by US Uncut.Watch the footage below.While the city of Oakland will pay $450,000 to settle the wrongful death suit filed by Jaramillo s family, the officers involved in this incident will never be held accountable.That s because the Alameda County District Attorney does not investigate in-custody deaths unless they involve officer shootings.This insane policy gives cops the green light to murder citizens, just as long as they don t use their guns to do it.The victim repeatedly told the officers that he couldn t breathe. Still they continued to press down on him, until he finally became unresponsive.At best, the officers involved in the death of Hernan Jaramillo are guilty of negligent homicide and reckless endangerment, if not deliberate murder. But the policies of the Alameda County DA s office enabled them to get away with it.Featured image credit: video screen capture via US Uncut",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 MIC DROP: Watch Neil deGrasse Tyson SHRED Flat Earth Rapper B.o.B On The Nightly Show (VIDEO),"Rapper B.o.B. has recently gained some notoriety for his theories about why the Earth is actually flat. I won t get into reasons why the earth is not flat. It s too ridiculous to even deserve a proper debate.There may be a good chance that this is some elaborate trolling by B.o.B. because he doesn t limit himself to just thoughts about a flat earth. He also went on to talk about something called  Mark 2 REM driven clones and Synthetic Robotoids,  with the suggestion we all  look it up. Well, one person seemed to have looked up B.o.B. and that was Larry Wilmore of The Nightly Show. Wilmore took the rapper to task over the tweets that B.o.B. had sent out, such as  the horizon is always eye level,   where is the curve?  and  Once you go flat you never go back. A few individuals tried to explain over Twitter why he couldn t see the curvature of the earth while he was physically standing on it, but many more chimed in to defend his crackpot suggestions. Needless to say, Twitter alone was not taking care of things.That s when Wilmore called in the one and only Neil deGrasse Tyson to explain exactly why B.o.B. was so wrong. Not only did NDT set the rapper straight, but he went on a bit of a tirade about how we have developed a culture that is partially accepting of looney theories like this. Calling it a  growing anti-intellectual strain,  NDT correctly explained how  being wrong  becomes  being harmful  when you are both wrong AND have influence over others. A direct line can be drawn from his statement to the attitudes of so many famous people today. All the way from average D-list celebrities to presidential candidates, there is a rather unprecedented  uncoolness  for knowing things and being well-informed about how the world works.Watch Neil deGrasse Tyson s epic takedown of intentional ignorance below:featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The ‘Baby Parts’ Video People Just Got The Worst News Of Their Lives,"Sorry, David Daleidin and Sandra Merritt, even if you don t like your first Grand Jury, you can keep it.On Wednesday, lawyers for the pair of anti-abortion activists who were recently indicted on multiple felony counts in a surprise twist to a case conservatives hoped would end Planned Parenthood forever, argued that the Grand Jury that handed out indictments was absolutely out of control. Unfortunately, things didn t quite go as the lying liars who produced the heavily edited, fraudulent  baby parts  videos that prompted Robert Lewis Dear to attack a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado, and Carly Fiorina to redefine  stupid  in her almost incoherent ravings about the health organization, had planned.Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said that she does not intend to cave to the whims of the right-wing activists, explaining that  the inconvenient truth of a criminal investigation is that it doesn t always lead where you want it to go.  Anderson, a Republican who is against abortion, explained that she understands that every single one of her personal beliefs does not have to interfere with her ability to perform her job:While the Grand Jury indicted the activists the subject of the proceedings, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, was cleared of all wrongdoing.Reuters reports:Documents filed in Harris County court showed fake California driver s licenses for the pair when they were making the video. Lawyers for the two did not dispute the fake IDs.The court papers said the pair unlawfully used a fake government record  with the intent to defraud or harm others. They face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.Terry Yates, an attorney for the two, said in Houston:  The grand jury has over reached, obviously a runaway grand jury would do that. This decision, of course, is shocking in a state whose Republicans recently gutted Planned Parenthood s HIV prevention program in a desperate attack against the organization. Both Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, who ordered their own proceedings, say that this latest vindication of Planned Parenthood will have no impact on their individual attempts to destroy the health organization. The fact remains that the videos exposed the horrific nature of abortion and the shameful disregard for human life in the abortion industry,  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told the Houston Press Monday.  The state s investigation of Planned Parenthood is ongoing. Planned Parenthood is celebrating this as a win.  It s great news because it demonstrates what we have said from the very beginning, which is that Planned Parenthood is following every rule and regulation, and that these people came into our buildings under the guise of health when their true intentions were to spread lies,  said Rochelle Tafolla, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, after the decision.Sorry, David and Sandra. It must be terrible not to have a choice in the matter.Featured image via Allen West Republic/LifeNews",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Gross: How GOP Candidates Are Using Military Vets As Human Shields (TWEETS),"At least two Republican campaigns are using veteran s groups as props for campaign debate stunts.The stomach-turning trend began with Super PACs backing Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), who responded to Donald Trump pulling out of the officially sanctioned Republican presidential debate by offering a ransom for Trump to appear in a one-on-one event.Super PACs supporting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz say they will donate $1.5 million to charities committed to helping veterans if rival Donald Trump agrees to a one-on-one debate with Cruz. Not only would this be a heck of a debate, but it would also be a terrific opportunity to generate millions of dollars for the veterans,  the Keep the Promise I and II PACs said in a joint statement Wednesday night.Former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, who is mired in the single digits in her campaign later chimed in, promising to donate $1.5 million to veterans to join in a Cruz-Trump debate, or $2 million to debate Trump at Drake University.My campaign will also donate $1.5 million to veterans' cause to join debate Saturday in Sioux City, @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump (1/2)  Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) January 28, 2016Upping the ante, I'm free tomorrow at 8pm, @realDonaldTrump. My campaign will give $2mm to veterans' cause to debate at Drake U. (2/2)  Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) January 28, 2016Neither stunt   and they are both publicity stunts that Trump will likely reject in all likelihood   managed to go into detail about what services nor relief would be provided to veterans, while also neglecting to mention that many of the warmongering policies supported by the candidates would create more, wounded veterans.The dueling offers also highlighted just how much the other candidates are yearning for a news cycle involving themselves and Trump, in order to raise their visibility and in theory help their performance in the Iowa caucus.The possibility of both the campaigns and Super PACs donating money to charitable veteran s causes no matter what Trump s campaign response is never came up.The frankly cavalier decision to use troops as a pawn does not appear to have attracted a detracting point of view within the Fiorina campaign or the Cruz PAC, with both entities furthering the crass campaign game without thinking of the big picture.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Fox News Host Is Personally Begging Trump To Come To Their Debate (VIDEO),"The spectacle of Donald Trump rejecting Fox News  debate got even more ridiculous on Wednesday night as the network s highest rated host, Bill O Reilly, got involved in the clown show.Despite shunning Fox, Trump still decided to appear on The O Reilly Factor in a satellite interview with the host. Discussing Trump s public tantrum, O Reilly all but got down on bended knee and asked Trump to reconsider his decision: I m trying to convince you that your tack is wrong, because it s better for the folks to see you in the debate format,  Mr. O Reilly said.He pointed to Newt Gingrich using negative questions during the debate in South Carolina in 2012 to great effect as he pummeled the moderator John King of CNN in the Republican primary campaign. Mr. Gingrich later won the primary in the state.  I m telling you, that s the way to go here,  Mr. O Reilly said. This has to do with the stupidity of Fox and what they did,  Mr. Trump said.O Reilly even pointed to his cheek, asking the reality TV star and current Republican front-runner to turn the other cheek after being angered at the network for a combative press release reports indicate was personally written by network boss, Roger Ailes.Trump rebuffed the overture, telling O Reilly he is more in the mood for an eye for an eye, wounding Fox in his perspective by hurting the ratings for the network and its advertisers.In addition to Trump s direct refusal to engage, his campaign cronies have also been spreading the conspiracy theory that Fox is in cahoots with Hillary Clinton, despite the network s pivotal role over the last 20 years in attacking and smearing Democrats, particularly the former Secretary of State.Taking advantage of the chaos, fellow candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has asked Trump to hold a one-on-one Lincoln/Douglas style debate with him. Trump has refused, and some believe the gambit is Trump attempting to opt out of debates even if he is the Republican nominee, an unprecedented cowardly move.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ammon Bundy Has Suddenly Had A Change Of Heart About That Whole ‘Dying For Freedom’ Thing,"On Tuesday night, seven of the Bundy militants that were previously occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon were arrested by authorities. What started as a traffic stop devolved into a gunfight with the FBI, in which the  blue tarp man,  LaVoy Finicum, was killed. The five remaining militants with Bundy, one of whom was wounded but survived, were promptly arrested. There were two other militants that were arrested in separate incidents from the one that involved gunfire.That s when it seemed things suddenly became all too real for Ammon Bundy. He, along with his fellow rebels, was arraigned in federal court and held without bail while awaiting trial. The sudden realization of what was happening appeared to knock some sense into his head, prompting Ammon Bundy to call on the remaining militants at the refuge to surrender and leave the compound.Through attorney, Ammon Bundy is telling remaining occupiers in Burns to ""Go home. Hug your families. Let us take it from here.""  Jamie Wilson (@JWilsonreporter) January 27, 2016FBI Special Agent in Charge Greg Bretzing commented that the militants were given  ample opportunities  to leave the occupation peacefully.  Instead, they have chosen to threaten and intimidate the America they claim to love,  he said in a statement during a press conference regarding the arrests and shooting Wednesday.The remaining militants had previously made statements that they were going to resist arrest, with one of them recording a statement that he was going to die fighting while everyone was watching.A check on the militant s YouTube channel shows new video from the compound uploaded as of 1 hour ago at the time of approximately 8:15 pm EST on 1/27, with a live stream scheduled later. From videos uploaded previously, it seems that there is still a small group remaining on-site.Sheriff Dave Ward also made an emotional appeal for an end to the occupation:This has been tearing our community apart. It s time for everyone in this illegal occupation to move on. It doesn t have to be bloodshed in our community. If we have issues with the way things are going in our government, we have a responsibility as citizens to act on them in an appropriate manner. We don t arm up and rebel. We work through the appropriate channels.Source: opb.orgThere are only two ways to end this now. Hopefully the remaining few realize their lives are not worth throwing away.Featured image via flickr",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black Chicago Teen Calls Cops 3 times For Help Before They Execute Him (VIDEO),"People always wonder why black people are so reluctant to call the police for help, but here is yet another example in a long line that demonstrates just why we are so wary of law enforcement, even when we are the victims.19-year-old Chicago resident Quintonio LeGrier called 911 three times in an emergency, only to have dispatchers hang up on him. When police arrived, as happens in so many of these cases, he was fatally shot by the very people charged with serving and protecting him. From The Root:According to ABC News, audio of the 19-year-old s 911 calls made Dec. 26 were released late Monday by Chicago s Independent Police Review Authority, which is investigating both LeGrier s death and the death of his neighbor Bettie Jones. Jones, 55, was also shot and killed by police after she opened their apartment building door to let police in.Earlier that day, LeGrier called 911 asking that a police officer be sent to his address. The first call was made at 4:18 a.m., and the last call was made three minutes later. There s an emergency, can you send an officer?  LeGrier can be heard saying on one of the calls.During one call, LeGrier didn t respond to the 911 operator s questions and the dispatcher hung up on the teen, ABC reports.However, instead of providing assistance, the cops came, after Quintonio s father, Antonio LeGrier, told a 911 operator, My son has freaked out. I need an officer. When the supposed  help  arrived, the child was shot dead. Police, of course, are covering their asses. The statement they released regarding the incident reads: Upon arrival, officers were confronted by a combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer s weapon, fatally wounding two individuals. Quintonio LeGrier was not the only person the cops murdered that night. A woman named Bettie Jones, a 55-year-old mother with five children, was also executed.This is why black people do not trust the police. I don t care what kind of trouble I am in, they are the last people I d call for help   because said  help  just might cost me my life.Watch a video news report on the incident below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Leave It To Sesame Street To Teach America What A Jerk Donald Trump Truly Is (VIDEO),"For everyone other than maybe his investment partners, his wife, and his white nationalist supporters, most people look at Donald Trump with utter disgust. No, not because he s orange with something that can only be described as an endangered species on his head, but rather because of his attitude towards life and how he apparently thinks people and things should be treated. Just by listening to his hissy fit over the Fox News debate, he has to make it about ratings and how he s really the thing that drives the entire event. To put it mildly he s full of himself, to be absolutely accurate, he s an egomaniac with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.And this isn t anything new for Trump. The Republican frontrunner has always been this braggadocios character who sees himself as the absolute best at everything and thinks everything he touches turns to gold. If he had a nice personality, many people would be able to look past this sort of ego, but since he s also an ass, well, people are going to call him out on it.The folks over at Sesame Street did just that back in 2005 when they created the character  Donald Grump  that Oscar the Grouch and all the other trash-loving grouches looked up to and admired. They put the word  GRUMP  all over everything, just like Trump does with his name. Oscar the Grouch in the introduction leading up the appearance of  Grump  explains to show staple Maria: Donald Grump happens to have the most trash of any grouch in the world  His name is on every piece of trash in town. Then after a brilliant song completely satirizing Trump,  Donald Grump  emerges and is everything you d ever imagine the muppet to be, with lines like: Who s name equals TRASH, to you and to me?  and the Grump saying  Who do you wish you all could be? Elmo s even turned down from being Mr. Grump s helper because he s  too nice.  However, Grump changes his mind when he hears Elmo is  nice AND annoying.  Qualities both Grump and Trump know help manipulate people to his fancy. Grump also yells at Maria when he doesn t like what she says by saying,  Scram, you re fired!  And when she says,  you can t fire me  he says,  I just did.  Which is all very foreshadowing to the revelation that Trump truly wants all Latinos to scram.But enough of me explaining what happens. The entire thing is just pure comedy gold and absolutely accurate.Enjoy.Video/Featured image: YouTube",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bristol Palin Wants Black Actors To Ignore Oscars’ Racism — ‘Not Everyone Gets A Trophy’,"Bristol Palin is no smarter than her mother, half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah. However, she sure does think she knows a lot about a lot of things. As if being an abstinence activist who has had two out-of-wedlock children weren t enough, Bristol has also decided that she is some kind of racism expert.Ever since black actors and their allies have decided to boycott the Oscars because, for the second year in a row, they have no black stars nominated for their prestigious awards, white folks all over the place have been telling Black America at large that there s no problem here, when we all know damn well there is. Now, Bristol Palin has added her voice to the mix.She said that she agrees with Fox contributor Stacey Dash, who wants to ride the world of pesky, racist institutions such as BET and Black History Month. This is bad enough coming from the Clueless star, who is black herself. To refresh, Dash said the following: Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards. Now, lily-white Bristol Palin goes and blogs about something that in no way concerns her. Taking to her own blog, Bristol wrote: I have to admit, I don t know who  Waka Flocka  is, or what he sings, but I agree with him on this! Though [Ice Cube] didn t mention Stacey by name, isn t it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly? We shouldn t segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year. I wish things were really colorblind. I don t know how other people think about it, but I hope my son sees early on   that not everyone gets a trophy. And this is the problem with people like Stacey Dash and Bristol Palin. Ignoring problems like racism doesn t make them go away; in fact, it always them to fester and grow under cover of dark. Exposing these things is how we rid the world of them. These actors and their supporters are taking on a systemic problem.No, you privileged, clueless little girl, this isn t about trophies and segregation. This is about uncovering the truth and telling it like it is, in an effort to right wrongs that are centuries old and counting.Then again, I don t expect you to know anything about that.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Just Opened Up About Something That Will Make Conservatives’ Heads Explode,"In a recent candid interview with the Washington Post, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders opened up about his religious faith in a way that many will probably find refreshing. Christian conservatives, on the other hand, might want to have a seat.Speaking with reporters Frances Stead Sellers and John Wagner, Sanders made it clear that not only is he not going to try to get votes by playing the religion card, he would rather politicians keep their faith out of politics altogether. As for himself, he freely admits he isn t interested in organized religion. I am not actively involved with organized religion,  Sanders said in a recent interview.Sanders said he believes in God, though not necessarily in a traditional manner. I think everyone believes in God in their own ways,   he said.  To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together. In other words, Sanders is describing himself as a humanist.In an earlier interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Sanders spoke about how his fellow man, and not a holy book, make him want to be a positive force in the world. Well, you know, I am who I am. And what I believe in and what my spirituality is about is that we re all in this together. That I think it is not a good thing to believe that, as human beings, we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people In classic Sanders fashion, he went on to pivot from spiritual musings to railing against wealth inequality. Once again, we were reminded that when Sanders claims he would rather talk about the issues that face the country rather than his faith or lack thereof, he means it.This is a radical deviation from how most American politicians approach voters. For many, particularly on the right, religious pandering is front-and-center to their campaign strategy. For proof of that, one need only to look at how many Republican candidates have held rallies at Christian universities. Several even launched their campaigns at one.How singularly focused on religion are Republican politicians? Consider this: Trump, a man whose history of divorces, intolerance, and greed would make even Jesus strain to turn the other cheek, has managed to score a key religious ally by grovelling: Evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. He couldn t wait to brag about it.Great honor- Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2016Eager to compete, Ted Cruz found his own religious leader to endorse him, Pastor Mike Bickle. Unfortunately, the man turned out to be a raging anti-Semite who claimed Hitler was sent from heaven to kill Jews. The Lord says,  I m going to give all 20 million of them the chance to respond to the fishermen. And I give them grace.  And he says,  And if they don t respond to grace, I m going to raise up the hunters.  And the most famous hunter in recent history is a man named Adolf Hitler. Oops.Ironically, Sanders commitment to avoiding religion in the public square falls more in line with what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they laid out the Constitution that Republicans claim to adore. While many   but not all   of the founders were religious, they were deeply skeptical of letting religion dictate secular society and vice versa. Religion was a private matter; politics, a public one. Mixing the two diminished both.Politics aside, it s clear that Bernie Sanders is defying every rule that Christian conservatives insisted a politician must have. Far from being hurt by his openness about his lack of organized religion, Sanders is doing just fine by sticking with the issues. It seems that a genuine drive to make things better for people really does matter more than being able to say you pray really hard. On the flipside, politicians who are deeply religious, don t seem to have a better track record. Famously, George W. Bush said he spoke to God about the invasion of Iraq   either God has a sick sense of humor or the voice in his head was, in fact, Dick Cheney s.Feature image via Flickr",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Continues Assault On Planned Parenthood Even After ‘Whistleblowers” Indictment,"If you thought the Republican Party was going to drop their Planned Parenthood witch hunt after the indictment of their criminal  whistleblowers  David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, you don t know the GOP very well. Honest people might back away from the fraudulent baby parts videos and admit they d been had, but we all know that the right-wing Teapublican lawmakers aren t the brightest, nor most ethical, crayons in the box. Instead of dropping their investigation, lawmakers have decided to keep wasting your tax dollars   all while claiming the country is broke.According to the Huffington Post, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) released a letter in the wake of the indictment and assured her fellow pro-fetusers that she would not give up the war against women: We will continue to gather information and get the facts about medical practices of abortion service providers and the business practices of the procurement organizations who sell baby body parts. These are issues of importance to the American people. We will study the laws on the books and follow the facts to defend life. What?This is how great the chasm between reality and fiction is for these people. She knows that the videos have been debunked, and yet she continues to insist that the beloved women s health organization is selling baby parts. Not even felony indictments can make her admit that her party was one hundred percent WRONG and she s not the only one. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee and a plethora of other Republicans have all said that they support federal investigations into PP.Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) said he was  disappointed and shocked  by the grand jury s decision. He even went so far as to defend David Daleiden for his illegal behavior: It s deeply offensive and ridiculous that those who illegally sell aborted human body parts get a pass   while these two pro-life defenders are indicted for using aliases to expose Planned Parenthood s unlawful and disgusting practices of selling baby body parts. This decision begs the question: how else could they get the truth? The real question is: How much proof do Republicans need before they stop attacking Planned Parenthood and women across the country? I guess that s stupid of me to ask, after all, how many Benghazi hearings have we had?Perhaps the worst part of all of this is that they really don t care about decreasing the number of abortions in this country. If they did, they d support contraception and comprehensive sex education. If they were really  pro-life  they d fully support things like WIC, food stamps, free medical care and free education for all children. What it all really boils down to is that they loathe women and want to punish us in any way they possibly can   even if that means killing us by destroying a health care organization that provides critical care for millions of men too.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Will Make You Think Twice Before Donating To The Wounded Warrior Project (VIDEO),"When you think about the sacrifice our men and women in uniform have undertaken for our country, one honestly can t put into words how grateful we are. They literally offer up their lives for service. When they come home, they should be treated with the utmost respect and grace, and most certainly should not be taken advantage of. However, one group that has been very vocal and outgoing in their supposed help of wounded veterans coming home seems to be using them to make money for themselves.The Wounded Warrior Project is one of the most visible groups out there raising money for veterans. They have commercials, big events, and publicity. On the surface, they look like a very reputable organization. However, as CBS News investigated, it looks as though they are, quite literally, wasting donation money, and they re not really hiding it either.According to CharityNavigator.org, Wounded Warrior Project only spends 60% of the money they take in on the actual services that help veterans. That may sound pretty great until you realize that other groups like Disabled American Veterans Charitable Service Trust (DAV) utilizes nearly 97% of their funds towards going directly to veterans.According to Army Staff Sergeant Erick Millette, who actually worked as a public speaker for Wounded Warrior project back in 2013: Their mission is to honor and empower wounded warriors, but what the public doesn t see is how they spend their money. Also telling CBS News: You re using our injuries, our darkest days, our hardships, to make money. So you can have these big parties  Let s get a Mexican mariachi band in there, let s get maracas made with [the] WWP logo, put them on every staff member s desk. Let s get it catered and have a big old party Going to a nice fancy restaurant is not team building. Staying at a lavish hotel at the beach here in Jacksonville, and requiring staff that lives in the area to stay at the hotel is not team building. A four-day conference for 500 staff members in Colorado for  team building  had a price tag of around $3 million. That s money that should be going to veterans. They are literally using the money to throw themselves lavish events instead of honor the veterans they are supposedly serving. The entire thing is almost obscene.Wounded Warrior Project s chief executive Steve Nardizzi even admits he runs the charity like a for profit company.  And while they are still raising money for veterans and using that money towards the needs and services of those who need them, please think twice before donating and perhaps donate to another group instead. If they are pulling in over $300 million, but only 60% is going towards veterans, that s nearly $120 million not going to veterans that should be.Wounded Warriors Project s mission is  To honor and empower Wounded Warriors.  However, where s the honor in skimming off the top of all their much-needed money to throw themselves parties all over the country?Watch here to see the CBS News investigation:Featured image: Jacksonville.com",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 How Electable Is Bernie Sanders? A Skeptic’s Response To Robert Reich’s New Pro-Bernie Video,"The great Robert Reich posted a new whiteboard video this week in which he makes a case in support of Bernie Sanders by reacting to claims made by Bernie Sanders skeptics   Democratic voters who aren t convinced Bernie is The Guy. I hasten to underline that while I m a Bernie skeptic, I m not a Hillary Clinton supporter either, though I do intend to vote for either Bernie or Hillary in June s California primary, as well as for the Dem nominee in the general election. Obviously. I d also like to repeat that I think Reich is one of the great left-wing political thinkers of our time. Now that the obligatory qualifiers are out of the way, Reich is off base with several of his counterpoints to Bernie skeptics.Let s take a look.1)  He d never beat Trump or Cruz.  Reich s response suggests that Bernie does indeed have a polling advantage over the Republicans in the general election, more so than Clinton. Unfortunately, Politifact determined that Bernie s version of this assessment is flatly  False.  While Sanders and Clinton each lead Trump, specifically, in the general election according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Sanders trails both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, while Clinton performs slightly better. PPP, meanwhile, shows Sanders losing to Trump, Cruz and Rubio while Clinton defeats all three. Additionally, and this is crucial to understanding the general election differences between the Democratic hopefuls, voters have been following Hillary Clinton for 35 years and yet she still performs better, scandals and all, than Sanders against the GOP in most polls. Sanders, meanwhile, is a relative unknown, so it s too early to tell how he ll do after the GOP begins to relentlessly attack him.2)  Congress would reject his ideas.  Reich reminds us that if Congress remains in the hands of the Republicans, Hillary Clinton wouldn t be able to do much legislatively either. Actually, that s not necessarily true. Clinton s agenda is decidedly more moderate, so while she s sure to run up against significant GOP opposition, it ll be easier for her to shake loose centrist and center-right Republicans, as well as blue dog Democrats who would otherwise oppose Sanders  significantly more leftist ideas.Reich goes on to say that Bernie could bring about a Democratic majority in Congress   if!   his political revolution works out. That s a super-colossal  if.  First of all, no revolution this year will change any gerrymandered districts. Secondly, let s suppose Sanders rides a massive wave of support into the White House with very long coattails. He d need a roughly 70-seat Democratic majority in the Senate to pass his single-payer proposal, for example.Why 70 and not 60? Blue dog Democrats. The blue dogs successfully killed the public option in 2009 and would surely join the Republicans in filibustering Bernie s single-payer legislation, hence the extra 10 votes above and beyond the 60 required to break the filibuster. Realistically, the only thing that might be able to spark a 70-seat majority (the House is totally different story, by the way) is another major financial crisis or another groundbreaking event that d compel voters to choose Democratic candidates across the board.3)  America would never elect a socialist.  Reich makes the off-the-shelf argument that there are many popular socialist programs in the United States, therefore Americans love socialism. Wrong. American voters love socialism, yes, but they don t know they do. And this argument about public schools and roads has been used since forever without successfully nudging very many voters leftward. Trust me, I ve tried it many, many times.Socialism, as we observed when Obama was falsely accused of pushing it in 2009, is still intensely demonized as being the same as communism (it s not) and, in some cases, Republicans have erroneously conflated it with the Nazis, aka  National Socialists.  (Just because  socialism  is in the name of the party founded by Hitler doesn t mean it s really socialist. Likewise, hot dogs don t contain actual dogs.)When the Republicans launch their relentless attack on Sanders  democratic-socialist platform, it ll be another swift-boating like we observed in 2004, only it ll be more relentless. Some undecided moderate voters in swing states   the people who decide elections in the polarized modern era   might be convinced to vote Sanders, but it s a long shot. These are picky, old-fashioned voters in states like Pennsylvania and Missouri. Bottom line: Softening the American voters  negative attitudes about socialism will take much longer than nine months.4)  His single-payer proposal would require raising taxes on the middle class.  I m with Reich and Sanders on this one. It s a bogus argument, pushed by skeptics and Hillary supporters alike. According to Sanders  numbers, middle class families would pay less per year for healthcare and therefore end up saving money in spite of a modest tax hike. The trouble, however, is getting Congress to support a tax hike on the middle class. See also #2.5)  His plan for free college tuition would mean colleges would be run by government rules.  I haven t heard any Democratic skeptics saying this, but I might ve just missed them. Nevertheless, I again agree with Sanders and Reich here. There s nothing in Sanders  proposal, or Obama s two-year-college plan, for that matter, showing that colleges would have to kowtow to the federal government.6)  He s too old.  Reich believes 74 is the new 64 and, honestly, I m not concerned about Bernie s age at all. As long as his would-be vice presidential nominee is strong, it s a non-issue. However, this will be an area the Republicans will use to attack Sanders, but it won t matter all that much. John McCain s age was only modestly relevant due to his battle with skin cancer. Sanders, on the other hand, seems quite energetic and healthy.So, all told, three of Reich s counterpoints to skeptics aren t particularly strong, while one counterpoint against middle class tax hikes is directed at hardline pro-Hillary people (not mere skeptics) as well as Republicans, and the final two are counterpoints to arguments I haven t really heard coming from Bernie skeptics.All in all, it still seems like a Sanders victory and a subsequent Sanders presidency would be a long shot. Not impossible, but risky from the standpoint of overcoming significant electoral and political hurdles, as well as the current status of the (obscenely gerrymandered) Congress. Democrats ultimately have to decide whether Sanders  agenda is worth risking a possible Republican victory in November.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Bernie skepticsHow to respond to Bernie skeptics?

 Fox CEO Desperately Begs Donald Trump’s Wife And Daughter To Get Him Back In Debate (TWEET),"Fox News and Republican front-runner Donald Trump have been in a strange power struggle ever since Trump decided to boycott the network s Thursday night GOP debate because the business mogul can t stand to be in the same room as Fox host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly.Clearly shaken up since Kelly got the best of him the first time she moderated the Republican debate, Trump has decided to make the GOP lineup look like even more of a circus by skipping the debate. So far the network is standing by Kelly, stating that it wouldn t give into  terrorizations toward any of our employees.  But it appears that Fox might not be genuine, as it is still secretly trying to get Trump back in by using two secret weapons   Trump s wife and daughter.On Wednesday morning, Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough exposed Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for trying to get Ivanka and Melania Trump to change The Donald s mind about skipping the debate, but Trump refused to speak with him and insisted that he d only speak with network owner Rupert Murdoch. Scarborough stated: Per our sources, Roger Ailes was calling Ivanka, he was trying to get in touch with Trump, he was calling Melania, people that he s got a good relationship with, they love Roger. They have a great respect for him. But at this point, Trump s only gonna talk to Rupert, and they re going to figure it out. In response to Trump s childish boycott, there s been an outpouring of controversy in the media, even from Kelly s side. Earlier this week, Kelly welcomed liberal filmmaker Michael Moore onto her show, where the documentarian mocked Trump and congratulated the Fox host for scaring Trump out of the debate   a task that not even his Republican rivals could pull off. Moore said,  In all seriousness, let me say this, you ve done something that Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio, Cruz   none of them have been able to do. Which is to, essentially, frighten him. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to bash Kelly on social media, signaling that his immature, mostly one-sided feud with her is far from over. Solidifying Kelly s point during the first GOP debate that Trump had zero respect for women, Trump tweeted:TwitterFeatured image via Donald Trump Facebook",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Lies About Tithing In Interview With Christian Journalist (VIDEO),"The Book of Leviticus is often cited by conservative  Christians  as examples of biblical law the nation must obey. Ted Cruz, however, doesn t practice what he preaches.According to Leviticus 19:11: Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another. But that is exactly what the Texas Tea Party Senator did during a face to face interview with David Brody on the Christian Broadcasting Network.The interview addressed Cruz s past failure to tithe, an obligation important to the evangelical community in which Christians are required to give at least ten percent of their income to the church as set by the Bible. It s especially important to the pastors in the movement who need those hard-earned dollars to enrich themselves.And if Cruz wants the support of evangelical voters, you would think he would be honest and explain himself satisfactorily, or at the very least, beg for forgiveness. But not only did Cruz tell a fabricated story to cover his ass, he did so right in the face of a Christian journalist and all the Christians watching. Listen on the question of tithing, all of us are on a faith journey, and I will readily admit that I have not been as faithful in this aspect of my walk as I should have been,  Cruz said. That article focuses on ten years ago. We don t have the ability to go back and change what occurred ten years ago when Heidi and I were newly married and we d just started a family. But at the end of the day, being a Christian is not about holding yourself out as righteous. It s about beginning with the understanding that we are flawed sinners and we are saved not by deeds but by Christ s redemption. I am grateful that God is a patient and forgiving God and this area, as in many areas of my life I am working to do a better job walking in my faith. Here s the video via CBN.Mediaite s Tommy Christopher, who grew up in a fundamentalist household, fact-checked Cruz s story and discovered that it is nothing more than a tall tale.The story he references, first of all, doesn t focus on  ten years ago,  it covers Ted s tax returns for a five-year period that ended five years ago. From 2006 to 2010, Ted Cruz made $5,064,248.00 and gave $44,000.00 to charity. That s 0.86% of his income, or about 8.6% of a tithe. In 2006, when Cruz made  only  $350 grand, he and Heidi weren t  newly married,  they d been married for five years, and they weren t  starting a family,  they didn t have kids until 2008.In other words, the story Ted Cruz gave about he and his wife being something of a struggling couple with mouths to feed is bullshit. He made more money in five years than most Americans do in a lifetime, yet he couldn t be bothered to share his wealth with the church community he has been aggressively pandering to over the years. If Cruz had followed the general rule, his tithing would have totaled $500,000 over those five years.Once again, Ted Cruz gets caught being a liar and a total hypocrite.Featured Image: Nation of Change ",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Veteran’s Letter Thanking Bernie Sanders For Voting Against Iraq War Goes Viral (VIDEO),"A U.S. Marine s letter to Bernie Sanders that expressed the utmost gratitude for the Senator s position on not sending U.S. troops to Iraq has recently gone viral, and it s easy to see why.The letter surfaced on Tuesday morning, when Reddit user CharlieDarwinsFather created a post titled An open letter to Bernie Sanders from a Veteran of the Iraq War  in the subreddit SandersforPresident, where many of Sanders  supporters gather to share news about the Democratic presidential candidate. The letter s author had been based in North Carolina and had served in combat during the second battle of Fallujah in Iraq during 2005, 2006 and 2007.Having lived through those battles as a young adult and seeing the short and long-term effects that war had on his fellow marines, the author thanked the Vermont Senator with great sincerity for opposing the Iraq War, and said he wished that America had more politicians like Sanders who weren t afraid to fight for real peace. In his letter, the U.S. Marine wrote: Senator Sanders,I want to thank you. I want to thank you for exercising sound judgement even when everyone around you was beating the war drums.See I fought in the streets of Fallujah, Iraq. I saw more blood and death than any 19 year old ever should. The amount of friends I ve lost to war will likely be surpassed by the amount of friends I ve since lost to suicide.I know first hand the moral cost of war. One of the most painful truths that I must go through life with is that I fought in an unjust and unfounded war. While my intentions were good and I fought hard for the men to my left and to my right, and while I thought what I was doing what was right for the people of Iraq- I was wrong.You knew this. You knew this before we went to war and you fought, and you spoke truth to your peers and though your words largely fell on deaf ears, I am truly heartened to know that I now have a chance to vote for a man who exercised sound and moral judgement when the war drums were beating the loudest.I have a son. He is only one and a half years old but someday he will be 18 and I fear that if we continue to elect the same establishment politicians, he too will face the same decision that I did, and he too will go off to fight in an endless quagmire and that he too will come home, broken, and never fully returned or worse- never come home at all.So thank you, Senator Sanders, for being of sound mind and judgement. Thank you for being the only voice in this race that does not want to continue this legacy of warfare. Thank you for being the only voice that is and has been standing up for those of us that fought in these misguided wars. Thank you for giving me hope for a peaceful future. Sincerely, A U.S. Marine   0311 Operation Iraqi FreedomThe letter has gone viral, and it s easy to see why as Sanders  anti-establishment approach continues to win over Americans across the country. Now more than ever, we re becoming more aware of the affects that war has on our veterans, and just how common homelessness, suicide and mental illnesses like PTSD are.This letter is especially noteworthy because Sanders recently pointed out   during Monday s Democratic Town Hall on CNN   that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had supported the war while Sanders rallied against sending troops to Iraq because he was afraid it would create more power for extremists (which he was right about).Sanders has been passionate about preserving peace for a long time   as this video of Sanders giving a passionate speech in 2002 reveals:Sanders, who is the former Chairman and a current member of the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee, continues to fight for America s veterans and has made it a crucial part of his campaign. This mission is spelled out right on Sanders  website: Sen. Sanders believes that just as planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war, so is taking care of the men and women who we sent off to fight the war. It includes caring for the spouses and children who have to rebuild their lives after the loss of a loved one. It includes caring for the hundreds of thousands of veterans with multiple amputations or loss of eyesight, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. It includes veterans who are having difficulty keeping jobs in order to pay their bills, and it includes the terrible tragedy of veterans committing suicide. And regardless of whether or not you think America should go to war, it s impossible to argue with Sanders when he says: While serious people can have legitimate differences about when our country should go to war, there should never be a debate whether we fulfill the promises made to the men and women who served this country in the military. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to provide the best quality care to those who have put their lives on the line to defend us.

 MUST-SEE: Protester Hurls Tomatoes At Donald Trump During Iowa Rally (VIDEO),"During a Wednesday rally at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, a protester hurled tomatoes at Donald Trump after the Republican presidential frontrunner referred to Bernie Sanders as a  communist. In a news release, officials said Andrew Joseph Alemao, 28, was observed throwing two tomatoes at Trump, the real estate mogul and front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.Alemao has been charged with disorderly conduct, a simple misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $625 or 30 days in prison. He is currently being held in the Johnson County Jail.He was taken into custody by the Secret Service and the UIPD after throwing the tomatoes, the release said.At least three Sanders supporters were apparently escorted by security out of the rally, with Trump shouting,  Get  em outta here!  to the cheers of his fans in the crowd.Not one of the tomatoes actually hit Trump.But it shouldn t matter.Frankly, regardless of how vile, obnoxious and ultimately dangerous Trump might be, there s simply no excuse for anyone to engage in physical violence against him, or any public figures for that matter. It s childish, unacceptable behavior   especially for liberals who ought to know better. If activists are incapable of making an argument using words, evidence and reason, they should figure out how it s done, rather than embarrassing the rest of us (especially other Bernie supporters) by lashing out like an infant who refuses to eat and hurls his food at the wall in protest.The same goes for pie attacks against William Kristol and Ann Coulter, or red paint attacks against Condoleezza Rice. In fact, at the time, I wrote something similar when a protester attacked George W. Bush by throwing shoes at the former president. Feel free to applaud these kinds of attacks   I m sure it s cathartic   but know that by encouraging such atrociously violent, kneejerk behavior, you re only encouraging more of it.And, so, don t be surprised when conservative activists retaliate with the same thing against liberal leaders and celebrities, not unlike how a pissed off wingnut attacked Hillary Clinton back in 2014. Put another way: it s probably not difficult for Trump supporters to worm their way into Democratic rallies.Just to be clear: it s entirely possible that the tomato-tosser wasn t a Bernie supporter at all.

" Sorry Republicans, LaVoy Finicum Didn’t Have His Hands Up When He Was Shot","As much as many conservatives would like to believe that the Bundy militia were merely innocent victims of the government, a picture is emerging that makes it clear the now-deceased LaVoy Finicum intentionally provoked a reaction from the law enforcement officers after trying to flee arrest.Finicum was part of a large group of the Bundy militants who were stopped by the FBI en route to yet another propaganda appearance in a nearby town. Rather than simply let the group go unimpeded, the authorities finally decided to act. It was a long time coming. The group had occupied a federal wildlife refuge for over a month, and with no end in sight and violent, paranoid extremists flooding into the region the situation was getting more out of hand by the moment.Sadly, it was not entirely surprising to learn that it was Finicum who resisted arrest. He had frequently claimed that he would rather die in a shootout than be arrested. Whether that was his intention on the night of his death is unclear, but his hostility towards law enforcement and his paranoia certainly contributed.Not everyone is convinced, however. Almost immediately after Finicum s death was announced, right-wing sympathizers began spinning a conspiracy that he had been executed with his hands up while his fellow  patriots  watched. The myth wasn t relegated to the backwaters of the internet, either. Soon, even sitting Republican politicians and Bundy s own Facebook page were repeating the tale.Michele Fiore, an anti-government conservative who   hypocritically  happens to work as a state representative in Nevada, repeated the lie to her Twitter followers.My heart & prays go out to LaVoy Finicum's family he was just murdered with his hands up in Burns OR.Ryan Bundy has been shot in the arm  Michele Fiore (@VoteFiore) January 27, 2016Jim Hoft, a conservative blogger who has been labeled the Stupidest Man on the Internet for consistently posting misinformation, ran with the story, repeating Cliven Bundy s baseless claim: LaVoy Finicum was murdered. Cold-blooded murder. They shot him with his hands up. Unfortunately for this convenient narrative, witnesses of the arrest say Finicum was the provoker. Melvin Lee was behind the Bundy convoy during the arrest. He recounts how Finicum tried to flee, and the wound up charging the officers. There happened to be some arguments between the guys in the truck. Somehow they got Ryan Payne pulled out of the truck, apparently. LaVoy had took off   he ended up hitting a snowbank, I guess, trying to get around the blockade. After he hit that snowbank, he came out of that truck and he charged at the law enforcement, as I understand it. A bodyguard of Ammon s said that Finicum crashed his car, then jumped out and began charging at the agents. He also concluded that this was entirely in Finicum s character. He was not on his knees, none of that. He was none of that nonsense. You know, that was a miscommunication on somebody else s part. But he went after them. He charged them. You know, LaVoy was very passionate about what he was doing up here. Finicum is said to have been radicalized by the Bundy s during the Nevada ranch showdown. In an interview, he once said that Cliven asked him to be the first  cowboy  to show up to what would become the standoff. I said Cliven, don t let them take your cows,  Finicum recalled in an interview with OPB.  He says saddle up your horse and be here early in the morning. I was the first cowboy to show up in the dark. In fall 2015, Finicum followed in Bundy s footsteps and chose to stop complying with his lease contract with the Bureau of Land Management, in spite of a long positive relationship with the agency.His death was the culmination of years of right-wing paranoia being relentlessly hurled at him from conservative politicians and media figures. They exploited his anxieties and played on his fears until eventually he decided to take action. There s no question that Finicum died believing he was in a struggle with a tyrannical government. His charge at authorities confirms that. Perhaps that is why the right-wing so desperately wants to prove that his hands were up. If he was innocent, than so are they.But he wasn t.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Two-Thirds Of Mayors In America Support Raising The Minimum Wage,"Republicans in Congress may not support raising the minimum wage, but most mayors in America say they want to do exactly that.A Politico survey reached out to 73 mayors in cities across the country asking them if they would consider raising the minimum wage like had been done in Seattle, Los Angeles, and New York City, all three of which approved a $15 minimum wage over the last two years.In a stunning result, 65 percent of the mayors surveyed said they would definitely consider raising the minimum wage. 37 percent said they would consider raising wages as high as $15 an hour while 28 percent said they consider raising wages but not quite as high as $15, suggesting they would support President Obama s call to raise the minimum wage to at least $10 an hour.29 percent of the mayors are like the Republicans who control Congress, in that they refuse to consider the idea of raising the minimum wage at all.Income inequality and poverty ranked as serious issues among the mayors with 80 percent identifying both as great challenges to overcome.Of course, raising the minimum wage would do a lot to close the income gap and provide families with more resources. And because families would spend that extra money, it would be a huge boost to the local economy. It would also help Americans pay for housing, which is getting much more difficult now. In addition, it would save the federal government millions of dollars because higher wages would mean less people needing federal aid such as food stamps to get by.Sadly, efforts to raise the minimum wage have been largely left to cities as Republicans in control of state legislatures and Congress refuse to take up the issue so as not to anger their corporate masters, despite the fact that studies from both sides of the aisle support wage hikes.Indeed, Republicans would rather eliminate the minimum wage all together so that corporate CEOs can pay their employees slave wages that would make America look more like it did during the Gilded Age, when workers were kept in poverty due to low wages, and the top 2 percent controlled more than a third of the nation s wealth.And once again, unless the issue of low wages and income inequality is addressed in a meaningful way, America will be repeating history, which means that the middle class will cease to exist and workers will struggle to keep their families and themselves afloat as the wealthy use their money to buy politicians to ensure that nothing ever changes.Raising the minimum wage and tying it to the rate of inflation has never been more important to achieve. And as Seattle, Los Angeles, and New York City have demonstrated, it can be done. But if we want it to happen across the entire nation, the 2016 Election would be a great place to start. Republicans think they can keep forcing Americans to work longer and harder with inadequate pay while they continue to make $174,000 a year working only for 110 days out of 365.Clearly, there is something terribly wrong when lawmakers can raise their own taxpayer paid salaries at will while they continue to reject the pleas of working people across the country to have their own efforts rewarded with a much needed wage increase.Featured Image: PR Watch",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

They must have missed the part where the police showed up in full military gear like an invading army.Image courtesy of The Feminist WireThere were tanks in Ferguson. Fucking tanks against unarmed protesters. TANKS! Meanwhile, the armed militants in Oregon promised to kill anyone that tried to arrest them and they were allowed to hold fucking press conferences. Clearly, Bundy and his terrorists got the shaft.But it s OK! The White Crusaders at the not-at-all-racist Stormfront know who to blame! The Jews and America s anti-white hatred, of course:__________________Adolf Hitlist s S.O.F. (Statements Of Fact)1. The Jews want a world where life is lived in fear, and cowardice is how you survive. 2. Multi-racialism breeds racism. How can you hate minorities if you don t know any. 3. Trying to fight Communism with Democracy is like trying to stab someone who is shooting at you. 4. Black isn t the opposite of White! Jewish is!On the contrary, you should read the report that the USGS published about the area. I think the Jewmerican regime wanted to push everyone out so they can mine those metals, render it uninhabitable to whites at the same time, and sell the metals to China, Israel and anyone else who wants to harm, or kill us. They have driven everyone else off their land, Bundy was the last. Now we will see that the feds have no intention to leave that lands as a refuge for wildlife.I m furious. Absolutely enraged. This is a direct, frontal assault on White America by the hostile, occupation government in Washington, D.C. The authorities shoot and kill a White man for exercising civil rights while blacks, browns and their liberal enablers get protected and publicly lauded for exercising the same civil rights.A White patriot in Oregon gets a bullet. Non-white looters in Baltimore get  room to destroy.  The National Guard stands idly by and watches while blacks burn Ferguson. Politicians of both the GOP and Democrat varieties praise the non-white  protesters  causing chaos in cities all across America because, ya know,  Black Lives Matter.   White lives, however, are apparently expendable when the federal government wants to make a point about who s in charge.What s wrong with this picture, kinsmen?The obvious question to ask now is how many cops will be assassinated over the death of a right wing terrorist? Unlike the Black Lives Matter movement, right wing extremists ARE violent. Incredibly so. They re consumed with visions of a race war to  take back their country  from all of Those People and see anyone with a badge (or darker skin) as the enemy. The last time the FBI killed a right wing militant, they went on a rampage that ended with the Oklahoma City Bombing and dozens of dead children. The right is far more radicalized now and violence is inevitable.Will we continue to ignore right wing extremists and pretend that there isn t a burgeoning insurrection fueled by racism in America? Or will we finally start treating them like the terrorists they are only after the next federal building is blown up?Featured image via Facebook.",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michael Moore Destroys Trump On Megyn Kelly’s Show (VIDEO),"Michael Moore made on appearance on the Megyn Kelly s show in time to mock Trump for boycotting the debates scheduled for Thursday night. Trump has thrown a hissy fit over what he says is Kelly s unfair treatment of him.  What s he afraid of? I m sitting here, I don t feel any fear,  said Moore. Speaking directly to Trump, Moore said: Donald, come now. Come sit beside me, I ll hold your hand, she s fine. She s fine. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR8s32UCTd4] It was fun watching Moore revel in the glee of Trump and Fox News not getting along. He also enjoyed watching Kelly get under Trump s skin. He said: You have done something that Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio, Cruz, none of them have been able to do, which is to essentially frighten him, make him run, shut him down. Everyone s tried to do this for months and you did it! This is true. All of the candidates have been lame in standing up to Trump. His unprecedented domination of the debates has seen him not only lead the Republican pack for the nomination, but he has at times obliterated his opponents, especially the squirmy Jeb Bush.Yet, he chose to ditch the debates at crunch time. Moore said: To get elected President in this country, you have to come on this network. You have to play ball with this network. Donald Trump today said  I m not playing with this network.  That s an historic moment, and it s going to be interesting to see where the real power is. Trump thinks he doesn t need Fox News. I think Fox News probably has something else to say about that. Fox News and Donald Trump make a perfect couple. Let s hope the marriage made in hell continues to disintegrate.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump’s Words To Megyn Kelly In 2011 Just Came Back To Haunt Him, Big Time (VIDEO)","Donad Trump s words to Megan Kelly in a 2011 interview about the Republican debates are coming back to haunt him big time today, and reveal the real reason he s backing out. He s scared of her.Trump was railing at the quality of debate moderators at the time, stating that they were unaware of the big issues and failing to grill candidates sufficiently. Kelly asked: Do you really think you re a better moderator than I am? To which Trump responded: No, I could never beat you. That wouldn t even be close. That would be no contest. You have done a great job, by the way, and I mean it. Flash forward a few years, and when Kelly applied that no-nonsense moderation to Trump himself, he didn t feel quite so complimentary. In fact, he fully freaked out.First he began hate-tweeting her.Then he claimed she must have been on her period, on national television, in a bid to undermine her.And after refusing to end his relentless vendetta against her, now he is set to boycott Fox s Republican debate on Thursday night. He is literally unable to face Kelly. While happy to rail against her in the media, and launch playground bully-style hate-tweets at her on social media   when it comes to going up against her face to face, he s bailing.If Trump cannot face a few tough questions from Megan Kelly, how on earth would he handle tough talks with Putin, or Iran, or China or even Congress? The trust fund tycoon has lived the sort of pampered life where his cash normally protects him from dealing with those who hurt his ego or un-nerve him. As President of the United States, a far tougher skin and sureness of character is required   neither of which Donald Trump possesses.Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Terry Schiavo’s Husband Is LIVID That Jeb Bush’s Super PAC Used Her Image In This Ad (VIDEO),"The lowest point in Jeb Bush s political career has to be the heartbreaking case of Terry Schiavo. Terry was pronounced brain-dead in 1990 after her husband Michael found her unconscious in their Florida home. Terry s parents, holding on for hope, refused to allow her to be removed from life support.A long and grueling legal battle ensued, with the courts eventually siding with Michael, on advice from doctors who confirmed that Terry was, in all sentient manner, gone and not coming back. It was time to let Terry go.In stepped Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, and his  all life is sacred  political crusade to  save  a woman who had been gone for 15 years and was only alive through autonomic function and a breathing tube. Jeb took the case back to court, had legislation passed and even signed an executive order to keep Terry Schiavo s body functioning, denying her husband the closure he so desperately deserved.In the end, Terry was finally allowed to rest, despite the best efforts of  pro-life  Jeb Bush and the conservative right, who believe all life is sacred, except for the 21 people executed in Florida s death chamber under his watch.Now, 26 years after Michael Schiavo lived what would be anyone s worst nightmare, Jeb Bush s Right to Rise Super PAC is releasing a new campaign ad that spotlight s the tragedy of Terry Schiavo by using her image as they talk about  protecting life. Michael  is not happy. In an interview with Politico, Schiavo said that he found the ad  disgusting,  adding that it  sounds like a last-ditch effort to get the right-wing constituents.  How right he is. Bush, long considered the favorite to win the GOP nomination, has faltered in the polls, especially with the conservative base who favor lunatic Ted Cruz and sociopath Donald Trump. Jeb Bush s political aspirations, however, don t make using a family s tragedy OK.Schiavo added: Using his disgraceful intervention in our family s private trauma to advance his political career shows that he has learned nothing. He s proud of the fact that he used the machinery of government to keep a person alive through extraordinary artificial means   contrary to the orders of the court that were based on the court s determination, made over six years of litigation, that doing so would be against her wishes. What the campaign video shows is that if he ever got his hands on the power of government again, he would do the same thing again, maybe next time to your family. Extremely wise words from a man who has seen first hand what a Jeb Bush can do if given any kind of power.Watch the despicable ad below:Featured image by Gage Skidmore",News,"January 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" If You Vote Hillary In 2016, Look Who May Be Headed To The Supreme Court","Hillary Clinton has revealed the person she would  love  to appoint to the U.S. Supreme Court if she becomes president in 2016 is none other than current President Barack Obama.The prospect of a Justice Obama reared it s head during a campaign event in Deocorah, Iowa on Tuesday. A voter asked Mrs. Clinton is she would consider appointing Obama to SCOTUS if she were made President, and it put a huge smile on her face. She told the 450-strong crowd: Wow what a great idea I love that! Wow!  Adding later, I mean, he s brilliant, and he can set forth an argument, and he was a law professor. So he has all the credentials. Now we do have to get a Democratic Senate to get him confirmed so you re going to have to help me on that, OK? This isn t the first time that a future place on the Supreme Court for Mr. Obama has been raised. Sadly, he was a little cold on the idea, put to him by The New Yorker in 2014: I love the law, intellectually,  he said at the time. I love nutting out these problems, wrestling with these arguments. I love teaching. I miss the classroom and engaging with students. But I think being a Justice is a little bit too monastic for me. Particularly after having spent six years and what will be eight years in this bubble, I think I need to get outside a little bit more. But who knows? Once he s had a chance to get some quality time with the Obama women, played a lot of golf, and wound down from the presidency   that hunger that drove him to the White House might propel Obama onto the Supreme Court.What is certain is that the prospect of Justice Obama is going to strike fear into the heart of every gun-loving, woman-hating, gay-bashing, conservative in the country.

 Bundy Militant Vows To Die In Gunfight With Feds: ‘You Guys Are Going To Watch Me Die LIVE’ (VIDEO),"Many of the terrorists who were participating in the armed occupation of a federal bird sanctuary in Oregon turned tail and fled after the FBI arrested their leaders and fellow  freedom fighters, killing the spokesman for the group of heavily-armed right-wing extremists,  Tarp Man  LaVoy Finicum, as he opened fire on law enforcement.Arrested were leaders Ryan and Ammon Bundy, right-wing internet radio host Pete Santilli,  Brian Cavalier, Shawna Cox and Ryan Payne, John Ritzheimer (who had fled home shortly before the crackdown to visit his family), and Joseph O Shaugnessy. Authorities say that everyone but Ryan Bundy and LaVoy Finicum cooperated. Bundy suffered a minor gunshot wound, and Finicum lost his life for his cause   something he recently said he would do rather than allow himself to be arrested.One of those men, an ISIS supporter who joined the Bundy clan as their  resident IT guy, decided to livestream from within the Bundy  militia  compound. David Fry confirmed that children had, indeed, been removed from Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. This is a good thing because of what he said next. Looks like this is it. This is gonna be the final stand here guys,  Fry says, asking people in the chat to say  Happy America.  His mood was joyful as he spoke of dying in a blaze of gunfire. Fry explains that the holdouts are surrounded and that a lot of the  rest of the guys  had  tucked tail and ran. We re not here to fight guys, we re here to defend,  he says to his audience.  I m defending my base. This is our base.  During the stream, some of his militants told their families they loved them and said goodbye, with one asking that viewers  tell my daughter why I died.  Fry turns the camera on himself: We died fighting for our Constitution. The law of liberty. You guys think this is fake? You guys think this is fake? Here s me, here s  ISIS boy,  here s uh,  Hitler acolyte,  and you guys missed it. They were actually calling me a Satan worshipper not too long ago. So I got called every name out there, and here I am   I m all boogied out and ready to go, and you guys are going to watch me die live.

 Terrorist Jon Ritzheimer Uses Sobbing Daughters To Beg For Money Before Turning Himself In,"Jon Ritzheimer, infamous hater of Muslims and one of the terrorists responsible for the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, managed to escape the arrests made Tuesday by federal agents of ringleader Ammon Bundy and his band of right-wing nutjobs.According to a post on his Facebook page, Ritzheimer had returned to his home in Arizona to visit with his family:That was, of course, the real reason Ritzheimer was part of the occupation to begin with: Money. After his armed protest of a mosque in Arizona failed to bring in the $10 million he said he needed for  security upgrades,  Ritzheimer began appearing at idiotic  movements  all over the place. His last was the Bundy fiasco in Oregon. Ritzheimer has proven he will go out of his way to find a reason to beg for money, and this was no different. Before turning himself in, he released this video on his Facebook page, along with yet another plea for help for  legal fees  and for help for his family, who he clearly can t support.Ritzheimer has proven he will go out of his way to find a reason to beg for money, and this was no different. Before turning himself in, he released this video on his Facebook page.

 Conspiracy Time: Why Trump Thinks Fox News Is Working For Hillary (TWEET),"As part of the Donald Trump campaign s public meltdown over the upcoming Republican presidential debate on Fox News,  senior adviser  Daniel Scavino Jr. made a bizarre allegation on social media.According to Scavino on Twitter, Fox News is feuding with Trump because it is apparently in bed with the Clintons?Fox News Corp. has donated over $3,000,000.00 to the Clinton's. Makes you wonder what goes on behind the scenes . pic.twitter.com/d7Z0aWRdO6  Daniel Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) January 27, 2016Yes, you read that right. Fox News Channel, the network that was launched in 1996 as part of an effort to undermine the Clinton presidency, tireless boosters of George W. Bush and the cheerleaders of efforts to delegitimize President Obama, are part of the vast left wing conspiracy!The temper tantrum from Team Trump about right-wing anchor Megyn Kelly s participation in the debate reached a fever pitch on Tuesday, with Trump issuing a press release claiming that he would not be involved in the debate. Trump is apparently still upset that Kelly, who has been the source of a series of attacks and conspiracy theories against the left, pointed out his misogynistic comments to figures like comedian Rosie O Donnell in the first debate televised on Fox.As is the case with so many of the Trump campaign s nonsensical assertions, this one is a belly-buster. Fox News has been the most reliable ally of the right in its campaign to take down the Clintons. Not a single assertion or crackpot conspiracy about the Clintons hasn t found its way to Fox News is in some shape.Fox has been the network of the Benghazi conspiracy theories, again and again pushing the disproven lie that Secretary Clinton or President Obama issued a stand down order for help when the U.S. compound in Libya was under attack.Fox was part of the team that brought you the Obama birth certificate conspiracy, and who for years broadcast Glenn Beck and his fevered dreams about how Obama was the second coming of Adolph Hitler.Now in the middle of a temper tantrum, in between attacking latinos and promoting the work of white power activists, the Trump campaign has decided that if it is at odds with Fox News, Fox is in league with the Clintons?And this is the campaign currently leading the Republican race for the presidency.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ammon Bundy Arrested, Ryan Bundy And ‘Tarp Man’ Shot After Confrontation With Police (VIDEO)","The ammosexual terrorists currently staging an armed occupation in a federal bird sanctuary in Oregon are standing their ground amid reports that Ammon Bundy and three of their compatriots have been arrested. Monumental imbecile, godawful radio host, and wannabe journalist Pete Santilli s live feed cut out as he stood in front of a hospital near the Malheur Wildlife Refuge to announce that Bundy and others had been arrested, and two had been shot.Santilli says that one of the Faithful received a phone call from the FBI: The word is right now that everyone   and this is the message that they wanted to convey, and if anybody s watching this stream at the refuge   the FBI has conveyed a message: you are free to go, and you must leave now. The confirmation is as follows,  Santilli said.  It is reported that Ammon Bundy is in custody by police. The roads are on lockdown reports of shots being fired and the report that we re getting right now is that two people have been shot.   WRGB reports that one of the militants is dead: Officials said it all began with a traffic stop while Bundy and some of his followers were en route to a community meeting in John Day, about 70 miles away.Shots were fired after FBI agents, Oregon State troopers and other law enforcement agencies made the stop. CNN reports its unclear who fired first.Details of the arrest and confrontation remain unknown, but charges are pending related to the group s 25-day takeover of the wildlife refuge.According to Oregon Live, Ryan Bundy suffered a minor gunshot wound, and Santilli s staff reports that  Tarp Man  Lavoy Finicum, who once warned that he would take death over jail, was also struck by gunfire. The name of the deceased has not been officially released. However, Assemblywoman Michele Fiore says that Finicum is, indeed, dead: If in fact Ammon Bundy has been taken into custody,  he added,  It s not a good thing. Certainly not a good thing.  During the stream, Santilli received a phone call and the stream cut out shortly afterward.  According to Oregon Live, aside from Ammon and Ryan Bundy, the following were arrested:Ryan W. Payne, 32, of Anaconda, Mont., Brian Cavalier, 44, of Bunkerville, Nevada, and Shawna J. Cox, 59, of Kanab, Utah.They have all been charged with conspiracy to impede federal officers, a felony.It is unclear if the remaining domestic terrorists will go home, but it seems unlikely. Many have pledged to fight to the death, with the group begging for clean underwear, tampons, and snacks to survive a long stay at the refuge.  What this means for the occupation remains to be known, but we sincerely hope that Y all Qaeda recognize defeat, give up peacefully, and slink home with their tails between their legs before lives are lost.Watch Santilli report the arrest below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-jYxOSnWY&w=560&h=315]The militants back at  base  are backing down, calling for  all patriots  to join them in defending their illegally-occupied land:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RoeNxjaShk]Militant Jon Ritzheimer posted a video of himself saying goodbye to his children.

" Trump Won’t Be At The Fox News Debate, Underoos Officially In Wad (VIDEO)","Well, it looks like Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is throwing his biggest temper tantrum yet. For days now, he s been complaining about the upcoming GOP debate on Fox News and the fact that Megyn Kelly will be moderating it. He even went to Twitter and Instagram to poll his followers about if he should even bother attending. Fox News responded, pretty much calling him a wimp, saying: Sooner or later Donald Trump, even if he s president, is going to have to learn that he doesn t get to pick the journalists   we re very surprised he s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly. However, Trump doesn t care if they call him a scaredy-cat or not, he s now completely pulling out of Thursday s Fox debate. Earlier in the day on Tuesday, he told the press: I probably won t be doing the debate. I m going to have something else in Iowa. Now Trump s refusal to attend has been confirmed by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who told Washington Post: He s definitely not participating in the Fox News debate. His word is his bond. Apparently, he s boycotting the debate and instead holding an event elsewhere in Iowa to raise money for veterans, including the group Wounded Warriors. Trump said of Fox News: They re dealing with someone who s a little bit different. They can t toy with me like they toy with everybody else. And here s Trump s latest post on Instagram: Campaign Statement on Fox News Debate: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-campaign-statement-on-fox-news-debateA photo posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Jan 26, 2016 at 6:16pm PST The hotel magnate is clearly extremely upset that Fox chose Megyn Kelly to moderate the debate, someone who he s had an ongoing heated kerfuffle. However, Fox News is clearly the one who will have the last laugh, as they told Mediaite earlier: We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings. And Fox News  Roger Ailes stands behind Megyn Kelly, saying: Megyn Kelly is an excellent journalist and the entire network stands behind her   she will absolutely be on the debate stage on Thursday night. They re not about to get bullied around by Donald Trump and his obviously fragile ego, as well as his inability to be criticized to his face.So, to Trump, you go and hold your event. Hopefully, you raise a lot of money for veterans. However, if you want to be leader of the free world, sometimes you re going to have to do things you don t agree with, so maybe this proves now, more than ever, that you belong nowhere near the Oval Office. The debate, and the world, will go on.

 FL Hearing Goes FULL RACIST: We Must Ban Abortion To Save ‘White Culture’ (VIDEO),"Florida Republicans have sponsored a bill that would literally ban all abortions except in cases where the woman s health and/or life is threatened by the pregnancy. If passed, the bill, HB 865, would make sure any and all abortion providers would spend up to 30 years in prison for defying the law.As if that weren t bad enough, the hearing for the bill featured a horrible racist by the name of Paul, who said that  white culture  was under threat due to legal abortion. The legislators in the chamber allowed this man to go on an absolutely racist rant, in which he said, in part: We see the destruction we re bringing upon ourself as a nation. The Muslims, they don t kill the babies. Paul then went on to say that white people do not live on an island  and  the Mexicans  breed faster because they don t believe in abortions. Then this absolutely crazy man went all in with a mix of nutty religion and disgusting racism: Their race is through the breeding of having families, children. And what happens is once you see the condition we re in, we re destroying ourselves and destroying our families, we ve accepted something in this country that the Creator   that we re going to pay for. You don t see us as a culture, as a white culture, pushing this agenda of abortion, women outside the home not having babies, everybody getting more and more and more? We re a sick nation and if we don t repent then the people leading our government, you are legislating morality by the laws you pass. You are legislating religion and morality by the laws that we pass as a people, and it s destroying us as a nation. After thanking the chamber for letting him speak, Paul reminded them to repent once more: It s either repent or perish America. That s the way it is. The scary part of this is the fact that the bill passed the committee with a whopping 8-3 vote. So, in other words, Florida is about to go back to the desperation of the pre- Roe v. Wade days,when women were dying in back alley chop shops and from self-administered coat hanger abortions.Watch the video of Paul s racist rant on this scary bill below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" THIS: After The Blizzard, Only One Group Of People Showed Up To Run The Senate","A blizzard fell upon Washington D.C. over this past weekend, basically shutting down the whole city, including the U.S. Capitol building. It left many people digging out for days, and some may still be trying to find their cars under the mounds of snow. However, not everyone took this as an excuse to sit at home. Some folks chose to put on their warm coats, lace up their boots, and get to where they needed to be. After all, the country needs them.Now, this may or may not be indicative of the future, but it seems women were they only ones to trudge through the snow to get to the Capitol to get back to work. Yes, women, at least in the Senate chamber.And because she was one of the few people who decided to show up to work on Tuesday, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (I-AK) took over the job of handling Senate business. And as she did so, she stated: As we convene this morning, you look around the chamber, the presiding officer is female. All of our parliamentarians are female. Our floor managers are female. All of our pages are female. Adding: Something is genuinely different   and something is genuinely fabulous. Murkowski was there alongside Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) who was exercising control over the Senate gavel.Not to let the moment escape without something thoroughly honest being said, Murkowski also noted: Perhaps it speaks to the hardiness of women. That put on your boots and put your hat on and get out and slog through the mess that s out there. Damn right it does! Women know how hard it is for them to get elected, they aren t about to sit back and let a few snowflakes get in their way. They re going to show up, and they re going to get the job done.Featured image: Flickr",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Continues To Market In Totally Full Of Sh*t Myths About The So-Called Liberal Media (VIDEO),"Arguably the most popular myth in the Pantheon of Republican fiction is the idea that there s somehow a liberal media conspiracy to suppress conservatism and elevate liberalism. Horseshit.But that hasn t stopped slippery dickface Ted Cruz from furthering the myth whenever possible. During an interview with Howard Kurtz, Cruz responded to a question about the candidate s base and its distrust of the  mainstream media.  I especially like the part about how Cruz s face scares small children. Which is probably true.Via Crooks & Liars:HOWARD KURTZ: When you bash the media, and you have been treated unfairly at times portrayed as somebody who scares little children, but isn t that in your interest to do that? Your base loves that. They don t like the mainstream media.TED CRUZ: There is a reason they don t like the mainstream media because they are partisan liberal democrats.KURTZ: Every single journalist?CRUZ: Almost without exception.KURTZ: Almost without exception?CRUZ: Almost without exception they have a partisan agenda. And we understand   let s take a substantive issue: police officers. If you have one police officer somewhere who does something he shouldn t have, the press will breathlessly report on this terrible, horrible police officer and all the democratic politicians will jump in and demonize and vilify the cops.Let me ask you something? How come the press doesn t tell stories of heroism?The great news is we don t live anymore in a world of three networks that have a stranglehold on information. We have got the internet. We have got the Drudge Report. We have got talk radio. We have got social media. We ve got the ability to go directly around, and directly to the people.Yes, Cruz believes every single journalist is a liberal with an agenda and therefore the news media is part of a liberal conspiracy. I suppose that might be true if you completely overlook the fact that the most popular cable news network in American history is decidedly conservative. Or that 50 percent of broadcast radio is controlled by conservative screechers. Or that most news media outlets are owned by conservative multinational corporations with little interest in liberal politics. Or that one of those corporations, NewsCorp, owns literally hundreds of news media outlets around the world. Even the so-called  liberal  cable news network, MSNBC, is anchored by a four-hour morning show, hosted by a conservative Republican former congressman.The GOP persecution complex is powerful   as powerful as toddlers who think toe-monsters are living under their beds.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trevor Noah Roasts Jeb Bush’s Pathetically Desperate Effort To Remain A Viable Candidate (VIDEO),"If Jeb Bush watched The Daily Show last night, he should finally throw in the towel before he embarrasses himself and his family even more than he has already.On Monday night, Trevor Noah torched George W. Bush s brother in a hilarious segment that began with Noah referring to Jeb as the most desperate candidate in the presidential field. He s so desperate, he s even released his own fragrance for men,  Noah quipped. Dubbed  Desperation by Jeb!,  Noah promoted the scent as being  for when being yourself just isn t enough.  He then took a whiff and laughingly remarked,  Smells like George Bush. But it got even worse for Jeb from there.Noah reported that Bush and his supporters have spent more money on ads than anyone else, but that for all of the $40 million spent on positive ads telling voters about Bush, it has resulted in zero returns.This is a private admission from advisers to Jeb s own SuperPAC, Right To Rise. Even a Bush supporter was embarrassed by the results, exclaiming that,  You might as well light all of this money on fire. An amused Noah pointed out that it s pretty messed up when your campaign spending is failing so bad that burning the money would have been just as useful. That would have been more effective for Jeb Bush because at least people would have gathered around him for the warmth of the fire. People notice a fire. They don t notice Jeb Bush. The money could have been put to better use by building a new water system for Flint, Michigan, Noah added.Instead, Bush spent a lot of the money on video mailers featuring a Bush documentary that were actually mailed to his supporters and potential voters, something that Noah found to be such a huge waste of money that he was rendered speechless for a few seconds before regaining his composure to nail Jeb with another zinger. Poor Jeb, he s so desperate for his videos to go viral he s willing to physically mail them to your house. Still, Jeb Bush hadn t reached the bottom of the desperation pot.Noah then revealed that Bush had enlisted his mother to appear in an ad touting him as the one candidate who  seems  to be able to solve the country s problems. The Daily Show host noted that Jeb s own mom didn t sound sold on her son s qualifications as presidential material. It s like a guy getting his mom to hit people up on Tinder for him,  he said, which led to a video clip showing an exchange between Bush and a voter. Bush asked the voter who she is voting for. After she replied that she  didn t know yet,  Bush responded,  Oh, come on. And thus a new campaign slogan was born.Here s the video via Comedy Central.Seriously, Jeb. Do America a favor and put yourself out of our misery. It s probably the only thing you can do that people will support.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox News Responds To Trump’s Hissy Fit Over Megyn Kelly, And He’s Not Going To Like It","If there s one thing about Donald Trump that pretty much everyone knows by now, it s that he s never wrong. Well, at least according to Donald Trump. He ll never admit a mistake, he ll double down on controversial statements, and heaven forbid he s asked a question he doesn t want to answer, or even worse, challenged on an answer on live television. The latter is exactly what Megyn Kelly did in the first GOP debate, and oh boy, has that thrown Trump into full tantrum mode, especially finding out she ll be moderating the next GOP debate to be held on Fox News. He literally told CNN s Wolf Blitzer: I mean, I don t like her. She doesn t treat me fairly. So, in turn, Trump is threatening to boycott the next debate because he thinks Kelly is a meanie.Trump even took his sophomoric toddler behavior to Twitter and Instagram and polled his followers:Should I do the #GOPdebate? https://t.co/cjTywwIl85  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2016 Should I do the #GOPdebate?A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Jan 26, 2016 at 10:04am PSTAll of this led Fox News to issue a reply that was absolutely accurate. Probably one of the few times they ve said something that is completely true. A network spokesperson said: Sooner or later Donald Trump, even if he s president, is going to have to learn that he doesn t get to pick the journalists   we re very surprised he s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly. They basically called Trump out for being terrified of Megyn Kelly. If he s terrified during a debate because he s asked questions he doesn t completely fancy, how is he going to deal with leaders around the globe who would inevitably call him out all the time for the decisions he would make as Commander-in-Chief?Fox also told Mediaite is a statement that was pure gold: We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings. Fox News had the perfect response to Trump s hissy fit over Megyn Kelly moderating the next debate. If you desire to be leader of the free world, you re going to have to realize people aren t going to kowtow to your every whim, and bullying really isn t an option with diplomatic relations. Trump needs to grow the f*ck up.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BUSTED: Declassified Memo Shows Rumsfeld’s Lies About WMDs Were Worse Than We Thought,"By now, we re all fairly certain that we ve seen enough evidence to in the very least convict the major players of the Dubya administration of lying to the American people about Saddam Hussein s Iraq. There were no weapons of mass destruction; of that we are sure.We re sure, the people who went looking are sure, even the CIA is sure. The only people who aren t sure are the top ranking members of the Bush administration; George Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. While they seem to admit that they were wrong about WMDs in Iraq, they refuse to admit they made a mistake invading Iraq over the issue because it was the  best information  they had at the time.A newly declassified document is shedding some light on those claims. In a memo written by Donald Rumsfeld himself to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the former Secretary of Defense wrote,  Please take a look at this material as to what we don t know about WMD. It is big. The memo wasn t about what we knew about the alleged Iraqi weapons programs, but rather what we didn t know. As it turns out, we didn t know diddly squat. The report stated:Basically, just before the Bush administration made their case for war, they knew very little about what was actually going on. That translated to the doom and gloom reporting to the American people by their leaders that a maniac had most definitely acquired nuclear, chemical and/or biological weapons that could be used against the US or its interests.While an article in Politico points out that Rumsfeld was under no legal obligation to disclose the classified memo or its contents, it is only fair to note that he and his bosses opted instead to send Colin Powell to the UN for the infamous speech full of lies that gained the support of the United Kingdom and a coalition of nations.The memo proves that we were going to war no matter what. They weren t fed bad information. They didn t push America off that cliff and into another ground war because they thought they knew what Iraq was hiding. They jumped off because they knew exactly what they didn t know, and even that pointed to a country far less dangerous than the one they sold the American people.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Wealthy Teen Gets Homeless Man To Pour Coffee Over Himself For $5, Then Karma Calls (VIDEO)","A New Jersey teenager thought it would be funny to pay a homeless man $5 to pour coffee over himself. But after the story went viral, the homeless man is now being crowdfunded out of poverty, and that teen is facing the consequences of his actions.65-year-old Ronald Leggatt has been facing the east coast ice storms from a vantage point that most of us couldn t even imagine. While people shiver next to fires in their homes, Leggatt is on the streets, in sub-zero temperatures. Surviving each day is a miracle.On Monday, he was approached by a local teen. He might have hoped for some kind words, or some cash towards extra clothing or food.Instead, the teen offered the desperate man $5 to pour coffee over his own head. So he obliged. 22-year-old local Carlos Mejia posted images of the incident to Facebook, saying: At first I thought it was an act of kindness but I was wrong, The poor man s eyes and face were red because of the burning coffee, In the image, the teen can be seen shaking the hand of a clearly injured Leggatt.After Mejia s post went viral, Lakewood Police investigated the incident and verified that it did take place. But sadly, no charges can be filed against the teen. They said in a statement: After further investigation it was determined, that although the incident occurred in poor judgement, it did not rise to a criminal act, Evidence in the case revealed that both parties were willing participants and no one was injured. But the local community were so outraged by the incident, that they located Ronald Leggatt and decided to provide him with as much assistance as they could muster. First, they got his hair cut, provided him with a decent washroom, and bought him new clothes.They then set up a crowd fund campaign to provide reparations to Leggatt in behalf of the entire community. More than $3,000 has already been raised to help get Laggatt back on his feet.Ari Boyer, a Lakewood resident, told the New York Daily News: The truth is that I saw the thing on Facebook and thought it was a horrible thing to do, I just don t like to see people hurt. Leggatt is almost unrecognizable in his new clothes, clean and trim.But while Laggatt s life has turned around, the teen who abused him in his hour of need has been shamed publicly. So excruciating was the embarrassment, he made a video apology for Ronald Leggatt, offering him $20 and to pour coffee over his own head.Laggatt politely declined the offer.The case is a reminder of the very worst, and the very best, any community of human beings has to offer. Thank goodness that the better angels of Lakewood came together to stand for Ronald Leggatt.Featured Image via YouTube Screengrab",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton Skewers GOP Candidates After Muslim Vet Asks Her An Emotional Question (VIDEO),"Last night during the Democratic Presidential Town Hall in Iowa, Democratic presidential candidate absolutely skewered the 2016 Republican candidates for their  dangerous  rhetoric.Clinton s fiery rant against the GOP came as a response to Islamic Air Force veteran Erum Tariq-Munir, who asked a question that no parent in America should ever have to wonder, but it s completely understandable now that the far-right is upping the crazy. Noting the rising Islamophobia in the country, Tariq-Munir asked: As a mother of three young children, as an American Muslim, how can I make sure that this country is the best place on earth to raise my family? Clinton paused and thanked Tariq-Munir for her service before launching into an attack against the people most responsible for the growing bigotry in the United States. Once she got going, the former Secretary of State couldn t hold back, allowing disgust and anger to flow freely.While Clinton s criticism was intended for all GOP contenders, front-runner Donald Trump was singled out specifically. Clinton admitted that  one of the most distressing  parts of the 2016 campaign has been hearing the Republican party s offensive, bigotry-fueled rhetoric. Visibly upset and disturbed by what this coming election has revealed so far about America s conservatives, Clinton said: One of the most disturbing aspects of this campaign has been the language of Republican candidates, particularly their frontrunner, that insults, demeans, denigrates different people. I found it particularly harmful the way [Trump] has talked about Muslims.It s not only shameful and offensive, which it is   I think it s dangerous   We cannot tolerate this. We must stand up and say,  Every person in this country deserves to be treated with respect. Once she was content that she d ripped the GOP enough, Clinton tied Tariq-Munir s question to foreign policy. She said: We need a coalition that includes Muslim nations to defeat ISIS and it s pretty hard to figure out how you re going to make a coalition with the very nations you need if you spend your time insulting their religion! Later on, Clinton solidified her position as a great presidential candidate, demonstrating an amount of poise and class that her GOP rivals would have never been able to pull off. She said: I want to be the president for everyone, and I believe that is exactly what any president should do. You can watch Clinton s passionate response below:Standing up against the GOP is now something that comes naturally to Clinton. Time after time, she demonstrates that she will stand up for ALL Americans   not just the rich white ones.TwitterFeatured image is a screenshot",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Kansas Republicans Try To Add ‘Gun Dealers’ To List Of Protected Classes Like Race And Gender,"Thanks to a repeal of a long-standing law in 2015, Kansas currently doesn t have discrimination protection on the basis of sexual orientation, but rather than rectify that blot on the state s reputation, Republicans are focusing on a group that s a bit closer to home: The hapless gun dealer.In a new bill, astounding in its sheer audacity, Republicans want to  ban discrimination  against gun dealers and manufacturers. In short, they wish to make the sellers of firearms a protected class like those of race, gender and religion.As the Wichita Eagle reports:The bill, titled the Kansas Firearms Industry Nondiscrimination Act, is scheduled for a Thursday hearing by the Senate Committee on Federal and State Affairs. The proposal would function similarly to laws that prevent religious or racial discrimination and allow gun dealers to sue in cases where they felt discriminated against.As one might expect, the bill is in direct response to something conservatives believe about Obama but isn t actually true. (Newsflash: Obama isn t coming for your guns.) The bill s architect, Sen. Jacob LaTurner (R-Of Course) made that clear when he said this was a way to protect gun dealers from the federal government s tyranny.LaTurner said his bill is  intended to give these folks an avenue to push back  and would  give the firearm industry the ability to get some protection against this incredible overreach by our president. Republicans have long floated the conspiracy theory that Obama is attempting to destroy gun businesses by making banks scared to do business with them. The  Jade Helm  of this particular fantasy is a 2013 initiative done by the U.S. justice department called  Operation Choke Point.  Like Jade Helm, the procedure was completely innocent, meant to block fraudsters from accessing bank accounts, but tin foil hat wearing gun enthusiasts see signs of something more sinister. At issue appears to be the fact that since Operation Choke Point deals with overseeing banking operations, now, any time a gun dealer gets rejected for a bank loan for any number of reasons, they blame Operation Choke Point for inspiring it.Reality check:An audit conducted by the FDIC s inspector general, released in September, found no instances where the FDIC has pressured a financial institution to decline banking services to a firearm or ammunition dealer. But chasing the delusion all the way down the rabbit hole, LaTurner and his fellow Republicans felt the need to put gun dealers on the same level as those who faced Jim Crow laws, lynchings, and anti-Semitism.But back to LeTurner: It s not theoretical. It has happened around the country,  LaTurner said.  I ve got a business here in Pittsburg that sells guns   they re a great company   and if a bank decides to stop doing business with them because the feds are breathing down their necks, they need to have some recourse. Because if there is one group in the country that needs more protection it s gun salesmen.Feature image via Wikipedia",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox Pundit Blows Top Over Indictment Of Anti-Abortion Fanatics, Attacks Female Prosecutor (VIDEO)","A Grand Jury in Texas realized who the real criminals are, and Fox News isn t happy about it.On Monday, a Houston Grand Jury chose to indict two anti-abortion activists from the right-wing group Center for Medical Progress (CMP) for their involvement in an investigation of Planned Parenthood that led to the release of repeatedly debunked videos the CMP secretly filmed while posing as employees of the women s health organization.The videos allegedly show Planned Parenthood employees selling fetal body parts when in reality they were only discussing reimbursement of transportation costs to get the cells to researchers. Planned Parenthood wasn t actually selling  baby parts  at all.Despite that, Texas Republicans ordered a court to indict the women s health organization, instead the Grand Jury slapped CMP boss David Daleiden and CMP employee Sandra Merritt with their own indictment, charging them with tampering with government documents and trying to purchase organs illegally, both of which are felonies. The CMP employees also used fake IDs to infiltrate Planned Parenthood.Thus far, Planned Parenthood has been cleared of any wrongdoing by a congressional investigation as well as several state investigations.But that didn t stop Fox legal analyst Andrew Napolitano from throwing a temper tantrum about the indictment.During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Tuesday, the former judge weighed in without having seen the actual indictment itself, claiming that the Grand Jury indicted the wrong people and were somehow led astray by the prosecuting attorney.The CMP employees, he said, should be considered  bona fide journalists  running a legitimate investigation, even though they aren t journalists at all. They re really seriously pro-life people wanting to expose how government dollars are being used by Planned Parenthood,  Napolitano said.  The tapes came out, there s a big uproar. He then accused Planned Parenthood of  using tax dollars to kill babies and sell their body parts,  even though such use of funds are prevented by the Hyde Amendment. Furthermore, abortion services only amount to 3 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides and it has already been established by legal and medical experts that Planned Parenthood was not doing anything wrong in the tapes.Napolitano also made some rather serious accusations against Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson, suggesting that she turned the jury against CMP instead of getting the jury to automatically indict Planned Parenthood regardless of the evidence or lack thereof like a real Republican is supposed to do. The grand jury does not turn around and indict your witnesses, the people who brought you the case, without the prosecutor wanting this to happen! So, why would this prosecutor, appointed by Governor Perry, a former judge, a Republican woman, why would this prosecutor want to do this other than to send a message like,  I might be a Republican but leave Planned Parenthood alone ? In the end, Napolitano called the indictment  a political hit job  while continuing to defend Daleiden and Merritt as journalists who did nothing wrong since the government  uses the same techniques  for catching criminals all the time.Here s the video via YouTube.Clearly, Napolitano has lost his damn mind and demonstrates why he shouldn t have ever been allowed to be a judge in the first place. These CMP employees do not work for the government nor are they employed by a media organization. They are activists who forged government documents and tried to buy fetal body parts that Planned Parenthood was never actually trying to sell. Therefore, CMP broke the law, not Planned Parenthood. In addition, just because the prosecuting attorney is a Republican, it doesn t mean Planned Parenthood isn t entitled to a fair investigation. Napolitano is whining because he thinks there should have been an automatic indictment just because the attorney is Republican and the investigation took place in Texas. In fact, it took place in the very city CMP conducted the sting operation. The true political hit job would have been if Napolitano had his way.However, the bottom line is that the Grand Jury did their job based on the evidence presented to them and they chose to indict CMP and exonerate Planned Parenthood. The legal system worked despite how much Napolitano and other conservatives want it to be rigged.Featured image via Fox News screenshot",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Carly Fiorina LOSES IT After The ‘Baby Parts’ People Are Indicted Instead Of Planned Parenthood (VIDEO),"You have to admire conservatives  ability to commit to the lie. After David Daledin and Sandra Merritt, the slimy, lying taint-barnacles who produced the fraudulent, heavily-edited Planned Parenthood  baby parts  videos that took the conservative world by storm, were indicted on multiple felony charges  a surprising event that took place during the course of an investigation into Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast ordered by Texas Governor Greg Abbott   one would expect conservatives to turn their anger toward those who lied to them. Unfortunately, these are people who still think Hillary Clinton was responsible for Benghazi.The indictments against the perpetrators of these agregious lies, ones that inspired Robert Dear to engage in an act of terrorism against a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado, were enough to throw 2016 hopeful Carly Fiorina into a fit of delusional panic and rage.On Monday, Fiorina joined conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt to share her outrage   not against the people whose lies caused her to spout off crazy talk about  baby parts  for months, but against anyone remotely interested in the truth. Asked for her reaction, Fiorina explained that she is furious that Planned Parenthood s  trafficking in baby body parts  did not lead to prosecution: Yes, well, this is why it s a fight for the character of our nation. We know for a fact that because of Planned Parenthood s own announcement that they would no longer accept payments for what they call  fetal tissue,  and they were in fact trafficking in baby body parts. So guess what? I m not going to sit down and be quiet as I said at the March for Life in Washington, D.C. on Friday before the snowstorm descended. I will not sit down and be quiet, I know the value of life, we know what s going on, and I will continue to stand for the character of this nation. From what I read, somehow the charge is that they falsified government identities because that s true obviously, that s not good, but I only know what I read at this point, but I think it s pretty clear that we now know what goes on in Planned Parenthood clinics,  Fiorina told Hewitt, explaining that the indictments for  Tampering with a Governmental Record  and  Prohibition of the Purchase and Sale of Human Organs   very serious charges   were an outrage because despite all this, she considers the heavily-edited videos to be legitimate: Here s what I know: Planned Parenthood has been trafficking in body parts. Planned Parenthood has been altering late-term abortion techniques to this specific purpose of harvesting body parts. In President Fiorina budget, there will not be a single dime for Planned Parenthood. Fiorina isn t the only GOP candidate who is immune to reality. Marco Rubio told CNN that he is  disturbed  because Planned Parenthood,  who are the ones that were actually selling off these (body) parts were found having done nothing wrong, the people who tried to expose them are the ones that are now facing criminal charges. It s interesting what happens when people focus on the facts, isn t it?Mike Huckabee called Monday a  sick day in America  because  those who expose evil w/ a cellphone  are being punished for their criminal actions, but Planned Parenthood was found to have done nothing criminal. Ben Carson s campaign promised retribution against Planned Parenthood, which has been cleared in every single politically-motivated investigation against them to date. Carson s Communication Director told CNN: He is equally shocked that they instead decided to indict the individuals that exposed Planned Parenthood s heinous and illegal activities. As President, he will use the full weight of his office to not only cut off all federal funding for this organization, but also prosecute them for crimes against the unborn. Unfortunately, conservatives simply don t care about the truth   and the truth is that the only criminals are the ones who made the fake videos that prompted the Stupid Part of America to lose their sh*t.Listen to Carly Fiorina lose her mind below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbuAU-9QX8A?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The End Of The Republican Party In One Simple Graph,"After getting crushed in the 2012 election, the Republican Party realized that they needed to appeal to more than just old angry white men. But they didn t do that. Instead, they doubled down on anti-Latino sentiment. Then they tripled down. Then they played their Trump card and that was the end of the GOP s Latino outreach. Now, Pew Research Center has released a study that confirms the Republican Party is doomed. Not only is the fastest growing group of voters Latino, Millennials (who already dislike the GOP intensely) make up the fastest growing segment within that already critical demographic.In other words, the people the least likely to vote for Republicans are going to be one of the most powerful voting blocks in just a few years. Just to make it a little more clear, here s what the growth of Latino voters looks like by the millions:And almost half of them are Millennials. If I were a Republican, this graph would make me wake up screaming every night. It s like the Grim Reaper showed up on my doorstep and said,  Hola, Gringo! I d feel bad for the GOP but they really did bring it on themselves. A few years ago, they MIGHT have been able to appeal to Latino voters. But the last two years have seen a repeat of the exact same short-sighted stupidity that drove the black community away from voting Republican for the last 50 years. Trump sped up the process considerably but it was already happening. You cannot tell an entire group of people that you hate their very existence and then be surprised when they vote against you.Republicans have painted themselves into a corner with no chance of escape. In order to rally their aging base, they demonized Latinos by pretending immigration was an existential threat of America. They were so successful in this that they cannot, in any way, appeal to Latinos without immediately alienating the old angry white people that keep them in office. But without the Latino vote, Republicans cannot possibly continue to compete at the national level for much longer.It s the most delicious Burrito of Electoral Doom imaginable and I can t wait to dig in!Feature image via Pew Research",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oregon Cop Convicted Of Shattering Biker’s Collarbone With Kick Forgot Dashcam Was On (VIDEO),"In a baffling fit of rage, an Oregon State Police officer has been convicted of ramming his car into a stopped motorcyclist then kicking the dazed man so hard in the chest that he would need a metal plate and screws to repair his shattered collarbone and ribs. What State Police Captain Rob Edwards didn t know was that his department have installed a functioning dashboard camera. It captured the entire shocking scene.The 2012 incident with a chase that the victim says he didn t know was happening. The first he learned of Edwards  presence was when the cop was running directly into the back of his motorcycle, spilling the man from his bike. The man gets up with his hands raised only to find Edwards rushing at him with his pistol held sideways, probably imitating something he saw in a movie. The biker, identified as Justin Wilkens, barely had time to say  What did I do?  before Edwards kicked him square in the chest with such force that Wilkens would later learn he broke his collarbone and several ribs.[youtube https://youtu.be/7Uuo_CiiPk8?t=3m32s]Edwards would later say that he was  frustrated  with Wilkens for not complying to his demands sooner (how?), and that he didn t realize his car was equipped with a functioning dashcam.What Edwards didn t know was that the unmarked car he was driving was equipped with a functioning dashboard camera.So when Edwards eventually struck Justin Wilkens  motorcycle with his car, then pulled his gun and kicked Wilkens in the chest, he did not know that the whole episode would be played   again and again   before a U.S. District Court jury.It s not hard to see why the dashcam was a bitter pill for Edwards   thanks to the footage his trial lasted all of three days and he was promptly convicted. He and his department will now have to pay $180,000 in damages. Bizarrely, Wilkens could have received more but the jury decided that a cop pointing a pistol at his head didn t constitute psychological damages. How militarized has law enforcement become in America?A cop aiming sideways guns at complying suspects is now considered so routine that courts are suggesting people just get used to it.In the past year, the conversation over police cameras has consumed the debate over police abuse. Some critics have pointed out that cameras didn t lead to justice for victims of police abuse like 12-year-old Tamir Rice and in the horrific death of Eric Garner. But on the other hand, it s hard to imagine cops like Edwards receiving any sort of punishment without them. For instances where cops cross the line, video of them doing so can be a godsend to the victims. Juries tend to err on the side of the police, but even they can t ignore what they see with their own eyes. Usually.Cops know this as well as anyone. It s no surprise that Edwards lamented his dashcam. Under the impression it wasn t working, he felt at ease shattering a man s collarbone because he was  frustrated.

 Stephen Colbert Gets Donald Rumsfeld To Admit The Iraq War Was All A Lie (VIDEO),"Donald Rumsfeld is in full damage control mode after a declassified memo from 2002 making the rounds revealed that he lied about Iraq s  WMDs.  Like anyone desperate to sway public opinion and keep himself out of jail, Rumsfeld is giving interviews to tell  his side.  Why he decided to go The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is unclear. Colbert is a screaming liberal, very smart and very well-informed. Perhaps Rumsfeld thought he could outmaneuver the comedian? Maybe he thought Colbert would go easy on him? Maybe Rumsfeld is suffering from dementia?Needless to say, the interview did not go well for Rumsfeld:The talk show host said this showed Bush administration officials believed there were weapons of mass destruction   but they had no hard evidence of their existence. I believe that sincerely   I don t think anybody made up the belief that there were weapons of mass destruction,  Colbert said, as Rumsfeld insisted those beliefs were sincere.  That is cynicism beyond what I would ever want to think of my government. I believe that everybody believed that they were there, but there was no hard proof that they were there,  he continued.  And yet it was presented to the American people as if there was. So there was an unknown known for the American people. It was known that there was not hard evidence, but we were presented a partial picture   and that s the unknown known that we were denied. Do you think that was the right thing to do? In this, Colbert is far nicer than I would have been. We already know that Bush and his neo-con administration wanted an excuse to invade Iraq. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Bush demanded that the intelligence community  find  a connection between Iraq and the attacks. When they couldn t find a connection, one was manufactured for the sole purpose of selling the American people on the war. In this  known known  context, it takes very little to imagine Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld fabricating their  belief  in WMDs from whole cloth.But the best moment came when Colbert got Rumsfeld to admit, out loud, that the utter certainty about WMDs that we were sold was, in fact, total bullshit: Were there things that the administration or you knew that we didn t learn about out of the best possible intentions   which is, there were things that would undermine the case for a war you thought was necessary to save the United States,  Colbert said.At last, Rumsfeld delivered a straight answer. The president had available to him intelligence from all elements of the government, and the National Security Council members had that information,  Rumsfeld said.  It was all shared, it was all supplied, and it s never certain  if it were a fact, it wouldn t be called intelligence. Translation into non-weasel speak: We lied when we said we  knew  for a fact that the WMDs existed.If you ll recall, the made up connection to 9/11 and WMDs were the entire basis for the Iraq War and Rumsfeld just admitted they lied about them.For the revisionists out there, a quick history lesson. Rumsfeld didn t say he  thought  Iraq had WMDs. Or that we were pretty sure or even very confident. He didn t equivocate in the slightest. He said we knew where they were. STEPHANOPOULOS: And is it curious to you that given how much control U.S. and coalition forces now have in the country, they haven t found any weapons of mass destruction?SEC. RUMSFELD:  We know where they are. They re in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat.-ABC s This Week, 3/30/03If the American people had been told that our intelligence on WMDs was as shaky as it actually was, no one but the most bloodthirsty among us would have supported it. Americans are more than happy to bomb people that attack us or a friend, but preemptive war is not, and has never been, a part of our DNA. Rumsfeld and his co-conspirators knew this so they lied through their teeth. It took a comedian to finally get one of the blood-soaked architects of America s worst war since Vietnam to admit it.Bravo, Mr. Colbert!

 Maine’s Governor Refuses To Answer One Simple Question – Then Things Get Really Weird (VIDEO),"The Rachel Maddow Show attempted to reach out to Maine Governor Paul LePage s office to see if he would be delivering his annual State of the State speech this year (after threatening he wouldn t do it). Instead of getting a response to that simple question, the Governor s office decided to make things really weird. Not only did the Governor and his aides not answer the question, but they made complete fools of themselves in the process. It was a war of words, to say the least.Here is the question they thought was so horrible: Hi, wanted to see if the governor has made a decision about whether or not he will give the State of the State address in person to lawmakers or if he still plans to send a letter. Do you have any information on that decision yet? Thanks! The very first message Maddow got back was: Why does Rachel Maddow have such an unnatural obsession with Governor LePage? Her neurotic fixation on his is kind of bizarre. What happened after that is just a back and forth of sheer awkwardness.While it is true that Maddow has reported on Governor LePage, and probably not in the most favorable light, that is the job of a national reporter after all. And   he s made a lot of stupid statements. Of course, a liberal show is going to laugh at someone like LePage for those comments. She reports on the news. It would have been very easy for LePage s office to say  we re not sure yet,  leaving Maddow almost nowhere to go with the exchange, even if she was trying to troll him.Surely the Governor and his aides must have known that this is precisely the last thing they would want to do to someone who commands an audience of millions. Not very smart. Then again, Tea Party Republicans aren t the brightest, either.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Hew said he takes full responsibility and that the government had failed the people.Then he refused to resign, denying the people the basic satisfaction of seeing their grossly incompetent  leader  step down.The hope for some kind of satisfaction isn t completely gone, however, as the lawyers in a class action suit filed for the people of Flint obtained subpoenas requiring the governor, his staffers, city managers and the Department of Environmental Quality to turn over all documents, records and emails pertaining the crisis in Flint.Lawyers are looking for anything dating back to 2011 referring to three specific items: The Flint River tapped for drinking water, the quality of the water in the river or the KWA pipeline, the main transfer route at the root of the problem.The bad news didn t stop there for Governor Snyder. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced that it was assigning the former head of the FBI s Detroit field office to lead a criminal investigation. What the citizens of Flint want, desire and deserve is what laws may have been broken,  said Schuette.The controversy surrounding Flint has been treated by Republicans like a simple  oops  moment. Jeb Bush has praised the governor for his handling of the situation that has already taken at least ten lives from Legionnaire s disease while calling for the head of Hillary Clinton on a pike over Benghazi. The entire situation has highlighted just how little republicans tend to think of the people when making decisions that could save a few dollars   or earn a few more.Hopefully, Governor Snyder will have no choice when the facts are presented but to step down. The people of Flint deserve no less.Feature Image via screen capture",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Neil DeGrasse Tyson SCHOOLS Rapper B.O.B Over Flat Earth Conspiracy (TWEETS),"If you were not aware there is a seriously old and debunked new theory going around the interwebz that the Earth is really flat after all. Yes, seriously. Recently, rapper B.o.B posted a bunch of  evidence  to support his belief that we ve all been lied to about the shape of our planet. Unfortunately for him, it got really embarrassing when astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson got involved and schooled him.A couple of weeks ago, singer Tila Tequila tweeted about the #FlatEarth movement, claiming that the Earth isn t really round because buildings in New York City are all straight.Why are all the buildings in NYC standing straight up? If earth was round then some of the buildings would have a slight tilt. #FlatEarth  Tila Tequila (@AngelTilaLove) January 7, 2016Apparently she isn t the only nutjob, because rapper B.o.B started tweeting  the same mind-boggling nonsense:A lot of people are turned off by the phrase ""flat earth""   but there's no way u can see all the evidence and not know  grow up  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016No matter how high in elevation you are  the horizon is always eye level   sorry cadets  I didn't wanna believe it either.  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016y'all be like  ""you're not high enough to see the curve keep going"" pic.twitter.com/dzgYpIIao3  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016how do you explain the horizon always being at eye level ? https://t.co/Kzuc4r77CK  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016There is tweet after tweet with this same crazy speak. About twenty tweets into his flat Earthfest, Neil deGrasse Tyson decided that he could no longer handle the dumbf*ckery and slapped down the rapper s loony conspiracy theory:@bobatl Earth's curve indeed blocks 150 (not 170) ft of Manhattan. But most buildings in midtown are waaay taller than that.  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016@bobatl Polaris is gone by 1.5 deg S. Latitude. You ve never been south of Earth s Equator, or if so, you've never looked up.  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016@bobatl Flat Earth is a problem only when people in charge think that way. No law stops you from regressively basking in it.  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016@bobatl Duude   to be clear: Being five centuries regressed in your reasoning doesn t mean we all can t still like your music  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016If you thought B.o.B would listen to one of most prominent astrophysicists in the world, you d be wrong. Instead of admitting that he had no idea what he was talking about, the rapper posted this:@neiltyson why can't the curvature of the earth be measured anywhere in nature? why does only NASA have photos of the curve ? r u a mason?  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016He continued on like this for the rest of the day, convinced that he knows more than Tyson.Neil deGrasse must have realized that the rapper was completely bat sh*t because he just stopped responding.We don t blame him.Although many American children are taught that Christopher Columbus discovered the Earth was not flat, the belief that it is round dates back all the way to 6 Century B.C., but was proven by Aristotle. It was then reaffirmed throughout history.There are a lot of mindnumbing conspiracy theories out there, but this one is exceptionally stupid. Why B.o.B thinks he knows more than the scientific community is anyone s guess, but he really should keep his crazy off of social media sites before he embarrasses himself further.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Michelle Obama And Conan O’Brien Entertain U.S. Troops In Qatar (VIDEO),"Conan O Brien and First Lady Michelle Obama teamed up in an hour long episode chronicling a trip they made to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar as part of the first lady s Joining Forces initiative.With comedians Laurie Kilmartin, Brian Kiley, and John Mulaney, along with Grace Potter as his musical guest, O Brien performed stand-up for troops stationed at the base. During his monologue, he regretfully told the audience of his decision to forgo a stay at the posh St. Regis hotel to live on the base just like the troops do.  I said no, I want to live on the base. That s what I said, because I m a fu**ing idiot, that s why,  drawing applause from the crowd.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM5r-CJpajA]On his way to Qatar with the first lady, O Brien wasn t allowed to film the trip for security reasons so he decided to do the next best thing: Use 3D animation as a way to narrate the experience. The video shows the first lady having tomato juice on the plane while O Brien has dozens of bottles of vodka stacked on the table next to him.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxvCt34QCkw]It was midway through the episode that O Brien and the first lady are seen together. Obama told the host the reason why she s decided to  shine a light  on active service members and veterans. Obama said: Once you connect, you don t want to let go. You don t have to be first lady or one of the funniest men on the planet to get involved.  The first lady s Joining Forces initiative seeks to empower veterans and their families: Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sectors to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives.

 POLL: Bristol Palin Wants To Know Whose Voice Sounds Like Nails On A Chalkboard- Her Mom Or Tina Fey,"Bristol Palin had something to say and pondered some questions after Tina Fey roasted her mommy on Saturday Night Live over the weekend.Last week, America s village idiot returned to the political stage to endorse Donald Trump in a rambling incoherent speech that has been lampooned repeatedly by comedians across the country.Frankly, Chris Hardwick s mockery of Palin s speech on Comedy Central s @Midnight has been my favorite thus far.But on Saturday, Tina Fey received yet another opportunity to mock Palin in what became an instant classic opening segment on the long-running NBC sketch comedy program.And of course, Sarah Palin s demon spawn couldn t resist taking shots at Tina Fey making fun of her looks and the way she sounds.Bristol Palin commented on the Saturday Night Live sketch on Monday by asking  Who wore it better- Sarah Palin or Tina Fey?  in reference to the jacket worn by both ladies. Anyway, I think it s funny that the producers of SNL couldn t get their hands on the same top my mom wore, because it was sold out,  the failed abstinence advocate wrote.  I have to admit, the shirt looked great. But I still think my mom wore it better. She then included a poll, which everyone should totally add their vote to, asking who wore it better.But that s not all.As mentioned earlier, Bristol also trashed Fey s impersonation of her mom and her looks. I m sure many of you saw Tina Fey, who sounds nothing like my mom, do a skit based on my Mom s endorsement of Donald Trump.I don t know about you, but hearing her fake accent is like nails on a chalkboard for me!I may be biased, but I think my mom trumps her in the looks department. (Especially for having three more kids and seven more years on Tina!)Saturday Night Live and Fey have been clinging to this impersonation a little too long. It s getting pathetic. Its been 7 years! Are they desperate for content? Or just desperate for viewers? In the interest of fairness- after all, Bristol did say she  may be biased - here s a poll asking who s voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard- Sarah Palin or Tina Fey? Be sure to vote and don t forget to vote on Bristol Palin s poll, too.Sarah PalinTina FeyFeatured Image: Distractify",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Is Putting An End To Inhumane Punishment In The Federal Prison System,"President Obama announced via an op-ed in the Washington Post that he will be enacting some major reforms in the federal prison system. He will be putting an end to solitary confinement for juveniles, and prohibiting the practice as a punishment for low-level infractions. The reforms were taken from a report by the Justice Department that listed recommendations for improving the system. It s estimated that approximately 10,000 individuals would be affected.Unfortunately, this only applies to the federal prison system and not to the majority of prison inmates that are incarcerated for state-level crimes. Even with that in mind, this is still a bold and very necessary step in reforming American prisons which can serve as a model for states to follow.President Obama made his case as follows:How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people? It doesn t make us safer. It s an affront to our common humanity.The Justice Department has completed its review, and I am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system. These include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low-level infractions, expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells. These steps will affect some 10,000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement   and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems. And I will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement.Source: WaPoWhile acknowledging that sometimes solitary confinement can be required for certain individuals, President Obama made it clear that it s a punishment which is overused and ends up causing more harm than good in many cases.There are as many as 100,000 people held in solitary confinement in U.S. prisons   including juveniles and people with mental illnesses. As many as 25,000 inmates are serving months, even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell, with almost no human contact.Research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating, lasting psychological consequences. It has been linked to depression, alienation, withdrawal, a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior. Some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide, especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses.Source: WaPoHopefully, this will be a first step in what turns out to be a long path of reforms to bring our prison system out of the realm of  cruel and unusual punishment,  as it was intended to be all along.featured image via The Georgia Straight",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives Are Going BONKERS Over the Indictment Of The Fake ‘Baby Parts’ Video People (SCREENSHOTS),"In case you haven t heard, after Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into Planned Parenthood after disingenuous, heavily-edited videos were produced by the deceptively-named Center For Medical Progress. The videos, which claimed the women s health organization sold  baby parts  to the highest bidder, launched a wave of investigations nationwide   all of which turned up absolutely no wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood.One such investigation in Texas involved Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast. Though a grand jury cleared the much-maligned institution of any and all wrongdoing, two indictments were handed down   against the producers of the anti-Planned Parenthood fabrications.David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt were both indicted for Tampering with a Governmental Record. In addition, Daleiden received an indictment for Prohibition of the Purchase and Sale of Human Organs   an incredibly serious charge. We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast,  said Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson.  As I stated at the outset of this investigation, we must go where the evidence leads us. All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury. I respect their decision on this difficult case. The people behind this fraud lied and broke the law in order to spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood to advance their extreme anti-abortion political agenda,  Planned Parenthood said in a statement.  As the dust settles and the truth comes out, it s become totally clear that the only people who engaged in wrongdoing are the criminals behind this fraud, and we re glad they are being held accountable. Nothing about today s announcement in Harris County impacts the state s ongoing investigation,  said Governor Abbott, who promised to continue to waste state money in fruitless attempts to smear the women s health group.  The State of Texas will continue to protect life, and I will continue to support legislation prohibiting the sale or transfer of fetal tissue. The horrific nature of these videos demand scrutiny and investigation. The Senate Committee on Health and Human Services will continue to examine the practices of abortion providers and whether state law adequately protects the sanctity of life,  Lt. gov. Dan Patrick added. I will never be deterred from standing up to fight to protect the unborn. Daleiden s supporters similarly don t care about the facts, with many demanding an investigation into the grand jury because they can t possibly think that laws were broken when the Center for Medical Progress illegally recorded privileged information and slopping edited clips together to give the impression of wrongdoing   no matter what the evidence says. On Fox News  Facebook page, they let their  thoughts  (we use that word loosely) be known:               It s important to remember that these people will be voting in November.Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BET Actress Lays The Smack Down On Obama-Hating Fox News Pundit Stacey Dash,"Fox News pundit and co-host Stacey Dash attracted a lot of negative comments with her recent comments that BET and the NAACP shouldn t exist.Actress Gabrielle Union is the star of BET s Being Mary Jane, and at a recent appearance at the Sundance Film Festival she put Dash s ignorant comments in their place.When asked about Dash s comments at the Sundance Film Festival premiere of  The Birth of a Nation  on Monday, Union first replied,  Who s that? Who s Stacey Dash? Is she like related to Dame Dash? Was she on Roc-A-Fella (Records)? Union said the BET Awards remain necessary because of the lack of diversity in mainstream awards. The more that we focus on inclusion and a true representation of this country, I think that crazy lady will have less to say,  Union said of Dash.Dash s career hit its peak with her appearance in the 1990s comedy, Clueless, and since then she has been far more likely to appear in instantly forgettable direct-to-video movies than anything in the mainstream box office.A few years ago she discovered that there is a niche for her as a black pundit who is willing to attack black America, and began using her Twitter account to boost Mitt Romney s presidential campaign. As that attracted expected pushback from her followers, Dash parlayed that into regular pundit appearances on Fox News, eventually becoming a co-host of the network s rip-off of The View, Outnumbered.On that show, Dash is the reliable source of outrageous, ill-informed quotes, often at the expense of black people to the delight of her Fox News bosses. Sometimes, Dash has even gone to far for Fox, however, and she was recently suspended for saying that President Obama doesn t  give a sh**  about terrorism. Though in reality, the offense for Fox News viewers was probably more that she swore on-air and not that she lied about Obama.Dash has a book coming out this summer about her transition from actress to right-winger, which gives credibility to the suspicion that Dash is in it for the money.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Why Scared Misogynists Are Trolling Emma Watson (TWEETS),"Emma Watson has been in the news lately and it s not because of her acting. She s a staunch feminist and a human rights activist, taking a strong position on the rights of refugees. She recently made news when she gave an extraordinary speech at the United Nations, advocating for the rights of women around the world. She also recently tweeted in solidarity with the refugees coming to Europe in search for safety after years of war and torment in Syria.That was more than enough for anti-feminist and anti-refugee trolls to attack Thomson by using her humanitarianism against her.  There is a petition circulating that challenges Watson to live in a camp in Calais, France. Entitled  Spend one week in a Calais migrant camp for feminism (without bodyguards),  the petition states: In order to show how safe current migration is to Europe, particularly regarding the cause of feminism (I reject wholeheartedly the notion that North African and Middle Eastern migrants are unsafe, and rapists), Emma Watson should spend a week s holiday in a Calais migrant camp, without guards of course, to show how safe, and how pro feminism these migrants are. It all started with one simple humanitarian tweet:#refugeeswelcome  Emma Watson (@EmWatson) September 7, 2015The tweet has since garnered plenty of responses for and against Watson s stance. Some ignorant people have chosen to lump all the refugees into a single category by citing the attacks on France:Remember this @EmWatson? #RefugeesWelcome They killed innocent people in #Paris, Emma. How do you sleep at night? pic.twitter.com/LYqfoWuh4i  JEB DELENDA EST (@rsmccain) November 15, 2015Others however, have shown support:@rsmccain @EmWatson if we abandon the innocent refugees we abandon compassion and create more extremists  Chris France (@france_chris) November 15, 2015Since the petition was created a week ago, over 12,000 people have signed it with 15,000 being   the goal. Here s what a troll had to say about Watson: Ever since she was invited to give a widely praised speech at the UN on the topic, she has become a poster girl of modern feminism. Her simultaneous embrace of female equality, mass migration and the misogynistic non-western cultures brought with it, is widely seen as typical of left wing activists today. In this context, the petition can be interpreted as an expression of frustration with the contradictions of modern liberal feminism, rather than merely a personal attack on Ms. Watson. Watson, who is best known for her role as Hermione in the Harry Potter films, was made a Goodwill Women s Ambassador by the United Nations in 2014 and has been passionately using her platform to advocate for the betterment of humanity. At only 24 years old, she s already making a difference. We need more people like Emma Watson and we need to support her.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons.

" Knowing They Have Idiot Viewers, Fox News Asserts Obama Won’t Be Running Again (VIDEO)","Sometimes in life you just need to state the obvious, especially if you re Fox News and your viewers still need to be reminded not to eat paste.It s pretty common knowledge that a president is only allowed to serve two terms in office, so either the folks over on Fox & Friends think that their viewers are stupid, they are reminding themselves, or this is brand new information to them and they think they are reporting breaking news for the first time.During the segment they showed President Obama explaining some of his biggest regrets as president, and how he wouldn t want to run for a third term even if he could, because it would be too big of a toll on his family. It was then that the hosts maneuvered their right-wing spin into saying that Hillary Clinton would be a third term of Obama.However, the most baffling part of the segment, alongside their love for George W. Bush, was when they were literally talking about a third term for Obama and what that would mean. Brian Kilmeade, while reading a tweet that read,  I believe he would beat anybody in the current GOP crop  decided to follow it up by saying: That could be the case. We ll see. Which is when Steve Doocy had to chime in and remind his cohost alongside viewers at home: But then again, he can t run. So, he wouldn t be running. Oh, Brian Kilmeade, there s a reason Bobby Moynihan portrays you as so scatterbrained and unintelligent on SNL, because you are.This really shouldn t be something that has to be explained to anyone in this day and age, but when dealing with Fox News and Fox News viewers, well, they seem to need a little bit more time to grasp facts and reality. Honestly, the look on Doocy s face as he explains to Kilmeade that Obama can t run again is priceless.Watch for yourself:  Video/Featured image: C&L",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Grand Jury Indicts Anti-Choice Zealots Who Produced Phony Planned Parenthood Videos,"Talk about blowback. Last Summer, Texas governor Greg Abbott initiated an investigation into Planned Parenthood following the release of a series of deceptively edited videos claiming to have caught the healthcare provider engaging in fetal organ harvesting and selling the parts to biomedical research facilities via some sort of grisly underground marketplace.But instead of catching Planned Parenthood red-handed, a grand jury has officially indicted the perpetrators of the videos, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, while also exonerating Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing.The AP via Talking Points Memo:David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, was indicted on a felony charge of tampering with a governmental record and a misdemeanor count related to purchasing human organs. Another activist, Sandra Merritt, was also indicted on a charge of tampering with a governmental record. It s the first time anyone in the group has been charged criminally since the videos started surfacing last year.Texas becomes the eighth state to exonerate Planned Parenthood, while casting serious doubt on the veracity of the obviously deceptive videos. Yet most of the GOP presidential candidates, along with most of the conservative movement, continues to treat the videos as if they represent hard evidence of Planned Parenthood s allegedly evil motives and illegal activities. Congressional Republicans, along with state Republicans, used the videos as convenient excuses to vote in support of crushing the healthcare clinics.It s entirely likely that Republicans will continue to attach their reputations to the videos in spite of the indictment and the various exonerations.Adding to the irony of the indictment, Daleiden is being accused of attempting to illegally purchase fetus organs   the very practice he was attempting to expose, even though it didn t exist.In a statement announcing the indictment, Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson didn t provide details on the charges, including what record or records were allegedly tampered with and why Daleiden faces a charge related to buying human organs. Anderson s office said it could not provide details until the documents charging Daleiden and Merritt were formally made public, which was expected later Monday.Get ready for the sound of anti-choice heads exploding, as well as the demagoguing of the grand jury itself as somehow an Obama/NARAL/PPFA conspiracy.Featured imaged via video screen grab.",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch This Bundy Militiaman Challenge Chris Christie To Sumo Match In Latest Bizarre Video,"It s been more than three weeks since a group of terrorists, led by Ammon Bundy, took over Oregon s Malheur Wildlife Sanctuary. Over that relatively short period of time, it appears the militia members have gone from mentally unbalanced to certifiably insane.Over the course of the terrorist occupation, various members of the group have posted various videos of themselves, including one that shows them taking down  hidden cameras  that are in plain site.The militants recently posted a video of themselves angrily  discovering  boxes of Native American artifacts in the basement of the wildlife refuge, which is exactly where they were left by the Burns Pauite Tribe that helped categorize them.Before that there was the video of militia member Jon Ritzheimer flipping his shit over an assortment of dildos and dicks that he got in the mail.But the most recent video to be published by a member of the group is the most insane yet.It shows a militia member named Kelly Gneiting challenging New Jersey governor Chris Christie to some kind of sumo duel. Gneiting is dressed in what appears to be nothing but his underwear.The video appears to be the group s attempt at a response to statements made by Christie earlier this month. Christie said  Laws matter,  and  Laws have to be enforced,  which in right-wing crazy language clearly means  Kill them all. In the video, Gneiting invites Christie to  put on a diaper  and  slap bellies  with him.There s been a lot of speculation about how the militia men have been spending their time over the past few weeks. Isolated from society, with no one to turn to for comfort but each other, the terrorists have spawned more than a few Brokeback Mountain spoofs.There s even a twitter-based homoerotic fiction story, thanks to Colin Meloy of the Decemberists.Gneiting no doubt thought that inviting the governor of New Jersey to  slap bellies  with him, while  wearing a diaper,  would be a good way to make people stop questioning his sexuality on Twitter.Watch the video below, via Kelly Gneiting on YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Asks One Question: The Response Is Both Chilling And Powerful (VIDEO),"During a campaign event in Iowa Falls, Iowa on Monday, Bernie Sanders asked the people in the crowd to hear their experiences on what it is like to live on a $12,000 dollar a year income. The response from one woman is both chilling and powerful.Here is part of one woman s response: It s so hard to do anything to pay your bills, you re ashamed all the time when you can t buy presents for your children it s really, really, really hard   and I work 3, 4, 5 jobs sometimes, always minimum wage, I have a degree, divorced and it s just I m waiting for disability to come through so my parents have to support me   it s just hard. Bernie Sanders responds, saying: It is not easy for people to stand up and say that but the truth is that until millions of people who are experiencing what you re experiencing do say that we don t make change. You can watch the entire exchange below:The right-wing has done everything in their power to make poverty shaming as acceptable as racism has historically been. Currently, the default attack on the poor is to claim that they only want free stuff. It s a slightly more de-racialized way of calling people welfare queens.That s why it can be extremely hard for poor people to come forward with stories of their personal struggles. They have been subjected to the dogma of homo economicus their entire lives. They have a tendency to see themselves as failures, rather than the people living in an economic system that was built for them to survive, not for them to prosper.In the same way that the movement during the queer liberation movement was largely successful because it encouraged people to come out of the closest and make some noise, so to the poor must tell their stories of struggle. They must demand that their existence and struggle be heard, and to refuse to allow themselves to be dehumanized by the forces that wish to exploit them.Featured Image Credit: Gage Skidmore via Flickr ",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Tennessee Family Values GOP Leader Loses Job After Years Of Unsolicited Sexts To Young Women,"The Tennessee House of Representatives needs to find a new majority whip after their last one was exposed of having repeatedly sexually harassed young women while he trumpeted  family values  from his political office.State Rep. Jeremy Durham formally announced he would be stepping down from his leadership role (but not giving up his seat in the legislature) after an investigation by the Tennessean found that he had repeatedly sent sexual texts to at least three women, oftentimes late at night.One woman in her mid-20s, who worked in various capacities at the statehouse, said during the 2013 legislative session, Durham repeatedly sent text messages and Facebook messages, sometimes late into the night.One text message, after 10 p.m., says he misses her.In another text, at about 1:30 a.m., Durham asks her for pictures.Another of Durham s victims reported that the politician sent her  dozens  of texts in a similar vein. In fact, he seemed so persistent that it s a wonder he had time to work in between bouts of sexual harassment.A text from Durham, sent at about 1 a.m., asks the woman for pictures. For me, I was just trying to engage professionally, from one professional to another. And he crossed the line: You don t text and constantly message on Facebook and ask to meet up at bars in the evening,  the woman said. He would come up with these ideas and I would just be like,  Are you crazy?   All three women said they did not make formal complaints against Durham because they feared what he and his fellow politicians might do when they found out. When one victim finally did alert leaders in the Tennessee legislature, it became clear that their fears were well founded. Rather than immediately attempt to get to the bottom of it, the politicians quickly convened with lawyers and concluded that the best course of action was to silence her. When a colleague floated the idea of letting the victim address the Republican caucus, they dismissed it out of hand. I think the general response was that it would be a bad precedent, just to get somebody who shows up at a caucus meeting and goes after a member, without going through a formal process,  McCormick said.The  formal process  wound up accomplishing nothing. It took the explosive report in the Tennessean to kickstart Durham s downfall.This isn t Durham s first run in with scandal. Just two years ago, the Republican rising star was turned in by a pharmacist for trying to forge a drug prescription. When police arrived, Durham had a meltdown that was   in all its glory   caught on tape. (A grand jury later refused to indict him. Shocking.)Right on cue, Durham blamed the  liberal media  for his latest problems. Having been let off the hook before, it s looking as if Durham is expecting to weather this storm as well. He may have miscalculated. Adding to the bizarre spectacle happening in the Tennessee GOP, Durham appears to have been stripped of his post while he was busy watching football. When reporters called his house to ask about his resignation, it was all news to him. I m talking it over with my family but have not made a decision. Nothing should ve gone out. Watching Broncos game at the moment. Family values conservative getting caught doing anything but valuing families has become a painfully common hypocrisy for the Republican Party. While politicians of all stripes have moral failings, conservatives have long propped themselves up on the idea that they are ethically superior than their liberal counterparts.

Last week, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia (GCVM) put a call out for like-minded  patriots  to join them in a protest against the  tyrannical government  in Flint: To help our effort, The GCVM are requesting a show of support on Sunday, January 24, 2016 from Patriots and Patriot groups across the land as a united front, standing with all citizens of the City of Flint, MI. We ask Militia, Oath Keepers, III%, Home Guard, and all other like groups to wear your uniforms and insignia to this event. All others are welcome to join us as well! We ask that you only wear side arms and not long rifles, this is not about our 2nd Amendment, this is about the infringement on the good people of Flint. . God Bless the Republic. The Detroit Free Press reports that about thirty armed militiamen dressed in fatigues showed up for the event on Sunday and handed out clean water to the people in the community.Maj. Matt Krol, Executive Officer/Information Officer of the GCVM said that his group did not believe it was a  racial issue  and explained, We re here to defend this community. We re not going to allow (the government) to step on the people of Flint any longer.  He added: If it means having to take up arms in defense   we will do that as well. Okay, a couple of things here need to be addressed. First of all, thousands of people would not be sick and ten people would still be alive if Flint was a majority white, upper-class community. Race very much played a part in what happened, but so did their socioeconomic status. As we know, the two often go hand in hand.Secondly, arming themselves is not going to make the water in the community clean. That is just nonsense and it is the kind of insanity that makes the rest of us look at them and think that they are a bunch of nuts   even when they are trying to do something good.When this story first popped up across my Facebook newsfeed I thought, Ahhh here come the racist gun nuts trying to make a name for themselves on the backs of the minority community in Flint.  But as it turns out they were joined by African-Americans as well. Twenty-seven-year-old, La Mont Williams of Chicago defended GCVM and said: There s really no motivation other than the people of Flint need help and we re in the position where we can help People need water. You can t go three days without drinking water and if you can come out here and help, I ve been met with nothing but love, my little brother has been met with nothing but love and everyone seems to appreciate just two guys coming from Chicago and helping out. And I m pretty sure, the more the merrier. The militiamen definitely deserve to be commended for their work this weekend. While other groups like them often give the movement a bad name, they were really only interested in helping the desperate people in Flint.Bravo.

 Ben And Jerry’s Co-Founder Reveals Bernie Sanders Inspired Ice Cream (IMAGE),"Supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders can now cool down with a pint of ice cream after they  feel the Bern. Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben & Jerry s ice cream, has created a special batch of the desert In order to show his support for Sanders  presidential campaign: Bernie s Yearning.Ben Cohen, one of the co-founders of Ben & Jerry s ice cream, has for months talked about making a special flavor for his home-state senator. Earlier this month, Cohen told MSNBC that he would call the ice cream  Bernie s Yearning,  featuring a milk chocolate disk covering the top of plain mint ice cream. The disc is meant to represent  the huge majority of economic gains that have gone to the top 1% since the end of the recession. Beneath it, the rest of us,  reads the description on the back of the pint posted on the website.On the site promoting the ice cream, Cohen points out that this is his personal creation, and the ice cream does not have the official backing of the company (which has been a subsidiary of the conglomerate Unilever since 2000). Cohen writes,  Jerry and I have been constituents of Bernie Sanders for the last 30 years. We ve seen him in action and we believe in him. When we re out  speaking on his behalf people always ask if there s a Ben and Jerry s flavor. There s not. But if I were going to come up with one, this is what it would be. Cohen made 40 pints of Bernie s Yearning in his own kitchen, and said he would be donating 25 of those to the campaign. He has started a contest to donate the remaining 15 pints, numbered and signed by him.Cohen has been a long-time supporter of progressive causes, and has been a backer of presidential campaigns including Dennis Kucinich, Bernie Sanders, and Barack Obama. He also supports a campaign attempting to push a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court decision which has allowed a flood of corporate money in elections.Featured image via Bernie s Yearning",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Brags: Black People Are ‘Gonna Like Me More Than They Like Obama’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has an extremely messed up perception of his standing with minorities.After being wildly offensive when it comes to women, Hispanics, and Muslims, Trump seriously believes that African Americans will support him even though he s made it clear that he supports white supremacists. For years, Trump has boasted that he has  a great relationship with the blacks, and yesterday he made one of the most ridiculous claims in his campaign history (which is quite impressive, when you think about it). Trump believes he ll actually be more respected and loved by black people than President Barack Obama.In an interview with Fox News  Howard Kurtz, Trump was asked if he would reach out to minorities more. Forever-delusional Trump said he d be great with with Hispanics, Asians, and especially African Americans. Trump said: The African Americans love me, because they know I m gonna bring back jobs. The interview gets even more unbelievable as the Republican presidential front runner says: They re gonna like me better than they like Obama. The truth is Obama has done nothing for them. Kurtz actually looks very uncomfortable and confused as Trump is saying this, and asks The Donald if he in all seriousness just said that African Americans will like him more than America s first black president. Even in his column, Kurtz revealed that Trump s confident statement was so audacious  that he needed a moment before he could respond to the idiocy.Trump answered that although Obama has a  slight advantage  over him, once Trump completes his term of office, he ll be the clear favorite.Here s the video of the awkward video, which is almost too crazy to laugh at:Trump is in for a rude awakening if he thinks he s going to get the black vote   especially considering the fact that statistically, African Americans tend to vote Democratic over Republican by a long shot. Another statistic that Trump should really familiarize himself with before continuing to brag about how much more black people will prefer him over Obama is President Obama s approval rating. According to a 2014 Gallup poll, Obama s approval rating with black voters is 84%   which was actually the lowest of his entire time in the White House. If Trump thinks he can beat that, even when he proves that he is a racist bigot on an everyday basis, he s dreaming.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Creepy Young Ted Cruz Says He Wants To ‘Be In A Teen T*t Film, Rule Everything’","2016 Ted Cruz is a moralizing, holier than thou insufferable prick on a mission from Jesus to save America from liberals and Muslims and brown people. 1988 Ted Cruz, on the other hand, was an insufferable prick that wanted to be rich and powerful, rule the world and .be in a teen tit flick:Via Politico:The new clip was posted on YouTube under the name  Young Ted Cruz.  The operator of the account told POLITICO the video had been provided by a high school classmate of Cruz s who wished to remain anonymous. The video comes less than 10 days before the Iowa caucuses, where polls show Cruz at or near the lead.You might be saying that it s unfair to slam Cruz for being 18, but let s be honest here, if a video surfaced of an 18 year old Hillary Clinton doing anything even slightly embarrassing, we would never hear the end of it.For most people, this would just be an isolated incident from their past. Not so much for Ted Cruz. His college roommate, his classmates and pretty much everyone that s ever spent more than a few minutes with him have said pretty much the same thing: Ted Cruz is a smug, arrogant and thoroughly awful person with a reputation of  creepy  behavior around women. His time in Congress has been marked with an obsession with accumulating power at the expense of everyone around him.In this context, Cruz s aspirations as a teen seem less like a joke and more like an honest assessment, including his desire to be in a  teen tit film.  I have to agree with his father s attitude; when asked if Ted would one day rule the world, he simply says,  I hope not! So say we all.Featured image via screencap.",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Making A Murderer’ Prosecutor Ken Kratz Finds Sickening New Way To Profit From The Avery Case,"This article contains spoilersThe District Attorney responsible for the questionable 2005 convictions of Steven Avery and his 16-year-old nephew Brendan Dassey for the murder of Teresa Halbach has found a new and sickening way to profit from his actions: He is going to write a book.Ken Kratz became infamous after the release of Netflix docu-series Making a Murderer. Produced over 10 years by film makers Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi, the 10-part series details the harrowing plight of Steven Avery and his young nephew.First, Avery is falsely convicted of the rape of a woman and spends 18 years in jail before new DNA evidence clears him of the crime.Then, just two years after his release, and when he is on the verge of a $36 million settlement with the Manitowoc Sheriff s Department for their role in the false conviction and the failure of subsequent appeals, he is arrested for another murder. 25-year old Auto-Trader photographer Teresa Halbach disappears after an appointment at Avery s salvage yard, weeks later her car, and burned remains are found on Steven Avery s property.Despite the overwhelming physical evidence, questions linger in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Is the Sheriff s department framing him again? As the defense team start examining the evidence, it becomes clear that all is not right with this  evidence .But just as the prosecution s case is beginning to unravel, they obtain a confession from Avery s 16-year-old nephew Brendan Dassey. Katz holds a press conference which he opens like the title sequence of The Twilight Zone, warning viewers under 15 years of age to leave the room. He launches into a harrowing and explicit description of Teresa Halbach s murder.It later emerges that teenager s confession  was obtained after hours of interrogation, during which he had no attorney or legal guardian present. Much of the testimony appears to be fed to him by the investigating officers, and it is clear that Dassey (with an IQ of just 70) has very little idea of what is happening. Essentially, a false confession wrangled out of a mentally-disabled teenager.Regardless, Kratz milked the (later retracted) confession for all it was worth, holding no fewer than seven pre-trial press conferences in which he implicated Dassey and Avery in the crime.Legal experts have blasted Kratz for these tactics, which effectively ruled out any possibility of a fair trial for Avery and Dassey. Ben Kempinen, University of Wisconsin Law School clinical professor of law and director of the Prosecution Project, told the Post Crescent: To me, those press conferences would suggest a colorable violation of the (bar association) trial publicity rule. The risks of prejudice are magnified in smaller communities because of the pervasive nature of the publicity and the likelihood that virtually the entire community will have strong feelings about the case. The Avery case appeared to have captured the attention of the Fox Valley market   and you cannot un-ring that bell. Avery s lawyers filed a motion on this basis, asking the Judge to dismiss the charges against their client due to inflammatory and highly prejudicial  pre-trial publicity. However, Manitowoc County Circuit Judge Patrick Willis rejected the motion, ruling there was no legal precedent for such  drastic  action.Both Avery and Dassey were convicted in 2005, and have remained in jail ever since. It is hoped that the popular outrage mobilized by the doc-series will add new weight to their appeals process.Meanwhile, Ken Kratz was later caught up in a scandal of his own making. In 2009, married 55-year old Kratz was prosecuting a domestic abuse case on behalf of 26-year-old victim Stephanie Van Groll. However, Van Groll was forced to turn to police after receiving more than 30 sexually explicit texts from Kratz during the course of the prosecution. According to Radar, Kratz began with sexually suggestive messages: I know this is wrong. I am such an honest guy, and straight shooter but I have to know more about you  Are you the kind of girl that likes secret contact with an older married elected DA the riskier the better? However, when Van Groll refused to engage with his fantasies, he turned nasty, fast. Below are three of the many texts he sent her after she ignored his advances. Hey..Miss Communication, what s the sticking point? Your low-self esteem and you fear you can t play in my big sandbox?[sic] You may look good at first glance, but women that are blonde, 6ft tall, legs and great bodies don t like to be shown off or to please their men! [sic]  he wrote on Oct. 21. I m the atty. I have the $350,000 house. I have the 6-figure career. You may be the tall, young, hot nymph, but I am the prize Van Groll told police she was terrified. Kratz hinted he would throw her entire case out of court if she continued to refuse his advances, leaving her at the mercy of her violent partner.A year later, Kratz was divorced, and forced out of office over the scandal. Van Groll later filed a case of sexual harassment which was settled out of court in 2013.Now, Kratz is seeking to weasel his way out of the shadows with a book about the case, telling Action 2 news that he is Finally grateful to tell the whole story. Given Kratz s track record, we expect he is more grateful for the opportunity to cash in on the global attention generated by the success of the docu-series.If new evidence cannot be found, Steven Avery will remain in jail for the rest of his life, and Brendan Dassey is not eligible for parole until the year 2048. The fact that Kratz is still looking for ways to milk this injustice confirms what we suspected   this is a man without shame.Featured Image via Netflix/Post Crescent",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Conservative Leader Hears Tenant Speaking Arabic, What Happens Next Made Us Sick With Rage (IMAGES)","The case of a New York Conservative Party leader and her Muslim tenant has gone viral after people the world over were left stunned by perhaps one of the most horrifying cases of modern-day racism reported in the U.S.Last September, 33-year-old Morrocon-born woman Hasna Jalal moved into the $1,500 a month apartment in the Pompey Avenue building of MaryLou Shanahan, former chair of an NY branch of the Conservative Party. It was to be the beginning of months of racial abuse that would end with Shanahan facing felony charges of grand larceny, being in possession of $425,000 worth of stolen property of Jalal s, and a lawsuit for evicting Jalal because she was Muslim. It is however, the details of the harassment that take our breath away.Images via NY Post/SiliveThe suit alleges that the situation began on Sept 6 2015, when Shanahan overheard Jalal in the hall speaking Arabic to her Moroccan relatives. Shanahan reportedly screamed: I don t need anybody speaking Arabic in my house! The neighbors will think you re from Al Qaeda. From this day on, Shanahan launched a campaign of terror against Jalal. It seemed every time Jalal left her apartment, Shanahan would be there. As they passed, Shanahan would hurl insults such as  nasty Arab , and  slut! Next, Jalal would come home to find offensive notes pinned to her door. One read,  Get the f*ck out of my house. You re a f king nasty Arabic pig. This continued to escalate for nearly one month, before matters reached a horrifying climax.On Oct 4, Jalal returned home to find herself locked out of the apartment. The locks had been changed. She began calling on neighbors to try to establish what happened, and they told her they had seen Shanahan clearing the contents of the apartment with removal men earlier in the day. The landlord had emptied Jala s apartment and locked her out while she had been at work.All-in-all, Shanahan had confiscated $425,000 worth of Jalal s property.Jalal went to the police and Shanahan was arrested later the same day for grand larceny and possession of stolen property. But the conservative wasn t done yet. She took to Facebook to begin harassing Jalal all over again, posting: The police will not touch a sociopath, foreigner,  Moroccan, muslim. Jalal has since filed a lawsuit against Shanahan for evicting her on racial grounds, and the former Conservative Party chair will appear in court on the federal charges on Tuesday.This case comes amid a backdrop of hate crimes against Muslims in New York, which have risen sharply in the last year. Attacks against Muslim Americans and mosques in the state have tripled since the Paris Attacks and San Bernardino shootings. According to The New York Times:The spike includes assaults on hijab-wearing students; arsons and vandalism at mosques; and shootings and death threats at Islamic-owned businessesThese attacks have no doubt been incited by conservatives like Shanahan, who prey on the fear and prejudice of others for their own political ends. The same is playing out on the national stage, with the entire GOP clown car adopting a fundamentally racist, bigoted stance toward non-whites, and non-Christians. The result is the daily oppression and trauma suffered by the likes of Hasna Jalal and others, who simply want to get on and live the American dream.Featured Image via Flickr",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Matt Damon Did NOT Hold Back His Anger Against Rick Snyder Over Flint’s Water Crisis,"What s happening in Flint, Michigan is absolutely criminal. Not only is the water there poisoned and leading to children being diagnosed with lead poisoning, but those who are ultimately responsible are not being held accountable. This needs to change, and several people have been calling for Michigan Governor Rick Snyder (R) to resign. He s the man who put the officials in charge who changed Flint s water source. Officials who insisted the water was safe to drink.One person stepping up and demanding accountability is actor/producer Matt Damon. He has been involved, for a while now, in providing clean water around the globe and co-founded Water.org with Gary White. Both men are absolutely appalled over whats happening in Flint, because as they work hard to bring fresh water to third world nations, people in our own nation are going without clean water. Damon told the Daily Beast: At the very least he should resign! At the very least. Listen, everybody s entitled to a fair trial in the United States of America, but that man should get one. And soon. That s just my personal opinion In terms of the work that we do, to see it happening in Flint, every parent in America feels it on a visceral, deep level, because we ask the question,  What if that was my child?  It s unconscionable in Flint, and it s unconscionable that 663 million people around the world are dealing with that every day in the developing world. Those are the communities we interact with, and that s the mission of Water.org: to end that suffering for those children, and those parents. Gary White continued that sentiment, saying: We should be outraged about Flint. That shouldn t be happening in the United States, but it also drives home the point that it shouldn t be happening anywhere. Flint is the reality for many developing countries around the world. And knowing that race and socioeconomic status definitely play a role in how certain communities are treated not only here in the United States, especially in Flint, but also around the world, Damon added: My sincere hope for our country and our world is that this greater connectivity is going to lead to a greater empathy and an awakening to the plight of our fellow citizens. These are huge systemic injustices we re talking about that hopefully everybody is waking up to. The question then is, what do we do about it? It will be interesting to see where we go from here. The first step in doing that will be to hold those responsible for this outrageous neglectful act accountable, starting with Gov. Snyder. Many, including filmmaker Michael Moore are even calling for his arrest, and asking for a thorough investigation. Unfortunately, for the people of Flint, MI, the damage is done. The harm from the lead poisoning is irreversible. Justice must be served, and resources allocated to the people of that community to deal with any and all ongoing issues. We also need to make sure this never ever happens again, not only in Flint, but everywhere in this nation and around the globe.Featured image: Wikimedia/Wikimedia",News,"January 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Congrats NRA: Man Who Shot Woman At Benghazi Movie Was ‘Afraid Of Mass Shootings’,"A couple of days ago a woman in Washington was shot while watching the Benghazi movie  13 Hours  and thanks to the United States  obsession with guns. We are now learning that the shooter, Dane Gallion, 29, had a gun on him during the movie because he was terrified of being killed during a mass shooting.According to the Seattle Times:Dane Gallion, 29, told officers he took the gun to Regal Cinemas 14 at the Landing on Thursday night because he was  concerned about recent mass shootings in public places,  according to a police account in a probable-cause statement released Saturday.That same anxiety prompted him to keep the gun unholstered in his waistband, the statement says.Think about that for a minute: our country has had so many mass shootings that this man was so scared to go to the movies, he felt he had to bring a weapon to protect himself.We all know that the  good guy with a gun  rhetoric that the National Rifle Association and Republicans like to spew is complete nonsense, but not everyone is as educated as those of us who want stricter gun laws. A great number of people are willfully ignorant and just believe the lines they are fed from the gun lobby and their supporters.This, of course, doesn t excuse the shooting. It definitely should have never happened. A gun owner should know how to properly handle a gun so that things like this do not happen. Frankly, Gallion should have never been allowed to carry a gun if he was that paranoid; After all, paranoia makes people do reckless things.However, it certainly proves how damaging the last decade or so s mass shootings have been on the psyches of the people in this country. Personally, I have a little ball of fear in the pit of my stomach every single time I go to the movies too, or when I drop my elementary school aged child off at school. How sad is that? We live in a country that prides itself on its  freedom,  but how free are we?Featured image: YouTube",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Promises ‘Christianity Will Have Power’ If He Becomes President,"We all know how much conservatives love to whine about how persecuted they are for their mainstream beliefs, and continue promoting their completely skewed perception of what it s really like to be discriminated against.On Saturday during a speech in Iowa, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump revisited his previous comments where he d proposed that all Muslims be banned from coming into the United States, offering up a completely out of touch alternative scenario. Trump actually had the audacity to say that he would have had  less difficulty  if he had suggested a ban on Christians from coming into America instead of Muslims! The business mogul said to his audience at Dordt College, a Christian school: If I said that about Christians, and if I said  banned,  I m telling you I would have had less difficulty. And that s pretty sad, because we re Christians. I m Protestant. I m Presbyterian. Trump s faith has been questioned before   especially since he d recently said he doesn t like asking God for forgiveness. Now doing damage control, he s embracing the religious right full force. He said: I m a true believer. And you re many true believers   I hope all   is everybody a true believer in this room? I think so. But Christianity is under tremendous siege. The Donald also lamented that Christians weren t using their full power and political influence in the United States   and that they should step it up. The nonsense he s spewing is actually pretty terrifying: The power of our group of people together, I mean, if you add it up   it could be 240, 250 million. And yet we don t exert the power that we should have. Now, I think some of the churches are afraid of their tax status, to be honest.But you know the fact is that there is nothing the politicians can do to you if you band together. You have too much power. But the Christians don t use their power. We have to strengthen. Because we are getting   if you look, it s death by a million cuts   we are getting less and less and less powerful in terms of a religion, and in terms of a force. Trump pulled out all of the stops, even touching on one of the far-right s biggest religion-based complaints   the supposed  War On Christmas . Complaining that big department stores were not using  Merry Christmas  during the holiday season, he said: When they don t want to say  merry Christmas  in department stores anymore. I won t shop at places that don t say  merry Christmas.  Guess what? I don t too much shopping. No, no, it s true. When I see these stores, and they have a red wall and they have nothing on it. They don t want to say  merry Christmas  anymore. I say,  Why don t you say merry Christmas?' I ll tell you one thing: I get elected president, we re going to be saying  merry Christmas  again. Just remember that. And by the way, Christianity will have power, without having to form. And as if Trump being president wasn t terrifying enough, his promise to giving Christians more power should have everyone running out to the polls to prevent this nightmare from actually happening. He added: Because if I m there, you re going to have plenty of power. You don t need anybody else. You re going to have somebody representing you very, very well. Remember that.

 US Marine Puts Sarah Palin In Her Place For Blaming PTSD To Excuse Son’s Violent Behavior,"In an amazing open letter, a former US Marine slammed America s village idiot for having the gall to blame President Obama and PTSD for her son s domestic violence arrest.On the same day she incoherently endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, it was reported that Track Palin had been arrested on weapons and domestic violence charges.Rather than acknowledge that her son broke the law and is responsible for his own actions, Palin chose to blame President Obama and PTSD instead, even though Track Palin never saw combat during his one year in Iraq. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they re respected anymore,  Palin said. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder,  Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? My son, like so many others, they come back a bit different. They come back hardened, they come back wondering if there s that respect for what it is their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have so sacrificially given to this country.So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander-in-chief who will respect them and honor them. Needless to say, Palin instantly pissed off veterans across the country, including former US Marine Chris Mark, who also happens to be a Republican.In an open letter posted on his blog, Mark ripped Palin to shreds for using PTSD as a political attack and for using it to excuse her son s behavior. I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family s abhorrent, violent behavior,  Mark said.After reminding Palin that her entire family was involved in a drunken brawl that should have served as sign that Track has a problem, he went after Palin for stigmatizing PTSD even more than it already is by th media.Calling her statements  foolish and ignorant,  Mark wrote that he would prefer Palin  avoid public life and simply fade away.  But since she refuses to go away, Mark suggested she educate herself and then use her status as a public figure to help veterans.Here s the full letter via Global Security, Privacy, & Risk Management blog.Dear Mrs. Palin,I am a former US Marine and US Navy Officer with a Combat Action Ribbon as well as service connected disabilities. I am also a Republican. I have also served with, and am friends with, dozens of combat veterans who suffer daily from various injuries and wounds to include PTSD. I recently read your comments related to PTSD in which you attempted to excuse your son s arrest on domestic abuse charges and firearm charges by referencing his supposed PTSD. Based upon your previous comments I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family s abhorrent, violent behavior.In 2014 your entire family was involved in a late night  drunken brawl  at a party in which Track Palin (the accused domestic abuser) was involved in a bloody fight. While you publicly stated how proud you were at your children s violent actions, maybe this should have been a sign that Track has a problem. It is certainly curious that you did not feel the need to reference his supposed PTSD in this situation and instead stated:  my kids  defense of family makes my heart soar!  Maybe, instead of encouraging Track s violence, you should have taken the opportunity to get him help. Maybe, instead of being the result of PTSD, your son was simply trying to uphold the stated Palin family values and  make your heart soar  by abusing a woman.PTSD is stigmatized in the media and not well understood by the general public. An estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every day in the United States. This is nearly 8,000 veterans who take their lives every year. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) stated:  Every day in the United States, 22 veterans succumb to suicide   losing their personal battle to invisible wounds of war.  Veterans who have willingly given so much in service to their country should not have to bear the burden of being further stigmatized by your ignorant and foolish statements.While I do not propose to speak for all veterans, I am clearly not alone in my views regarding your unfortunate statements. They were unfortunate for the many veterans who face further disdain and discrimination based upon your inaccurate and ignorant portrayal of those who suffer with PTSD as well as the causes of the condition.While I would personally prefer that you simply avoid public life and simply fade away, if you insist on trying to use your  celebrity status  for a cause, please educate yourself on the facts of PTSD and try to help veterans by using your significant influence in a more productive, and less political manner. There are a number of veteran s organizations to which you can donate time, money and energy to make a difference.Regards,Chris MarkAnd there you have it. Sarah Palin made an ass of herself in public again and this Marine called out her stupidity, much like another veteran did during a rally in 2013 after Ted Cruz managed to persuade his fellow conservatives to shut the government down. Palin attempted to use veterans to criticize President Obama for not bowing down to Republican demands when one veteran reminded everyone that she s an idiot.But Palin really stepped in it this time around and now she has to answer to veterans across the country who actually deal with PTSD every day. She owes all of them a huge apology.Featured Image: Fox News",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: This Is What Happens When Media Asks Bernie Sanders Idiotic Questions (VIDEO),"During an on interview on This Week, Bernie Sanders had to deal with some seriously weak interview questions. The interviewer, Martha Raddatz brought up an allegation that Sanders  surging campaign has been  unsettling the markets.  That accusation is as ridiculous as it sounds.Here is how the interview went.Martha Raddatz: Senator Sanders, you said something to your supporters yesterday that caught my ear, you quoted with pride a Wall Street Journal article calling you a viable candidate, saying it appears that we are making Wall Street a little bit nervous and that s a good thing. The article was quoting Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman who said the markets are unsettled because of you, a slowdown in China and geopolitical risks. You re laughing, but I want to know why is it a good thing that the markets are in turmoil? People have their pension funds in the market? Lots of middle class people have their 401(k)s invested in stocks. It s not just Wall Street. Everybody is affected by this. Bernie Sanders: The reason that I am laughing is I fully admit to having a big ego, like many other politicians. But the idea that Bernie Sanders  candidacy, because it has growing support all over this country, is unsettling world markets is absolutely absurd. The point I was making is we are getting the attention of Wall Street. Wall Street s greed and recklessness and illegal behavior drove this economy into the worst recession since the Clutch Plague. Millions of people lost their homes, their life savings and their jobs. And yes I believe that we have to break up the major financial institutions. We have to reestablish Glass-Steagall. And that we are now gaining the attention of Wall Street tells me that our campaign is doing very well. Here s the interview:For those not in the know, the Blackstone Group is one of the largest and most powerful private entities on the planet. They currently manage over $300 billion dollars in assists. Stephen Schwarzman currently has a net worth of $9.8 billion dollars. If anyone has been a beneficiary of the deregulation of Wall St., it s Schwarzman. It isn t surprising that he, the WSJ, (who notoriously published a completely debunked hit piece on Sanders) and the mainstream media would be pushing this kind of nonsense. They just want to make it sound like Sanders is coming after people s 401(k)s, etc.Which couldn t be further from the truth. As Sanders pointed out, people lost everything under our current system of Wall Street-take-all finance.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via YouTube  h/t Egberto Willies",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Man Wearing Turban Kicked Out Of Trump Rally, Then Things Get Even More Racist (VIDEO)","At this point, it seems like Donald Trump cannot hold a rally without there being a protest. Some of those protestors have a tendency to be beaten, and or forcefully removed from the event. On Sunday, during a campaign rally in Muscatine, Iowa, a man wearing a red turban was forced to leave the venue.He was with a group of people protesting the event. He was carrying a sign that said,  Stop Hate.  That s a message completely antithetical to the values of Trump and his supporters.A video shows the crowd at the event was ecstatic about the man being forced to leave. Hundreds of people can be heard cheering and shouting,  U.S.A! U.S.A.! U.S.A!  It s a pretty good symbol for where America s racism is at. That s when Trump says: He wasn t wearing one of those hats, was he? Protesters escorted out of @realDonaldTrump rally ""He wasn't wearing one of those hats was he?"" Trump asks crowd pic.twitter.com/Aow23SHZAN  Josh Haskell (@joshbhaskell) January 24, 2016People quickly jumped Trump, thinking that he was referring to the man s turban. Apparently Trump was asking if the man was wearing a  Make America Great Again  hat that Trump supporters use to identify each other with. It s the 21st century equivalent to the white hood the KKK wears. In Trump s America you do not need to cover your face to be openly racist.It isn t hard to believe why people are protesting Trump. Just last week he retweeted @whitegenocideTM, a Twitter account known for putting out images like one that shows Donald Trump pulling the lever on a gas chamber with Bernie Sanders inside. Bernie Sanders being a Jewish man, who embodies everything that Trump and his supporters are against.  Values such as, equality, tolerance, and the idea that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. Donald Trump has brought out the worst of the United States and exposed the Republican for what it is. A party built out of white supremacy.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via Twitter",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Civil Rights Hero Nearly Killed By KKK Has A Warning About Donald Trump,"Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) was nearly killed by the Ku Klux Klan while helping to lead the Freedom Rides in Alabama in 1961. He knows the destructive power of racist hatred first hand, and he is now warning about the forces that have been stirred up by the divisive presidential campaign of Republican candidate Donald Trump. I ve been around a while and Trump reminds me so much of a lot of the things that George Wallace said and did,  Lewis said in an interview with The Times after speaking at Cal State L.A.  I think demagogues are pretty dangerous, really.   We shouldn t divide people, we shouldn t separate people. Sometimes I feel like I am reliving part of my past. I heard it so much growing up in the South,  he said.  I heard it so much during the days of the civil rights movement. As a people, I just think we could do much better. Trump launched his campaign with a divisive message of racism, accusing Mexicans of being criminals and  rapists.  Since then, it has gotten worse. Trump-inspired thugs have attacked Latinos. His campaign supporters have   on multiple occasions   attacked black demonstrators at Trump s own rallies, sometimes egged on by the candidate himself. And Trump has also proposed a ban on Muslim travel to the United States.As former chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Rep. Lewis is the last of the  big six  leaders of the Civil Rights Movement still alive (the others are Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young).Lewis was attacked by the KKK while participating in the Freedom Rides, buses of young activists that went to register black voters in segregated Alabama. The Klan deflated the tires of the bus he was on and forced it to stop. They attacked Lewis and the other riders, beating them for trying to accomplish their peaceful mission. Speaking about the attack years later, Lewis explained,  It was very violent. I thought I was going to die. I was left lying at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery unconscious. Lewis was also beaten by Alabama State Troopers on Bloody Sunday as civil rights marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. His skull was fractured after he and others were hit with night sticks.For his role in the civil rights struggle, Rep. Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2011.Featured image via The White House",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SNL Parodies All-White Oscars In Brutal Smackdown (VIDEO),"Last night, Saturday Night Live delivered a brutal blow to Hollywood s diversity issues, calling the Academy Awards out for overlooking minority actors in favor of all-white nominees.The Academy s diversity problem came to light when nominees were announced for the 88th annual Academy Awards  revealing that no black actors were nominated for individual acting categories. If you look at the Awards  entire history, a mere 31 of over 2,900 Oscars have been awarded to African American actors, and it s been two years since a non-white actor has been nominated.Once the nomination lineup was released, many celebrities and directors spoke out against the seemingly racist ceremony, and SNL added its voice to the controversy in a powerful parody. Although SNL never once mentioned the Academy Awards, the show s intention for their  Screen Guild Awards couldn t be more clear as cast member Cecily Strong announced all-white nominees for best actor films representative of Creed,   Straight Outta Compton,  and  Beasts of No Nation. It isn t long before you notice that the  Best Actor  winners are all-white nominees with little to no on-screen or speaking roles. You can watch the video below:Many celebrities such as Jada Pinkett Smith, director Spike Lee, Danny DeVito and Viola Davis have called Hollywood out for its racism and lack of diversity. In no time, #OscarsSoWhite was trending on social media. On Instagram, Lee wrote: We cannot support it and [I] mean no disrespect   But, how is it possible for the second consecutive year all 20 contenders under the acting category are white? And let s not even get into the other branches. Forty white actors in two years and no flava at all. We can t act?! WTF!! Amid the controversy, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has made emergency changes to ensure that more diversity is included in the future. These changes in rules include increasing the number of nominees in every category, expanding the number of films for  best picture  to ten and adding new members to its committees to help make important decisions about membership and governance.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Florida Governor Rick Scott Tax Cut His Way Into Massive HIV/AIDS Comeback,"Rick Scott has been governor of Florida for just over one term but already the state is feeling the effects of his conservative fanaticism. While the rest of the country continues to combat the spread of HIV and the number of people dying from AIDS drops, Florida is seeing the reverse.In a comprehensive review of how Scott s war against government led to his deep slashes in public health funding, the Miami Herald discovered two disturbing facts: Florida now leads the nation in HIV cases, and its biggest county, Miami-Dade, is ground zero.New cases last year totaled 6,240, the highest since 2002. Miami-Dade and Broward together account for 38 percent of that total.Although Florida is among the nation s fastest-growing states, Scott has pushed every year to trim the state work force, and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the Department of Health.The 67 county health departments, largely funded by the state health agency, have declined to 10,519 positions compared to 12,759 in the year Scott took office. It s indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services,  said Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens.  We have a rise in AIDS and we have a reduction in public health spending. We re now cutting just to be cutting. Indeed, Scott is often cited as one of the conservative movement s standard bearers. He s a tax-cutting superstar in the same vein as Kansas Governor Sam Brownback (who imploded his state s economy) and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder (whose neglect poisoned an entire city).However, he differs from his fellow conservative tax-slashers in that he doesn t even seem remorseful for the negative impact he s had. At least Brownback had the decency to break down in tears after destroying his state s job growth. In a disturbing reminder of the Reagan era, when conservative politicians intentionally ignored the AIDS epidemic contributing to the deaths of thousands by their apathy, Scott appears to be unconcerned about this surge in HIV cases. Or perhaps he s just grown used to it. After his first year in office, the number of HIV cases has grown hand-over-fist.Making matters worse, Scott has routinely fought against working with Obamacare in his state. For years. All the while, HIV cases piled up as his budget cuts took hold. This spells disasters for the victims of HIV because the best and only way to prevent it from turning into the much deadlier AIDS illness is careful health management. You can t get that if your governor has refused to expand access to health insurance to spite the President.As we ve seen around the country, Republicans who have grown used to screaming about the  tyranny  of big government are met with disaster when they attempt to get rid of it. Far from the freedom of living a life of liberty and self-determination, states that try to cut government spending only cause misery for the citizens they are trying to  liberate.  It s easy to say as a concept that  government is bad,  but harder to accept that you can no longer get healthcare or build safe roads without it.Florida is learning the hard way that government spending isn t always  wasteful.  Oftentimes it is being used to keep the real threats like illness and poverty at bay.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Superhero Cop Shows Us All What A Good Police Officer Looks Like (IMAGES),"It s not often enough that we see a story about a good police officer who goes above and beyond the call of duty, which is why this story is so awesome.It s true that police officers around the country have developed a bad reputation. There are bad apples in every department who can t keep their guns holstered, and they end up killing unarmed individuals for no reason. The fallout has been swift. And rightfully so.But there are good cops out there who not only do the right thing at work, they do extraordinary things off the clock as well which should be newsworthy, too.Take Damon Cole of the Fort Worth Police Department in Texas, for example.When he isn t fighting crime as a police officer, Cole takes two weeks off every year and spends it traveling the country visiting cancer-stricken children in hospitals dressed as different superhero characters. And he does this on his own time with his own money. I dress up as different Superheroes (Superman, Batman, Iron Man, Captain America and Baymax) and I travel the country seeing children with cancer on my own time and money,  he explained on Facebook. After winter is over I will take 2 weeks off from work and I will go through 20 states in my custom 2012 Superman Dodge Charger to all the children s hospitals. If anyone on here knows of any children who are sick or have cancer, PM and I will go see them. I do NOT charge anything, I do all this on my own time and money. I will go anywhere to make a child happy. I also go to schools or any community functions to talk to kids about being a police officer then a become a Superhero for them. Back in October I took a week off from work and I drove to Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, New York City and Tennessee to see children with cancer. Here are several photos of Cole in action.Cole even started a non-profit organization called Heroes and Cops Against Childhood Cancer.Here s the full post on Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;This guy is the kind of hero every police officer should aspire to be both in and out of uniform.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump’s Billionaire Neighbor Could Enter Race, And Split The Vote For A Trump Win","A fellow multi-billionaire from New York and neighbor to none other than Donald Trump has already laid the groundwork for entering into the 2016 presidential race. That person is Michael Bloomberg   and this time, he s not only flirting with the possibility, but he s also considering throwing in $1 billion of his own money to make it happen. While that may be a lot of dough for the Donald (a sizeable percentage at least) for Bloomberg, it s practically nothing.The former Mayor of New York is no stranger to politics, either, having served in the position for 11 years, and he s worth an estimated $37.2 billion. That makes him the 12th richest person in the world today, according to Forbes. If anyone could make a dent in the race, it s him.He would have to run as an independent, for sure, and while the chances of him winning would be slim to none taking that path, here s what s more important: Bloomberg entering the race would be a straight-up disaster for Democrats, to say the least. And, it makes you start to think along these terms; is a billionaire going to buy the presidency this go around, for a fellow New York billionaire?Mr. Bloomberg says he would be in it to win it, but let s look at the numbers: The Washington Examiner did a poll already on this and had Trump winning in a three-way race if Clinton gets the nomination. Trump would receive around 37 percent of the vote to Clinton s 36 percent while Bloomberg would only tally 13 percent. While it s possible there could still be a Clinton win within the margin of error, it opens up a path for a Trump win, period. Just giving Trump a possible win is enough to make this scary.The elections department at the Huffington Post has a vast array of polls pitting Clinton against Trump, going back months. Guess what, Clinton has won in a head to head matchup against the Donald in 23 out of the last 28 conducted. That s an overwhelming amount. It s safe the say that having an independent of Bloomberg s stature running is something Democrats would rather end up avoiding.Why Bloomberg thinks he would have a chance in this thing, other than to hand the presidency over to the GOP is beyond us. But   according to several sources in his camp, he s apparently hoping that Bernie Sanders takes some key early states, at which case he could step in around an early March time frame. If Bernie takes momentum away from Clinton, Bloomberg thinks he has a chance. Here s what that tells us: Bloomberg could take even more votes away from the Democratic Party   he thinks anyways   than he would from the Republican Party were Sanders to win the nomination. That doesn t look good, either.His record backs that up, too: he s pro-gun control, pro-abortion, recognizes climate control is a huge problem, is for immigration reform; in practically every social view he leans to the left. The only thing that hurts him with Democrats is the fact that he has close ties to Wall Street and has a lot of business views that aren t exactly great for poor people.Even Trump wouldn t mind Bloomberg jumping in. The New York Times even made it the title of their latest article announcing the news: Donald Trump Would  Love  to See Michael Bloomberg Run. I would love to see Michael run   I would love the competition. I d love to see what would happen. (We run) different kinds of business, it s a very different kind of business, but I would say that if he ran, I d be very happy about it. He s not the only one either who sees Bloomberg running as a gold mine for Trump. Alan Patricof, a financier and longtime donor to the Clintons, said it would be a  terrible thing  for the Democratic Party if the former Mayor decides to run as an independent. If it was President Trump or President Bloomberg, I d certainly rather have President Bloomberg. But, it certainly can t help the Democrats. Mr. Patricof might prefer Bloomberg, but that doesn t mean Bloomberg would come out ahead. Ari Fleischer, a former White House Press Secretary for President George W. Bush says this would be a godsend for his party. Bloomberg s entry into the race would be a dream come true for Republicans. He would draw mostly from the Democratic column.  I hope he runs. If there s one thing we know, Bloomberg is no idiot. If he enters the race, he must know he d only be doing a favor for Trump. And, that on the face of it, doesn t make him an enemy of Donald Trump. If anything, it would make them best friends, no matter what they d like voters to think of their relationship to one another.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Blasts The Entire U.S. Congress For Their Corruption (VIDEO),"On the sixth year anniversary of the Supreme Court s Citizens United v. FEC decision that granted billionaires, millionaires, and special interests the ability to essentially buy U.S. elections by donating virtually unlimited amounts of money to superPACs, Elizabeth Warren wanted to make a statement, and it wasn t pretty. She not only blasted the Supreme Court for the decision, but the entire U.S. Congress, as well. This is what we ve come to expect and love Senator Warren for, and she didn t disappoint. It was brutal, to say the least.Here is what she had to say, in part: Six years ago today the Supreme Court overturned a century of established law. And, in doing so, unleashed a secret flow of corporate money into our political system. The Supreme Court created a big problem, but that does not mean anyone with any integrity must just roll over and play dead. No, it is time to fight back.This Congress doesn t lack for workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics, this Congress just lacks a spine to do it!

Warren does have the courage to stand up to the super wealthy. Would you be excited if Senator Warren was Bernie Sanders choice for Vice President?Posted by Viva Bernie 2016 on Thursday, January 21, 2016She called on Congress to pass three measures to end this none sense once and for all:Pass The Fair Elections Now Act. This will create public funding for congressional elections matching the contributions of small donors so working families would have a louder voice and begin to compete with the rich and powerful. This is a bi-partisan solution, at least outside of Washington. According to a recent poll, Democrats and Republicans both agreed strongly with the idea of citizen-funded elections. 72 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of Republicans said YES. This bill was first introduced by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) back in 2014. As you may very well know by now, no actions have been taken on it. Take a look, HERE.Pass the Disclose Act. (This will) force super PACs out of the shadow and make them tell us where the money comes from. 91 percent of Democrats and 91 percent of Republicans agree they need to disclose the source of their funding. This was re-introduced by Rep. Chris Van Hollen (MD-D) in January 2015 and referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice back on 2/5/2012. Since then, as you might be able to guess, nothing has been done with it. Take a look, HERE.Pass the Shareholder Protection Act. To force companies to tell their shareholders how much money they re giving to politicans and which politicians they re giving it to. This is the shareholders money and they have a right to know how it s spent. And, if they don t like how the money is being spent, they can put somebody else in charge. This bill was re-introduced, as well, by Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) also in January 2015. It was read only twice where it has since collected nothing but dust. Take a look, HERE.She really ended up giving seven ideas, including a constitutional amendment to solve the problem, but summed up the majority of her comments on those first three. Senator Warren decided to speak up on the anniversary of Citizens United because the majority of Congress just doesn t seem to care, and for that we thank her. If anything like this is ever going to get passed, the people will need to DEMAND it.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Two Dead After Father-Son Shootout At Gun Store,"An argument over a $25 gun repair charge led to a father-son shootout, at gun store in Mississippi.The shootout involved two different fathers and their sons. According to police, at around 3:00 pm on Saturday a man and his son went to the McLemore Gun Shop, located in Pearl River County. They were there to pick up a gun that had been dropped off for repairs.The man reportedly became irate after being told that the gun was not ready, and that there was a $25 service charge due.The wife of the gun shop owner, who was working the counter at the time, called her husband and son to deal with the angry gun-owner.A tussle broke out between the two fathers and their sons, which led to pushing and shoving, and then a hail of gun fire.WLOX reports that four people were shot during exchange. The 40-year-old owner of McLemore Gun Shop, located in Pearl River County, died from injuries sustained during the shootout. The owner s 17-year-old was also pronounced dead at the scene.The other gun-owner, a father in his 50 s, and his son, described as a man in his late 20 s, were seriously injured during the gun fight. Both men were taken by helicopter to local hospitals.At this time, it s unknown which of the four armed men fired the first shot.According to NRA propaganda, the only way to keep from getting shot is to surround yourself with lots and lots of guns. Yet somehow this gun shop owner and his 17-year-old son are both dead, in spite of the fact that they were surrounded by lots and lots of guns.We keep hearing that  Guns don t kill people. People kill people.  But arguments and shoving matches can not turn into full-fledged shootouts unless there are guns around for angry people to get their hands on.The right wing will tell you that fathers and sons bonding over guns is an  American tradition. Kids getting shot is also a uniquely American tradition. Every year at least 10,000 children under the age of 18 are injured or killed by guns in the United States. We can add another 17-year-old to the nameless statistics that we traditionally count at the end of each year.Featured image credit: Niels Noordhoek via Wikipedia, cc 3.0",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Journalist Kicked Out Of World’s Largest Gun Show For Asking This Totally Valid Question (VIDEO),"Wednesday, January 22 was the day of the world s largest gun show. Held in Las Vegas, Nevada, the SHOT show (Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade) is where arms dealers gather to show off their best and newest instruments of death. Understandably, the event sponsors have to keep a tight grip on media at the event, lest journalists ask questions that might make people think just a little bit.That s why when The Guardian s Rupert Neat went to the show to ask people questions that are indirectly related to gun control, he must have known it would be only a matter of time before he would be thrown out of the event. Neat s experiences were documented on video, and then posted online.In the beginning of the video, Neat says that he was specifically asked not to talk about gun control with any of the more than 1,600 hundred exhibitors at the event. Despite this warning, Neat actually talked to many of the exhibitors and attendees of the event about questions indirectly related to gun control, before being kicked out of the show. Neat asked people what they thought was driving the huge boom in gun sales that were seen last year.They re answers were nearly identical   fear. Fear is what is driving the record sales of firearms in the United States. It has been well documented that mass shootings drive gun sales. So does talk of gun control, when President Obama is elected/reelected, and when minuscule actions on gun control are taken. In December of 2015, after President Obama announced he would be taking executive actions to slightly increase gun regulations, 1.6 million guns were sold. The only other month that has topped that record was in January of 2013, which coincided with both the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre, and Obama s second term.But those types of questions are not what get Neat kicked out of the gun show. While talking to an exhibitor with Smith & Wesson, Neat was shown a MP 1522 sport rifle. Neat held the gun and casually asked the exhibitor: So, is the same gun used in the San Bernardino shooting?  Neat asks.The exhibitor dodged the question, simply answering that the gun is MP 1522 sport rifle. He then promptly removes his microphone. At that point Neat gets an e-mail asking him to come speak to the communications director at the event. Neat and his crew are told multiple times to stop filming, and refused to answer any questions while the camera was rolling. Neat then left the gun show.The truly disturbing   and important   aspect of the encounter between the journalist and man from Smith & Wesson is that it shows how dangerous breaking the fantasy that the NRA and other lobby groups sell, is to gun manufacturers. The goal of public relations is to sell a credible version of reality. The reality that weapons manufacturing industry wants to sell is that their weapons are tools to fight dangerous people, not tools used by dangerous people   or toddlers. Any questioning that can potentially unravel the credibility of their meticulously crafted version of reality must be silenced, or disregarded as the deranged ramblings of lunatics.You can watch the video, in full, below.https://www.facebook.com/GuardianUs/videos/1264293813597683/Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via Facebook/Guardian US",News,"January 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH Tina Fey’s Triumphant Return To SNL As Crazy Sarah Palin Endorsing Trump,"Tina Fey once again took on Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, and as always, it was a gutbuster.Fey opened the January 23 edition of the comedy show with the  cold open,  appearing as Palin next to Darrell Hammond s always-on-point rendition of Donald Trump. The two were re-enacting Palin s bizarre endorsement of Trump from earlier in the week.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDKKe04sBQIntroducing her, Trump said,  I hope nobody s allergic to nuts, because we got a big one here. Palin then launched into a monologue eerily reminiscent of the real thing, freestyle rhyming about the Americans she supposedly is representing as part of the Trump trainwreck.Palin explained,  I belong in [Trump s] cabinet.  Cause I m full of spice, and I ve got a great rack. In a moment made for social media, Fey/Palin also spoke in tongues, shooting off her finger guns:Speaking for most of America, Trump noted,  She s crazy, isn t she? Fey of course also appeared in a version of Palin s blinding blouse from the event, and many observers on social media pointed out that in addition to the shocking visual similarity between the two women, Fey had once again nailed Palin s accent and bizarre language.In 2008, Fey s impression of Palin set the comedy world on fire and SNL s ratings skyrocketed. The failed vice presidential candidate and half-term governor was repeatedly a source of material for the premiere satirical program in America, with her assertion that she read  all  of the media, and that Alaska provided a vantage point for oversight of Russia s Vladimir Putin.Palin recently tried to return the favor, appearing as Fey in a sketch for a conservative website, but despite the visual similarities, the skit mostly fell flat. Instead of going for the joke, as Fey has on SNL, Palin chose to promote a political message about  political correctness  and  safe spaces.

 Dixie Chicks’ Natalie Maines Dusts Off Infamous Quote To Thoroughly Troll Ted Cruz (TWEET),"It s hard to believe that it s been nearly 13 years since Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks perfectly spoke her mind in reference to the impending Iraq war. If you don t remember what she said, let me remind you: Just so you know, we re on the good side with y all. We do not want this war, this violence, and we re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas. This, of course, sparked a huge backlash against not only Maines, but the Dixie Chicks. People everywhere couldn t believe that she d have the perfect audacity to speak up against an unjust war and against the president who was leading the charge into Iraq. Dissent is usually considered patriotic, but apparently not if the dissenting voice is against a warmongering conservative president.Well, dusting off her infamous quote on Twitter, Maines just completely roasted Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz. Another Republican from Texas who loves war and wouldn t think twice about send our troops anywhere he thought there was a need, necessary or not. Diplomacy be damned.Maines tweeted:Just so you know .I'm ashamed Ted Cruz is from America;) pic.twitter.com/QU39ERnAzN  Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) January 24, 2016And mind you, the quotes are absolutely perfect that she chose. The first being from former President Eisenhower, a man who knew the dangers of war, because he lived through the worst we ve ever had. Then paired with Sen. Cruz, a Canadian born chickenhawk, and far from the Republican that Eisenhower was, who claims he ll  carpet bomb  the enemy to make them  glow in the dark. Maines reminds America of the stupidity of electing yet another senseless fool to the White House and the inevitable war it would cause. A war that would send thousands more of our troops to unnecessarily die. However, Maines does it with a perfectly sarcastic spin when she says: Just so you know .I m ashamed Ted Cruz is from America;) The wink is seemingly insinuating two things: that he s a repeat of George W. Bush, so the same quote was necessary, and also that he was born in Canada, which was confirmed with this tweet:I stand corrected Just so you know, I'm ashamed Ted Cruz claims to be American. pic.twitter.com/JUltNImOXH  Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) January 24, 2016Cruz is definitely a person to be ashamed of, because not only is he dangerous, he s smarmy as hell and as greasy as a used car salesman to get what he wants done. Even if that means reading Green Eggs and Ham on the floor of the Senate to shut down the United States government.Good on you, Maines.. Well frickin  done.

 Michigan Government To EPA: ‘You Can’t Tell Us What To Do’,"On January 22, in response to an emergency order issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the Flint water crisis, Michigan s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Director, Keith Creagh, wrote that the state is questioning whether the EPA has  legal authority  to  order a state and its agencies  to act to protect the health of its citizens.The order, issued by the EPA on Thursday, states: The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) provides the US Environmental Protection Agency with the authority to order actions when an imminent and substantial endangerment exists and the actions taken by the state/and or local authorities are inadequate to protect public health. EPA has determined that the city of Flint and the state of Michigan s responses to the drinking water crisis in Flint have been inadequate to protect public health and that these failures continue. As a result, the EPA is issuing this emergency order to make sure that the necessary actions to protect public health happen immediately. Under the order, the state of Michigan is required to  promptly  provide the public with  necessary information,  in a  clear and transparent way to assure that accurate, reliable and trustworthy information is available to inform the public and decisions about next steps. That includes an order to create a public website where the state is required to post all reports, sampling results, plans, weekly status reports and  all other documents required under this order. As many people already realize, the Snyder administration is not fond of transparency. Michigan is one of only two states in the country in which the governor is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Emergency managers and other members of Snyder s administration have conducted business behind closed doors throughout Snyder s two terms as governor, leading to repeated battles over violations of the state s open meetings act.Aside from releasing relevant information to the public, the EPA order requires the Snyder administration to provide the Flint EPA Task Force with all of the information it has been trying to get from Michigan officials since November. You can view the long list of items that the state has refused to turn over to the Task Force here. The state now has ten days to produce all of that information.The Snyder administration must also bring in qualified professionals to deal with the situation, something else the state was instructed to do, but has not done. The state has 15 days to comply.The EPA s order provides a detailed overview of the ongoing failures of the state, Snyder appointed emergency managers in Flint, and Snyder appointed officials at the DEQ.As Addicting Info reported here, the state supplied the EPA with documents that were altered and test results that were purposely skewed to make it appear that the water in Flint was fine.During the annual State of the State address, Michigan s governor Snyder told the citizens that he was very sorry for poisoning the residents Flint.He went on to say: You deserve accountability. You deserve to know that the buck stops here with me. Creagh s unbelievable two-fold response to the EPA order can be read as  we haven t done anything wrong,  followed by  you don t have the authority to make us do anything right. How s that for accountability?Creagh states in his response to the EPA that the state will comply with the EPA s order, but intends to  fully outline the state s legal and factual concerns  as to whether or not the EPA has the  authority  to issue the order.On Wednesday the state of Michigan received $80 million from the federal government, in addition to the $5 million that was granted to the state earlier this month, following the declaration of state of emergency in Flint. So every U.S. taxpayer is now paying the bill for Snyder s corruption and incompetence.Yet the Snyder administration has the audacity to claim that the EPA doesn t have the authority to tell the state what to do.It s disgusting and infuriating that Snyder s administration has to be forced to do what it should have done months ago. These are basic things, like getting the necessary information to the public, cooperating with the EPA Task Force and bringing in trained and qualified professionals who can address the situation. These are things the Snyder administration should have done without an order from the federal government, but they did not.In the midst of all of this, the people of Flint are struggling to cope with a crisis that most of us cannot even fathom.Featured image credit: Duncan Creamer via Flckr cc 2.0",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bundy Terrorist Dragged His Little Girls Out Of School To Serve As Human Shields In Oregon Standoff,"What kind of man would pull his daughters from the safety of their school and place them in the middle of an armed standoff? A Bundy terrorist.On January 2nd, Ammon Bundy and his deranged band of gun-toting marauders seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in an effort to force the federal government to release two idiot ranchers who illegally set fire to federal land. The pair were sentenced to five years in prison, which is the mandatory sentence for such a crime.Of course, Bundy and others who dare to call themselves a  militia  decided to takeover the wildlife refuge in protest and are hoping to spark a war with federal law enforcement. But they arrived abysmally unprepared and began begging the public to send them supplies to aid in their lawbreaking, which thus far includes treason, domestic terrorism, illegally carrying firearms on federal property, property damage, threatening law enforcement, disturbing Native American artifacts, and being total douchebags.And now we can add child endangerment and abuse to the growing list.According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, a terrorist within Bundy s camp actually pulled his little girls, 8 and 9 years of age, out of their school and brought them to the wildlife refuge:OPB is not naming the kids, nor their parents, to protect the identity of the children, but the mother and father are active and vocal militants in the armed occupation. Both parents have been involved in the incident since its start Jan. 2.The children were visible inside one of the buildings Thursday evening. One of the little girls asked to come outside by a campfire but was not allowed. The kids were also seen playing and wrestling together in a hallway in their pajamas.The kids are from out of state and have been at the refuge since early this week. They spend most of their time out of sight of reporters and visitors.So these little girls have basically been held hostage for the last three weeks and have not been allowed outside all this time. They are surrounded by loaded firearms and by assholes of questionable character.They have also missed significant school time and they probably aren t receiving proper nourishment either. And as you ll recall, the last time the Bundys had a little standoff with federal law enforcement, they were cowardly and used women and children as human shields.This is child endangerment and abuse and it s time to arrest these monsters before something terrible happens to these little girls. Federal authorities have allowed this dog and pony show go on long enough and we all know that if this were an armed group of Muslims or black men, there would be no hesitation to shoot them on site whether they are armed or not. But for some reason, these white rednecks have been given free reign while the Justice Department looks the other way. Two little girls are being forced to stand in the crossfire while Ammon Bundy gets to come and go as he pleases.Enough is enough. Bundy and his minions have had their fun. Now it s time for them to face the consequences of their stupidity.Featured image: Babble",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 That Time An Ohio Ammosexual 2nd Amendmented Himself In A Chik-Fil-A Bathroom,"Ammosexuals also tend to be anti-gay bigots, so it s no surprise that this particular unfortunate victim of his own love of his penis extension gun would shoot himself in the bathroom of a Chik-fil-A location.While most of us boycott the Christian chicken chain out of sheer principle, but not the 45-year-old victim of his own hubris. He was apparently pulling up his pants in the facilities of the locations (hey, even gun nut heroes have to use the john now and then, right?) when the Glock pistol went off. Luckily for the unnamed miscreant, the bullet only grazed his leg. Hardly a fatal injury, of course, but still quite unfortunate and dangerous.Local station WHOH tweeted the story, but, at this time, there is not much information. The victim was able walk out of the Chik-Fil-A location and transport himself to a local hospital for medical care. The injury is not serious, and, of course, no charges will be filed.BREAKING: Fairfield Twp police and medics say a man accidentally shot himself in the bathroom of the Chick-fil-a. pic.twitter.com/GwXHFz12MI  WMOH Newswire (@WMOHNEWSWIRE) April 28, 2015That s the real rub, though. This guy luckily only shot himself. However, how many incidences have there been of  responsible gun owners  injuring or even killing other people where the law decides that it was just an accident? Too many to count, really. This is just evidence of the fact that we need tighter laws regarding firearm ownership. Not everyone who is eligible to buy, own, and conceal carry a gun should be able to do so.This guy likely was another nutjob who couldn t bear to be anything but fully locked and loaded, even in a public restroom in a self-proclaimed family restaurant, and he was injured as a result. What about next time, though? And, believe me, there will be a next time. No one who is irresponsible enough to have an  accident  like this is a one-off shooter. In fact, if  he were any sort of normal, responsible gun owner, he d have never been pulling his pants up in a Chik-Fil-A bathroom with a fully loaded gun in the first place.Featured image via video screen capture from NY Daily News",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cher Goes On Yet Another GLORIOUS Twitter Tirade About Flint’s Poisoned Water (TWEETS),"Cher has certainly used her power, money, and influence to help the people who are suffering from their water being poisoned by Michigan s Republican Governor Rick Snyder. She has already gifted water to the residents of Flint, and now she is using her influence on social media to remind the whole world just what a travesty the whole situation is.First, the superstar singer-turned-activist reminded everyone of her own humble beginnings. You see, Cher wasn t always rich and famous. She was, in fact, quite poor, as she reveals in one tweet. However, she also says that no matter how destitute they were, her mother was never afraid to let her drink or bathe in the water flowing from their taps:I remember my mom crying because she couldn't make ends meet,I was sick & she couldn't afford Dr  BUT..SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF OUR WATER  Cher (@cher) January 23, 2016She also posted picture of the water that the residents of Flint  had been assured was  safe  until this scandal broke, and they are nothing short of absolutely horrifying. It looks more like mud than water, and is clearly unsafe. However, considering that Flint s residents are mostly destitute African Americans, we can be assured that their situation didn t matter to the right, white GOP governor Rick Snyder and his emergency management people who made this nightmare a reality.How would U like 2 wake up Tomm & have nothing but  water 2 give your kids 2 DRINK,BATHE IN WASH CLOTHES IN pic.twitter.com/lxhkhSAB72  Cher (@cher) January 23, 2016Cher then tweeted a photo of the water running into a washing machine to wash a family s clothing. It is nothing short of deadly, and that is why people are dying and children who have been drinking and bathing in that water have elevated lead levels in their young bloodstreams, which will likely affect them for the rest of their lives.Cher, Flint s own native son Michael Moore, and many other people in positions of power and influence are just as outraged by this as the rest of us. Luckily, they have the money, power, know-how, and resources to actually do something about it. And they are.Hopefully, the next step will be to get this disgusting excuse for a human being and a governor, Rick Snyder, out of office, and into the dustbins of history with other rightfully disgraced politicians.Featured image via Cher Twitter",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Jeb Bush Cherishes A Secret Ambition — And No, It’s Not Being POTUS (VIDEO)","Jeb Bush was, once upon a time in a land far, far away, assumed to be the shoo-in for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. Then, Donald Trump happened, and Jeb s dreams of presidential glory were crushed. In fact, Jeb s campaign is in such trouble now that he had to get his mommy to appear in a political ad reminding everyone that her son should be the GOP s annointed one, and that Trump is just a big bully.Well, it s a good thing that as Jeb s campaign circles the drain and dies, he has other dreams to fulfill. Bizarrely, it s to be a G-rated killer on the hit fictional drama about the U.S. government, Homeland.Apparently, the series The Circus caught Jeb admitting on camera that he d like nothing more than to kill people on television. The thing is, though, Trump is right about one thing. Jeb Bush is a lackluster dork who would be nothing more than a laughingstock on that series. In fact, he very presence would likely make it jump the shark. Nevertheless, it s highly entertaining to realize the revelation that acting in a television drama is the next best thing to really being POTUS in Jeb s feeble mind.Give it up, Jeb. You ll never appear on Homeland, and you ll never be POTUS. No worries, though. You have plenty of time and money. I m sure you ll find something constructive to do.Watch the video of Jeb s confession below:Featured image via video screen capture.",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Spokesperson Upset At Lack Of ‘Pure Breeds’ Running For President (TWEETS),"It gets more outrageous by the day for the Trump campaign when it comes to racism and racists. It appears Trump has assembled a political team and a fan base of individuals who are racist to the core. Take for example current Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson. Back in 2012, Pierson took to Twitter and lamented at the lack of  pure breeds running for president in reference to President Obama, who has a father of Kenyan descent, and Mitt Romney, whose father was born in Mexico.Perfect Obama's dad born in Africa, Mitt Romney's dad born in Mexico. Any pure breeds left? #CNNDebate  Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) January 20, 2012In her tweet, Pierson implies that having a parent born oversees somehow makes someone less American, or to put it in more eugenical terms, less pure.  That s interesting, since Donald Trump s mother was actually born in Scotland. One can easily infer why she would find Scotland more acceptable to be born in than Kenya or Mexico.Pierson is in agreement on all of Trump s policies, including supporting the ban on Muslims from entering the United States. She also advocates using America s nuclear arsenal in some capacity against perceived enemies saying,  What good does it do to have a good nuclear triad if you re afraid to use it? Katrina Pierson is not without a checkered history. She s been accused of collecting thousands of dollars in welfare benefits while working.  She also made a recent appearance on CNN where she wore a necklace made of bullets. After anti-gun advocates called her out, she promised to wear a necklace made of fetuses. Pierson also has an arrest record for shoplifting.  Ironically, four years before her wacky tweet, Pierson sued her previous employer for racial discrimination.Donna Pierson s antics and her checkered history shouldn t be surprising. After all, she s helping steer one of the most racist and frightening presidential campaigns in American history. Let s hope that the country can find a few good laughs with these crazies and put them all in the dust bin of history when the time comes.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Martyrs Without Causes’: Maher Calls Out Crazies On Both The Right And The Left (VIDEO),"Bill Maher is all about telling it like it is, and that is just what he did on his  New Rules  segment of Friday night s edition of his HBO show Real Time. First, the comedic host took the terrorists who are currently occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to task, and rightly pointed out that they really don t have a reason for being there. He zeroed in on notorious anti-Muslim nutjob Jon Ritzheimer, who infamously filmed a hilarious   goodbye  video to his children, saying  your daddy swore an oath,  and that s why he can t be there. Maher said of Ritzheimer and his video: Just listen here to one them,  patriot  Jon Ritzheimer, explaining to his kids in a video he posted from his truck, why he had to leave. After playing a clip of Ritzheimer, Maher said: Wow, seems like a lot of trouble to go to just to  get out of spending time with your family at the holidays Why not just drink like the rest of us. The host then went on to mock the  shopping list  of supplies the Oregon militants were requesting from the public so that they can continue their lawless occupation of federal property indefinitely.Maher didn t stop, there, though. After blasting the militants, he reminded those of us on the left that we have our own brand of crazy. He played a clip of a Yale student s expletive-filled rant regarding offensive Halloween costumes at a professor that was trying to make an argument for free speech.While microaggressions and cultural appropriation are definitely a problem, there are people who go too far in their opposition to such things. That kind of ranting behavior only makes the cause and its supporters look nuts, and makes everyone who shares the ideology lose credibility to seem just as crazy.In conclusion, Maher also pointed out that there s not much difference between the extremists of the two sides, and that s something everyone should think about, regardless of political ideology.Extremism in either direction   just not a good thing.Watch the hilarious, and oh so true, clip below:Featured image: screen capture",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Glenn Beck Endorses Ted Cruz In A Series Of BIZARRE Tweets Declaring Their Bromance,"It s a bromance for the ages. One that may go down in history. Glenn Beck, while on the campaign trail in Iowa with Ted Cruz, formally endorsed the Republican candidate. However, that s not even the half of it.For most of the day, Beck was sending out these cryptic love notes regarding his feelings towards Cruz. Even going so far as to imply that Cruz is the next George Washington. Althoug, George Washington was actually born in the United States, we can t say as much for Cruz.The tweets really need to be put into letter form, so that s exactly what I ll do for you here: This election is about more than someone who understands your anger; it is about those who can stand shoulder to shoulder with you. I used to worry folks would vote party over principle. This year is worse   it s paparazzi over principle. I need more than someone to vice my anger   I need someone to have my back. The George Washington we need will not be found in the garish light of gold. Do we really want another 8 years of a president who views his role as a Benevolent Dictator? The president does not create jobs. He helps create the conditions in which WE THE PEOPLE create jobs and change lives.I have prayed for the next George Washington   I believe I have found him. The presidency is not just a man, it is principles. That s why I stand with Ted Cruz. Our children deserve hope of a better tomorrow than our yesterdays; they deserve Ted Cruz. I am officially endorsing Ted Cruz to become the first Hispanic president!Connect with truth. Connect with freedom. Connect with Cruz.No, one man makes America great. But each of us as individuals, living our own lives, believing in our own strengths. That makes the USA great. Well, actually Beck, you ve made it pretty darn clear that you believe Ted Cruz is going to be your one and only in making the nation what you want it to be. While your passion for Cruz can be admired, your facts regarding your beloved candidate aren t quite accurate. Ted Cruz is no George Washington. Not even close. However, keep believing in your heart of hearts that Cruz is the man of your campaign dreams. If it s something you can hold close, do it. It may be all you have this election season.Here s the full series of tweets with a few jabs thrown at Trump and Hillary Clinton as well:This election is about more than someone who understands your anger; it is about those who can stand shoulder to shoulder with you.

" Well, It Happened – Trump Proves He’s A Traitor In Favor Of A New Confederacy (TWEET)","Either Donald Trump doesn t ever look at who he is retweeting, or he does, and that s pretty damn frightening.

Let s re-establish the Confederate States of America. Other states would join. As you can tell, this person clearly wants to split from the United States, and also clearly wants Trump as president.via TwitterAnd as a person that is running for President of the United States of America, you d think, maybe, just maybe, he wouldn t endorse such a tweet with a retweet of approval. By doing so, it reaffirms the position held by the person he s retweeting and makes it appear as though he also wants the nation to once again be divided. So much for making America great again.Sure, the tweet itself was in regards to this person wanting to end their National Review subscription, but holy sh*t, Trump couldn t have found a better person to retweet? Who the hell is working his social media campaign?What this really is indicative of is the sort of people responding to Trump s racist rhetoric that he s been touting since the start of his presidential campaign. His white pride attitude is drawing all the racists out from their holes, and they are feeling perfectly comfortable being openly bigoted in public. After all, a major party frontrunner is saying these things, so why can t they?The Republican party needs to put Trump in check or he will be their nominee, and if this is the sort of candidate they want to run, well, then we certainly know which party is the party of racism.

 This Brutal Ad Exposes Donald Trump For Every Liberal Position He’s Ever Had (VIDEO),"An anti-Trump Super PAC has just released a new attack ad highlighting just how untrustworthy and flip-floppy the GOP presidential candidate has become over the years. It turns out that historically, the business mogul has supported more liberal positions than conservative ones.The main purpose of the ad was to get Americans to open their eyes and ask themselves, How much do we really know about Donald Trump? The ad was released by Our Principles PAC, which was founded by Katie Packer, a deputy campaign manager on Mitt Romney s 2012 presidential campaign. Packer told Politico: Our Principles PAC has focused on conservative principles and ensuring that voters have the necessary information to make a wise decision on Election Day. The ad contains back-to-back footage of Trump supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and praising President Barack Obama, while backing conservative no-nos like universal healthcare and abortion. In one part of the ad, Trump admits that he leans more toward the Democrat party and even says that Republicans are just too crazy right. At the end of the ad, the text reads, With a record like this, how can we trust Donald Trump?  Hillary Clinton s voice is also heard, saying that Trump is basically a Democrat.  She says: He was basically a Democrat and he was supportive of Democrats. He was supportive of a lot of the causes that I cared about and people I knew cared about. This anti-Trump video is called The Trump Tapes: Vol. 1,  which we hope means that the Super PAC plans to release more soon.Many people are aware that Trump has made some of these statements, but seeing all of this footage together really drives the message home. The fact that it came from conservatives makes it even better.TwitterOur Principles Super PAC has also created an accompanying website to the attack ads, called Trumpquestions.com, which is worth checking out   it s full of articles that highlight just how dishonest the current Republican front-runner really is.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michigan Militia Group Turns On Right-Wing Governor Rick Snyder,"As a general rule, militia groups do not side with liberals on anything. But as Michigan reels under revelations of conspiracy and collusion at all levels of republican Governor Rick Snyder s administration, militia members have added their voice to the chorus of citizens calling for Snyder s arrest.As reported by the Detroit Free Press, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia will be staging a protest in the city of Flint, demanding answers from state officials regarding the city s poisoned water. The protest will be held on January 23, just one week after filmmaker and activist Michael Moore staged a similar protest in the city.In a press release concerning the upcoming protest, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia stated: It is nothing less than shocking that our elected officials would try to hide the hazards that residents are being subjected to just by drinking a simple glass of tap water!!! On its Facebook page, the militia group has also issued a call for the state s emergency manager law to be overturned by the Michigan legislature. This echoes the sentiments of an overwhelming majority of Michigan citizens, many who voted to repeal the law in 2012.Following the voter repeal, the state legislature, which is almost entirely controlled by republican and Tea Party representatives, simply rewrote the emergency manager law and passed it again, this time with a rider to ensure it could not be repealed by voters.Image: scree capture, Genesee County Volunteer Militia, *names redactedLike other militia groups around the state, the Genesee County Volunteer militia displays the Tea Party flag on their Facebook page.This week it was widely reported that Governor Snyder has hired two out-of-state PR firms to try to help him with his public image.No doubt Snyder was hoping to paint the Flint water scandal as a  leftist  attack. The trouble with that narrative is that Michigan militia members are the furthest thing from  leftist  as you can get.When the pro-gun militia stands shoulder to shoulder with the producer of the anti-gun documentary  Bowling for Columbine,  you ve got the kind of problems not even two hundred PR firms can fix.Dave McKellar, a member of the Genesee militia group, told the Detroit Free Press that the group not only agrees with Michael Moore, but that they are trying to coordinate protests with the filmmaker, so that they do not stop.To be clear, we re not saying that we think the militia should bring out their weapons and march through the streets of Flint. To be clear, there hasn t been any indication that Sunday s protest will be an armed protest.Still it is very significant that even far-right groups like the Volunteer militia, which have consistently voted for and defended Michigan s republican/Tea Party legislature, are now turning against the people they helped put in office.Image credit: screen capture Genesee County Volunteer Militia",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Just Told His Fans They’re Stupid TO THEIR FACES – And They Cheered (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s heavily-conservative base is filled to the brim with stupid people. It s one thing for polls and studies to prove that TrumpFans are absolute morons, but it s another for the billionaire 2016 hopeful to actually admit it.On Saturday at an Iowa campaign rally, Trump told his fanatical followers to their faces that they are so stupid they would even support him if he shot someone in broad daylight, in front of a crowd of people. I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose voters, ok? It s, like, incredible. Yes, it is incredible. It s incredible in the first place that anyone regardless of political leanings could support a man who wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States (even if they are returning from vacation), waste taxpayer dollars to build a gigantic wall, make followers of Islam register in a national database and wear special badges to let everyone know their religion, and throw them in concentration camps as a  temporary measure. It s almost baffling.But what is more baffling is that Trump standing before a crowd and telling them they are so stupid they would continue to support him if he murdered someone in cold blood in a scenario in which there is no question of his guilt does absolutely nothing to dissuade them from supporting him.He is right   the loyalty of his fans is iron-clad, and it is clear that they love him no matter what he does or says, no matter how horrible.Trump is probably right: He could probably shoot someone in front of a crowd of people, and his followers would defend him   especially if the victim was black, gay, Muslim, Jewish, or anyone who wasn t a white Christian conservative. Even then, it is unlikely their support would waver Because they re f*cking stupid.Watch Trump tell his followers how stupid they are below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 That Constitution The Bundy Terrorists Tote Around Is A Perverted Version Of The Real Thing (VIDEO),"You may have seen the pocket version of the United States Constitution the Bundy Bunch carries around. The distinctive picture of George Washington on the cover is a clear giveaway that not only do these imbeciles not understand the laws of our land, they rely on the interpretations of a man whose thoughts on the hallowed document have been compared to  a warm bucket of spit. It s a convenient version for the right-wing terrorist; it retains the original spelling and punctuation from the 18th century, leaving it completely intact and just the way they like it. Read between the lines, however, and you ll find the thoughts and analysis of a man who once called President Eisenhower a Soviet agent. His name is W. Cleon Skousen, once referred to by TIME Magazine as  an exemplar of the right-wing ultras. Skousen s commentary has long been mocked as an attempt to connect the constitution to religion, making it a favorite among zealots and meatheads like the Oregon  patriots.  It holds dear the idea that America was founded as a  Christian Nation  and includes such revolutionary insights as this:-W. Cleon SkousenIt s not only his own thoughts added that make Skousen s pamphlet such a perversion of the actual constitution but the thoughts of some of the founders themselves, taken completely out of context and used as talking points to sell a disturbing message. For example, John Adams, who said,  Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,  was taken from a letter to militia intended to see them do more good deeds for the people.The pamphlet, available for 35 cents, has zero respect in the educated world. Scholars have repudiated its teachings for decades and its author ended up dying in obscurity without ever achieving his goal of convincing people who government was of the people, by the people, and for God.Ammon Bundy, who has been photographed both at the current occupation and at the Bundy  ranch  incident in 2014, had the principles of the Skousen Constitution ingrained in him by his father, Cliven Bundy, who told the LA Times:  It s something I ve always shared with everybody and I carry it with me all the time. That s where I get most of my information from. What we re trying to do is teach the true principles of the proper form of government. The proper form of government is apparently one discredited right-wing nutjob s distorted views of a document that has been proven time and time again to have nothing to do with religion. The modern conservative just loves it, however, because it embodies everything they believe in. With the Skousen atrocity of critical thought in their pockets, they are prepared to do whatever it takes to see that they can do whatever they want while denying actual constitutional rights to people who disagree with them.The terrorists in Oregon have decided to use one very specific portion of the pamphlet that pertains to  The Enclave Clause,  which they believe means that the federal government cannot own land. They believe that because it says it, right there in black in white, in the one and only Skousen mockery of the constitution.Here s Bundy Buffoon Jon Ritzheimer, making a ridiculous argument for the Enclave Clause, which he clearly doesn t understand, while holding his very own copy of this perverted pamphlet:https://www.facebook.com/scrappyphx.rider/videos/472699262917879/You can read about the ACTUAL meaning of the Enclave Clause HERE.It s absolutely amazing that so many people have decided to be influenced by one discredited man s interpretation of a document that is over 200 years old. While this is America and everyone is entitled to their opinion, Article 3 Section 2 pretty clearly reserves the right to decide matters of law and equity arising under the Constitution to the Supreme Court, who typically (though not always) rely on a couple of centuries of precedent, not the opinion of one asshole, to make their decisions. They sit in a really big building in Washington DC that is most definitely owned by the federal government.The bottom line is, these people have been seriously misguided by a strange and lonely man whose views have been circulated among extremists and laughed at by scholars since the 1960s.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative Icon And National Review Founder William F. Buckley Loathed Donald Trump,"Donald Trump thinks conservative icon William F. Buckley would oppose the National Review s attack against him. William F. Buckley disagreed 16 years ago.Earlier this week, the National Review launched an all-out assault against Donald Trump, branding him a  charlatan  who isn t a real conservative. Virtually every Republican presenting himself to voters swears so-help-me-God that he is a conservative,  wrote Brent Bozell among multiple other writers for the publication. Enter Donald Trump, not just with policy prescriptions that challenge the cynical GOP leadership but with an attitude of disdain for that leadership precisely in line with the sentiment of the base. Many conservatives are relishing this, but ah, the rub. Trump might be the greatest charlatan of them all. In response, the billionaire Republican presidential wannabe took to Twitter to blast the National Review and he invoked its founder William F. Buckley, claiming that Buckley would be disappointed in his creation.National Review is a failing publication that has lost it s way. It s circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2016Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead.   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2016The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2016The only problem with Trump s use of William F. Buckley as a defense is that Buckley actually wrote down what he thinks of Trump and the prospect of him running for office as a conservative candidate. As it turns out, Buckley slammed Trump 16 years ago and predicted this very scenario that Trump is playing out today. Look for the narcissist,  Buckley wrote in 2000.The most obvious target in today s lineup is, of course, Donald Trump. When he looks at a glass, he is mesmerized by its reflection. If Donald Trump were shaped a little differently, he would compete for Miss America. But whatever the depths of self-enchantment, the demagogue has to say something. So what does Trump say? That he is a successful businessman and that that is what America needs in the Oval Office. There is some plausibility in this, though not much. The greatest deeds of American Presidents   midwifing the new republic; freeing the slaves; harnessing the energies and vision needed to win the Cold War   had little to do with a bottom line. In the final analysis, just as the king might look down with terminal disdain upon a courtier whose hypocrisy repelled him, so we have no substitute for relying on the voter to exercise a quiet veto when it becomes more necessary to discourage cynical demagogy, than to advance free health for the kids. That can come later, in another venue; the resistance to a corrupting demagogy should take first priority.In short, William F. Buckley would be horrified that Trump is so far ahead in the Republican primary polls and would be disappointed that the conservative movement has become an anti-intellectualism and anti-science base of stupid people. And with Sarah Palin endorsing Donald Trump, it stands to reason that if Buckley were still alive, he d die of embarrassment, but not before using his command of language to tell the new conservative base to go f*ck themselves.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The Last Time This Happened, It Signaled The Global Financial Crash Of 2008. Now, It’s Happening Again.","The last time this trade measure fell dramatically, it signaled the incoming global financial crash of 2007/2008. Now, it s happening again. Only this time, it s dropped to the lowest point in its history.The Baltic Dry Index tracks the cost of shipping  dry goods  around the world. Historically, it has served as a sort of  bellwether  for the global economy. Why? Well, if the prices fall, it means that trade is dropping. If trade is dropping, the economy is about to take a hit.Now, back in late 2013, the Baltic Dry Index was flying high at 2,330. And even last August, it was still at a healthy 1,222.This week, it crashed to just 354.Image via Business InsiderThe reason this should stop us all in our tracks, is that the last time this happened, it heralded the global financial crisis of 2008   from which many economies have yet to recover. And back then, it was still over 600.As Business Insider reports:There are several other occasions when the index has pointed to a big correction in the global economy. The Baltic Dry Index has existed in its current state since 1985, and it had its first big drop in mid-1986, just under a year before the Black Monday crash hit markets in 1987.In 1999 the Baltic Dry slumped to 12-year lows, very soon before the dot-com bubble burst. It slumped again to another massive low in 2001, around the same time the US economy fell into a recession that lasted until 2003.Does this mean we are definitely going to have a crash on the scale of 2008? No. It would be foolish to argue this test is infallible. But is it, together with other warning signs in the economy, something to which we should be paying serious attention? Absolutely.William White, former chief economist at Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements, has warned that an epic debt tsunami is about to wash over the global economy, and that: The situation is worse than it was in 2007. Our macroeconomic ammunition to fight downturns is essentially all used up, The only question is whether we are able to look reality in the eye and face what is coming in an orderly fashion, or whether it will be disorderly. White is not alone. Banks like Goldman Sachs and the Royal Bank of Scotland have issued their own stark warnings about impending financial crisis. On top of that, Jeremy Penn, the Baltic Exchange s CEO, told The Telegraph: We are now at the stage where people are struggling to remember an era when it was this difficult, we ve gone through what it was like in the  90s, the  80s, and the  70s, so expressions like  living memory  start to apply, In short, we ignore these warnings at our peril.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 White High-Schoolers Break The Internet With This Truly Racist Yearbook Photo (IMAGES),"A group of seniors from Desert Vista High School in Phoenix, Arizona posed for their yearbook photo this week. But instead of high fiving, or the lens snapping them mid-leap   they opted to spell out a racial slur with their t-shirts. The image has since gone on to break the internet.It s fairly common for Seniors to celebrate their photo day with t-shirts that, when they assemble for a group photo, spell out a word or phrase. It could be the name of the school, their social group, or so on. But as AZ Central reports, this one was different:A photo shows six smiling girls standing with their arms around each other, wearing black shirts with letters written on them in gold tape that, even with asterisks in the middle, unmistakably spell out the n-word.The photo has a small circle in the corner, indicating it was originally posted to Snapchat, where photos disappear after 24 hours.The image began appearing across Facebook shortly after: What appears to have happened, is that the girls assembled for their class photo with their lettered t-shirts. In a large group, they spelled out:  Best you ve ever seen, class of 2016 . Then, a group of six girls decided to pose in a smaller photo in which they used their letters to spell out the slur.Jill Hanks, Executive Director of Community Relations for the Tempe Union High School District, which oversees Desert Vista said: That was not a school photo, That was taken off to the side somewhere and I don t know who took it or who posted it. We found out about it when everyone else did, when it popped up on social media. They do not represent DV or the community as a whole. These are six students who made a really bad decision. They do not reflect the rest of the student body, the 3,100 other students that go here, staff that work here or anyone in our district, She emphasized the class will undergo  sensitivity training  in efforts to have them understand and empathize with issues around race and history.Once  word  began to spread, a major backlash began. Over 5,000 people have signed a petition calling for the students to be expelled for racism.Petition to have the #DesertView racist high school students put up for expulsion due to their anti-Black behavior. https://t.co/fX1xvJZMcj  Melaninqua (@BlvckConscious) January 23, 2016And Twitter lit up with reaction too.Yes! This is the ""best you've ever been class of 2016"" because it's about to go downhill quickly #DesertVista pic.twitter.com/5piIKH1Du4  TylerBaldwin (@tylerbaldwin) January 22, 2016I'm disgusted by those girls at #DesertVista #BLACKLIVESMATTER  Gilbert Romero (@GilbertRomeroAZ) January 23, 2016There were rumors that the girls have since been suspended for five days, but the school and school district have not released details of any punishment formally. According to Atlanta Black Star:Tempe Union Superintendent Dr. Kenneth R. Baca released the following statement:The event that took place today at Desert Vista will not be tolerated. It is unacceptable for any racial slur to be used regardless of intent. We need to understand that words matter. I can assure you the appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.A letter also was sent home to Desert Vista students from Principal Dr. Christine Barela which read:Dear Desert Vista Families,We want to let you know we share your outrage and disappointment over the actions of a handful of our students today. We want to make it crystal clear those actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated at Desert Vista. Those actions do not represent who we are as a campus. We can assure you we will discipline these students in accordance with district policy and our student handbook. While we don t discuss individual discipline, we can tell you that in addition, the obvious need for sensitivity training will be addressed. As a precaution, Phoenix Police will be increasing security at and around Desert Vista.This has done little to calm tension in the area or in the press and social media.I'm tired of AZ being in the spotlight for racism! 5-day suspensions for these #DesertVista girls are NOT ENOUGH! pic.twitter.com/Uwvb8QK5G2  phxsoul (@PhxSoul) January 22, 2016It s clear that  we didn t mean anything by it  is well past its sell-by date as an excuse for this sort of racist behavior. If these girls don t learn this lesson now, they will carry these warped world views into their adult lives. And if there is one thing the adult world doesn t need, it s another six racists.Featured Image via Facebook",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher Did NOT Disappoint In His Reaction To Sarah Palin’s Endorsement Of Trump (VIDEO),"There s really no better person to roast Sarah Palin than Bill Maher, and he most definitely didn t disappoint on Friday s edition of his HBO show. After the failed vice presidential candidate and half-term governor of Alaska endorsed Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump this past week, it s been pretty much nonstop coverage of her idiocy. After all, the woman showed up, dressed in wind chimes, and was clearly either drunk or overly caffeinated. Any way you put it, no one put it better than Maher when he stated: Trump and Gump. Fatman and Little Brain  it was really something. Did you happen to see any of her speech? Oh my God. It was like a crazy drunk bridesmaid grabbed the mic at a wedding reception. This woman has a thousand stupid clich s in her head, and when she opens her mouth, it s like they re all escaping a nightclub fire. He then showed a clip of all her craziness during the endorsement, and said: You cannot put into words how much she cannot put something into words. Maher also brought up Palin blaming her son s domestic violence on Obama somehow not respecting the troops, saying:  and that s what makes the Republican party the party of personal responsibility  If Obama would just secure the borders, maybe Bristol would stop getting knocked up all the time. And that s really the truth of all of it. Sarah Palin wants to pretend that she s some high and mighty person, somehow morally superior to others, but the truth of the matter is, her son beats up women, and her daughter needs to learn where the condom aisle is. Palin is a walking and talking joke, and the sooner she realizes this the better.Kudos to Bill Maher for utterly annihilating Palin and her craziness.

 Chelsea Clinton BLASTS Charlotte Rampling’s ‘Anti White Racism’ Oscar Comments (TWEET),"Actress Charlotte Rampling really stepped in it when she declared that the boycott of the Oscars by black actors was nothing more than  anti-white racism.  Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that the fact that, for the second year in a row, only white actors have gotten Oscar nominations is highly suspect. Rampling, however, said the following of the controversy: Maybe this time, no black actor or actress deserved to make it to the final selection. Why should we always categorize people? I think nowadays we are living in easily offended societies. There will always be someone who s too beautiful, too black or not white enough. Well, there s one person who spoke out against the remarks: Chelsea Clinton. She took to her twitter account and roundly condemned the remarks, calling them  outrageous, ignorant, and offensive. Outrageous, ignorant & offensive comments from Rampling. https://t.co/h7r1HNND5E  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 22, 2016The problem here is that Rampling and those who think like her have absolutely zero understanding of systemic racism and the way it works when it comes to seeping into literally every crevice of our society and lives. Rampling, like many people suffering from white privilege, is terrified that she ll lose her throne if there s more space for others.Chelsea Clinton, however, understands just what this boycott is, and why it is so important. It should not have taken public outcry and boycotts for the Academy to change its rules regarding voting for these awards. That is what it took, though,and in 2016, that s a damn shame.I am just eternally grateful to Chelsea Clinton for speaking out against the likes of Charlotte Rampling and others who would squash this very important conversation. Racism is alive and well, even in supposedly  liberal  Hollywood. It is time   far past time, in fact   that we realized that racism didn t end with the signing of the Civil Rights Act.Thank you, Chelsea Clinton, for saying what needed to be said here.Featured image via Chelsea Clinton Twitter",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump’s Insult To The Troops He Didn’t Want You To See,"Donald Trump has once again used images of non-American military in a campaign appeal. This time the former reality TV star used images of Communist soldiers in a web ad advertising his support of veteran s issues.The men were clearly Communists, as the detail on their medals read  CCCP,  the Russian initials for USSR   The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Interesting choice for a photo of veterans in this @realDonaldTrump video: https://t.co/NdxdwpvMDD pic.twitter.com/PiagKGTP8H  Josh Perry (@MrJoshPerry) January 22, 2016After he was called out for posting the Communist soldiers as Americans, the Trump campaign pulled the video. But here it is.The incident is not the first time Team Trump has tried to pass off foreign soldiers as Americans. In July, Trump tweeted out a photo of himself embedded on the American flag with a photo of soldiers. The problem is, that photo was a picture of German Nazi soldiers. As in the photo of the Communist soldiers, a cursory glance at the picture would have revealed the SS eagle logo on the side of their uniforms.As he often has done during the campaign, Trump blamed the photo on a  young intern  and pulled the picture.It was the same excuse he used on Friday when he re-posted a complimentary Twitter image from an account called  White Genocide,  who turned out to be a Trump supporter who also is a backer of the white supremacist movement.Trump s campaign is a cult of personality, built of toadies who appear to have risen in the ranks based on how much they suck up to the former reality TV star. Actual competence doesn t seem to matter at all. Even more damning, it doesn t seem to matter to Republican voters, who appear quite fine with giving their support to Trump, even as he can t show the basic respect that is due to members of the U.S. armed services.But then again, that seems to be the mindset of most of the Republican establishment, so perhaps it shouldn t be so surprising or jarring.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Kevin Spacey Predicts What Would Happen If Frank Underwood Ever Debated Trump (VIDEO),"House of Cards star Kevin Spacey, who plays the fictional character President Frank Underwood, sat down with CNBC International on Thursday and just couldn t avoid getting asked questions concerning the 2016 presidential election. Chief among them was a question about what would happen if Donald Trump ever had to debate Frank Underwood.Here is the answer he gave, which drew quite a bit of laughter: He wouldn t (debate Underwood). There would be a terrible accident, on the way to the debate. It would be terrible, and very sad. If that wasn t funny enough, he followed that up with his best Trump impersonation: I m huuuge. I m too huge for this church. Spacey is currently making rounds across the globe promoting the new upcoming season of House of Cards, which airs in March. He was also asked this very same question at the annual SkyBridge Capital reception hosted at a piano bar just a day earlier. He says he often gets asked the question of what would happen if Frank Underwood had to debate Trump,  who would win? I thought about this and I said,  We must remember one important distinction, one of these characters is a fictional character, and the other is a fictional character.' It turns out he s used this line in the past often. Probably the best and most elaborate answer he s ever provided is from a Q & A session with CNN he did back in September. Oh, I think Underwood (would win). He (would win) because he would kill Donald Trump. Trump would never make it to election day. It d be over, done.I think it would be great if Donald Trump started a feud with a fictional character, because maybe for once it would be a fair fight. Perhaps Trump will appear in season 5 of House of Cards next year after he loses the real U.S. election this November. He is, after all, a TV personality. It s not too far-fetched that Trump could be a rival of Frank Underwood one day.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher CRUSHES Sarah Palin For Blaming Obama For Her Bad Parenting Skills (VIDEO),"When Sarah Palin blamed President Obama for her son s domestic violence charges pretty much everyone slammed her for it, including the veterans she referred to in her rant against the Commander-in-Chief. It s not only utterly inaccurate to blame Obama for the actions of her son, but it s actual pretty petty and a definitely a cheap jab at the expense of both the president and veterans.One person who has never held back from roasting Sarah Palin is Real Time host Bill Maher. On Friday s edition of his show, he and his guests discussed Track Palin as well as his mother s lame defense of him. Basically, Maher pointed out that she shifted blame from herself and her obvious horrific parenting skills. After all, she has one daughter with two different baby daddies, and a son who has a history of violent outbursts and run-ins with the law.Maher spoke directly about Palin s ridiculous defense of her son, and also discussed the way she s trying to somehow insinuated Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was the cause of all her son s problems. He stated: [She] just glossed over that. Like, we accept that now. We send our sons off to stupid wars and they come back a bit different, because he beat up his girlfriend, was talking suicide. And she blamed that on Obama. That s why I m sure his girlfriend was cowering under the bed   because of Obama. Her daughter has had two out-of-wedlock children. I mean, does it ever occur to anybody that the Obamas are just so much better parents? And the Obama s most certainly are. One look at the Obama girls and they are pretty much the embodiment of the near perfection. The Obamas keep those girls in check, and they are definitely well-behaved.Maher also pointed out that it probably won t matter what Palin says or does, because when it comes to the folks who actually find her as qualified to hold a valid opinion, they basically just look at religion: She s the worst  It s the most morally sloppy person going to Iowa to convince the evangelicals   the supposedly moral people   to vote? That s why faith sucks so bad. Because when you have the same faith as me, then whatever you do is off the table, right? Here s the thing, if Palin s son does suffer from PTSD, she definitely has the resources to get him help. PTSD also shouldn t be used as a political chew toy to throw around and take jabs at a sitting president because you have nothing else constructive to say. Palin was trying to shift blame from her son and herself to that of the president and the war. It s not just wrong, it s kind of sad.Video/Featured image: YouTube",News,"January 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The Academy Just Showed The GOP How Diversity Is Done, Changed The Rules For Oscar Voting","The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences has come under serious fire recently for being, well   too much like the Republican Party. The voting members of the Academy, it turns out, average more than 60-years-old and are predominantly white males.As nominees for this year s Academy Awards were released, minority members noticed that the coveted Oscars were going to once again be a gathering of the Hollywood White Boys Club. This year, however, some of the most influential people in the industry decided to take a stand. After actors of the calibre of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee, along with many other highly respected minorities in the business boycotted the event, the Academy began looking fo a solution to the #OscarsSoWhite problem.That solution came today, as the Academy announced that they will be changing the rules of voting for members, which is expected to weed out some of those who havenb t been active for years yet still cast their votes for anyone who is white, male and heterosexual.The new rules, according to a statement from Academy  President Cheryl Boone Isaacs, are as follows:The statement also outlines other measures the Academy is looking to take to increase the diversity of its membership to better represent the work contributed by minorities and women.The Academy s proactive approach to solving a problem that wasn t going to just go away is a breath of fresh air. The Republican party could learn a thing or two from them.featured image via Indiewire.com",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Seizure Victim 2nd Amendmented A Fireman Who Responded To Wife’s 911 Call To Help Him,"Greg Pruitt s wife was awoken at approximately 5 a.m. when she noticed her husband was having a seizure. Quickly, she called 911. As help was on its way, Greg s seizure started to subside a bit, and he was coming out of it when help arrived.Twenty-nine-year-old Jason Adams, a volunteer fireman, was the first responder on the scene. When Adams was standing in the doorway of the room where Pruitt was, attempting to evaluate the situation, Pruitt promptly shot and killed Adams, thinking he was an intruder.Adams was a nearby neighbor who lived approximately a half-mile from the residence. A witness who entered the home after the shooting gave the same account of what happened. Adams was rushed to a local medical center in North Little Rock but was pronounced dead.Not very surprisingly, authorities do not know if there will be any charges filed in this  accidental  shooting.Please, can we admit yet that we have a problem with guns in America? This is a perfect example of why we do. I know when people are in an emergency situation, possibly panicking, they don t think about the gun that is in arm s reach of a seizure victim, or about what will happen because of it when a stranger suddenly enters their home. But, is that really an acceptable way to write off this sort of thing?The idea of  responsible gun ownership  is exactly what s in question here. Why are we living in such paranoia, in the  home of the brave,  to where we are shooting at every shadow we see? It s incredibly wrong for a first responder to have to second-guess rendering aid because they re afraid they will get shot just by showing up. The concept of  always shoot first because it s just an accident if you do,  that has been cultivated by the NRA and Republicans in America needs to come to an end.Watch news coverage of the incident below:featured image via twitter",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Psychic Apparently Couldn’t Predict The Lawsuit She’d Face By Refusing A Gay Couple (VIDEO),"Some people in life still haven t grasped the fact that all people should be treated equally. Many still feel it is well within their rights to be discriminatory based upon personal beliefs. Such is the case with Deepika Avanti who lists herself as a  Holistic Therapist  and  Psychic Healer. Avanti, along with being a  psychic healer,  is also a property owner in Boulder, Colorado who leases out her property to renters. However, when one couple who sought to rent her property, Avanti flat-out rejected them. Why? Because she didn t want the  uniqueness  of the couple to harm her position within her community. What makes this couple so unique? They are a lesbian couple, and one of the women is transgender.Rachel and Tonya Smith, alongside their adorable child, are seeking legal action against Avanti with the help of Lambda Legal. According to the legal documents: Defendant suggested that the Smith family look for housing in a  larger town where the community would better accept them and intimated that she did not see them as a legitimate familial unit who could live together on her property. Rachel Smith said: We just thought it was a little bit ridiculous, particularly given that Boulder is known for being a more liberal, open-minded area. Honestly, if this was going to happen in Colorado, I would expect it maybe in Colorado Springs, but not so much out of Boulder, and especially not in Gold Hill. I thought it was more accepting. Good on these women for not backing down in the face of discrimination.

 Excited About ‘The X-Files’ Reboot? Here’s Something Concerning You Should Know,"While it s exciting to see a great television show finally make its way back to the small screen, it s disappointing to realize another aspect of old school TV was also rebooted. While David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are both equal partners on The X-Files, as it turns out, when Anderson was approached for the reboot she was offered half as much money as her costar. So much for equal pay for equal work. Apparently, having an extra appendage in between your legs makes you somehow more valuable.The characters Mulder (Duchovny) and Scully (Anderson) go together like peanut butter and jelly, peas and carrots, Bert and Ernie. You wouldn t pay Ernie less than Bert, would you? Well, of course not. They re both male, and puppets   we re getting off track.Here s the thing, back in the 90s, when The X-Files was originally airing on television, Anderson worked hard to make sure she was paid equally as much as her costar. When asked about the current pay disparity, Anderson said: I m surprised that more [interviewers] haven t brought that up because it s the truth. Especially in this climate of women talking about the reality of [unequal pay] in this business, I think it s important that it gets heard and voiced. It was shocking to me, given all the work that I had done in the past to get us to be paid fairly. I worked really hard toward that and finally got somewhere with it. Even in interviews in the last few years, people have said to me,  I can t believe that happened, how did you feel about it, that is insane.  And my response always was,  That was then, this is now.  And then it happened again! I don t even know what to say about it. It is  sad. According to the Hollywood Reporter, both Anderson and Duchovny were paid the same in the end, but the fact that they weren t from the get-go is, well, sad, as Anderson said.Unless a show features a strong male lead and other female actresses are quite obviously supporting roles, co-leads, regardless of gender, should be paid the same. They both bring the same amount of talent and equity to their performances and the show s success.This is still a battle not only women in Hollywood have to continually face, but women in every profession nationwide. So, while some conservatives like to tout that  women are already equal    actually, no, they re not  at all. It s important now, more than ever, to make sure we elect into the White House another person with the ideal of making sure equal pay for equal work happens once and for all. It s time. In fact, it s far past time. We need another liberal in the White House.Featured image: YouTube screengrab",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This One Image Reveals The Right-Wing Racism That Fueled Flint’s Water Crisis (IMAGES),"The human rights debacle that is being referred to as the Flint water crisis has just been summed up perfectly by political cartoonist Matt Wuerker, who found a brilliant way to express the true underlying issues behind this massive issue in one powerful image:Cartoon by Matt WuerkerThanks to the irresponsible, neglectful actions of Republican governor Rick Snyder and Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, a city with over 100,000 residents   the majority of which are African American   has been poisoned. Almost a dozen people have died from Legionnaire s Disease as a result, with dozens more becoming seriously ill.As more evidence surfaces, Snyder s disturbing role in the crisis has become crystal clear, adding to the outrage as many call for Snyder to resign and be held accountable for allowing this to happen to Flint. Among those speaking out is filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore, who called Snyder out for having  knowingly poisoned a black city  and  racial killing. Flint homeowners have been lied to and were told that their tap water   which in some areas is polluted enough to meet the EPA s standards for toxic waste   was safe to drink, even though it was discolored.Twitter TwitterThe damage that Snyder s carelessness has caused is irreversible, and it will take 10-15 years for the real damage of the lead-poisoned, highly corrosive water to be calculated. For the children of Flint, this could be deadly. It s not just homeowners that have been affected either   even hospitals are without safe water.TwitterWe cannot ignore the fact that Flint is a predominately black city with a large low-income population.Even as more evidence is gathered, many GOPers in Michigan (aside from Snyder) are calling the water crisis a hoax. Republican L. Brooks Patterson has even called reputable reports of the lead poisoning  false . Earlier today, Snyder said that race played no role in the water crisis when asked a question from a New York Times article that asked,  If Flint were rich and mostly white, would Michigan s state government have responded more quickly and aggressively to complaints about its lead-polluted water?  He s lying through his teeth.Featured image via Matt Wuerker",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 White Man Terrorizes Black Shop Owner By Leaving Ku Klux Klan Robe (VIDEO),"Leona Coakley-Spring has only been running her consignment shop, Rags to Riches, for a few months. Coakley-Spring opened her dream business and settled into the ritzy Seattle, Washington suburb, only to  be made to feel unwelcome.The trouble comes as Coakley-Spring made a horrifying discovery: a Ku Klux Klan robe amongst the dresses dropped off by a customer. She considers the robe to be a threatening message, saying to local station Fox 13: You can t be a black business owner in downtown Redmond, you can t be her.  I didn t know what to do or what to say. It was just so horrifying. Coakley-Spring s son, Shane Coakley, documented the incident with photographs, which he then turned over to the authorities. A sketch of the man believed to have left the racist robe, alongside photos of the robe itself, are being released to the public. The cops are increasing their presence around the store, and consider what happened here a hate crime. Coakley-Spring has obviously been deeply affected by this: I can t change the way I look. But it makes me feel like I m not good enough. And that s a bad feeling to have, that you re not good enough. Hopefully, this wonderful woman realizes that it s these racists who have the problem, not her. She even considered closing down over this, but so far, is hanging on: We close the store, and they would win And I don t want to give them any satisfaction. Remember that, Ms. Coakley-Spring, every time you want to throw in the towel.

 This EDM Remix Of Sarah Palin’s Trump Speech Makes Her Screechy Voice Totally Worth It (VIDEO),"If you re like me, listening to the sound of Sarah Palin s voice alone, regardless of what she says, is like being stabbed through the skull with a series of high-school geometry class protractors. Only then do I begin to actually absorb the nonsensical content of what she s saying. But, of course, leave it to the internet to take the pain away.A YouTuber called Tronovitch assembled the first what will inevitably be many autotune remixes of Palin s incoherent Trump speech. This one is built around Palin s white trash tendencies, illustrated by the mashed-up use of the phrase  hee-haw  as well as the 1970s television show of the same name.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cs9jP2ILOw&w=560&h=315]While we re here, is there anyone else in politics who s less self aware than Palin? She seems to believe that liberals and the  lamestream media  are terrified of her because she goes rogue and challenges the establishment. She appears to be completely unaware of the fact that everyone outside of her retirement-aged fanboys are laughing at her   her and her Idiot Strength. Consequently, she doesn t seem to grasp that she s embarrassing herself by going Full Dumbstupid. (You never go Full Dumbstupid.)She seems to believe that her speaking style is a threat rather than a source of accidental self-satire. In other words, every time she appears in public, she ratchets up her act, thinking that it ll totally flummox liberals, but in reality it just comes off as Full Dumbstupid. Frankly, it s one of many tell-tale signs that she s totally ensconced in white-trashery, which is often indicated by poor judgment and horrendously bad taste.Suffice to say, she clearly doesn t know. And if she s been told how insanely ridiculous she sounds, she s not paying attention   which is yet another sign of being white trash. Besides, if she stops, the comedy ends. And that d be a tragedy.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

" White Hollywood Stars Say Black Actors Should Be ‘Patient’, And The Oscar Boycott Is ‘Anti-White Racism’","High profile back stars from Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith to Spike Lee will be boycotting this year s Oscar s ceremony in solidarity over the persistence of racism in Hollywood. But for one (white) nominee, this is all just a case of  racism against whites. First, veteran Hollywood star and Oscar-winner Michael Caine told black stars they must be  patient  and await the point where they are permitted full entry to the Academy.He was joined by actor Charlotte Rampling, who is nominated for Best Actress for her role in 45 Years, and will be competing against four other white actresses   Brie Larson, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett and Saoirse Ronan.Not only will there be no black actor in this category, but there will be no black actor in any category of the Oscars in 2016. Not a single nomination.However, like Caine, Rampling believes that black stars of Hollywood are making a fuss about nothing. Worse, that their calls for greater representation in Hollywood amounts to racism against her and her fellow white actors. She said during a radio interview on Friday: It s racist to whites. One can never really know, but perhaps the black actors did not deserve to make the final list.  Then, in a final fit of white privilege she added: Why classify people? These days everyone is more or less accepted, People will always say  Him, he s not as handsome  or  Him, he s too black  or  He s too white. But does that necessarily mean there should be lots of minorities everywhere? What does it mean that [black actors] still think they are a minority? It would be a much better world if Rampling was right, if black actors were being judged on their merits and simply fell short. But if she truly believes this, her disconnect from reality is profound. As Variety points out:In 1956, Variety ran a series of articles asking why there aren t better roles for black actors. Three decades later, the situation hadn t improved. On Feb. 19, 1982, Variety carried the front-page banner NAACP faults film employment. Last year, the hopes for diversity were based on one film, Paramount s  Selma,  which earned two nominations, for best pic and song (winning the latter). This year, there were more opportunities, including  Creed, Straight Outta Compton  and  Chi-raq,  as well as  Beasts of No Nation. This year, it s even worse.Surprising omissions from the actor race this year included Idris Elba for  Beasts of No Nation,  Will Smith for  Concussion,  Michael B. Jordan from  Creed  and the many young actors in  Compton. To add insult to injury, despite the fact that Creed featured a black actor in the starring role, and was written by a black man   the only nominee was a white man.Not only is Hollywood failing to acknowledge the black actors who have delivered breathtaking performances throughout the year, but the industry is also decades behind television in providing leading roles for black actors in mainstream movies which make them household names. As The Guardian discovered when they crunched the numbers:A 2012 Los Angeles Times study found that nearly 94% of Oscar voters were white. Some 2% were black and 2% were Latino. More than three quarters of voters were male. The median age was 62.So, let s be clear, this is not about hurt feelings. This about a very real, systemic issue. And as these figures show, it s not just on race where Hollywood fails to reflect the diversity of our societies.It is far better that white stars stand in unity, like George Clooney and Michael Moore, to help transform Hollywood for the better   than they stick their head in the sands and continue to ignore an unjust status quo. But for some, the reality of racial prejudice is an ugliness they would rather pretend doesn t exist.Featured Image via Wikimedia Commons/Wikimedia Commons/Mod.Com",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Young FL Filmmakers Take On GOP’s ‘Ridiculous’ Islamophobia With Hilarious Spoofs (VIDEO),"Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States has been fraught with Islamophobia. But the 2016 Republican presidential candidates, coupled with the recent Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) attacks and the San Bernardino shooting, the hate has reached a fever pitch. In response to the rising tide of bigotry, a group of young filmmakers in Tampa, Florida called  Peace House  have started fighting back with humor instead of anger.Ahmad Hussan and Nick Amaro said that in the days following the arrest of Ahmed  The Clock Boy  in Texas, they decided to go into their studio and make a parody about the incident. Their video shows a frightened uncle calling the police because his nephew is holding a clock. Their brilliant mockery of the incident got nearly eight million views.Hussan told Fox 13 News that they want to expose the  ridiculousness  of people s anti-Muslim sentiments: When you are laughing at something, you are kind of exposing it for its ridiculousness. And when someone refers to me, just because of my faith, as a terrorist, that is ridiculous. In addition to the clock video, the filmmakers have made a video that showcases ignorant family members sitting around a table during the holidays; they called it  Happy Hatesgiving.  They also took on Ben Carson s comments that compared Syrian refugees to rabid dogs, and in another they interviewed people for jobs with ISIS. We are making things that are funny,  Amaro explained.  But ultimately, the goal is to make you think deeply about something, to help you understand an issue from a different point of view. The fact is, the GOP field has used people of the Islamic faith as punching bags for more than a decade. What s worse is that their constant fear mongering has put targets on the backs of innocent people who want nothing more than to live peacefully like the rest of us. It s nice to know that this group can laugh about it, but in reality they shouldn t have to. In 2016 there is no excuse for the rampant ignorance that is so prevalent on the right.Featured image: video screenshot",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Steven Colbert’s Hilarious Summary of Trump’s Crazy Week,"For anyone who s been paying attention to Donald Trump, you can t help but wonder how in the world this individual is leading polls by a large gap for the Republican nomination to be president of the United States. After watching Stephen Colbert s analysis of Trump s week, one can only conclude that there are many not so smart Republican voters out there.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oo0RcL4PJw]Take, for example, Trump s visit to Liberty University to attract the Evangelical vote. During his speech, Trump misnamed a book in the Bible.  Trump loves the Bible so much he doesn t even need to read it, apparently because he had a little trouble with one of the names of the books of the Bible  Second Corinthians ,  said Colbert. Then he showed a clip of Trump calling it  Two Corinthians.   It s like two Corinthians walk into a bar  mused Colbert. Trump however did compliment the Bible, saying that it  blows away  his book, The Art of The Deal.Do these folks actually believe that Trump is religious or that he even pays attention to the Bible? If they do, they seem to be either quite delusional or not so smart. They re probably both.Then there s the apparent endorsement of the dead John Wayne. Trump was endorsed at the John Wayne Museum by the famous actor s daughter, who said that if her dad were alive today, Trump would be his guy. Colbert said: That s right,with Trump s new-found spirituality, Trump has reached through the veil of death and dragged back the endorsement of John Wayne. The unfolding Trump saga and his crazy support base is humorous when Colbert sums it up but it s also quite frightening that this guy leads in the polls.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ted Cruz Forgets To Sign His Family Up For Health Insurance In Time, Blames Obama","There is arguably no other person in America who dislikes Obamacare more than Ted Cruz. He is the guy who quite literally shut down the government in order to make an inane point about it. But even for Cruz, his latest attempt to show America how much he doesn t like the Affordable Care Act is pretty pathetic.At a campaign rally, Cruz told the crowd that he and his family currently don t have any health insurance because  blah blah Obamacare. I ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who s lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me,  Cruz told the audience at a campaign stop New Hampshire on Thursday evening.  I don t have health care right now. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. (I wouldn t advise taking that literally, Ted. The hospital bills will be through the roof.) Cruz seems to have intentionally torpedoed his family s chance to get insurance so that he could tell conservative voters that Obama cost him his healthcare.You may recall that Fox News spent months trying to dig up people who lost their health insurance because of the ACA. Cruz cited  millions.  In all their searching they found only a few. Those, it turned out, were mostly wrong about losing their health insurance. One by one they discovered that they either hadn t actually lost their insurance or their new plan was more affordable because of Obamacare. They were simply ignorant of what they were meant to do to get a new policy. Thanks, no doubt, to Fox News and its relentless misinformation.As Think Progress explains, Cruz is in a similar situation. He didn t  lose  his health coverage, he just didn t sign up for a new policy in time:Cruz s family used to be covered through a PPO plan with BlueCross BlueShield of Texas. But for 2016, the insurer decided to eliminate PPO plans and move to offering only HMO plans on the individual marketplace (which is becoming a bigger trend in the insurance industry). The insurance company announced this decision last July.The July announcement gave people enrolled in BlueCross BlueShield s plans a full five months to select a new HMO plan if they wanted to maintain coverage into the new year. Ted Cruz s family apparently just didn t sign up in time.Like the rest of America, Cruz was expected to pick his new plan before the new year. The marketplace actually extended their deadlines in order to make it easier for busy families to find time to sign up. Millions of Americans managed to do so. In fact, more Americans have health insurance today than at any other time in the country s history. Just not Ted Cruz and his family.After blaming Obama, Cruz hinted that his family aren t happy with him. He told the crowd: By the way, when you let your health insurance policy lapse, your wife gets really ticked at you,  Cruz said.  It s not a good   I ve had, shall we say, some intense conversations with Heidi on that. Note that even Cruz seems aware that he simply dropped the ball. He also admitted that he s currently signing up for insurance (which will begin in March.)At most, this is a mere inconvenience. For many American families, a lapse in insurance can be a scary time. One slip on the ice or nasty illness and one s savings can evaporate. That s unlikely to happen with Cruz. His wife, a former Goldman-Sachs executive, and Cruz, a senator, probably have enough money in the bank that any hospital bill can be taken care of even without insurance.While Cruz has consistently run on the idea that he will repeal Obamacare, Americans are growing to like it. Healthcare in the United States is still an absolute mess, and more reforms need to be done to fully address the problems, but more people on insurance means less bankruptcies, healthier workers, and longer lives. You can t put a number on more time with a loved one who may have been saved with access to healthcare, but you can put a number on what these life-changing opportunities are doing to the economy. Obamacare was framed by Republicans as a  job killer  and a deficit bomb   it s proven to be neither.So stop complaining and sign up for health insurance, Ted. Then go apologize to your family for gambling with their health to take a dig at the president. That s just bad form.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Christian Conservative State Bans Women From Testifying In Court Unless They Obey ‘Modesty’ Code,"A Christian Conservative  lawmaker in Kansas has used his position as a Senate Committee chairman to enforce a dress code for female witnesses in courts. The rules govern skirt length and cleavage allowance. There are no equivalent rules for men.Sen. Mitch Holmes is the Republican chairman of the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee in Kansas, and has included his new rules in an 11-point code of conduct. He argues that women in court, and in the Senate, dress provocatively to distract men   and he wants to bring an end to this.Women will not be permitted to give testimony if they do not abide by the rules.He told the Topeka Capital Journal: It s one of those things that s hard to define. Put it out there and let people know we re really looking for you to be addressing the issue rather than trying to distract or bring eyes to yourself. His bizarre rules and comments have prompted withering condemnation from female members of the committee and the Kansas legislature. Topeka Democrat Senator Laura Kelly responded: Oh, for crying out loud, what century is this? Meanwhile, even Republican colleagues were unwilling to defend Holmes. GOP Senator Vicki Schmidt (Topeka) sighed: Who s going to define low-cut? Does it apply to senators? In total, four of Holmes  female senatorial colleagues (two Republicans and two Democrats) have come forward to publicly condemn his comments, and stress that women should not be subjected to gender-specific dress codes.Another Republican Senator, Carolyn McGinn of Sedgwick, spoke to the fact that men and women in the Senate and our courts should be judged by their contribution, not their clothing, saying: I am more interested in what they have to say about the direction our state should go than what they re wearing that day, It is indeed hugely disappointing to see a lawmaker use his position to implement gender-specific dress codes that enforce his patriarchal religious codes onto the women of the state. This is the very reason the Founding Fathers separated church and state in the U.S. Constitution   because freedom of religion is not merely about the right to practice our own religion (or none) in peace, but to avoid being forced to follow the whims of anyone else s. The women of Kansas just lost that right.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Donald Trump Retweets One Of His Fans, A ‘WhiteGenocide’ Neo-Nazi Account (IMAGES)","Donald Trump woke up this morning, sleepily grabbed his phone off his nightstand, saw one of his supporters had tweeted an anti-Jeb Bush picture at him, and hit  Retweet. Unfortunately, that supporter happened to be a racist neo-Nazi with the account name  WhiteGenocideTM. Seriously.The love for Trump from racist xenophobes is startling, but not exactly surprising. Trump s current presidential run quite literally started with a racist screed against Mexicans, and has been sustained by a torrent of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant smears. His rallies regularly feature his supporters beating people of color who come to protest his ugly rhetoric.You can almost feel the sense of excitement in the racist, Nazi-loving dark corners of the country: Finally, a candidate for us! And even better   if you happen to be a toxic racist   Trump won t hesitate to give you free publicity if you just tweet something to stoke his ego.It would have taken all of two seconds for Trump to realize that the man he was tweeting was a despicable monster. If the  WhiteGenocide  name   based on the racist belief that white people are being systematically edged out of American society by minorities   didn t give it away, the account s biographical details should have.Even worse, just scrolling through the account s tweets shows a pattern of racist filth. Some of it advocates for the deaths of political figures, particularly those on the left. Last week, for instance, he tweeted a picture of Trump in a Nazi uniform with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders inside a gas chamber.As of this writing, and more than an hour after he retweeted this scumbag, Trump still has the tweet up, including a link to  WhiteGenocideTM s  account, giving him more exposure.Donald Trump has surged in the Republican polls, with even many of what we consider  mainstream  conservatives applauding his appalling comments. At the root of his support, however, is a thriving neo-Nazi and white supremacy contingent that believe Trump might be the leader they were looking for. Just hinting at racist ideology wasn t enough for them, they like a guy who will openly admit to it and never apologize.Certainly Trump will eventually excuse the tweet and, likely, blame a  young intern  for the mistake. We shouldn t let him get off the hook that easily. This is a pattern of disgraceful behavior that puts real lives at jeopardy. It is extremely telling that the most toxic, violent people in society are cozying up to Trump. Clearly, what he s saying is right up their alley. Trump may try to excuse his behavior, but his actions   and followers   speak louder than his words ever will.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The White House Sets Palin Straight — Her Bad Parenting Isn’t Obama’s Fault (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin is an idiot. While this has been commonly accepted ever since she slinked out of her slime pit and emerged on the political scene, Palin recently managed to be so utterly stupid that it prompted an official White House response. After Palin s son Track drunkenly beat his girlfriend and made threats with a semiautomatic weapon, Caribou Barbie did the only thing she knows how to do: she blamed that socialist Communist Muslim atheist fascist dictator Barack Obama.Sure, the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska could have had a moment of self-reflection, questioning her role as a parent and what she did wrong in failing to instill proper values in her precious little snowflake. She could have spoken out against domestic violence in general, and pointed out that it is an issue that faces many families, including hers. She could have said nothing at all. Instead, she told a crowd at a Donald Trump rally that Obama gave her son PTSD when he served in Iraq for a single year under Bush, and blamed Track s violent tendencies the President s blatant attempt to deprive veterans of medical and psychological treatment (failing to mention that  it was actually Republicans who slashed the budget for veterans  care): I can talk personally about this, I guess it s kind of the elephant in the room. My son like so many others, they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country. And that starts from the top. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder, if they have to question, if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question though that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of some PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with,  Palin said.  And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of Americas finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them. Earnest said that while it s easy to mock Palin   really easy   the topics she discussed are not a joke: The reaction of some people I think is to make light of some of the rhetoric that we see on the campaign trail, particularly from Gov. Palin. But the fact is domestic violence is not a joke. Gun violence is not a joke. Problems with addiction are not a joke. The consequences, or I should say, the sacrifices that many of our men and women in uniform make for our safety and security are not a joke. We take [those issues] very seriously and there are many communities and families that are dealing with these very difficult challenges in a way that is sometimes difficult to talk about publicly,  he said.Classy   something one would never expect from someone who would fling herself on top of a dogpile in a drunken brawl her family started at someone s birthday party.Watch Earnest eloquently destroy her below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuDTaEGJ2s&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab (1,2)",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Pathetic: Jeb Bush Gets His Mommy To Take On Bully Donald Trump (VIDEO),"One of the hallmarks about Jeb Bush s failing presidential campaign has been just how pathetic it has turned out to be. His latest campaign ad won t help that perception of the Republican once spoken about as a shoo-in for the nomination.The ad features Jeb Bush s mother, Barbara Bush, and she takes a swipe at Donald Trump.The former first lady says Jeb Bush wants to be president for the right reasons, unlike some other candidates in the field. Rather than talking about how popular they are or how great they are, he s doing it because he sees a huge need and it s not being filled by anybody,  Mrs. Bush says, likely referring to Trump, the GOP front-runner.After months of being depicted as out of touch and a wimp, it probably won t help to have your mother now fight your battles for you. It s an approach that is sure to attract the derision of Donald Trump and other, more pugilistic Republicans.It has been startling how the Bush campaign and its affiliated super PAC has made so many mistakes throughout their campaign. Starting with a candidate with very strong name recognition and a $100 million-plus war chest that reportedly scared off a campaign from Mitt Romney, by this point Bush was supposed to be on the verge of accepting the nomination.Instead, he is polling in single digits, behind Trump and Cruz. He s served as the poster boy for the impotent Republican establishment, while his super PAC has been lighting money on fire on things like nonsensical ads making fun of Marco Rubio s boots.Bush himself has been a dud of a candidate, leading some to comment on how his brother and father seem to have had far more natural political talent. Bush has been awkward on the campaign trail, showing quirks more often associated with a political rookie rather than someone elected to govern in a populous state like Florida.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oops: Ammosexual Playing With Gun During Benghazi Movie Shoots Woman (VIDEO),"Thinking about going to the movies? You might want to avoid 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, and not just because of the film s poor reviews.In case it s not obvious from the title, the film was created in hopes of drawing in a crowd of delusional right-wing nuts, whose hatred for Hillary Clinton is only surpassed by their passionate love for firearms. In that respect, at least, the film seems to have done what it set out to do.To illustrate the point, on January 21, as the Benghazi film flickered on the screen, a drunken ammosexual playing with his substitute penis handgun while seated in The Landing Cinema in Renton, Washington,  accidentally  shot the woman sitting in front of him.According to Renton police: Preliminary accounts indicate that an intoxicated suspect entered one of the theaters and was fumbling with a handgun he had in his possession when it went off, striking another patron seated in front of him. The victim was rushed to Harborview Medical Center, where she was listed in critical condition.The unidentified 29-year-old shooter ran out of the building, likely fearing a theater jammed full of  good guys with guns,  locked, loaded and ready to fire at anything moving in the darkened cinema.David Grushke, who was in the theater at the time of the shooting, described the shooting to KOMO News in Seattle, saying: There was a gunshot and we thought it was a light bulb exploding in the theater, so no one really reacted. Grushke said by the time he and other patrons realized that the woman was shot, the shooter was already disappearing through the exit.Grushke told KOMO News that it appeared the woman had been shot in the upper chest.The shooter s father later turned him into the police. He was arrested at his family s home in Newcastle.Considering how badly this incident might have turned out, the fact that only one person was shot, and no one was killed, seems almost fortunate.Here s more on the story from KING5.Featured image credit: video screen capture KING5",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Anonymous Declared War On MI’s Gov. Rick Snyder, Now Cyber Attacks Have Been Confirmed (VIDEO)","Not long ago, the hacker collective known as Anonymous declared war against Michigan s Republican governor Rick Snyder in a new campaign called #OpFlint. The declaration came, as they always do, in the form of a slick YouTube video, where they called for Snyder s arrest. Less than 24 hours after Anonymous released the video, a major cyber-attack has been confirmed in Flint.Anonymous did not make any specific details on what action(s) they will take in order to help the people of Flint. They say in the video, that  We must remind the city officials of Flint we do not forget and we do not forgive,  the spokesperson in the video says.  The crimes committed by Gov. Snyder as well as other city officials will not go unpunished. The next day a cyber-attack rocked the Hurley Medical Center. That s the hospital where Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha first noticed there were elevated levels of lead in children s blood in Flint.Here s the video: Hurley Medical Center has IT systems in place, which aid in detecting a virus or cyber-attack,  hospital spokeswoman Ilene Cantor said.  As such, all policies and protocols were followed in relation to the most-recent cyber-attack on our system. Patient care was not compromised and we are closely monitoring all systems to ensure IT security is consistently maintained. It hasn t been confirmed that the cyber-attack is connected to Anonymous. However, it would be a pretty big coincidence for Anonymous to make this threat, and then for a completely random hack to occur. I think it is pretty safe to assume that if it was Anonymous who did hack the Hurley Medical Center, it was in an effort to get info on the situation. Not to actually harm the hospital. Or at the very least, to let the Snyder administration know that they mean business.Speaking of Snyder, he should be very concerned about the potential threat of a massive data breach. In his State of the State address on Tuesday, Snyder promised he would release all of his e-mails in a show of transparency. That promise just turned out to be another slap to well, at this point, the entire nation, who is watching him like a hawk. Here is an example of what  transparency  means to Snyder:That s not the kind of bullsh*t you want to be pulling with a hacker group breathing down your neck. With all things Anonymous, it is important to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism. That being said, it will be interesting to see if they escalate their fight with Snyder and the rest of his cronies in the near future. Especially since his administration has landed Michigan s government the honor of being ranked worst in transparency.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via YouTube ",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cruz Campaign Donates Water To Flint–But Only To People Who Qualify For Their ‘Generosity’,"Ted Cruz is fast approaching Donald Trump as the most hated man in America. As GOP insiders and long-time public figures denounce Cruz as someone nobody in congress would work with, he continues to take his campaign in directions that guarantee that Democrats and Independents will despise him even more. Apparently, Cruz thinks he can get elected with the votes of the extreme-right only, which is where his platform is and will always be directed.In what may be the worst case of discrimination and idiocy ever by a presidential campaign, Ted Cruz 2016 donated an undisclosed amount of bottled water to residents of Flint, restricting their  generosity  to people with the  right  frame of mind. Cruz s campaign staff took to the streets to get much-needed water to those working and visiting the fraudulent  pregnancy crisis centers  that dupe women into believing they re going to receive medical advice and treatment but are instead cornered and fed anti-abortion rhetoric and religious indoctrination.Cruz s Michigan state campaign director, Wendy Lynn Day, announced in a Facebook post begging for donations that the campaign had worked with anti-abortion group Flint Right to Life to coordinate this absolutely idiotic and ridiculously ignorant plan.  The water is for  expecting moms and moms of little ones. Cruz state director @WendyLynnDay: Donating water to #Flint babies both supports the city and shows ""the pro-life values of Senator Cruz.""  Chad Livengood (@ChadLivengood) January 20, 2016The  pro-life values  of Senator Cruz apparently include denying children who have already been exposed to massive amounts of lead from Republican incompetence water they so desperately need because their parents aren t currently seeking anti-choice counseling from a place where zealots wear lab coats to make people think they re physicians.The malfunctioning moral platitudes of these people are astounding. While most of the GOP field feigns ignorance to an issue they want nothing to do with, Cruz 2016 has taken a proactive role in alienating an entire city in the middle of a crisis unless they conform to the beliefs of Ted Cruz. Pro-life  Ted Cruz, who thinks carpet bombing whole villages full of innocent people is OK as long as you kill some terrorists along the way, hasn t personally commented on the issue, but his campaign works directly on his behalf.Certainly the several people who work at these madhouses are appreciative of the clean water donations while tens of thousands of others line up to receive actual charity from people who care about the already born.Featured image via tedcruz.org, altered",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Skip The Flowers, Just Don’t Vote For Trump, Asks PA Man’s Obituary","Jeffrey Cohen was a man who believed The meaning of life is  OOPS!'  according to his obituary. The 70-year-old Pennsylvania man passed away Sunday morning at his childhood home in Squirrel Hill, a suburb of Pittsburgh. He was a person who  took pride in being the only Jewish cowboy that he knew of,  and an accomplished chiropractor   one who treated Gold Medal-winning Olympians, members of the Pittsburgh Ballet, professional boxers, and many of the Pittsburgh Steelers throughout his career. Even  Weird Al  Yankovich stopped by to see him.He is described as  compassionate and kind    someone who would  always put others before himself, happily and without hesitation.  His love of dirty and  groan-inducing  jokes was legendary. He also has one final request of those who love him and all who read his obituary   don t f*ck up the next election, or at least do some good in the world:Jeffrey would ask that in lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Donald Trump. (Also acceptable   donations to the Nimmo Educational Foundation   www.nimmoed.org   or a charity of your choice .)That s right   to honor his memory, Cohen asks one simple thing: Don t vote for Trump. Don t throw away our future.His obituary does not indicate whom he would choose as president, but he doesn t want people to vote for someone who would ban Muslims from entering the United States, throw them into concentration camps (after forcing them to register in a national database and wear special badges, of course), or any of the multitude of horrific ideas the brain-gerbils that reside beneath his hairpiece suggest. Cohen doesn t want a  big beautiful wall  running the length of our (southern) border, nor does he want someone who would allow Sarah Palin to speak.This request is the opposite of an obituary request that popped up earlier this month when a Virginia man asked,  in lieu of flowers please vote for Donald Trump.  The billionaire tweeted the obituary, declaring thanking the deceased man and declaring him to be  a great person.  It seems as though Cohen made this request as a light-hearted retort to the Trump fan s suggestion that Americans vote for someone who would later be endorsed by Sarah Palin.Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. https://t.co/2DZp7YOadj pic.twitter.com/2YtLlEwceB  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2016It is highly doubtful that Trump will say the same of Cohen.While no thinking individual would vote for Trump anyway, if you are considering voting for Trump, think about honoring this Cohen s dying wish instead. We don t need to  make America great again.  America is already great.But we can make it better by voting Blue in November.Featured image via Legacy/YouTube",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Third Grader ROASTS Trump With Hilarious Letter Obliterating His Deportation Rhetoric (IMAGE),"Since the start of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, he s gone after pretty much every minority group there is. Along with his obvious and seemingly deliberate racism, he s also declared that he will deport all undocumented immigrants, mainly the ones he can tell by skin color. In other words, Latinos and Muslims. His words have been horrendous and have reached far and wide all across the United States.His words have even reached a young third grader, who seems to be taking an ESL (English as a Second Language) course, and their teacher in Ohio posted a letter the child wrote concerning Donald Trump to Facebook for all the world to see. Why? Because it s AMAZING.The letter reads, in its original grammar: I have a dream 2016!I have a dream that Donald Trump will not be president. But if he does all Asians, Africans and Mexicans have to go back to their contry. Without them the U.S.A. population will go down to 12,0000 people only. Most enginners are Indian then their won t be no tecnolegy! Without tecnolgy theirs no NETFLIX. Without netflix theirs no chill.

They are a young child after all and hopefully they won t know the grown up meaning to that phrase til much later in life.However, the point is still made that if we as a nation degrade, look down upon, or worse deport minorities, we ll be doing ourselves a great disservice. The United States of America is a nation of immigrants, it s kind of our thing. It makes us who we are, and we can cultivate the best and brightest to build a better future.So to answer the question again, no, we don t want to live in a world with Donald Trump as president.

 JFK’s Grandson Obliterates Ted Cruz’s Fantasy That JFK Would Be A Republican Today,"Ted Cruz would like us all to believe that John F. Kennedy would be a Republican today if he were alive. JFK s grandson not only disputed Cruz s claim, he torpedoed it.In an op-ed for Politico, Jack Kennedy Schlossberg repeatedly demonstrated that the Republican presidential wannabe and JFK fanboy is full of bullshit.Cruz has referenced JFK on several occasions throughout his presidential campaign insisting that the late former president would not be a Democrat today, but would instead join the Republican Party. JFK campaigned on tax cuts, limiting government and standing up and defeating Soviet communists,  he said in New Hampshire earlier this week.  JFK would be a Republican today. He stood for religious liberty, and he would be tarred and feathered by the modern Democratic Party. Not so fast, says Schlossberg. As Kennedy s grandson, and as a student of his life, legacy and administration, I find this notion and the suggestion that Ted Cruz is somehow taking up his mantle absurd. Were my grandfather alive today, he d be excited about how far we have come as a nation since 1963, he would feel a sense of urgency about the challenges that lie ahead and he most certainly would not be a Republican. Indeed, according to Schlossberg and the historical record, John F. Kennedy was, and still is, a liberal hero who stood in stark contrast to the conservatives who have overrun the GOP in the present day.For instance, here s Schlossberg on Kennedy s record on science versus Cruz and the GOP. Kennedy gave science and technology the highest national priority with his expansion of the space program. Most of the Republican Party denies climate change and has fought all efforts to address it. And here s Schlossberg on what religious liberty meant to JFK. Kennedy believed in religious liberty and the separation of church and state. He did not believe in the right of elected officials to impose their religious views on others. And considering how JFK was attacked because of his Catholic faith, Schlossberg pointed out that  he would be horrified by the attacks made against Muslim-Americans by leading Republican candidates for president. Schlossberg didn t stop there either. He continued to obliterate Ted Cruz s fantasy of a Republican JFK even further.On voting rights: He championed legislation to ensure that all Americans could exercise their right to vote. He did not spend his time devising ways to disenfranchise certain segments of the population. On immigration: As a senator and president he supported immigration reform that would welcome more hopeful men and women to America s shores. He did not try to close our borders, demonize foreign nationals or separate families by deporting parents with American children. Even JFK s stances on foreign policy differ from Cruz s by a wide margin.When it came to projecting American strength and power around the globe, JFK  didn t substitute bluster and bombast for statesmanship and resolve,  and he certainly  did not propose a perpetual war footing or unilateral displays of force. JFK would be particularly pleased about how President Obama has used diplomacy to reach common ground with Iran and Cuba and Schlossberg called out Cruz by name for irresponsibly forcing a government shutdown in 2013 and leading the constant obstruction in the Senate as things his grandfather would despise. Kennedy believed government could help organize the best of America s energies and skills. He created new federal programs with ambitious goals, such as the Peace Corps. He did not spend his years in the House and Senate devoted to obstructing the opposition. He certainly did not lead an effort, as Cruz did, to shut down the federal government to score political points and deny health insurance to millions. And in a final knockout blow to Ted Cruz, Schlossberg described how if the Texas senator had listened carefully to JFK s nomination speech in 1960, he would know that his claim about Kennedy being all about lower taxes, talking tough to the Soviet Union, and supporting limited government is totally wrong. As it turns out, Kennedy admitted that taxes would not always be low because it would take everyone chipping in their fair share to make government work better for everyone and promised that he would not deliver harsh rhetoric against the Soviets.  Clearly, Cruz hasn t read that speech,  Schlossberg wrote.In conclusion, Schlossberg said,  Today, my grandfather would be 98 years old. He d have no idea how to use a cell phone, and he d be shocked by just how far the Republican Party has lost its way. It s safe to say that Ted Cruz should probably keep his damn mouth shut the next time he thinks about bringing up John F. Kennedy as an example of a president who would be a Republican today.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Supporter Gets What He Deserves After Attacking Peaceful Protester At Rally (VIDEO),"Folks, violence is never the answer. Certainly not in situations like the one that you re about to read about and watch.Two peaceful (and silent) protesters attended the infamous Donald Trump and Sarah Palin rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Tuesday. As you ll be able to see in the first four seconds of the video, a Trump supporter pushes them when all they were doing was standing there. For one, that s not their job (let security be the dicks). Secondly, it was completely uncalled for no matter who it was, even if it was security that did it.Later in the video, a guy in a cowboy hat attempts to drag them out around the same time a uniformed cop arrives. Instead of being retaliated against in a violent nature, the protester knocks the guy s cowboy hat off. It wasn t exactly the most professional response, but hey, he was being dragged out by a man who had no business putting his hands on him. He could have responded in a whole host of other ways that would not have been preferable, such as throwing a fist. In any case, the cowboy deserved it.The cop that showed up didn t get violent and merely escorted the two guys out. That, for once, was the correct way to do things. Kudos to that man. It s possible that the guy in the cowboy hat was, in fact, affiliated in some way to the event, but we re not sure as of this writing. If he was, he certainly wasn t dressed for it.Just to show the ignorance of Trump supporters, you can hear a guy nearby say that the protester was the  violent  one for merely flipping off the guys hat. It s absurd, and everyone that watches the video will know better. Here s what he had to say, in full: Good job, buddy. You f*cking idiot. Get this mother f*ker out of here. He s violent. He must not have been paying attention until the very end. Somehow we highly doubt that. Trump s supporters aren t exactly the sharpest tools in the shed   this is just further proof.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chris Hardwick Lampoons Sarah Palin By Comparing Her To The Perfect Cartoon Character (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin went full Looney Tunes on Tuesday and @Midnight host Chris Hardwick knows exactly which character she channeled during her speech.During Wednesday night s episode of the Comedy Central program, Hardwick kicked off the show with footage from Sarah Palin s endorsement of Republican billionaire presidential wannabe Donald Trump.While not denying that her whole speech was a rambling incoherent rant, one particular part of the speech caught Hardwick s attention. Yesterday, Donald Trump received a significant endorsement from feral snow-MILF Sarah Palin,  Hardwick began.  Sadly, no one could really understand it. Hardwick then played a clip on a Vine showing a piece of Palin s crazy speech, the full transcript of which you can read here. How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the establishment. Right. It was an attack on President Obama s past statement about bitter conservatives who cling to their guns and religion, but Hardwick couldn t resist mocking Palin. You betcha!  Hardwick said imitating Palin s voice.  You gosh-darn betcha! What with the flim-flammin , sock-darnin  every kinda woof-wrestlin , moose cobbler coolin  on the windowsill, baseball chuckin , flag-wavers, troop salutin , country lovin  anthem hummers, and no to the gays. But somehow, that nonsense sounds kinda familiar,  Hardwick continued before playing a clip of the gun-slinging mustachioed Looney Tunes character Yosemite Sam throwing a temper tantrum in the same way Palin said her line about right-wingers, which drew laughs from the audience.Hardwick then asked the three comedians standing in front of him to define what  bitter clingin , proud clingers  are. I have no clue but I m sure they re uncomfortable around black people,  James Davis replied, drawing a chuckle from Hardwick.Jen Kirkman ended the segment by saying that it s  a lizard that clings to a tree during a hurricane and blames Mexicans for everything. Here s the video via YouTube:This is an absolutely perfect comparison. It could also be said that Palin and conservatives like her could be compared to Elmer Fudd or Wyle E. Coyote as well. Regardless, Sarah Palin s drunken incoherent rants are comedy gold and Chris Hardwick hit the jackpot.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Reality Check: New Iowa Poll Shows Bernie In The Lead; Second Iowa Poll Shows Hillary Leading,"The news media thrives on political drama, so whenever a new poll drops in the increasingly heated Democratic primary contest, you can expect the everyone to lose their minds, and the sensationalistic headlines will be frantically shared all over social media.The latest CNN/ORC poll is just another example of this phenomenon. The headline from The Hill is indicative of headlines on this story throughout the political internet on Thursday:  Poll: Sanders overtakes Clinton in Iowa. That d be excellent news for Sanders if it held water:A CNN-ORC poll released on Thursday found Sanders receiving 51 percent support in Iowa to Clinton s 43 percent. Clinton led by 18 points in the December version of the poll.Again, seemingly great news for Bernie. But the next two paragraphs completely undermine The Hill s headline and lede.Reality check:But among Iowans who participated in the 2008 caucuses, the survey found, Clinton leads Sanders 55 percent to 38 percent.The difference between the first part and the second part is the difference between  voters  and  likely voters    the latter being a more accurate measure of Democratic preferences. The next sentence is even more sobering.Clinton still leads in the RealClearPolitics average of Iowa polls by 4.7 points, but recent surveys show the Democratic presidential race has tightened considerably since the fall, when she appeared to be pulling away.So, yes, while the race might be tightening, the polling average shows Clinton in the lead.Meanwhile, a second poll dropped on Thursday showing Hillary Clinton leading in Iowa, contradicting the CNN/ORC poll.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a nine-point lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) among Iowa Democrats, according to a poll released Thursday by the Emerson College Polling Society.Clinton has the support of more than half of Iowa Democrats, with 52 percent of respondents intending to vote for her. By contrast, support for Sanders stood at 43 percent and support for former Maryland Gov. Martin O Malley at 3 percent.So, which poll is correct? Perhaps neither. All we need to do is reference the gold standard for polling, Nate Silver, whose algorithm still shows Clinton comfortably in the lead in Iowa, according to both the odds and the polling averages. According to Silver, Clinton s chances of winning Iowa have increased in the last 24 hours to 83 percent. Silver s polling average, by the way, shows Clinton leading 47.7 percent to Sanders  40.9 percent.To be abundantly clear: this isn t intended to take the wind out of the sails of Bernie s momentum or to crap all over his supporters. It s merely both a reality check as well as an illustration of what we can expect from the political press as the primary season heats up. Bottom line: read everything with a critical eye before sharing or retweeting.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Church That Has Never Paid Taxes Demands Taxpayer Money For Playground,"Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia, Missouri has never paid a dime in taxes. But it seems church officials still believe that they are entitled to get free stuff, at the expense of those of us who do pay them.In 2012, the church applied for a grant from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The taxpayer-funded grants allow qualifying organizations to purchase recycled materials, used to resurface playgrounds.The DNR denied the application, citing the state s Constitutional barrier against taxpayer funds being used to support a religious organization.The exact wording of the state Constitution reads: No money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion .and that no preference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against any church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious faith or worship. Trinity Lutheran church responded to the denial by filing suit against the state, claiming  religious discrimination. The trial court ruled against the church, upholding the state Constitution and the validity of Missouri s  No-Aid  Clause.But the church really, really wants Missouri taxpayers to pay for its playground resurfacing material. So much so that it appealed the decision, taking the case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Arguments were presented this week.The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLU), the ACLU of Missouri and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a 44-page brief in response to the church s allegations that Missouri s No-Aid Clause is discriminatory.As stated in the brief, which can be read in full here: By barring government aid to religious schools and other religious institutions, these provisions (1) ensure that no taxpayer is forced to subsidize religion or religious exercise, bolstering religious liberty for all and (2) safeguard the integrity of (and financial support for) free public schools which, unlike many religious schools, are open to children and families of every faith, sexual orientation, and economic class, as well as children with disabilities. All churches and religious institutions in the United States are tax exempt organizations.How often do we hear the  Christian  right talk about freeloaders and people who want something for nothing? Yet these  religious  institutions cry discrimination because they are barred from taking money from coffers they never paid into.We see this happening across the United States, as Charter schools and religious schools and private school voucher programs suck money out of the public school system in states like Michigan, Florida, Texas and elsewhere.On the bright side, Colorado courts upheld the U.S. Constitution in June of last year. The state s highest court struck down the use of public funds for private school vouchers, a move which protected the state s Constitutional barrier against public money  controlled by any church or sectarian denomination whatsoever. Then in September of 2015, in what was also seen as a major victory for public education, the Washington State Supreme Court found Charter schools to be unconstitutional.And here again in Missouri, we see yet another religious organization lusting to get its hands on public dollars, while pleasantly enjoying the benefits of a tax exempt status.The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on the Trinity Lutheran case. As Bloomberg reports here, the case could unhinge the Separation of Church and State clause that has long kept the government from controlling or being controlled by religion.Americans United for the Separation of Church and State is tracking the case and will publish the outcome on their website here.Featured image credit: Pixabay CCO",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oregon Ranchers Who Started Bundy Occupation Threatened To Kill Refuge Employees And Their Kids,"By now, everybody knows that the two ranchers who inspired the Bundy militia standoff fiasco in Oregon are no innocent victims of the big bad federal government. However, new details were given by current and former Malheur Wildlife Refuge employees about the family which reveal a long and very serious criminal history.Dwight and Steve Hammond have had friction between the federal government and themselves for decades. Forrest Cameron, who served as Fish and Wildlife Service manager from 1989 to 1999 described how the conflict with the Hammonds goes all the way back to the 1980s when they made death threats against refuge employees. Cameron explained that  one way or another the Hammonds were violating their permit  for grazing on refuge lands, to where there was never a time when there was not some problem occurring. Cameron went on to say,  They ve done so many illegal activities that never got to a courtroom. Some violations were not significant, and we figured we could correct it by talking to them. A biologist employed at the refuge reported that the Hammonds engaged in aerial hunting of coyotes on the refuge, which is illegal. Cameron said that the Hammonds had an airplane at the time.  They were flying to shoot coyotes on their land, and we didn t have a problem with that.  However, the biologist allegedly saw the Hammond s plane flying over refuge property, which the Hammonds denied.In August 1994, the Fish and Wildlife Service was trying to fence a waterhole used by waterfowl, because the Hammonds were also using it for their cattle. Fish and Wildlife wanted to protect it solely for waterfowl use. As the fence was being constructed, the Hammonds disabled a Caterpillar vehicle, sabotaging the construction of the fence. Dwight and Steve Hammond were arrested and charged with felonies for impeding, intimidating, and interfering with federal officers.Before the 1994 fiasco with the waterhole, Cameron said that there were death threats being made against his family, as well as other staff members and their families as well: My wife would take these phone calls, it was terribly vulgar language. They said they were going to wrap my son in barbed wire and throw him down a well. They said they knew exactly which rooms my kids slept in, in Burns. There were death threats to my wife and two other staff members and their wives. My family went to Bend rather than be in the community because it was so volatile at the time. The families of my biologist and my deputy manager family had to relocate as well for a short time. At the refuge headquarters, one of the Hammonds said they would tear my head off and shit down the hole. One of the Hammonds told my Deputy Manager, Dan Walsworth, they were going to  put a chain around his neck and drag him behind a pickup. Source: RawstoryThese are the people that right-wing America are holding up as both heroes and victims. They are neither. Personally, I will admit that at first the idea of five years for burning grassland sounded like an excessive sentence. Perhaps all alone it would arguably still be one (although the details of the case appear much worse.) However, these people have been engaging in bad behavior   to put it extremely mildly   for decades now. They earned what they got, and to defend them is to defend nothing short of good old home-grown domestic terrorism.

" SICK: Colorado School Wants To Teach Little Girls To Be Christian, Submissive, And Pure For Future Husbands (VIDEO)","A Colorado public school is facing the wrath of parents after they received an email urging them to bring their daughters to an event designed to turn them into pure Christian wives who submit to their husbands.Mesa Valley School District 51 sent an email to parents promoting an event called  Wake Up Sleeping Beauty: Worship At His Feet,  and includes a Bible verse from Luke 7:38 which seems to tell women and girls as young as 11-years-old to submit to their husbands. The event also aims to train girls to remain pure until they find a husband. In other words, indoctrinate them from a young age to hold strict religious views on sex, marriage, and gender roles. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. A video posted on Wake Up Sleeping Beauty Facebook page suggests that fathers keep an eye on their daughters to make sure they remain virgins until marriage, and features a creepy image of a father watching his daughter put on makeup.A girl then praises the event  Especially going through the time that I was, being cheated on. That was really hard for me but it also made me realize a lot that I needed to forgive him and he didn t have the qualities I was looking for in a husband. The image of a woman crying at a man s feet before wiping the tears dry with her hair was of particular concern to one parent. The idea of a woman or girl crying at a man s feet, then using her hair to wash his feet, then kissing his feet, seems pretty demeaning to me. Apparently the irony of this imagery used to promote an event which purports to strengthen or support girls/women is lost on all involved. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, it s also a violation of the Constitutional tenet of separation of church and state, because school officials used the district mailing system to promote a religious event.But District 51 Communications Specialist Jeannie Smith made a bullshit claim about the email not being religious at all. Having reviewed the flyer and KHB-R per your request, we do not find that the flyer promotes a religious organization or demeans a person or group on the basis of gender,  she wrote in an email to an angry parent.But the flyer did actually promote a religious event and a religious organization. The program is put on by Wake Up Ministries, which is a religious organization.So, Mesa Valley School District 51 flat out lied to parents.Schools are supposed to protect our kids from religious organizations, but Mesa Valley school officials allowed their own email system to be hijacked for religious purpose in an effort to indoctrinate young girls to their beliefs. It s outrageous and sickening. Someone needs to lose their job for this. At the very least, an independent investigation needs to be waged.Female students already have to put up with enough sexist bullshit from school officials as it is, particularly from unfair dress codes that blame teen girls for how boys act around them. The last thing they need is a school that shoves religion down their throats.Featured Image: Pixabay",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch This Profusely Oblivious Billionaire Question Why People Are So Unhappy (VIDEO),"There are people in this world who are willfully ignorant, or just unabashedly uninformed and out of touch with reality. Many of these people are in positions of great wealth and power who really don t have to deal with the everyday problems that life may throw at those who are not at the same level as they are. One of these people is billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, the Chairman and CEO of Blackstone Group, and investment firm currently with $333 billion in assets and revenues of $7.6 billion. Schwarzman himself is worth $9.3 billion, and was listed #62 on Forbes  list of most powerful people in 2015.Schwarzman is so out of touch and greedy that he actually wants poor people to pay more in taxes and make sure rich people pay less, even going after Warren Buffett for saying the rich should pay more. He seems to be the living embodiment of Ebenezer Scrooge.So, it wasn t at all surprising that during an interview with Bloomberg, Schwarzman had absolutely no clue why people are so upset and angry at our current economic structure, and why it s the centerpiece of many political debates.The oblivious billionaire stated: What s remarkable is the amount of anger. Whether it s on the Republican side, or the Democratic side. Bernie Sanders to me is almost more stunning than some of the stuff going on on the Republican side. How is that happening? Why is that happening? What is the vein in America that is being tapped into across parties that s made people so unhappy? Here s some advice for Schwarzman: walk into one of your many bathrooms, close the door, walk up to the mirror, and stare at the face you see. It will be there that he will see what  is the vein in America  that has made people so greatly unhappy. Furthermore, the fact that he doesn t see himself, his cronies, and his business practices as the problem is yet another issue in and of itself. The first step to solving a problem is realizing there is a problem, even if you are the problem.If you want to know why people are so unhappy, Schwarzman, listen. Listen to the anger and frustration in people s voices who work endless hours to barely make ends meet. Listen to the mother s who have trouble feeding their children because corporate lobbyists push for more tax breaks and subsidies while their paid for legislators also push to cut food assistance programs. Listen to the countless people who just want to make a living wage while you sit atop billions of dollars and refuse to recognize the reality of the working class. Listen, Schwarzman. Listen. It will be there where you could finally figure out why people are so unhappy. And why people are rising up to fight greed and injustice where it stands.

 These Veterans Have Some VERY Choice Words For Palin Blaming Obama For Her Son’s Behavior,"The reason Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump decided to bring  Sarah Palin back into the limelight is still unclear. She was the poison pill for John McCain in 2008, and has made a career off saying wildly moronic things.The latest wildly moronic thing she said happened when she decided to blame President Obama for her son s domestic violence arrest. She said: They come back wondering if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given so sacrificially to this country, and that starts at the top. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder,  Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander-in-chief who will respect them and honor them. She s more than implying that President Obama doesn t currently respect our troops, which is just an outright lie. And it is also not the president s fault if her son may suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Nor was it his fault her son was arrested. Knowing this, and calling Sarah Palin out for this uncalled for and vicious attack, is the head of the New York City-based veteran s organization Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). Paul Rieckhoff said: It s not President Obama s fault that Sarah Palin s son has PTSD. PTSD is a very serious problem, a complicated mental health injury and I would be extremely reluctant to blame any one person in particular. Also stating: It s important to recognize that Track may need help like many veterans. This is a great opportunity for Sarah Palin to sound the alarm about PTSD. Now that she has endorsed Mr. Trump, I would encourage her to talk with him about it. Mr. Trump s campaign is pretty light on specifics about what he would do for veterans. Adding: I hope this doesn t become a political chew toy in a political campaign. Reickhoff seems to really hope that Palin chooses to discontinue her efforts of politicizing PTSD. Hopefully, Palin can recognize that she is a public figure and can use her position in politics to not just become famous, but rather promote positive change in the lives of veterans nationwide. Outright blaming the president for PTSD is petty and wrong, and thankfully she was called out on it.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr) ",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Patton Oswalt Just DESTROYED Sarah Palin In This Hilariously Accurate Impression (TWEETS),"Nothing captures the sheer absurdity of the Republican 2016 presidential primary more than the Donald Trump phenomenon   especially now that he has gotten the support of the worst element of American politics   Sarah Palin.Palin s endorsement speech of Trump was nothing short of amazing, and that isn t intended to be a compliment. The amazing part is that someone didn t send out the hook to pull her away from the microphone and off the stage.Palin s speech was the equivalent of putting a huge can of alphabet soup in a paint mixer, letting it run at its highest setting for about three hours, then taking small handfuls of it and hurling them at the crowd.Here are just a couple examples of the many truly epic statements she made:How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution.And you quit footin  the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we re paying for some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries. Where they re fightin  each other and yellin   Allah Akbar  calling Jihad on each other s heads for ever and ever. Like I ve said before, let them duke it out and let Allah sort it out.Source: BuzzfeedYeah, she said  squirmishes. If Sarah was holding a giant flashing neon sign during the speech that said  Please mock me,  it couldn t have invited ridicule more than she already had within the first one minute of speaking. Needless to say, some of our more liberally bent comedians took to it like wolves to red meat.Patton Oswalt took notice of her shenanigans and decided to deliver his own blistering impression of an average Sarah Palin speech, which you can read below:Just saw @SarahPalinUSA's speech and was really moved.

 What Will Rick Snyder Tell Congress About Poisoning The Water Of Flint’s Black Children?,"Michigan governor Rick Snyder is being called to appear before a congressional hearing about how the city of Flint s water supply was poisoned with lead.Snyder, a Republican, made the call on changing the city s source of water in order to save money. As a result, thousands in the mostly black city have been affected.A spokeswoman for the committee did not immediately return a request for comment on the hearing, which would be the first congressional inquiry into the crisis. President Barack Obama signed an emergency designation for Genesee County and Flint last Saturday and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is supplying water and water filters to residents.Lawrence, D-Southfield, a week ago sent a letter to leaders of the committee, of which she is a member, asking for the hearing, saying it s Congress  responsibility to address  a man-made disaster created by the poor policy decisions of elected and career government officials. Snyder s office was pushed by national criticism to release internal emails about how they responded to the water crisis, and though some of those emails were redacted to the point of absurdity, they also reveal that early concerns about the water were downplayed and ridiculed:A top aide to Michigan s governor referred to people raising questions about the quality of Flint s water as an  anti-everything group.  Other critics were accused of turning complaints about water into a  political football.  And worrisome findings about lead by a concerned pediatrician were dismissed as  data,  in quotes.Hillary Clinton dispatched officials from her campaign to go to Michigan to speak to local officials about the water problems, while Senator Bernie Sanders has called for Governor Snyder to resign.While visiting Michigan, President Obama said the damage to the community was  inexplicable and inexcusable. By contrast, Donald Trump refused to speak about the water issue.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Carly Fiorina Ambushes Preschoolers On Field Trip To Prove Point About Abortion (VIDEO),"It gets weirder and more exploitative with the Republicans on a daily basis. This time, a party of preschool kids on a field trip to the Greater Iowa Botanical Garden unwillingly served as a backdrop to Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina s anti-abortion speech. One parent said: The kids went there to see the plants. She ambushed my son s field trip. The former Hewlett Packard executive embarked on a day of campaigning in Iowa in an attempt to save her ailing campaign. The ambush occurred when Fiorina  hosted a  right to life  forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. She entered the rally before a crowd of about 60 and directed 15 kids to a makeshift stage. The problem, according to one parent, is that Fiorina did not get permission from any of the parents to sit with her in front of a huge banner bearing an image of an unborn fetus while she talked about the harvesting of organs from aborted babies. Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, said: Taking them into a pro-life/abortion discussion [was] very poor taste and judgment. I would not want my four-year-old going to that forum   he can t fully comprehend that stuff. He likes dinosaurs, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Transformers. The discussion about abortion and the vivid images are difficult for adults, but such a heavy topic with its images weighs more on young kids.  During the rally and with children present, an anti-abortion activist carried a scale model of a four-month-old fetus sucking its thumb.  This is the face of abortion,  said the activist as Fiorina looked on.Fiorina s campaign apparently doesn t see anything wrong with what she did . A campaign spokeswoman said:  We were happy that these children chose to come to Carly s event with their adult supervisor. So four-year-old children  chose  to come to an event to hear about abortion? Is she nuts? It s no surprise that Fiorina s campaign is foundering, polling at 1.5% in Iowa. Her opportunist approach to using little kids for political purposes, exposing them to pictures and rhetoric they don t understand, all without permission from their parents, is alarming and tells us a lot about her.Watch the video below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giv4p1HXyhE]Featured image via YouTube screen capture",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Disgrace: Ted Cruz Using Anti-American Propaganda In Campaign Ad (VIDEO),"Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said it was terrible that the sailors detained by Iran were videotaped putting their hands up and surrendering. But now Cruz is using that same footage shot by Iran in a new campaign ad.The ad,  Have Your Back,  uses the footage of U.S. Navy sailors created by the Iranian regime as a backdrop for a promise from Cruz to stand up for them if he is elected president.But if Cruz believes the video is enemy propaganda, why use it in a crass television commercial?It once again hollows out the conservative message that they are the one, true, source of support for the military between the Democratic and Republican parties.The ad also reminds voters just how wrong Cruz was about the initial capture of the sailors. As the situation unfolded, Cruz ran to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt to complain that the incident showed weakness on behalf of the Obama administration. Our prayers right now are with the sailors and with the families of the sailors,  Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday night.  I think what the president should say is that the sailors are coming home and they re coming home right now.  Cruz continued: Now, I don t know that he will say that, and the fact that Iran feels emboldened enough to capture two U.S. Navy ships and to take 10 sailors into custody is really a demonstration of the unbelievable weakness of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. We have a Commander-in-Chief where the bad actors of the world have learned that he will not stand up to them. Remember this is the same Barack Obama who is trying to send Iran 150 billion dollars. A few hours after Cruz stamped and whined his rhetorical feet, the sailors were free. Not because Obama followed  the lead of Cruz and other Republicans with a bellicose posture towards Iran, but because the Obama administration has opened up lines of diplomacy between the two countries   lines needed in order to avoid conflict. The sailors were home without a single shot fired, without an American put in harms way or an innocent Iranian civilian having to suffer.While Obama was bringing the soldiers home safely, Ted Cruz s ad men were analyzing the situation and looking at the optics for the best way to position their right-wing candidate.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: The Media Gives MI’s Gov. Rick Snyder The Tongue Lashing He Deserves (VIDEOS),"Michigan s governor Rick Snyder is desperately trying to retain some credibility by increasing his presence in the media. It isn t working. All he is doing is proving to the world that he is as much a scumbag as the world thinks he is.In an interview with Fox 2, Snyder said that he would let his grandchildren be bathed in Flint, Michigan. During the interview, Charlie LeDuff asks Rick Snyder: Would you have your grandchildren bathe daily in that water coming out of those pipes, now? Yeah, because again, that s the advice I ve gotten,  Snyder says. I wouldn t let my child chew on a Chinese made toy, I don t think I d let my child, as just as person, a rational person that doesn t know that much, bathe in water what we know there s high levels of lead,  LeDuff responds.  You would let your grandchild bathe in that? Snyder then tries to squirm his way out of the gaffe he just made by giving this poor explanation for his claim: We don t know that there s necessarily high levels of lead in every bath tub. But again, there could be this risk. But we ve been told by the experts  by itself You just don t leave them by themselves. you need to monitor that to make sure they don t drink the water. Here s the interview.It really sounded like Snyder was trying to make the contamination of Flint s water sound safer than it is, didn t it? That s really weird because just hours earlier, Snyder went on CBS for an interview where he said that they don t want people to assume that the water in Flint is safer than it is.During that interview, Snyder was again, completely hammered for his utter incompetence. Snyder failed to answer even basic questions about what people desperately want to know.The interviewer, Scott Pelley, asks Snyder: Governor, is the water in Flint safe today? Snyder responds, saying: We don t want to consider it safe, Scott. I think we ve seen progress in terms of improvements in the water testing. But until it s been thoroughly tested, including third-party verification, we want people to assume that they should be using filters, or bottled water as an interim measure. Pelley presses Snyder: So fair to say you don t know what the lead content is in the water? Snyder responds, saying: Well, again   we don t want people to believe it s safe. Extensive testing is going on, has been going on for some time. At that point, Pelley seems to have had enough of Snyder s evasiveness. He grills Snyder, saying: I don t understand why you can t give us the latest testing data and what it shows for the water in Flint. What is the number? Snyder, still trying to down play his incompetence, says: I don t have the number at the top of my head of the very latest data. And it varies by parts of the city. To this, Pelley eviscerates Snyder, saying: I would think that the governor of Michigan would have those numbers at the top of his mind right now.

 Bundy Terrorists Disturb Native American Artifacts Stored At Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy and his band of gun-toting domestic terrorists are living up to their Vanilla ISIS nickname.As you ll recall, the international community has condemned ISIS for destroying archaeological sites and artifacts during the organization s rampage through the Middle East. They are literally destroying history and heritage.Well, that s kinda what Bundy and his pals are doing now at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.In addition to being a wildlife refuge, Malheur is also a storage place for thousands of Native American artifacts, many of which are associated with the local Paiute tribe.And instead of leaving the artifacts alone and undisturbed, the tantrum-throwing white rednecks decided to search through the artifacts, thus putting them at risk of being damaged or stolen or destroyed entirely.The militants even posted a video of themselves doing this, and they accused the Bureau of Land Management of not storing the artifacts properly.Here s the video via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;SHARE! BREAKING UPDATE BURNS OREGON BLM LEFT NATIVE ARTIFACTS TO ROT IN MICE DROPPINGS!Posted by Bundy Ranch on Wednesday, January 20, 2016The Y all-Qaeda militants claim that the artifacts were left to rot in mouse droppings, but the video really doesn t offer much evidence of this. Instead it appears to show artifacts wrapped in plastic and placed in boxes that are organized neatly on shelves.In fact, the Paiute tribe isn t as worried about the federal government handling the artifacts as they are about the militants handling them. We are really worried about the status of the artifacts down there,  said Burns Paiute tribal chairperson Charlotte Roderique. The tribe has also demanded that any barbarian militant who even so much as disturbs an artifacts be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and they have the legal statutes on their side.According to Indian Country Today: The tribe delivered a letter to federal agencies including the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service demanding prosecution of Ammon Bundy and other armed militants occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge,  If the occupiers disturb, damage, remove, alter, or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property.There are approximately 4,000 artifacts belonging to the tribe in the buildings the militants are holding. The occupation is entering its third week.The tribe is demanding federal action under both the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and a  protection against bad men  provision in the treaty the tribe signed with the United States in 1868.Under ARPA, a federal law authorizing law enforcement and penalties in the defense of archeological sites on public land, removing artifacts is a felony offense. First time offenders can be fined up to $20,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. Second time offenders can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years. It s not like the militants actually respect Native American culture either. Not too long ago, Ryan Bundy said that Native Americans have no claim to the land and that current culture (a.k.a. white culture) is more important. We also recognize that the Native Americans had the claim to the land, but they lost that claim. There are things to learn from cultures of the past, but the current culture is the most important. In short, Bundy and his boys are acting like ISIS. They have no respect for Native Americans or the artifacts of their culture. By all rights, they should prepare to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, which they would have to pay from behind bars if the Justice Department actually did their damn job by arresting and charging these assholes as the criminals they are.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Goes Full Racist On Oscars Boycott: ‘The Whites Don’t Get’ BET Nominations (VIDEO),"The Oscars have been experiencing some well-deserved backlash since January 14, when the show announced an all-white group of nominees for the 2016 Academy Awards. Chris Rock, who is hosting the show this year, called the show the  white BET Awards  while other celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee said they would not be attending the show. Since the uproar, many other celebrities have spoken out against racism in Hollywood and have supported the call to boycott the Oscars.But someone else has given their unwanted opinion   Republican presidential front runner and infamous racist Donald Trump. Never one to disappoint when it comes to being offensive, the business mogul went on Fox & Friends to share what he thought about the Academy Awards  lack of minority nominees. Actress and Fox contributor Stacey Dash set the stage when she criticized Black Entertainment Television (BET) for not giving out awards to white people. She said: I think it s ludicrous, because we have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you re only awarded if you re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It s a double standard. Trump followed Dash with his own awful take on BET and the Oscars controversy: I saw somebody on your show today say,  Well, what do we do with BET?  The whites don t get any nominations, and I thought it was an amazing interview, actually. I ve never even thought of it from that standpoint. Later in his rant, Trump added: I mean, I ve watched over the years where African Americans have in fact received Academy Awards and have in fact been represented. And this is not one of those years, but over the years I ve seen numerous black actors and African American actors receive awards and I think that s great. This doesn t happen to be one of those years.   It s a difficult situation. Trump also slammed Al Sharpton s push to tune out the A-list event, saying  Give me a break.

 A Picture Is Emerging: Everyone Who Has Ever Known Ted Cruz Grew To Hate His Guts,"Sen. Ted Cruz may be seeing a surge in the Republican primaries, but that s probably just because voters don t know him well enough yet. If ever there were a more unlikable person running for president, you d be hard pressed to find him, just ask anyone   literally anyone  who has ever had the misfortune of knowing Ted Cruz on a personal level.While it s not surprising that most Democrats view Cruz and his right-wing policies as morally abhorrent and intellectually idiotic, members of his own party are sounding the alarm as well. This week, former presidential candidate Bob Dole broke ranks and very publicly went after Cruz, dropping some uncomfortable truth bombs. I question his allegiance to the party,  Mr. Dole said of Mr. Cruz.  I don t know how often you ve heard him say the word  Republican    not very often.  Instead, Mr. Cruz uses the word  conservative,  Mr. Dole said, before offering up a different word for Mr. Cruz:  extremist. I don t know how he s going to deal with Congress,  he said.  Nobody likes him. Dole is being a bit too kind to Cruz, though. His allegiance isn t to Republicans or conservatives   it s to Ted Cruz. This is the man, after all, who almost unilaterally orchestrated a government shutdown to prove an insane political point about Obamacare. It cost the country billions, destroyed America s financial credibility overseas, and ultimately accomplished nothing   but it did get Cruz s name out there. Would Cruz do it again? In fact, he s already tried.But it s not just fellow politicians   on both sides of the aisle  who despise Cruz. His past is littered with people who are eager to publicly dish on how awkward, weird, and misanthropic Cruz was when they knew him. His former roommate at Princeton, the now legendary Craig Mazin, has spent much of the past few years relentlessly mocking Cruz on social media. He paints a very disturbing picture of his former Princeton peer.I have 30k followers now, and all I had to do was be stuck in a room with Ted Cruz for a year. I'm sure you're all nice, but SO NOT WORTH IT  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) January 18, 2016@GaucheFilms He s not my buddy. I loathe him, and I loathe what he stands for.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) October 27, 2012My freshman year college roommate Ted Cruz is going to be elected Senator. In case I hadn't made it clear, he's also a huge asshole.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) October 26, 2012But maybe Mazin has a personal beef with Cruz. Maybe Cruz was a messy roommate or something? Nope. Another former classmate recently backed up Mazin s assessment.People might think Craig is exaggerating. He's not. I met Ted freshman week and loathed him within the hour. https://t.co/2ZrbTdjHJh  Geoff (@gacohen) January 20, 2016Hilariously, The Daily Beast decided to track down more of his classmates to see if their stories matched Mazin s. What they found was an almost universal feeling that Cruz was a creepy, politically extreme asshole.In addition to Mazin and Leitch, several fellow classmates who asked that their names not be used described the young Cruz with words like  abrasive,   intense,   strident,   crank,  and  arrogant.  Four independently offered the word  creepy,  with some pointing to Cruz s habit of donning a paisley bathrobe and walking to the opposite end of their dorm s hallway where the female students lived. I would end up fielding the [girls ] complaints:  Could you please keep your roommate out of our hallway?'  Mazin says.Cruz exuded such creepy vibes that even in stories that are ostensibly not about how much he s loathed, people can t help but suggest it. The New York Times recently ran a story about Cruz s time working as a law clerk for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The story quickly devolved into former colleagues uncomfortably noting Cruz s sick fascination with murder. It freaked everyone out.In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment. Some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges.But don t worry, it s not just co-workers, roommates, politicians, and pundits that dislike Cruz. Average people do as well. In 2014, ABC News decided to take a novel approach to judging a politicians popularity: See what people were saying about them on Facebook. What they found was that 61 percent of the mentions of  Ted Cruz  on the social media site were unambiguously negative.So how does Cruz survive in politics despite being hated by everyone? It s not as hard as you d think. For one thing, he s backed by a small but powerful group of millionaires who like his anti-government policies. Secondly, he s a power-hungry, shameless opportunist who seizes the spotlight any time he can. For politicians there is no such thing as bad publicity. The more Cruz s mug shows up on Fox News, the more conservatives learn to live with his inherent creepiness.It s hard to imagine that particular set of skills translating to an effective presidency, however. At this crucial time in America s relations with other nations, having a man who oozes unlikability in the oval office could be a disaster in the making. It s also clear that Cruz will use any opportunity to glorify himself, even if it is at the expense of the good of the country. (See: Government shutdown.)The fact that everybody hates Ted, and that the hatred only grows once you get to know him, should be a MASSIVE warning sign that something is not right with the guy. Is that someone we want running the most powerful nation on Earth?Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Responsible Gun Owner Shoots Himself After ‘Accidentally’ Killing Friend (VIDEO),"On the night of January 7, 2016,  responsible gun owner  Justin Lowrie decided to skip the AA meeting he was scheduled to attend, so he could get drunk with friends.According to the Leader-Telegram, Lowrie was  experienced with firearms.  The 32-year-old alcoholic had been given a concealed carry permit by the state of Wisconsin two months before. The permit made it perfectly legal for Lowrie to take his 9 mm handgun to a drinking party.Around 10:30 pm, as the party was winding down, Lowrie and a group of friends were gathered in an apartment building in Rice Lake. He was holding his handgun.Two friends, Laura Polichnia and Cheri Fullarton, were standing  arm-in-arm  nearby. That s when Lowrie  accidentally  shot Fullarton in the face, killing her.Melissa Leland, a resident of the apartment building where the shooting took place, described the scene to WQOW. We heard a gunshot and all of a sudden people just started screaming and crying and after a couple of minutes went by, I went out of my apartment and checked to see what the heck was going on. One of my neighbors just came running at me crying,  He shot her. He shot her.' Someone from the apartment complex called 911. Before authorities arrived at the scene, Lowrie left the apartment where the group had been gathered. He returned to his own apartment, located two doors away from the apartment where Fullarton was shot.That s where he put the gun to his own head, pulling the trigger and ending his own life in a moment of drunken despair.The Leader-Telegram describes Lowrie as  a man with a troubled past and a drinking problem.  During an interview here, Lowrie s father said his son had been  troubled  due to his wife leaving him and his mother dying of cancer in 2014.The NRA says that everyone has the right to own a gun, regardless of mental and emotional health. Any attempt to prevent a tragedy like this is portrayed as an evil liberal plot to take their guns away and put them in FEMA camps or something equally as ignorant.Cheri Fullarton was a 37-year-old mother of three.During an interview with the Leader-Telegram, her brother, Roger Miller, said the family is struggling to deal with the loss. We try and remember how she loved her children, was pretty and intelligent,  he said. We re just mad as hell about how he was screwing around with a gun, even if he thought it was unloaded. Lowrie s distraught father told the Leader-Telegram, All I know is that Justin made the choices that he did in a drunken state and he s not here for me to ask why. During the same interview, Justin Lowrie s dad also said, I believe the Lord is going to save other people through this. We all wish he could take it back, but he can t; we don t get do-overs, but we can acknowledge the things that have happened and learn from them  to make better choices. Maybe this will change someone else s life. That would be great. But the gun-totin Jesus of right-wing Christian fantasy would never allow such a thing to happen.Here s more on this story from WQOW.WQOW TV: Eau Claire, WI NEWS18 News, Weather, and SportsFeatured image credit: Alice Taylor via Flckr cc 2.0",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 One Of The Bundy Idiots Is A Very Dangerous Man Who Could Cause Them Serious Problems,"When the Bundy Moron Militia first took over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon, Ammon Bundy put out the call for  Murican  patriots  to come and join the  fight.  In essence, a man who advocated for armed idiots to aim their assault rifles at federal agents because his father is a freeloading government leech called on the worst America has to offer to join him in doing it again, this time as aggressors.His call was answered by the likes of Jon Ritzheimer, whose insatiable appetite for attention couldn t resist and a slew of other unfavorable imbeciles who decided a patch of forest in Oregon was more important than their wives and children.The Oregonian, a local publication that has been covering the occupation, has uncovered that (at least) one of the men who showed up isn t just dangerous because he follows right-wing terrorists, he s actually a convicted murderer:Courtesy of the OregonianNiel Sigurd Wampler, circled above, was convicted in 1977 of the second degree murder of his own father at 29-years-old. After denying that he is the same Niel Sigurd Wampler that the Oregonian uncovered a murder conviction on, they confirmed his identity from his unusual name and a matching date of birth as well as a positive ID from a former prison guard who remembered him from when he was locked up.The details of the murder reveal an extremely disturbed individual. According to court records, Wampler killed his father while was sleeping by clubbing him in the head with an 18-inch steel eye bolt while he was in bed. Wampler apparently called the police and told them,  I have just killed my father. The leaders of the Bundy Bunch have distanced themselves from Wampler, denying that they know who he is, but as you can see from the picture above, he s been out and about and in plain view, often seen talking to other terrorists as well as the press.Wampler was also one of the men who appeared at the Bundy Ranch incident in Nevada, where The Las Vegas Review-Journal quoted him saying,  I myself am willing to be shot and killed for constitutional rights and principles.  He was also present at the Sugar Pine Mine confrontation last year in southern Oregon. For the leaders of the terrorists to refuse to acknowledge shows a great deal about his character, or lack thereof.That poses an interesting question: How is a man who is a convicted felon part of an armed occupation? According to a spokesman from Wampler s home town of San Luis Obispo, California, Wampler is forbidden from owning or possessing a firearm due to his felony murder conviction. When asked by the Oregonian if he was armed, he answered,  Oh, yes,  but refused to show his weapon.The serious problem this man poses is that if it is confirmed that he is or has been carrying a weapon in violation of Oregon law, will law enforcement continue to allow him to walk free? We re not talking about just guns here, either. Oregon law prohibits a convicted murderer from possessing  any instrument or weapon having a blade that projects or swings into position by force of a spring or by centrifugal force or any blackjack, slingshot, sandclub, sandbag, sap glove, metal knuckles or an Electro-Muscular Disruption Technology device (taser), or who carries a dirk, dagger or stiletto. There is a 15-year statute of limitations for those laws, unless the felon in question was convicted of murder. There s no word yet from law enforcement about action against a particular individual at the refuge, but clearly this man, who admitted to being armed, poses a direct threat not only to the local, state and federal agents he comes in contact with but also to the press covering the stupidity and the children the terrorists are using as a shield.Things just keep getting worse. Not only for the Bundy Terrorists but for the entire right-wing extremist movement in general.Featured image via the Oregonian",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Stephen Colbert’s Hilarious Response To Sarah Palin’s Crazy Speeches (VIDEO),"No one is happier to see Sarah Palin back in the news than Stephen Colbert. Following the former Alaska governor s endorsement of Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, Colbert now has plenty of material to make fun of the woman he called  the original material girl. God I have missed you. It s like a magical eagle made a wish on a flag pin and it came to life,  Colbert said of Palin s reappearance.  Which is great, for me,  he said,  because while Trump, admittedly, has given me so much material to make jokes about, nobody compares to the original material girl. Colbert played some of Palin s so-called  greatest hits,  referring to bizarre statements Palin made about  community organizer  Obama,  drill, baby, drill  and  we re gonna kick ISIS s ass!  Colbert said:  Sarah Palin just guaranteed Donald Trump the Evangelical vote, because I think she was speaking in tongues! While Donald Trump has been a frequent target of Colbert, no one has come close to the original  material girl.  Palin was a primary target of Colbert s during his 10-year run of his Colbert Report on Comedy Central.There s truly lots to make fun of. It seems that Palin has gone off the deep end lately more so than ever before. She even had the nerve to blame the president for her son s delinquency and her rambling speeches give a clear impression of someone that doesn t seem to have things together.In any case, Trump, who apparently is excited about Palin s endorsement, said that he would have a position for her in his administration, possibly vice president. It all sounds quite frightening. But for now let s laugh at these two.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donna Brazile DESTROYS Palin For Blaming Her Woman-Beating Son’s Arrest On Obama (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin did something entirely expected of her, yet so irrationally stupid that it is almost baffling following the arrest of her son for drunkenly beating his girlfriend and making threats with a semiautomatic weapon: She found a way to blame President Obama.At a Trump rally, where nonsensical bullshit is accepted as fact without question by the vapid, racist buffoons that make up the billionaire s base, Palin said that PTSD and Obama were the true culprits in her son s woman-brutalizing, ammosexual ways: I can talk personally about this, I guess it s kind of the elephant in the room. My son like so many others, they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country. And that starts from the top. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder, if they have to question, if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question though that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of some PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with,  Palin said.  And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of Americas finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them. Track Palin served with the Alaska-based 25th Infantry Division s 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team for a single year in 2008, while George W. Bush was still President.Palin s nonsensical claim didn t sit well with veterans   or with CNN political commentator Donna Brazile, who put Palin on blast Wednesday. You have known me for a long time, so I m just gonna say it: she s a liar,  Brazile told Anderson Cooper.  That s a damn lie.  She pointed out that House Republicans slashed $1.4 billion (with a  b ) from President Obama s requested budget for veterans  services, which included a $690 million reduction  for medical care   the sort of thing that would help veterans with PTSD: I care for all veterans   I am the daughter of a veteran. And to go out there and to insinuate that the president of the United States is trying to hurt veterans when in fact he is trying to put more resources so that we can give our young and old veterans the care we need, that s just a damn lie. You can say Donna Brazile said it. I approve this message. Of course [Track Palin] should be held responsible for his own personal behavior,  Trump supporter Jeffrey Lord contended when asked if Palin was right to blame Obama.  But we have been told time and time and time again that there is a serious problem within the VA treating veterans. And I think that s the point she s trying to make.  He did not explain how in the world blaming Obama brought attention to any issues with the VA. Drink the water, Jeff,  Brazile shot back.  Drink the water.

" Conservative Convicted Of Trying To Assassinate Obama With A Slingshot — Yes, A Slingshot (SCREENSHOTS)","A Wisconsin man who believed it to be his  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY  to kill the President was convicted last week of two counts of threatening Barack Obama. After four hours of deliberations, a jury of seven men and five women found 55-year-old Brian Dennis Dutcher guilty of writing a Facebook comment about assassinating the President upon learning of an upcoming visit, and of telling a security guard he would shoot Obama the day before POTUS  arrival in Tomah.In comments under a Facebook post in which he informed people that  all members of the fed gov have targets on their foreheads,  and that they should be shot on sight, Dutcher gleefully remarked that  the upsurper is coming HERE. saving me a 800 mile trip.  Dutcher explained that he planned to kill the President so his daughter can  live free. That s it! Thursday I will be in La Crosse. Hopefully I will get a clear shot at the pretend president,  he said in another post that was deleted before we had a chance to snag a screenshot in June.  Killing him is our CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY! In numerous other posts, Dutcher discussed killing the President, even expressing a desire for the Secret Service to  step out of the way long enough for someone    like him    to take the shot  so the President could be  exucuted.   Dutcher also said that he had a stockpile of fully automatic weapons and ammunitions, as well as plastic explosives, mortars, and other things that would make any NRA member s pants tighten a bit.With all that heavy equipment, it was shocking that Dutcher was arrested with After Tough Guy s arrest on July 2, Dutcher told Secret Service that he meant what he said, and he absolutely intended to use the slingshot to kill the  usurper. Dutch  was detained for 24 hours at a mental health facility in La Crosse, where he threatened the staff and accused them of   helping the tyrant.  He was then moved to Dane County Jail. He said he was very accurate with a slingshot,  Secret Service Special Agent Jeffrey Ferris testified.  His true intention was to circumvent security and figure out how to shoot (Obama) with a slingshot.  Dutcher told police that he had hunted animals with the slingshot and that he could kill a human with it. He also referenced the Biblical story of David and Goliath, with Obama apparently being the latter in the tale.Dennis the Menace Dutcher is due to be sentenced for his crimes in March. He faces up to five years in prison for each count, so he may have a long time to sit in the corner and think about what he did.Featured image via Wisconsin State Journal/Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Obama Visits Michigan, Blasts Republicans For ‘Short-Changing Basic Services’ (VIDEO)","On Wednesday, President Obama took a trip to North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, but while he was there he took time out of his itinerary to talk about the water crisis in Flint   and he didn t mince his words.During a speech, the president let the people of Flint know that he hears their cries: I am very proud of what I ve done as president, but the only job that s more important to me is the job of father. And I know if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself if my kids  health could be at risk. That s why over the weekend I declared a federal emergency in Flint. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) has identified at least twenty-seven kids with elevated levels of lead in their blood. However, that number is likely astronomically higher when you consider how long the people of Flint were drinking the contaminated water Governor Rick Snyder assuredthem was safe   even when he knew it wasn t. Unlike Obama, Snyder didn t think about how terrified parents must be for their children. His main concern was  balancing  a budget, safety be damned.The president also blasted Republican lawmakers for  short-changing  the people of Flint: It is a reminder of why you can t shortchange basic services that we provide to our people and that we together provide as a government to make sure that public health and safety is preserved. The horrifying thing about all of this is that if it were up to the GOP, this would happen a helluva a lot more often. The Republican Party absolutely despises regulations that they believe are unnecessary   that includes clean water and air.  As a matter of fact, last week while the Flint water crisis was raging on, Republicans in the House voted to overturn provisions of the Clean Water Act that protects streams. Last June, Senate Republicans voted to repeal the very same thing.Think about that for a minute. Lawmakers on both a state and federal level have known about the crisis in Flint for more than a year, and the GOP voted to repeal laws related to clean water at least TWICE in that time. These pro-life lawmakers didn t care at all that tiny humans were literally being poisoned, the only thing that mattered was sticking it to Obama because they didn t like his new provisions for the Clean Water Act.While Republican representatives in the federal government were trying to gut the Clean Water Act, Governor Snyder was busy ignoring the crisis in Flint. He knew that people were drinking dirty and instead of fixing the problem he just allowed children to continue to ingest lead. Not only did he know it was happening, he didn t care enough to stop it!The Flint water crisis a perfect example of what happens when Republicans are left in charge of anything   and it s terrifying.Watch:Featured image: video screenshot",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BET Had More Than A Few Things To Say To Stacey Dash About Her Hypocrisy (TWEETS),"By now you ve probably heard about the remarks Clueless  star and Fox News contributor Stacey Dash made about race, segregation and BET. However, if you haven t they went something like this: I think it s ludicrous. We have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards, where you re only awarded it you re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms, it s a double standard there shouldn t be a black history month. We re Americans. Period. Well, as you can only imagine that didn t go over so well. The twitterverse had her name trending within hours and pretty much everyone had something to say regarding Dash s ridiculous remarks. In fact, BET responded themselves. First by tweeting a link that displayed  Every Time Stacey Dash Proved She Was Clueless :Every Time Stacey Dash Proved She Was Clueless: https://t.co/mto8DSxVhe pic.twitter.com/NBDorO6Jna  BET (@BET) January 20, 2016THEN they tweeted:?

She really and truly seems clueless as her former role suggests.It s clear why Fox News hired her. Dash will say the things that clearly don t make sense to appeal to the audience that Fox has built up over the years   old, white people who are angry and scared of anyone who doesn t look or sound like them. It s too bad, really, because she s in a role where she could reach out to that audience to offer some much-needed clarity, but instead she caters to their myopic minds by agreeing with them and telling them what they want to hear.Featured image: Twitter ",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Numbskull Republican Ignores History, Says Reagan Would NEVER Negotiate With Iran","Republican Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) spoke with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins yesterday, on the radio show  Washington Watch,  where they discussed Obama s diplomatic victory in the peaceful release of Iranian prisoners.Perkins was very upset over the idea that we got Americans returned home by talking to Iran and using diplomacy. He suggested that America has hit a dangerously slippery slope in regards to Americans being held abroad in prisons, because the fact we did something to get our people home would only invite more and more demands in future incidents.Poe agreed that it was a very sad state of affairs for the nation. The  price  as he put it, that America had paid was simply too high. What price is acceptable, he didn t say. He only continued on to lament the fact that the days of Ronald Reagan and not negotiating with terrorists were gone from the country.Since he brought up Ronald Reagan and his policy of not negotiating with terrorists, let s take a closer look at that.During Reagan s second term, officials of his administration and very likely Reagan himself secretly and illegally sold weapons to Iran. Iran was under an arms embargo at the time because they were considered a terrorist state. The sale was done in order to bribe Iran to help facilitate the release of American hostages in Lebanon.The Republican revisionism and selective memory, when it comes to the legacy of Ronald Reagan is nothing short of amazing. The Iran-Contra scandal happened when practically every establishment Republican was alive and old enough to be able to watch the news or read the newspaper. It s like Germany insisting World War 2 never happened, and instead the entire nation was on vacation for 6 years.President Obama did everything right, getting our people home, not firing one bullet to do it, while not sending more weapons into the hands of those who can do us harm, and the first reaction from the right is to attack him for it.I m sure Republicans wish the prisoners were still being held so they had a political football, but can t they just try to repeal Obamacare again?[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/242909973  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]featured image via YouTube screen capture",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Millionaire Palin And Billioniare Trump Beg Gullible Supporters To Pay For Sarah’s Travel Costs,"If you ve ever noticed how Donald Trump brags more about how much money he s made than how much he s given away, that s because he s notoriously uncharitable. Apparently that same level of pennypinching applies to the people who come out to endorse him   even conservative celebrity Sarah Palin.According to a new fundraising email sent from Sarah Palin s controversial Political Action Committee (SarahPAC), Palin needs her supporters to break out their checkbooks and give as much as they can to the one time vice presidential candidate so she can attend  political events to support endorsed candidates  like Trump. The email, captured by Politico reporter Ken Vogel shamelessly tells Palin s loyal fans to visit the PAC s website to  [contribute] what you can  because Palin  went all in for Donald Trump. As bizarre as it is for Trump to not offer to cover travel expenses for his new best friend and political ally, it s downright offensive to suggest Palin herself can t afford to pay her own way, either. This is the same person, after all, who recently put her $2.5 million Arizona mansion on the market. She s also the person who quit her job as governor in order to cash in on a book deal and a Fox News gig that earned her around $12 million. She may not be Donald Trump rich, but she s wealthy enough to buy a ticket or two from Travelocity.Longtime followers of Sarah Palin s grift machine won t be surprised by this latest moneygrab. SarahPAC has consistently operated like a personal bank account for Palin. The millions of dollars pulled in by gullible conservatives rarely go to meaningful political campaigns. Instead, the  fiscal conservative uses the money to fund her lifestyle and promote her brand.As political watchdog group Open Secrets noted in 2014:What did SarahPAC spend most of its money on, then, in the third quarter? Many of the same consultants she has used all along   for speechwriting, fundraising, logistics and research. There s even someone paid to consult on  coalitions.  Travel, presumably for Palin, is part of the equation; a PAC like this is useful for keeping a high profile nationally without having to pay those pesky airline and hotel tabs out of personal funds. And the PAC sent $10,885 to HarperCollins   publisher of all three of Palin s books   for  books for donor fulfillment.  That wasn t the only book purchase by the committee: A lump sum of $13,000 was listed as being spent for  lodging, SUV rental, books for donors. In other words, Palin s SuperPAC is designed exclusively to (legally) steal money from conservatives hoping to get involved in the political process. Instead of using that money to fulfill her commitment, she spends it on  SUV rentals  and buying her own book in bulk to boost her sales. Now she says she needs more to keep up with Trump s traveling circus.In the interest of transparency, let s consider what one would get should they decide to give Palin some traveling money:It s been less than 24 hours Featured image: screengrab ",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Stacey Dash Weighs In On The Oscars, BET And Racism In America, And It Is ABSURD (VIDEO)","Never has a movie role so perfectly described a person as Stacey Dash s character in  Clueless  describes her. Dash, the newest token multi-racial person hired by Fox News, was asked for her opinion on the current controversy over the lack of minority representation at the Academy Awards and the Oscar boycott by prominent black actors and directors.Working for Fox News means you have to be a total sellout, and Dash is no exception. It s clear that the only reason she s being asked her opinion on the issue is to persuade the 68-year-old white men who dominate the network s demographics to believe that racism has in fact been cured in America, and here s a black woman who proves it.Dash goes on a tirade about the difference between segregation and integration, asserting that the only reason America sees any racism or segregation at all is because BET and the Essence Awards exist. She takes it one step further into absurdity by declaring we shouldn t have Black History Month.These are all the typical arguments of institutional racism, of course, and Fox must be awfully proud to be able to drop a woman of color in a chair opposite Steve Doocey to declare such myth as fact. The arguments are so transparent and weak. If white people had their own network, black people would lose their minds? White television dominates the networks, from the major players right down to Field and Stream TV, where the only black person you ll see is during a commercial break.For black people to hold their own awards show is reverse racism? Have you considered that there s a possibility that black people feel as though they re excluded from oh, say the Oscars? It s pretty obvious that all those poor white actors who are discriminated against by the jerks at BET have a show or two they can clearly call their own.The most ludicrous is Dash s contention that Black History Month is somehow promoting segregation. Yes, February   the shortest month of the year, mind you    is set aside to honor the contributions of African Americans. To racists and clueless idiots like Stacey Dash, that somehow gives Fox News hosts license to proclaim an unfair advantage to the black community, which is perhaps the most laughable sentiment of all time. April is Autism Awareness Month. Are we somehow discriminating against people with Down s syndrome by prioritizing autism for 30 days? How about March? March is Women s History Month. Are we being disrespectful to half of the population because we decide to celebrate the achievements of women?It s ludicrous. Where s the outrage over Italian-American Heritage Month? How about Polish-American Heritage Month? Why are they not on the radar for a good shellacking at Fox News?I think we all know why. Racism is NOT an issue America has solved; not by a longshot.Watch Stacey Dash make the standard arguments of institutional racism below:https://www.facebook.com/AndrewRamosTV/videos/473698129488396/Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Why We Should All Be Aware Of Ted Cruz’s Creepy Obsession With Murder And The Death Penalty,"Some people have a passion for writing or for music and the arts. Others make sure they stand up for human rights for all and/or the impacts of climate change on our global economy. Then there are the folks who you already thought were creepy and just became a lot more creepy when you find out that they re  obsessed  with murder and the death penalty.Enter: Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz.While it was thought that Cruz took a particular interest in the death penalty because his mentor s father was killed by a carjacker, he also obsessed over the details. As a Supreme Court clerk he was preoccupied with the details of murders, many say so that he could push for the death penalty. And while some were impressed that his passion was deep for this form of justice, others felt very differently.According to the New York Times: Other clerks, however, had a less admiring view of his interest. In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment. Some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges. In Cruz s own words within his book  A Time for Truth,  he wrote, I believe in the death penalty,  and he thought it was his job to  describe the brutal nature of the crime,  because  liberal clerks would typically omit the facts; it was harder to jump on the moral high horse in defense of a depraved killer. His obsession with the death penalty derived from his passion for conservative Judge J. Michael Luttig, and came through the death of Luttig s father. The New York Times describes their relationship as such: Judge Luttig engendered enormous loyalty from his clerks, who sat behind him as he wrote multiple drafts of an opinion over 20-hour days. But the ideological and intellectual connection between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Luttig also had an emotional element. The emotional element was intensified by Cruz s reaction to the murder of Luttig s father via carjacking. A carjacker who was, in fact, executed in 2002 for his crimes.Cruz brought his passion to the Supreme Court when he began his clerkship for Chief Supreme Court Justice at the time, William Rehnquist. It was there that he schmoozed his way through and got his feet wet in the world of national politics. His ardor for the death penalty continued and according to the NY Times: Mr. Cruz usually reserved his enthusiasm for his unsparing death penalty memos or the late nights when a prisoner from the appeals circuit under Chief Justice Rehnquist s oversight was slated for execution. On those nights, when he was responsible for addressing the flurry of 11th-hour motions from defense lawyers, he would rouse the chief justice at home, give his recommendation, get the chief justice s vote and then write up a memo that explained why the chief justice had voted to deny an emergency postponement of the execution. One would think, as the supposed Christian that Cruz says he is, he would err on the side of compassion and responsibility to ethics and reasonable doubt instead of pushing so hard for people to die. After all, according to the Bible, Jesus was killed via the death penalty.His passion for the death penalty is one that may show more than just his supposed love for justice, but rather about his character. It s odd, to say the least. Concerning, to be brutally honest. Is this the sort of person the United States needs as a Commander-in-Chief? One that is so eager to rush to judgment and push for people to be killed in some form of vengeful act? It truly explains his fervor for war and  carpet bombing  the Middle East to make the Islamic State  glow in the dark. To answer those questions, no, we don t need that sort of unstable person in office making critical decisions about foreign policy and national security. It wouldn t only be devastating for the nation, but for the entire world.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Has BIG Plans For Sarah Palin, And It’s Really, REALLY Terrifying (VIDEO)","If you re one of the people who saw Sarah Palin endorse Donald Trump for president and thought to yourself,  oh, God, she s back  with utter misery in your soul, you re most definitely not alone. She was the poison pill for John McCain s career. No, not just his presidential run in 2008, his career. He will always be the guy who put Palin on the national stage to torture all the world.Trump, being the bombastic person that he is, and not caring what anyone really thinks of him (even though he s obsessed with polls) thought it wise to bring Palin back into the spotlight after her failed attempts at everything from being a governor to a reality star, and propped her up embracing her endorsement. However, the endorsement isn t even half of his plans for her, and we, as a nation, should be f*cking mortified.Trump has now declared that there will be a role for Palin within his administration if he were to win the White House this upcoming November. He doesn t think she d actually want a role, which may actually be true considering that would require actual work and follow through, but he said the door is open to the possibility. He told NBC Today host Savannah Guthrie: She never made a deal, like so many people want to try and make deals. I mean, she just said: I really like what s going on, it s an amazing thing, I ve never seen anything like it in politics. Trump even insinuated that he may consider her as a potential vice presidential running-mate, saying: I haven t discussed it with her. No, I haven t discussed anything with her about what she d do, but she s somebody I really like and I respect. And certainly, she could play a position if she wanted to. The real estate mogul also took the chance to rub in the fact that he got Palin s endorsement over other candidates when he said: It s such an honor, because as you know, very badly, so many people are so disappointed that she didn t support them. Is it really, though? I mean, come on, look what she did to McCain.However, to drive the point home that a Trump win in November equals Palin in his administration, he said: But certainly there d be a role in the administration if she wanted, and I m not sure that she does want that. But there d certainly be a role. If Trump being the orotund racist with no policy experience wasn t enough for you to vote against him this November, his saying Palin will have an open spot in his administration should be the icing on the cake. It s more important now, than ever before, to make sure a Democrat wins the White House this fall.Would @RealDonaldTrump consider @SarahPalinUSA as a running mate?

 This Bible Study Leader’s Crimes Against A 14-Year-Old Girl Will Make Your Skin Crawl (VIDEO),"Yet another victim of sexual abuse can thank a church for introducing her to her assailant. The Calvary Christian Church in Del City, Oklahoma was the scene of a brainwashing that led to more than 50 counts of sexual abuse charges against 45-year-old Donnie Ray Shultz.Shultz, who has a history of sexual abuse, was allowed to volunteer to teach a class on church doctrine, in spite of his sordid past. While the class was supposed to be for adults, a spokesman said ,  apparently some participated in the class before they were eighteen. In this case, four years before. Even though the church was aware of Shultz s past when he joined 19 years ago, they are still  shocked  at the allegations. The girl told police that she had intercourse with Shultz 20-30 times and engaged in oral sex several times as well. Police are investigating Shultz for the possibility that there are other victims.You have to wonder how things like this continue to happen. The Catholic church, plagued by arrests and lawsuits over molested altar boys, still manages to let a priest or two through the cracks every now and then. People like Josh Duggar, who consider themselves to be of a higher moral fiber than the rest of us because of his relationship with Jesus, astound us with incredible acts of hypocrisy that can somehow be explained away with  a moment of weakness  and set aside because with enough prayer God forgives you.Does God sign some kind of a hall pass for depravity or is it merely implied?This church in Oklahoma most likely allowed a sick individual with a past that told a tale of immorality to volunteer to teach a class because he  repented.  They say he wasn t an employee and wasn t paid for his work, but that certainly doesn t excuse them or release them from liability for the hell an innocent 14-year-old girl went through because a serious lack of judgement.Watch the news report, courtesy of KOCO, below:Featured image via screen capture ",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Palin Blames Son’s Domestic Violence Arrest On Obama (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin has marked her return to the national stage as part of the Trump campaign with another doozy. Palin s son Track   a combat veteran   was recently arrested on domestic violence charges. He had a fight with his girlfriend, who told police that he threatened to kill himself with an AR-15 rifle.At a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Palin blamed her son s arrest on Obama. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder,  Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them,  she said.President Obama has made the care and security of military members a priority since he was first elected. At the top of that agenda was his decision to end the war in Iraq, which took thousands of American lives and permanently injured and disabled so many serving in the military.Obama has also sought to cut down on gun violence   specifically the problem of soldiers driven to suicide who use guns to end their lives.By comparison, Palin was in favor of the invasion of Iraq, and was part of a failed presidential ticket that promised to  bomb Iran,  a proposition which would have put more American soldiers in harm s way, and in her rambling incoherent speech with Trump she attacked Obama for proposing gun safety measures.But this is the Palin technique. A word salad with almost no meaning, combined with lies and deceptions in order to further the right wing s mission.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Won’t Believe What GOP Lead Poisoning Truthers Just Said About The Flint Water Crisis (VIDEO),"The GOP never ceases to amaze with its consistent insanity. This time the insanity has to do with the water contamination issue in Flint, Michigan. A Michigan Republican said that the Flint water crisis may be overstated and another said that it s actually a  hoax.  L. Brooks Patterson, an Oakland County executive said that the water crisis had been  vastly overstated. However, blood testing of Flint s children has found dangerously high levels of lead after the cash strapped city stopped buying water from Detroit and instead drew corrosive water from the Flint River beginning in April, 2014. Despite the tests, Patterson is skeptical. He made the statement after  GOP political analyst Bill Ballenger had opened a debate on the issue during a radio interview.  I think, well, that s the other side,  Patterson said.  Let s wait and see what the facts show. On the radio show, Bill Ballenger said that tests on his own blood had found no elevated levels of lead: This has been a vastly overblown crisis, perpetuated by a lot of politicians with an axe to grind and, for that matter, the news media, and some national figures, some political, some entertainers who don t know what they re talking about. I had my blood tested just yesterday, and I have no elevated blood-lead level   it s way down there. The idea that the entire population of Flint has been poisoned and that we all have elevated blood-levels because of this is just a total canard. It s just a crock, and for this to be perpetuated as a story is doing a lot of damage to Flint as a community. The evidence or lack of evidence cited in Ballenger s rant has given Patterson reason to doubt whether the children of Flint, who don t have any access to fresh drinking water, were contaminated despite the tests that were done. Patterson said that Ballenger was  adamant that he lives in Flint, he drinks the water, he showers in that water.  Ballenger even described the water crisis as a  hoax. Ballenger s evidence is at best anecdotal. Whether he drank Flint s water or not, it s children who are much more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults. Eden Wells, Michigan s chief medical executive, said that all children who drank the city s water since April of 2014 have been exposed to high levels of lead. That is at least 8,657 children. The long term effects of elevated blood levels can lead to many health complications: The long-term effects of elevated blood lead levels in children may include slow development, reduced Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores, learning disabilities, hearing loss, reduced height and hyperactivity. Very severe lead exposure (blood lead levels greater than 80  g/dL) can cause coma, convulsions and even death. It boggles the mind that the Republicans would rather talk about ISIS or repealing Obamacare, while they dismiss an unfolding tragedy in an American city that s affecting thousands of American kids.Feature image via screengrab",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Deranged Michigan Congressman Thinks Disaster Relief For Flint Is Unconstitutional: Here’s Why,"Representative Justin Amash (R-Mich.) thinks that providing disaster relief to the people of Flint, Michigan is unconstitutional (Full Disclosure: Amash is my current representative). Amash is a libertarian, and a Constitutional Originalist. That means that he takes the extreme view that the Constitution should be interpreted as the original framers would have. He s besties with Rand Paul, and a darling of the Tea Party. I have been to many of his speaking events. No matter what the topic is, his supporters mostly only want to know the latest news on Benghazi.Amash s extremist view, that is shared with the likes of Justice Scalia, has led him to be very vocal in his opposition to giving federal assistance to the people of Flint. Here is Amash s reasoning for his opposition: While the U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal government to intervene in an intrastate matter like this one, the State of Michigan should provide comprehensive assistance to the people of Flint. The residents who were harmed deserve an independent, nonpartisan investigation, and the persons responsible for this crisis must be held accountable. Michigan needs federal assistance. That s the bottom line. It is estimated that it will cost $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. It is tragic that Republicans can rail against the government, working to dismantle the effectiveness of its apparatus on every level, only to have their failed schemes be bailed out by the government. However, we are the United States. We come together in times of crisis. Man-made, or otherwise. 10 people have already died from legionaries disease, people need help now.There is absolutely no Constitutional argument against providing disaster relief to the people of Flint, outside of the mad imaginings of what these loons think the Constitution is. Fortunately, Amash and similarly minded people in Congress don t have the collective political power to actually prevent disaster relief funds to places that need them.That s why the Hurricane Sandy spending package of $9.7 billion dollars was approved of, despite Amash s and other Republicans votes against the package, in 2013. Yeah, he voted against disaster relief for those hurt by Hurricane Sandy too. At least Amash is consistent in his world view, even if that world view is a complete departure from reality.By Gage Skidmore from Peoria, AZ, United States of America (Justin AmashUploaded by AlbertHerring) [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Viral Video Captures The Importance Of Investing In Children,"Released in September 2013, this short video about the power of Giving instantly went viral. Once you ve seen it, you ll understand why.Produced by TrueMove H in Thailand, the three-minute video reminds us of how taking care of others comes full circle, touching our own lives in ways that we cannot begin to foresee.It s especially relevant in today s political climate, where the conversation is too often dominated by Ayn-Rand-worshiping right-wing politicians, accompanied by a choir of religious leaders who feed the masses a poison concoction of fear and hate, served up in a glittering bowl of egotism and self-righteousness.At the beginning of the video, a young boy has been caught stealing. An outraged, unmerciful shopkeeper is in the process of shoving him around in the street, screaming and ranting as she does so.But the owner of a nearby cafe intervenes. He gives the shopkeeper money out of his own pocket to cover what the boy stole. He then sends his young daughter into his own store for vegetable soup, after learning the boy s mother is sick.For those who haven t seen how the video ends, watch it below, courtesy of Elon Iva on YouTube.(*You may want to have a box of tissues nearby.)In a larger context, the story told on this video is one of social responsibility.For those on the right who are constantly asking  Why should I have to Whether we re talking about giving to the poor or investing in public education, there s a message in this video that we all should pay attention to.The right promotes the false idea that a society full of Ayn-Rand individualists can be healthy and functional. According to that way of thinking, other people s lives aren t our responsibility. We don t need to invest healthcare or support programs that  enable the freeloading poor.  The only person that matters is  me, myself and I. What the right consistently fails to understand is that when you live in a society, every person is connected in some way or another.The video especially speaks to the need to invest in public education. While it was once seen as a  Christian mission  to make sure that every child has equal access to education, today s right wing Christians view education as an  evil.  Yet, just a few decades ago the Christian church believed that every child should learn to read and write. How else can a child read the Bible?But the church is now a corporation, and as we can clearly see by examining  Christian corporations  involved in things like educaAs the video shows, investing in a child s future is anything but a  waste.  It s an investment in our own future, and in the future of our society.The school to prison pipeline that we ve set up in the United States is costing our society hundreds of billions of dollars every single year. Instead of investing in the future of our country s most vulnerable citizens, we cut funding for the programs that benefit kids the most.At the same time we create more and more laws, with harsher and harsher punishments, pouring more and more of our tax dollars into the prison industrial complex, while taking more and more away from public education.What we see in our society today is the result of our decade s long experiment with right wing  tough on crime  policies and Ayn-Randian ideals of individualism. It doesn t work.We have fewer and fewer students graduating with the skills needed to become doctors or Scientists or mathematicians. The number of students enrolling in college is also consistently declining. At the same time, every year in the U.S. more than two million young people enter into the juvenile justice system. The majority of these  criminals,  95 percent, are not arrested for violent crimes.Last week teachers working for the Detroit Public School System released shocking pictures of the deplorable conditions inside the city s schools. If we need a vision of America under the influence of right wing ideology, we can look to Detroit to see the future.Educating and caring for children used to be a priority to Americans. But that system has been replaced with a new system which prefers mass incarceration.This video is an important reminder that when we invest in our society s children, somewhere down the road we will reap the benefits. On the other hand, when we throw children away because of petty crimes, we re throwing away possibilities that we may not even be able to imagine.*Featured image credit: video scree capture TrueMove H via YouTube",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bundy Terrorists Attend A Community Meeting, Get Chewed Out By Angry Residents (VIDEO)","Ammon Bundy and his band of armed domestic terrorists attended a meeting of Harney County residents on Tuesday night, and discovered they are universally loathed.During the meeting held in the gymnasium at Burns High School, residents took turns telling Bundy and his pals to get the hell out of their home as they looked on in silence.The militants had made an unexpected appearance, which is why residents made the most of the opportunity to slam them to their faces.Since the beginning of the month, Bundy and friends have occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge after seizing a federal building on park grounds and turning it into their own personal compound from which they have threatened law enforcement, used federal vehicles as their own, and torn apart federal property.Bundy claims his group is doing all of this to force the government to reverse the five-year prison sentence of Dwight and Steven Hammond, who were convicted of setting fire to federal lands. Five years is the minimum mandatory sentence for committing arson, something a resident angrily pointed out while also noting that minimum mandatory sentencing affects everyone and were put in place by Republicans. It has been around for 20 years and it was the Republicans who put them in place,  resident Isabelle Fleuraud said.  For 20 years mostly inner-city, poor, minority men have been unjustly jailed for endless sentences  The Hammonds committed the crime, and they got the sentence that was appropriate for that crime. And it is very sad, but it is sad for everybody in America who has an unfair sentence. Not just the Hammonds. She went on to blast Bundy for invading the community and told him he belongs in a jail cell.On woman told Bundy to give them back their home so people will stop stressing out over the occupation.Indeed, the local area has been basically on lockdown since the standoff began. Schools have been closed and area businesses have taken a hit.Ed Brown told Bundy that he agrees that the government is too big but even he wants the gunmen to leave.  But the same hand, get the hell out of my yard. Look what you did to this county,  he said.And when Oregon judge Grasty stood toe to tow with Bundy and told him to get the hell out of his county to his face, the residents cheered and chanted  Go, go, go, go. It is time for you to go home,  Grasty declared.  I don t care if it s Utah. Go home will you? We got families. We need to move on. Here s the video via YouTube.Bundy and his armed band are unwelcome by the local community they claim to be fighting on behalf of. That alone should be enough to convince them to leave with their tails tucked between their legs. But so far, they have refused to budge. And frankly, their treason is tiresome and would have been put to a swift end if they weren t white rednecks. That being said, it s time for the Justice Department to arrest all of the members of this group and throw the book at them, something one Oregon lawmaker has already ripped them for failing to do during a speech on the House floor.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 2015 Broke A New Climate Change Record And It’s Bad News For The Planet,"Every year without fail, the first major snowstorm to hit the Northeast is greeted by Fox News as  proof  that global warming is a myth. It doesn t matter that the claim is nonsensical, it s picked up and mindlessly repeated by their viewers and reinforced by Republicans in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. But this year might be a little different as scientists announced that 2015 is officially the hottest year on record, not just beating the record set in 2014, but smashing it:Scientists reported Wednesday that 2015 was the hottest year in recorded history by far, breaking a record set only the year before   a burst of heat that has continued into the new year and is roiling weather patterns all over the world.In the continental United States, the year was the second-warmest on record, punctuated by a December that was both the hottest and the wettest since record-keeping began. One result has been a wave of unusual winter floods coursing down the Mississippi River watershed.Those floods have negatively impacted millions and killed dozens, if not more. And don t forget the bizarre spat of unseasonable winter tornadoes that have been ripping through parts of the country, destroying communities and costing more lives. But it s going to snow this weekend so everything is A-OK!Unfortunately, it doesn t matter what we do now. We re locked into some of the worst effects of Climate Change for the next couple of centuries. Our children and their children will be thanking us for the gift of wild and unpredictable weather. Even worse, doing nothing will guarantee that the planet will become completely incapable is sustaining human civilization as we understand it. Yet, Republicans are still fighting even the mildest of measures tooth and nail in pursuit of the short term profits of their fossil fuel masters.Let s hope that future generations will have the luxury of examining the past and not be forced to focus on simple survival in a climate rendered inhospitable to human life.Featured image via the New York Times",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Man Who Threatened To Shoot Muslims Uses The ‘Fox News Made Me Do It’ Defense,"A California man who by his own account spent much of 2015 binge watching Fox News and getting progressively more angry about Muslims says that the only reason he repeatedly threatened to kill Muslims was because he had a toxic mix of alcohol abuse and Fox abuse problems.In 2015, after months of watching Fox News air thinly veiled hate speech regarding Muslims, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations activist group in particular, California resident John David Weissinger began leaving voicemail messages for the employees of CAIR in which he threatened to shoot them. Even more disturbing, Weissinger had already been known to linger around the front of the CAIR office.Apparently, Weissinger could have made good on his threats as well. After police went to arrest him for his threats, they found he possessed an illegal assault rifle. (In at least one of his voicemails, Weissinger insisted that he had enough guns and ammo to come and  kill all of you.  He wasn t kidding.)In many ways, Weissinger s story bears a striking resemblance to that of the right-wing terrorist who went on a mass shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood that same year. Like Weissinger, the man charged with the crime gave verbatim right-wing talking points as justification for his murder spree. Also like Weissinger, he had plenty of guns and ammo to make his threats turn into a massacre.Weissinger pled guilty to hate crime allegations, making a criminal threat, and possession of a illegal assault rifle. At his sentencing hearing, his lawyer tried to diminish his culpibility by suggesting Fox News had whipped him up into a hate-fueled fury and alcohol had lowered his judgment. He barks when he s drunk,  Malowney told a judge during the Tuesday sentencing hearing, as quoted by KFMB.  He was reeling from depression and anxiety. Between Fox News, Donald Trump, and other conservative politicians, the most fanatical right-wing extremists have plenty of material to stoke their paranoid racial and social anxieties. In at least one analysis, Fox News was found to lie to its audience on a consistent basis  over 50 percent of statements made by Fox News pundits were found to be blatantly false  and many of those lies center around stereotypes of groups conservatives hate. Fox has always been a network built by and for conservatives, but increasingly, it has become a gross manufacturer of smears against minorities meant to confirm pre-conceived biases of its old, white audience.The results of all this hate-mongering is as disturbing as it is clear: Instances of hate crimes, particularly against Muslims, have skyrocketed. Mosques and other Muslim owned buildings are being vandalized. Many are being burned to the ground in a national outbreak of arson cases.And if there is any question as to who is stoking these acts, just listen to the right-wing terrorists themselves. They ll tell you. Weissinger has told you.  Fox News made me do it.

 Sarah Palin And Donald Trump Are NOT Going To Like Today’s NY Daily News Cover (IMAGE),"The New York Daily News is becoming well-known for its political, controversial and not-so-subtle covers, especially when it comes to the Republican party. So when former Alaska governor and ex-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed GOP front runner Donald Trump, the Daily News certainly didn t disappoint.TwitterOn its front page, the NYDN blasted Palin for endorsing such an imbecile, showing a photo of the two conservatives with enormous text that read,  I M WITH STUPID. Implying that it was a match made in heaven, the smaller text read,  Hate minds think alike: Palin endorses Trump.  Judging from the reactions on social media, there were a lot of people who felt the same exact way.TwitterTwitterTwitterWhen you consider the things Palin has said in the past, as well as her more recent comments when she announced her support for Trump as president, the  I m with stupid  reference makes absolute sense. Especially when you consider this statement, in which Palin talked Trump up: He builds things, he builds big things. Things that touch the sky. Big infrastructure that puts other people to work. He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard hats and the steel-toed boots and the work ethic that you all have within you. He, being an optimist, passionate about equal opportunity to work. This self-made success of his, you know that he doesn t get his power, his high, off of opium  other people s money   like a lot of dopes in Washington do. They re addicted to opium, where they take other people s money and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right? The NYDN has never been a fan of The Donald   when the real estate mogul announced that he was running for the White House, the Daily News published a cover that said  CLOWN RUNS FOR PREZ  with Trump s face covered in clown makeup.While Palin has put in her completely nonsensical endorsement of Trump, it s probably safe to say that NYDN won t be.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ted Nugent Calls For The Death Of President Obama, Goes Off On Racist Rant (VIDEO)","Ted Nugent woke up on the wrong side of the bed Wednesday morning. Pretty soon the Secret Service will be knocking on his door. Not long after 7:00 a.m. central time, Nugent was already in the mood to call President Obama a  chimp ass punk  that needed to be  tried for treason and hung,  along with Secretary Clinton for their handling of, you guessed it, Benghazi. He must have made his coffee a little bit too strong, sending him into a caffeine-filled rage. That, or he s just the same Ted we ve all come to know over the years.We get that the right-wing is all rattled up about the new  13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi  movie that just hit theaters. Nugent must have stayed up all night watching it on repeat judging from his post. Immediately after threatening the life of President Obama, Nugent goes into a long rant detailing what he considers to be evidence that Clinton and Obama are just the worst two people on the face of the planet. What s funny is that even though he comes to the conclusion that they need to be  hung,  he resorts to lighter language in the very next paragraph saying instead, this  raises dramatic new questions.  There really is a difference. Either it s convincing, or it s not, Ted. Which one is it?Pic via Facebook.We won t even attempt to go into the subject of Benghazi, because it s been talked about too much already, and we re not trying to get into the business of entertaining this guy any more than he already is. The fact is, this guy s blinders are truly on. We don t recall Ted getting all huffy puffy at George W. Bush and Co. for his handling of the Iraq War. There were too many failures to mention. Nevermind that, though, right?Here s a video of Nugent from a few years back where he said,  I m not going to call people names anymore.  He actually repeated it TWICE, when the interviewer called him out on it, not thinking he would commit to it. So, he doubled down. At the time, he sounded serious, but as you can see, we all know how that ended up.Oh, and that Benghazi movie Ted was all worked up about? It tanked at the box office. It was a total, abject failure. So much for that bogus message gaining any steam.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bristol Palin Points Out She’s NOT A Graduate Of Harvard – Gets Roasting Of A Lifetime (IMAGES),"Bristol Palin didn t go to Harvard Law School like President Obama or her frenemy Ted Cruz did.

Someone, please get ahold of Bristol s personal assistant, email inbox, whatever she uses to keep in touch with the vast worldwide community she tries to communicate with on a daily basis, and tell her: WE ALREADY KNOW THIS, PRECIOUS.Pic via PatheosNevermind the fact that she forgot to use the word  be,  thereby automatically rendering her sentence structurally unsound. That s less important. Let s soak in for a moment the gist of what she s saying, that is, if it s even humanly possible.First, here s some context. In a nutshell, Bristol is glad her mom has decided to endorse Donald Trump. She s mad that Ted Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler issued the following statement when rumors first started circling that Sarah Palin would throw her support behind the Donald: I think it [would] be a blow to Sarah Palin, because Sarah Palin has been a champion for the conservative cause, and if she was going to endorse Donald Trump, sadly, she would be endorsing someone who s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on partial-birth abortion. She then went on a long diatribe of how she  likes Cruz  after meeting him, but that this statement was just way over the line. Cue the inspired  I didn t go to Harvard Law School  quote. In other words, she s saying she knows a few things despite not knowing other things.Okay, we re done trying to understand Palin logic. Our heads are starting to hurt. Cue the internet reaction where she s currently getting the roasting of a lifetime for making the comment.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.In all fairness, we finally do get what Bristol was trying to say: She s not that bright but is still going to speak up regardless. In that respect, the apple doesn t seem to fall too far from the tree. Perhaps next time she can say something like:  I didn t get married, but I still know how to teach abstinence and make babies at the same time.

 GOP Strategist: Trump Supporters Are All ‘Crazy’ Nazis ‘Who Masturbate To Anime’ (VIDEO),"When one searches for the perfect way to describe supporters of Donald Trump, many things come to mind. Many are white supremacists. They re almost all Islamophobic bigots. They re definitely uneducated cretinous taint barnacles. They re violent people who express their discontent in the form of beatings. But no one, no one, has described Trump fans so perfectly as GOP strategist Rick Wilson.Responding to a question about Trump s massive white supremacist following on MSNBC s All In With Chris Hayes, Wilson let his frustration with the sort of people Trump is attracting fly loose. I think that there is definitely still a very significant portion of the party that is a limited government conservatism based faction of the overall coalition,  Wilson said.  Now the screamers and the crazy people on the all-right as they call it, you know, who love Donald Trump, who have plenty of Hitler iconography in their Twitter icons and names They sure do,  Hayes interrupted.  I can back that up.  Wilson continued:Yes, he went there: Donald Trump s supporters are basement-dwelling neckbeards who possess a strong sense of ethnic nationalism and are brought to climax by pictures of cartoon characters. Wilson says that, despite Trump s wide appeal among conservatives, he doesn t think  this other stuff that Trump is toying with is really a part of the mainstream conservative movement by any stretch of the imagination. The question to me is, this is all going to be tested, right?  Hayes replied.  I agree with you: there are large parts of people who are avowed Republicans and conservatives who genuinely care about limited government. But what we re seeing right now is this sort of electoral test. And that s what makes today so fascinating, this fight so fascinating.

 WATCH: This Hilarious Video Is The Only Way Palin’s Trump Endorsement Word Salad Makes Any Sense,"Sarah Palin s horrific word salad of an endorsement of Donald Trump on Tuesday evening didn t make sense in any language resembling English, but a viral Vine video puts Palin s praise in the only context where it works: In the mouth of Iggy Azalea.In the video from Lindsey Bieda entitled  Iggy s freestyle has gotten quite a bit weaker,  the words from Azalea s rap breakdown have been replaced by audio of Palin from the Trump announcement.Instead of the Australia-born Azalea s  Fancy,  we hear Palin s eardrum piercing rhyme:  Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions. In case you feel like the creator of the Vine took poor Palin out of context, this is the entire paragraph from that section of the speech, which would probably make the most epic rap video in history if it received the same treatment:Well, and then, funny, ha ha, not funny, but now, what they re doing is wailing,  well, Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they re not conservative enough.  Oh my goodness gracious. What the heck would the establishment know about conservatism? Tell me, is this conservative? GOP majorities handing over a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to be coming on over border as we keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that s why we elected them and sent them as a majority to DC. No! If they re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell us that we re not conservative enough in order to be able to make these changes in America that we know need to be Now they re concerned about this ideological purity? Give me a break! Who are they to say that? Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter. Tell her she s not conservative. How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the establishment. Right.Got that?At least with the Azalea video you don t have to watch Trump off to the side, leering as he watches the grotesque display go on and on and on.Featured image via YouTube/Vine",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Racist Joe Arpaio Extorts Money For Re-Election By Threatening To Retire (SCREENSHOTS),"Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is a vile creature. The 83-year-old has reigned over the Arizona county for more than twenty years, much to the dismay of the Hispanic community, and he s running for office again. But, the way he is soliciting donations from his scared, xenophobic supporters this time around is absolutely infuriating.In an email sent out to supporters recently, America s Most Racist Sheriff extorts money from his ignorant voters by threatening to retire. The email s subject line is: Announcement: I ve made a difficult decision  and begins by calling on his  patriots  to support him or else: After hours of prayer, and countless frank discussions with my wife Ava and other trusted advisors, I have decided my time as Sheriff is over, unless I can count on you to stand with me this election. Arpaio then goes on to blame  left-wing elites,  his immigration stance,  Obama s political machine,  and  Hollywood leftists  for the tough road he has ahead of him should he decide to run for re-election. He tells his supporters that they need to empty their wallets and help him defeat the scary liberals who want to see him out of office: For some of you $5 is all you can spare today. But for others $500 or even $1,000 is a sacrificial gift you are willing to make. My team has told me that because our reserves are almost completely drained I will need to raise at least 5 million dollars to have a fighting chance, so every single dollar helps. To be clear, this is absolutely, 100 percent extortion. The definition of which is  the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats. He is threatening that he will retire and not bother to run again unless his faithful, immigrant-hating supporters shell out money for him. He doesn t just tell them he d like to be their sheriff again, he threatens them. And this isn t the first time he has duped voters.In 2015, he sent an email out with a similarly deceiving subject line: They re trying to recall me.  Nobody was trying to recall him at the time. I mean, we always want to recall him but there wasn t a concerted effort to remove him from office.It s not surprising that he would stoop to such levels. This is, after all, the man who can be blamed for countless deaths in his jail and has made the lives of Latinos in his community a living hell. He was Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump. His bombastic, hate-filled rhetoric garnered him the support of many top Republicans   including former-Governor Jan Brewer.Since 1993, he has unleashed hell on brown-skinned people in his Phoenix. And sadly, every time he is up for re-election he wins because people just don t vote or they have become complacent. For whatever reason, he continues to sail to victory each time he runs.Hopefully, Maricopa County voters will be so turned off this newest extoruion plot and they ll vote for someone else   but, I won t hold my breath.See the full email below:   And here s a video to remember why we hate this guy so much: Featured image via Facebook",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 These 10 Seconds Of Sarah Palin’s INSANE Trump Endorsement Perfectly Capture The Crazy (VIDEO),"Pretty much all of Sarah Palin s endorsement of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump was definitely off the wall. You weren t sure if you were watching a circus performance by a lady dressed in wind chimes, a piece of visual art that you might find at the Museum of Modern Art, or a person just before they get a psych evaluation.Nonetheless, there Palin was in all her glory. Watching her speak, you really couldn t tell if she was just really excited or maybe just really drunk. However, her enthusiasm for Trump was most definitely spirited and could be felt through television sets across the nation by people who were dumbfounded at what they were actually witnessing.However, if there was one moment of all the crazy moments that could perfectly sum up the embodiment of Palin s long-winded endorsement of a man who shouldn t even be allowed on a tour of the White House, let alone be president, this was it:Sarah Palin s poetry to describe Trump supporters pic.twitter.com/Hl2OmGIxZT  Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) January 20, 2016If you need a translator to figure out what the hell she just said, it went something like: How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. In all honesty, that s really all she needed to say. That pretty much wraps up the modern-day Republican party full of extreme right-wing, bitter people clinging to their guns and religion and pretending to follow the Constitution. It s also the perfect summary of her entire speech. Everything else, along with that jumbled sentence, sounded like drunken jibber jabber to the point Donald Trump looked extremely uncomfortable standing next to her with a look of  oh sh*t, what did I just do?  However, now he s stuck with her and all her unhinged glory. Hopefully she ll bring the same luck to Trump s campaign that she brought to John McCain s.Featured image: Twitter",News,"January 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michigan Gov. Poison Gets Humiliated By Mark Ruffalo After Admitting Flint Disaster Is His Katrina,"Governor Rick Snyder should probably stay off social media for the rest of his life.During an interview on Monday, the Republican governor admitted that the Flint water crisis was mishandled; however, he didn t quite go so far as to blame himself. After all, he s a Republican. Everyone else is to blame. The checks and balances that theoretically could have been there didn t work. This is a mess. I mean, I feel terrible about all this happening. And that s why I m working hard to do everything I can to repair the damage and then actually work to strengthen Flint and the citizens. After being asked if this is his Katrina, Snyder said that  it s a disaster. So far, ten people have died and the entire community has been forced to deal with a calamity that never should have happened in the first place. In a lazy attempt to save money, the state switched Flint s water supply from Lake Huron a the river which has been undrinkable for decades due to lead and other industrial chemicals. In short, the state provided the residents of Flint with poisoned water.Snyder has taken a lot of criticism since the disaster gained national attention, especially from Rachel Maddow, and many have called for his resignation and prosecution, which is why he posted an ill-advised tweet on Sunday. Political statements and finger pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the Flint water crisis,  Snyder wrote in the hopes of keeping people from blaming him.Political statements and finger pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the Flint water crisis.

Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) January 18, 2016The bottom line is that it is a well known fact that the Flint River was abandoned as a drinking water source for a damn good reason back in 1964 after industrial pollution made the water unsafe for consumption. So it s been public knowledge that Flint River has been contaminated for 50 years now, but officials appointed by Snyder made the switch anyway and ignored history and the facts.That is why kids are going to have problems in the coming years are they become adults and it is why 10 human beings are dead and it is why an entire community is in crisis. A crisis that only third-world countries usually have to deal with. And that is precisely why Rick Snyder should resign in disgrace and face prosecution. People are dead because of his irresponsible leadership, so he should have to pay the price for it.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 We Watched Sarah Palin’s Trump Endorsement Speech So You Don’t Have To (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin made her first campaign appearance with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and it featured all of the authentic frontier gibberish we ve come to expect from the half-term governor and professional grifter.Let s dive into Shrieky McJutty s official endorsement of the GOP frontrunner, shall we? Mr. Trump! You re right! Back there in the press box, heads are spinnin . Media heads are spinnin . Nah. It s not that big a deal other than the fact that Sarah Palin single-handedly managed to make Trump s campaign even less serious than it already was. Put another way, Trump already acts like he s in the throes of dementia, and Palin s endorsement is like Trump getting bonked over his bewigged head with a cartoon-sized mallet. It s like a Twitter troll suddenly being defended in a flame war by the Twitter troll s drunken babysitter. Palin simply doesn t realize that everyone outside the GOP bubble watches her because she s stupid and says stupid things   not because she s any sort of political threat. Obviously.I was told, you know, warned left and right, you are gonna just get so clobbered in the press. You are just gonna get beat up. Chewed up n  spit out. N  you know, I m thinkin  And?Again, she s going to get clobbered because she has no business on a national stage discussing serious political matters. Why? Not just because she speaks as if she used Google Translate to transform her remarks into German, then translated from German back into what can only be described as horribly fragmented English, but chiefly because her speeches are mainly about her   how she always goes rogue and how the  lamestream media  hates her.To wit: When I was on stage nominated for veepee, and I got to say, [in creepy whisper voice] Yeeaaah  I ll go  Send me  You betcha  I ll serve Yes, she has a stellar record of serving   for part of her term, then quitting. And then when the McCain campaign tried to get her to stay on message, she  went rogue  and helped to doom her ticket. Good job.And now, I challenge you to sentence-diagram the following passage. Warning: it gets particularly gibberishy by the end.I m in it because just last week, we re watchin  our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage, at the hands of Iranian captors in violation of international law because a weak-kneed capitulator-in-chief has decided that America will lead from behind. And he who would negotiate dills [sic] uh kinda  like with the skills of a  community organizer maybe organizing a  neighborhood tea. Well, he deciding that no, America would apologize and, uh, as part of the dill [sic] as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow and we apologize and then we bend over and say  thank you, enemy? The sailors were hastily released unharmed. If Trump were president, the sailors would be dead because we d already be at war with Iran. If Palin were president, the sailors would be dead and we d be at war with the Hamburglar. [Trump] is beholden to no one but We The People. This is Trump she s talking about? Trump. Who s all about Trump, and who puts the name  Trump  on everything he touches? That Trump? Is beholden to the people? That s rich. No more pussyfootin  around. Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best. Pussyfootin ? He is from the private sector, not a politician. Can I get a  hallelujuah!  Where in the private sector where you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize to keep the main thing the main thing. And he knows the main thing. Hallelujah? Did that just happen at a Trump rally? Jesus. Also, no, balancing budgets isn t about keeping the main thing the main thing, whatever the fuck that means. Oh, and yes, Trump is a politician. If one runs for president, one is a politician by default. Sorry. And then funny. Haha. Not. Funny. But now what they re doing is wailing,  Trump and, uh, uh, his trumpeters, well they re not conservative enough.  Oh my goodness gracious, what would the establishment know about conservatism? It s at this point when Jay P. Morgan, Jamie Farr and Rip Taylor would simultaneously gong her off the stage.How about the rest of us? Right-wingin , bitter clingin  proud clingers of our guns, our God, our religion, and our Constitution.How is it possible to be both resentful of Obama s  clinging  remarks, while also being proud of it? It can t be both. By the way,  bitter clingin  proud clingers  is my new favorite Palinism, right up there with the time when she said the role of the vice president is  position flexible. All told, this is an odd alliance Trump has formed here. Palin s favorability rating among Republicans hovers at around 27 percent. Again, among Republicans. I m not sure how this helps Trump, other than to further purge any remaining support he enjoys among serious Republicans. I m not sure that standing side-by-side with this bitter clingin  proud clinger is a smart move. But it s absolutely the funniest thing that s happened to Trump s campaign since he did this.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyfUu_fNQfM&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Republicans Tried To Kill The Clean Water Rule, But Obama’s Veto Pen Said ‘Hell No’","On Tuesday, President Obama s Veto Pen  got some exercise when he dashed Republicans  hopes of gutting clean water rules   a curious mission, given the fact that Republicans in Michigan literally murdered 10 people and poisoned hundreds of kids with the state s disgusting water supply  water their Governor assured them was safe to drink.The resolution, introduced by hog-castrating waste of flesh Joni Ernst, had one goal: to block the EPA s enforcement of the Clean Water Rule and to prevent similar measures from being taken to protect our nation s water in the future. Fortunately, President Obama stepped up to kill the GOP s dream of unregulated waterways teeming with dangerous bacteria and other nasty stuff. In his veto message, the President explained:I am returning herewith without my approval S.J. Res. 22, a resolution that would nullify a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act. The rule, which is a product of extensive public involvement and years of work, is critical to our efforts to protect the Nation s waters and keep them clean; is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders; and is consistent with decisions of the United States Supreme Court.We must protect the waters that are vital for the health of our communities and the success of our businesses, agriculture, and energy development. As I have noted before, too many of our waters have been left vulnerable. Pollution from upstream sources ends up in the rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and coastal waters near which most Americans live and on which they depend for their drinking water, recreation, and economic development. Clarifying the scope of the Clean Water Act helps to protect these resources and safeguard public health. Because this resolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water, I cannot support it. I am therefore vetoing this resolution.Republicans attempted to use a rarely invoked law known as the Congressional Review Act to overturn the rule, but the President s veto ended all that, as they lack the votes to overturn the President s decision. Ernst says that she intends to find other ways to curtail the EPA s ability to regulate our waterways. We all want clean water,  Ernst said in a statement following the veto. This rule is not about clean water. Rather, it is about how much authority the federal government and unelected bureaucrats should have to regulate what is done on private land. This is exactly why we need to vote BLUE in November   do you think a Republican President would have protected America s water?Featured image via White House ",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Meghan McCain: Ted Cruz Is ‘The Thinking Man’s Trump’ Because Bible Stuff (VIDEO),"There are many, many things I would call Senator Ted Cruz, but  a thinking man  would never come to mind   but apparently, that s exactly how Meghan McCain.During a conversation on Tuesday s episode of  Outnumbered on Faux News, Weekly Standard columnist Stephen Hayes commented that he believes Cruz is winning his battle with Donald Trump because the frontrunner is not a true conservative. And Ted Cruz looks like he just waking up to that fact after having tightly embraced Donald Trump,  Hayes said.  I think that s the risk for Cruz even if I agree with him on his substantive critique of Trump. Host Andrea Tantaros wondered out loud if Cruz has made a mistake by not fighting harder against Senator John MCCain and seven other lawmakers  comprehensive immigration bill. Because, you know, the party of  family values  must never, ever support a bill that would keep families together.  After Tantaros  musings, Meghan McCain made her silly  thinking man  statement: That s red meat for conservatives in Iowa,  Meghan McCain agreed.  What I think is fascinating is Donald Trump was at Liberty University yesterday, Jerry Falwell s school, very religious school obviously. He quoted Corinthians wrong and now it s become this meme all over the Internet. Ted Cruz, in many ways, is the thinking man s Donald Trump,  she asserted.  He s a religious man that I think a lot of people especially in the hardcore evangelical parts of Iowa can digest as being much more religious. And I think that s going to play really well for Ted Cruz. What?First of all, being able to quote the Bible does NOT make him a  thinking man,  it makes him a parrot. Secondly, if Ted Cruz were a  religious man  his policies would be ones that help the poor, accept immigrants, promote peace   instead he believes in the exact opposite of all of those things.Meghan McCain used to make some sense when she spoke, but now it seems that the Fox stupidity has seeped into her brain and made her as ignorant as everyone else on that network.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Teens Get Creeped Out When Republican Lawmaker Asks If They Are Virgins During Statehouse Visit,"Can you imagine if Republicans interrogated every constituent about their sexual activity? Well, these kids don t have to imagine it, they experienced it.During a visit to the offices of several lawmakers on Teen Lobbying Day, a group of students chaperoned by Planned Parenthood employee Rachel Todd were absolutely stunned when Washington State Rep. Mary Dye interrogated them about whether or not they are virgins and began offering them unwanted marriage and sex advice.The teens were there to advocate in support of expanding insurance to cover birth control, but when they got there, Dye gave them an  unprompted  lecture instead about the choices she thinks teen girls should make. After she made the statement about virginity, all of my teens looked at me and I said,  You don t have to answer that. You don t have to answer that,  Todd told the Seattle Times.Soon after, Dye delivered a prepared apology: I shared with them that I did not support the issues they were advocating for. Following a conversation they initiated on birth control for teenagers, I talked about the empowerment of women and making good choices   opinions shaped by my mother and being a mother of three daughters. In hindsight, a few of the thoughts I shared, while well-intended, may have come across as more motherly than what they would expect from their state representative. If anything I said offended them or made them feel uncomfortable, I apologize. Todd, who is an education specialist with the women s health organization, said that she has never witnessed such inappropriateness during a meeting. I ve never been in any type of meeting, especially with teens where an adult, especially an adult legislator, was so incredibly disrespectful and inappropriate,  she said.One student in the group, Alex Rubino, thinks Dye was insane. It seemed kind of insane for her to say that, especially on the record, to constituents,  he said.Indeed, lawmakers should be acting like lawmakers instead of trying to parent other people s children. These teens came to talk to her about a serious issue and ended up being questioned about their sex lives and told what choices they should make.Considering Dye is an anti-birth control conservative, it s assumed that she preached about the virtues of abstinence-only as the only choice these teens should make when it comes to sex. However, it is increased access to and knowledge of birth control that is responsible for the dropping teen birth rate and abortion rate across the country.Perhaps Dye and other Republicans should stick to facts and reason next time they meet with constituents instead of prying into their private lives and giving out unwanted opinions.Featured Image: CSPAN",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Flint’s Mayor Knows Which Candidate Has Their Back, Makes GLOWING Endorsement","Governor Rick Snyder and his emergency management team have literally poisoned the water in Flint, Michigan. The city is literally in the middle of a public health emergency, and Snyder is being roundly criticized for his actions that could have permanent effects on the lives of the children living there who have been drinking and bathing in lead-poisoned water.Politicians and emergency workers around the nation have been gravely concerned about the situation in Flint, and many are doing what they can to bring an end to the water crisis and aid those poor residents affected by it. One such politician is Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She sent two of her best and most trusted campaign staff to the suffering city of Flint, to do whatever they could to help in this time of dire need. Clinton s proactive response has earned her the endorsement of Flint s mayor, Karen Weaver. The mayor said of Clinton s response to the crisis: If this was a test, she has really come to the forefront and passed it because we in Flint need some help and we need it now. The statement came during a conference call that was the work of Clinton s campaign. It seems as if the endorsement wasn t part of Weaver s planned press releases from the call, but, nonetheless it happened. She said, when asked if she was giving Clinton her endorsement: Yeah it does sound like it, doesn t it? I want Hillary. Weaver went on to mention that others had expressed outrage and concern over what was going on in Flint, but action was what got Hillary her endorsement. We do want some accountability. But as far as what Hillary Clinton has done, she has actually been the only candidate, whether we re talking about Democratic or Republican, to reach out and talk with us   We want a friend like Hillary in the White House. This is a very important endorsement from a mayor who has suddenly found herself thrust onto the national stage because of reckless decisions by a GOP governor who doesn t give a damn about the people he is supposed to serve.Whether it s Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, hopefully both would work to get Rick Snyder and those like him out of positions of power before they can ruin anymore lives.There have been at least three class action lawsuits filed on behalf of those living in Flint who are affected by the poisoned water. According to attorneys for the city of Flint s residents, the consequences for what Rick Snyder has done could be dire, and those responsible must be held accountable, and taken from their positions: Public officials must never again be permitted to give assurances to the public about public health conditions when they know the assurances are false. Public officials must never again be permitted to ruin the lives of our children by remaining silent in the face of a public health emergency. That is exactly right. Hillary and other Democrats, thank you for doing what you are doing. These people need your support so much right now. This isn t about politics, it s about people s lives.

He probably thought he had her support in the bag, but she took her endorsement elsewhere. After all, the reality television star loves screen time, and Donald Trump has definitely been getting the most out of anyone running from either party.Tuesday morning when the Palin s endorsement seemed imminent, Cruz s communication director Rick Tyler made a comment on CNN that may have really shown how Cruz was feeling at the moment. Tyler said of Palin endorsing Trump: I think it [would] be a blow to Sarah Palin, because Sarah Palin has been a champion for the conservative cause, and if she was going to endorse Donald Trump, sadly, she would be endorsing someone who s held progressive views all their life . Bristol Palin didn t take kindly to that at ALL.I like @TedCruz, but maybe THIS why people don t? https://t.co/1cCwjRYjMt @RealDonaldTrump @SarahPalinUSA  Bristol Palin (@BristolsBlog) January 19, 2016She wrote: After hearing what Cruz is now saying about my mom, in a negative knee-jerk reaction, makes me hope my mom does endorse Trump. Cruz s flip-flop, turning against my mom who s done nothing but support and help him when others sure didn t, shows he s a typical politician.  How rude to that he s setting up a false narrative about her!America doesn t need that.  We need someone who has a vision for economic prosperity, who won t let us get kicked around in the world, and who will fight for our future.I didn t go to Harvard Law School, but I know this:  You can like two people in a race, but there will only one president.The audacity to suggest that because she chooses one over the other will somehow  damage  her just shows arrogance. However, once the sad wore off a little bit and the shock of the break up wasn t so raw, Cruz took to Twitter to let Palin know that even though their romance is no longer, he ll still think of her fondly from better days.Cruz tweeted out sans heart emoji: I love Sarah Palin. Without her support, I wouldn t be in the Senate. Regardless of what she does in 2016, I will always be a big fan. I love @SarahPalinUSA Without her support, I wouldn't be in the Senate. Regardless of what she does in 2016, I will always be a big fan.  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 19, 2016It s got to be tough to see someone who you thought you could rely on run to another. Maybe Cruz s crazy wasn t enough for her. Maybe she needed the added splash of extra racism. Racism that Trump is all to eager to dish out at every rally. Who knows, really? All we can hope for is that Palin brings the same luck she brought for John McCain.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr/flickr)",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" These Americans Actually Believe Martin Luther King, Jr. Endorsed Trump (VIDEO)","Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. will always be remembered as one of the most revolutionary civil rights leaders and someone who made a tremendous impact on America and the movement to end legislated racism. On Monday, we honored King s life, which was taken far too soon.Despite King s fame and place in history, not everyone knows as much about him as they should   as late night host Jimmy Kimmel discovered when he interviewed people on Hollywood s Walk of Fame. For his show Jimmy Kimmel Live on Hollywood Boulevard, Kimmel had a camera crew interview pedestrians and see what they thought of King (falsely) endorsing Republican front runner Donald Trump. The results are seriously too depressing to actually be funny.Out of the several people interviewed, many were completely unaware that King had been assassinated in 1968   therefore preventing him from making any type of endorsement to the GOP candidate. Unsurprisingly, those very same people were oblivious to what King actually stood for, and were also unaware that Trump had made tons of racist comments that King would have never stood behind. These people had seemingly been living under a rock for the past several months, and probably didn t even know that Trump has been endorsed by King s opposites   modern-day white supremacists.One woman seriously said, I figure if he s going to endorse Donald Trump for president, then maybe he thinks he will be a good president.  And that wasn t even the worst response. You can watch the frightening interviews below:It is mind-boggling how ignorant many people in America still are   and it isn t much of a stretch to say that anyone who believes someone like Martin Luther King, Jr. would endorse such an imbecile is probably going to end up voting for him.If King were alive to hear these responses, it would certainly be a nightmare for him. Especially since this has basically been Trump s response to people who aren t white like him:Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Track Palin Faces Assault And Weapons Charges After Domestic Violence Report,"It s no secret that the Palin family are fans of drunken hijinks after a well-publicized drunken birthday brawl in 2014. Shortly after it became news that Sarah can see a Donald Trump presidency from her house, more news surfaced   something regarding one of her children. No, it has nothing to do with Bristol for once. According to Gawker, Track Palin, who reportedly broke his ribs during the aforementioned drunken brawl, faces weapons and assault charges after he drunkenly interfered with a report of domestic violence.According to online records, Track was charged on Sunday with assault, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.It is unclear who was filing the domestic violence report when the armed and drunk Palin got violent with an unnamed female, but we can be certain more details will surface. For now, Wasilla police said in a statement: An investigation revealed Track Palin had committed a domestic violence assault on a female, interfered with her ability to report a crime of domestic violence, and possessed a firearm while intoxicated. Palin s ex-wife, Britta Hanson, says she was not involved in the incident. The unidentified victim was found with  bruising and swelling around her left eye  and complained of pain in her right knee.At one point, Track was   holding onto a gun, yelling  do you think I m a p y?  and  do you think I won t do it?  apparently threatening to kill himself. [The woman] was concerned he would shoot himself and ran outside and around the house,  according to reports. She ultimately hid under a bed.On Tuesday, Sarah Palin announced that she is endorsing Donald Trump for President.  I am greatly honored to receive Sarah s endorsement,  Trump said in a statement following Palin s decision to endorse him.  She is a friend, and a high-quality person whom I have great respect for. I am proud to have her support.  Fortunately for Palin, Trump likely won t care about something like a little domestic violence, given his own track record.Palin was held without bail until his arraignment on Tuesday, police say.It s so nice to see  family values  people show exactly who they really are. Unfortunately, this will do nothing to change how conservatives feel about the Palins, their opinions, or even about those who eagerly gobble up their endorsements. They believe in Jesus, after all, and that s enough to convince most conservatives to look past quite literally anything.Featured image via People ",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Colbert’s Fear And White Privilege Confession To DeRay MeKesson Is Absolutely Perfect (VIDEO),"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert had a very special guest on to celebrate MLK Day   Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson. Nothing could be more appropriate, and the two sat down and talked about something about 70% of white people refuse to talk about: Race.The conversation began with Colbert s telling McKesson of the reaction to his wearing a  Black Lives Matter  bracelet on the air. He says that with the way his white counterparts acted,  you would have thought I d slapped a baby. McKesson s frank response was, of course, spot-on: I think that people are uncomfortable talking about the racist history of this country and what we need to do to undo the impact of racism. People would just like to act like we don t have a legacy of racism here. I think people get really uncomfortable with it, but we know that we can t change it unless we address it, right? He went on to remind Colbert and the audience what most of us have known all along: that the  All Lives Matter  crowd just want to distract from speaking about the real issues surrounding race. If  All Lives Matter  was true, we wouldn t have to be out in the streets. The police have killed 26 people just in 2016. Indeed. McKesson then addressed the  blue code of silence,  which everyone is aware of. Cops don t squeal on cops   even if it means covering up murder. Across the country it has been so similar, we know that it s not just isolated events. It is actually a systemic problem. He also reminded everyone of the responsibility that comes with the power of policing, especially the power to kill: That means they have a different responsibility and accountability that is not present right now. So true. They have a responsibility to serve first, and be rational, rather than militant and trigger happy.McKesson was them asked about Dr. King: People misremember King today. They remember, like, the safe King   they don t remember, like, the radical revolutionary King. He talked about redistribution of wealth and economic justice   he was more aggressive than the dream that people remember. McKesson, who rose to fame through Twitter, then pointed out how social media is important to today s activist, though, at the root of it all,, nothing has really changed: The issues are the same. We didn t invent resistance, we didn t discover injustice, but technology has allowed us to amplify these issues in ways that we couldn t before and has accelerated the pace of organizing in ways that are really powerful. After speaking about the Democratic candidates and his experiences with them, the conversation turned to the issue that is at the root of all of this: White privilege. Unfortunately, that is something most white people will never want to speak about. However, Colbert is definitely not afraid, and he asked McKesson how to understand his own privileges from being white. McKesson responded: It s about role, and it s about access   and what you can do is extend that privilege so that you can dismantle it, right? You can create opportunity for people, you can amplify issues in ways that other people can t and you can use your resources to create space for people. Colbert then made the ultimate confession, which is that privilege also comes with fear. I can t speak for other white people, (but) I feel guilty for anyone who does not have the things I have. That includes black people or anyone, because I am so blessed   I think there s always a fear that it will be taken from me. And that is the very essence of why so many white people fear the breaking down of the system of white supremacy. They fear that their wealth and societal position will be taken if black people get so much as a crumb of the pie, much less a slice. But, they should fear not, for giving other people rights is not their oppression.Such a basic concept that so few understand.Watch the absolutely perfect video below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chris Christie Is REALLY Mad Michelle Obama Is Forcing Fruits And Veggies Down Kids Throats,"Republican presidential candidate Gov. Chris Christie is mad. He is so mad, in fact, at Michelle Obama for wanting kids to eat healthy, that he has just openly come out against her initiative for healthier children. Sound crazy? Because it is.Never mind the fact that it was only a few short years ago when Christie lauded the First Lady on her healthy eating agenda when he said: I think it s a really good goal to encourage kids to eat better. You know, I ve  I ve struggled with my weight for thirty years and it s a struggle. And if a kid can avoid that in his adult years or her adult years, more power to them. And I think the first lady is speaking out well. I mean, I don t want the government deciding what you can and what you can t eat. I still think that s your choice. But I think Mrs. Obama being out there encouraging people in a positive way to eat well and to exercise and to be healthy, I don t have a problem with that. Now he s trying to run for president and knows that the people he needs nationally to vote for him don t want some commie agenda of healthy eating. After all, Eve ate the forbidden apple, but there is NOTHING in the Bible against eating Twinkies for dinner.While campaigning in Iowa on Monday, Christie told a young child in the crowd that he ll be able to eat whatever he wants if Christie were to be elected. He told the kid: The First Lady has no business being involved in this. Using the government to mandate her point of view on what people should be eating every day is none of her business, it just isn t. I want people to eat healthier. I ve been trying to eat more healthy. We all should be trying to do that. It makes us better, makes us living longer, better quality of life, all the rest of it. But in the end, it s your choice. I don t care what you re eating for lunch every day. I really don t. I want you to eat whatever your mother wants you to eat and your father want you to eat. And if your parents want you to eat gum drops and Mountain Dew as a balanced meal, go for it. Who cares if kids get sick from malnutrition or get diabetes and raise health costs nationwide? At the end of the day, fruits and vegetables are yucky, and if you don t want your kid eating yucky food, vote for Chris Christie! (please note the sarcastic tone before angry commenting)Let s get to the point here, folks. First Lady Michelle Obama and her push of healthy eating isn t a forced agenda, it s a suggestion. Her Let s Move campaign is also just a suggestion. Just like former First Lady Laura Bush promoted reading, and Nancy Reagan was a against drug use, it s not a communist plot to take over the minds of our youth. It s to suggest and promote positive actions in the lives of children. That s all. Calm down. And Christie, really? This pandering is just outright pathetic.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Supporter ADMITS To Being Racist After Black Reporter Confronts Him (VIDEO),"We all know that the only reason Donald Trump is so popular among the Republican base is because he is because of his racist rhetoric. His Trump Hate  is very appealing to the vile voters the GOP panders to, and every single time he says something bombastic his poll numbers go up. However, if you ask one of these Trump supporters if they are racist they ll assure you that they are not   most of the time.Steve Bowman of Omaha is a different kind of Trump supporter, because when he was confronted with a truth bomb, he actually admitted that he was wrong.WOWT reporter John Chapman, an African-American, approached Bowman and asked him if  he thinks a sign in his front window that said, Ni***r Obama  was racist. Bowman responded: Well, I grew up in the 60s. I remember racial riots. I know Martin Luther King. I m 57 so I grew up in the late 50s early 60s and I know what it s like the water guns the racial riots and Birmingham. You know the south, I know all about it. I have a master s degree in history It might be a little racist. A little? No, it s A LOT racist and apparently it s not the first time. According to his neighbors, an African-American family, he often puts up racially charged signs: He s been putting up stuff like that constantly. Constantly putting up stuff like that and I ll bring it up to him gently, you know,  take that down please you know this is not the neighborhood for that  neighbor Regina Wright told WOWT.  He understands and he will take it down after I mention it to him, but then he ll put something else up. Bowman took the sign down after the reported confronted him, but whether or not he puts one up again is anybody s guess. What s really ridiculous is that he tried to use the Civil Rights Movement as some kind of explanation for his sign. It was almost as if he was saying, I lived through that, so I can t possibly be a racist  If anything, the fact that he remembers the horrific treatment of the African-American community should be even more of a reason not to have something like that in his window.But as we know by now, common sense and inclusiveness do not grow in Trump supporters  gardens.Watch:  Featured image via video screenshot",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ISIS Terrorists Forced To Screw Over Their Own As Obama’s Game Plan Tears Them To Pieces,"During the State of the Union Address, President Obama made the remark that our enemies aren t getting stronger. If you listened carefully, you could hear the grunts and groans from the Republican side of the aisle, where doom and gloom aren t just political talking points, they re a way of life.The President, briefed daily on the status of the Islamic State, knows better than anyone exactly where the enemy stands, yet Republicans still try to sell fear of a domestic attack by people half a world away like it s as certain as the sunrise. As it turns out, even Fox News is better informed than the people it stumps for, reporting Monday that ISIS announced it had to cut salaries for its terrorists by half:In a sign the Islamic State terror group could be pressed for cash, a new report claims its leaders slashed the salaries of all its fighters in half.The  Treasury Ministry  of ISIS blamed  exceptional circumstances, The Jerusalem Post reported.They also reported that the pay cuts were announced well before a massive money stash in Mosul, Iraq was announced, meaning not only were Obama s tactics working, he managed to follow-up with a crushing blow to the treasury as well.ISIS says regardless of the pay cuts, fighters are still responsible for their taxes. The lunatics have decided to not only twist the Koran into something that allows for indiscriminate killing and world domination, but as a way to keep more of the money they owe the jihadists they ve brainwashed.It s clear that the president was right to call out the political hot air of the Republicans in his most-watched SOTU speech to date, as the rhetoric they spread defocuses the country from domestic issues in desperate need of more attention. Fox, while reporting the truth in this case for some reason, felt it necessary to include an older video with the article about how strong ISIS has gotten and how impressive their weapons are:Screen capture from Foxnews.comIt doesn t matter what the propagandists at Fox News, the Republican party or even ISIS have to say about what s going on in Syria. The fact is, the JV team the president spoke of was underrated at first, but are now showing their inexperience and lack of playing time. On top of being shunned by the majority of the Muslim world, they re being pushed back geographically and decimated financially.That doesn t matter to the right.

 ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Threatens To Shoot Two Men In Bizarre Fight Over Roadkill,"The Clampetts are at it again! As usual, the  responsible  gun owning population can t make it a single day without shooting or threatening to shoot someone over something nonsensical. On Saturday, one brave patriot decided that two men waiting to harvest the meat from an animal someone hit along a Montana highway were getting just a bit too greedy   so he proposed a Second Amendment Solution to the problem.An elk had been hit by a car earlier in the day, and two men stopped to wait for it to die so they could grab it, take it home, and salvage the meat from its corpse. Sure, eating roadkill is something one would not expect to create an issue in 2016   but a third man apparently got a bit jealous over the bounty of road splatter.As the men waited, somehow unwilling to put the elk out of its misery, 52-year-old Kenrick Workman drove to the scene where the two men were eagerly awaiting an opportunity to have themselves some roadkill. After arguing with the gentlemen who were patiently awaiting dinner, Workman pushed one of the men and retrieved a handgun from his car. He then threatened to shoot them.The men called police, who arrested Workman on existing warrants for a DUI, resisting arrest, and assault with a firearm.The NRA regularly assures us that gun owners are exactly the people who will save us from oblivion. While they draw a distinction between  good guys  and  bad guys with guns,  the problem is that in the eyes of the NRA everyone is a  good guy with a gun  until they commit a crime. In other words, everyone should be trusted with a weapon until it is too late   even someone who would rush out of his home to threaten people in a bizarre argument over who gets to eat the animal someone left on the side of the road.It is unclear if anyone got to eat the elk.Featured image via ",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Won’t Believe What Rubio Said About The Flint Michigan Water Contamination Crisis (VIDEO),"We all know the GOP is out of touch with the public, but when there s a major crisis unfolding in the United States, one would expect even the Republicans, especially presidential candidates, to keep up to date with what s happening. Not so with Marco Rubio. When asked about the lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, Marco Rubio said that he has not  been focusing  on it.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi77s6CjZRE]The contamination has left tens of thousands of residents without drinking water and the lead in the water may have caused irreversible damage to many more who have been drinking it. Yet, Senator Rubio did not feel that it was important to read up on the issue. Rubio said: I d love to give you a better answer on it. It s just not an issue we ve been quite frankly fully briefed or apprised of in terms of the role the governor has played and the state has played in Michigan on these sorts of issues. Rubio continued, saying that he s unable to give: A deeply detailed answer on what the right approach should be, other than to tell you that in general I believe the federal government s role in some of these things [is] largely limited unless it involves a federal jurisdictional issue. Whether he thinks the federal government s role is limited doesn t mean he shouldn t pay attention to a crisis affecting tens of thousands of Americans and especially when Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) asked the Obama Administration to declare a state of emergency and send millions of dollars to help alleviate the situation.It s not just Rubio who s been both silent and ignorant on the issue. Other Republicans haven t commented on or mentioned the tragedy at all. However, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have condemned the negligence that led to the crisis, not only framing it as a health problem, but one that is a racial justice issue. Clinton said: I think every single American should be outraged. We had a city in the United States of America where the population, which is poor in many ways, and majority-African American, has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care. He had requests for help that he basically stonewalled. I ll tell you what: if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would have been action. Gov. Snyder, who s a Republican just like Rubio, is facing a class action lawsuit from Flint residents.Sen. Bernie Sanders  added that he thinks Gov. Snyder should resign:  There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint s water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign. Officials fear that some children in Flint who drank and bathed in the water may have brain damage and other long term health problems. Yet, Rubio and the Republicans don t see the importance of addressing and taking the initiative on an unflolding tragedy in an American city.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Seth Meyers: GOP ‘Sh*t All Over’ President Obama’s Successful Iran Prisoner Swap (VIDEO),"President Obama has been working for months to bring home four American prisoners held in Iran. It finally paid off with a deal that saw Iran and the United States exchange prisoners. The president showed that diplomacy instead of war is the right course of action to take.However, that wasn t good for the Republicans who started complaining as soon a  the president announced the deal. It s typical of Republicans to play the partisan card even when what happens is good for the country. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, Meyers said: Of course, a good day for Obama only lasts seven minutes before Republicans shit all over it. Which they did, because Republicans were outraged Obama traded seven Iranian prisoners to get the Americans back. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utJKElxYHPY]Donald Trump was apparently upset that the US gave up seven prisoners while Iran gave up just four. Yet, clips show that Trump called it a bad deal yet also took credit for it. Meyers summed it up well. Imitating Trump s accent, Meyers said: It s a terrible deal we should be ashamed of   and not to brag, it was my idea and you should thank me for it. Trump also denied that he ever said the prisoners would never be released even though the video shows that he did.  Another contradiction from America s favorite contra-dickhead,  Meyers said.It s typical fashion for Republicans to go after the president even when the results are good for the country.",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Photo Woman Posted Of Unsuspecting Target Cashier Goes Viral (IMAGES),"A Target employee in Indiana has just gone viral for showing the utmost care, patience and kindness to a customer who was struggling to pay for her items.Ishmael Gilbert was an employee at the Glendale, Indiana Target store and had only been a part of the store s team for a short time when the 19-year-old had to ring up an elderly woman. Gilbert had no idea that what happened next would make him an internet star.When it came time to pay for her items, the woman revealed she d be using coins to pay. Gilbert didn t hesitate to help the woman add up her change and remained patient, even as some customers huffed off to find a shorter line. Gilbert said: She was all worked up because the line was getting longer and she was moving so slow. She was shaking. Behind the elderly woman was 35-year-old Sarah Owen Bigler, who was watching Gilbert s encounter with his elderly customer. Bigler was originally annoyed that her trip to Target was now going to be longer than planned, but she decided to stay when her young daughter took an interest in what Gilbert was doing. When Bigler s daughter asked Gilbert about the change he was counting, Bigler knew the wait would be worth it. She said: Part of me, the part that had a long day at work, the part of me who had a 1 1/2 year old having a melt down in the cart, the part that had set an unnecessary timeline for Target and getting home, was frustrated with this woman and the inconvenience she had placed on me.BUT then I watched the young employee with this woman. I watched him help her count her change, ever so tenderly taking it from her shaking hands. I listened to him repeatedly saying  yes, mam  to her. When she asked if she had enough to buy a reusable bag, he told her she did and went two lines over to get one for her and then repackaged her items. Never once did this employee huff, gruff or roll his eyes. He was nothing but patient and kind.As I was watching him, I saw that Eloise was too. She was standing next to the woman, watching the employee count the change. I realized I hadn t been inconvenienced at all. That my daughter was instead witnessing kindness and patience and being taught this valuable lesson by a complete stranger; furthermore, I realized that I too needed a refresher on this lesson. Bigler was so blown away by what she witnessed that she took a photo and posted it on her Facebook page, where it quickly went viral. The post has now gained over 25,000 shares.// < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Yesterday Matt was sick.

He said: I was asleep at home and everyone was texting me,  check Facebook, check Facebook.' When he finally realized that his moment with the elderly woman had gone viral, he was stunned. I never thought it d blow up this big. Her post, I guessed it touched a lot of people.  On Friday, Bigler and her daughter came back to the Glensdale Target to meet with the media and see Gilbert again. Gilbert said: It just feels good to be recognized for good work. But this isn t something new. I treat all customers the same, the way I want to be treated. And it turns out, Gilbert s lesson on patience and kindness to Bigler s daughter wasn t lost on him. Gilbert has a daughter of his own, who just turned one. It felt like a daddy-and-daughter moment a little. She asked,  what s that? I said that s a penny.  It felt good because that s the kind of example I want to be for my daughter. Since his overnight fame, Gilbert has been offered money and other job offers, although he plans to stay where he is for now. Glendale Target Store Team Leader Todd Davis has said that Gilbert s actions will have a positive impact on his career at the store. Davis said: Very rarely you get the opportunity to talk about something that s a positive impact in the community. You never know who s watching.

 Rachel Maddow CRUSHES The GOP Fantasy That Reagan Was Stronger On Iran Than Obama (VIDEO),"Republicans have revived an old and overused piece of right-wing trash in an effort to try to invalidate the unmitigated success of President Obama s recent diplomatic victories with Iran.The myth that they have dug back out of their closet is that Ronald Reagan freed American diplomats and citizens held hostage in Iran, simply by becoming president. Republicans like to infer that Reagan was some kind of ultra-tough Republican cowboy, and this caused Iran to be petrified with fear causing them to surrender the hostages the moment Reagan was sworn into office. As Rachel so eloquently explains, nothing could be further from the truth.Watch Rachel completely destroy the Republican effort to try to deny Obama the legacy he earned below:If you want to look at who operated from a position of power in the negotiations, you need to look no further than the soft-spoken Jimmy Carter. He froze $11 billion in Iranian assets after they seized the hostages. Iran was engaged in a war with Iraq at the time. Suddenly the Iranian s had second thoughts. $11 billion in 1980 dollars was huge and they needed this for the war effort. The unfreezing of assets, plus an American pledge to not meddle in internal Iranian affairs and an agreement to work together to resolve post-revolution financial claims, were the only things we had to give them. To sum it up, Jimmy got virtually everything and Iran got nothing except being left alone.The ONLY aspect that Ronald Reagan played in the freedom of the Iranian hostages was coincidental at best. If Iran had not released them when they did, they risked Reagan nullifying the agreement, and in turn, they would lose everything that was already on the bargaining table. You could replace Reagan with literally any other person that existed on Earth at the time, and you would have gotten the same result. He did NOTHING except occupy space. It stands in a stark contrast to Reagan s true legacy on Iran. Remember the one where he illegally sold weapons to Iran in order to try to get them to facilitate the freeing of American hostages from Lebanon and using the proceeds of the sale to fund an illegal war in Central America?

 Hilarious: Trevor Noah Has More Fun Than One Guy Should With Last Week’s Debates (VIDEO),"Another huge crowd of Americans tuned in last week as the Republicans held their latest fear-fest, also known as a debate. Refusing to acknowledge that so many people have been tuning in to watch them make fools of themselves and to see what Donald Trump will say next, the GOP field of freaks took the opportunity to once again go at each other s throats for at least half of the debate while invoking fear and bashing Hillary Clinton for the other half.On the flip side, the Democratic debate   held at 9PM on a Sunday night after a long day of playoff football   drew a tenth of the audience but had a thousand times the substance. As the GOP remains focused on having Americans clutch their guns while watching out the front window for ISIS to come knocking on their doors, the Democrats were firmly planted in the world of domestic policy, discussing things that the next president will have the pleasure of dealing with here at home.Both debates had desirable outcomes. The Republicans continued making fools of themselves, alienating more independent voters in the process, in two and a half hours of Clinton bashing, fear-mongering nonsense while the Democrats finally got to see the candidates bear their teeth while Martin O malley interrupted every so often to spread his vision of a world where tree-hugging liberals will stand next to Ammon Bundy for the betterment of humanity.No matter who you support, there was plenty of material from both debates to go around. As comedians and late-night show hosts get back to work, there will be plenty of laughs to be had. Trevor Noah and the team at Comedy Central s Daily Show were the first to hit an absolute home-run with a hilarious segment that includes brutal jabs at the GOP combined with some hilarious Democratic moments as well.Trevor Noah may be having trouble with ratings and people may still not be over the loss of Jon Stewart from their Daily Show fix, but he continues to show why he was Stewart s choice to move his beloved show forward.

 Racist Cop Suspended After Telling People To Run Over ‘Idiot’ Black Folks (SCREENSHOTS/VIDEO),"A police sergeant in St. Paul, Minnesota is enjoying a paid vacation has been placed on leave after a concerned citizen brought some of his more unsavory actions to the attention of Internal Affairs   specifically, suggesting that people run down Black Lives Matter protesters with their cars because, he says, they will get away with it.Andrew Henderson, a co-administrator of Minnesota Cop Block, first noticed Sgt. Jeffrey M. Rotheker posting under the name JM Roth on the cop watcher group s Facebook page. In fact, he explained while making his report to Internal Affairs, Rotheker was a regular dissenter. But one remark on an article about Black Lives Matter protesters stopping traffic went too far, prompting Henderson to take action. Run them over. Keep traffic flowing and don t slow down for any of these idiots who try and block the street,  Rotheker advised his fellow Facebookers. He explained that they should  continue to drive and if you hit someone make sure you call 911 to report the accident and meet the cops a block or two away.  Rotheker says that the stop farther away can be justified because  you feared for your safety since in the past people in this group has shown [sic] a propensity towards violence. Since they are trying to block the street and/or cross where there is no crossing you should not be charged with anything,  he added, explaining that even if  these idiots  attempted to sue you in civil court,  remember that it will be jury trial and so most likely it will come out in your favor. Henderson provided evidence to Internal Affairs that  JM Roth  is actually Rotheker. You know, a police officer shouldn t be advising people to run over other people for just standing in the road. That s not reasonable to me,  Henderson tells Internal Affairs investigators in a recording he made of the encounter.  I don t know if that s reasonable to you.   It wouldn t be reasonable to, I would think any person, any decent person, Sgt. John Wuorinen replies. Police Chief Thomas Smith says that the allegations are  of grave concern  given the then-upcoming Martin Luther King Day protest. In a statement the police department announced an investigation is underway and   swift, strong and decisive disciplinary action will be taken  if it is proven that Rotheker made the comments. The statement (posted) is offensive, disappointing, concerning and does not reflect in any way   or align with   the views, values and practices of the St. Paul Police Department,  the statement reads.Unfortunately, Rotheker s suggestion is uncomfortably close to reality. In 2014, a St. Paul man struck a 16-year-old protester in Minneapolis who was speaking out about Michael Brown s murder, breaking the teen girl s leg. He paid a $575 fine and was ordered to complete a traffic education course. No jail time was served. Jeffrey Patrick Rice claimed that he was attempting to  flee a mob  that  damaged his car.  After plowing through a crowd of people and injuring the girl, Rice attempted to flee the scene but was stopped by police about a mile away.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJiRoRtdiSg&w=560&h=315]St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman issued a statement Monday indicating that he is   outraged and disgusted by the post and (I) have directed the SPPD to investigate.

 Racists Spew Hate All Over Facebook After Black People Hold Anti-Violence #BikesUpGunsDown Rally (VIDEO),"When the Black Lives Matter movement started gaining nationwide attention, racists across America were outraged. How dare the African-American community speak out against the institutionalized racism in this country! One of the most common statements from the hate-filled folks was, Oh sure, they complain about  white on black  crime, but ignore  black on black  crime!  And that sentiment is what makes the following story so ironic.On Monday, a group of predominantly black bikers held a rally called  Bikes Up, Guns Down. Hundreds of young men took to the streets on their ATV s and dirt bikes to promote peace in their communities. Rapper Project Stacks, who is involved in the movement, explained what it was all about in an interview with the Miami New Times in April:Bikes Up, Guns Down is strictly to stop the youth violence. Violence ain t cool. We re saying,  Let s stick together.  We already deep in population. Back then, when it was violence, it was probably one person droppin  every three months or every six months. Now you got two or three dropping every weekend. Or two, three, or four dead bodies every weekend So it s kind of different, and it done raise the stakes. But I know they like to ride them bikes. Give  em something to do. I ma buy as many bikes as I can, man.However, when dozens of riders took to the streets on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the white supremacists went wild on Facebook. Fox 13 Tampa Bay posted a video of the riders on the streets, some of them were driving like idiots, but for the most part is was just a bunch of bike riders   but the white folks were very displeased with this.         That s right, calling out his vile stereotypes makes YOU the racist.The sad thing about this entire incident was the completely predictable way that the racists responded. The people who participated in the rally were branded  thugs  even when they were trying to do something positive for their community. Yet, the same totally inclusive white people have nothing to say when hundreds of caucasian bikers hold rallies and disrupt traffic. Hell, they didn t even say anything when a bunch of bikers got into a gun fight outside of a restaurant.As a person who is so white I can guide the way in a dark tunnel, I am truly disgusted by the way my community continues to treat other people. It s not that difficult to be a good human being, I promise.If you are one of those people who still believes that we live in a  post-racial  America, all you have to do is log on to the internet to be proven wrong.Watch:Featured image video screenshot",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Perfect Match? Evidence Leans Towards Sarah Palin Endorsing Donald Trump At Iowa Event (IMAGE),"Donald Trump set tongues wagging with a tweet on Monday promising a special guest scheduled to appear with him at campaign event in Iowa on Tuesday, January 19. His campaign announced: He ll be making a major announcement & bringing a special guest. Now, after some sleuthing by some conservatives online, it appears that the guest may be none other than failed Republican presidential candidate and half-term governor Sarah Palin.Eagle-eyed campaign watchers found a flight on a private jet that left Anchorage International Airport, and five hours later touched down at Des Moines International Airport.Since her campaign flameout, Palin has kept her brand alive at the center of conservative politics. She has been a featured speaker at the CPAC conference and regularly has pumped out books targeted at conservative readers. A pay-per-view video venture of hers was less successful and recently shuttered. Palin recently put her gated Arizona mansion up for sale.Palin may be accused by some conservatives of being disloyal to Trump rival Ted Cruz, who she endorsed and campaigned for in the past.But Palin has also been a booster of Donald Trump. Last November she said his nomination was a strong possibility. I think it s a very real possibility because people are really tired of professional politicians who, you know, won t call it like they see it and maybe don t have life experiences that allow them to prove a track record of success,  the former vice presidential nominee said in a radio interview with WBT Charlotte s News Talk radio on Thursday. That s refreshing about Trump,  she said.  He s a fighter. We know he s gonna put America first, and he really nailed it early on what the main problems are in America right now, so it s a very real possibility. In 2011 when there was speculation Palin might challenge President Obama in 2012, she took her bus tour to New York City and had a weird pizza date with Trump and his wife, Melania.While mostly a laughingstock to the public at large, Republican base voters remain enamored with Palin, and may view an endorsement by her of the reality TV star as a signal to select him as their candidate as the Iowa caucus waits only a couple of weeks away.Featured image via YouTube ",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Obama Mic Drop’ Is The State Of The Union Music Video You Have To See,"A new parody video from the Gregory Brothers shows a rendition of the 2016 State of the Union we all wish could be real. In autotune, President Obama sings about his accomplishments in  Obama Mic Drop. https://www.facebook.com/gregorybrothers/videos/vb.46060559283/10153884847629284/?type=2&theaterIn the song, President Obama notes that we ve had the strongest job growth since 1999, as Joe Biden and even Speaker Paul Ryan are forced to get out of their chairs and join along with the President s dance crew.The video then cuts to the audience and we see some Congressional figures not often known for their support of the President also get into the head-bobbing action, including Senator Lindsey Graham   fresh off of dropping out of the 2016 presidential race   and Senator Marco Rubio.Democratic Minority Leader and Senator John Kerry also get into the act as well, and everyone eventually gets on their feet for a standing ovation for the President s last hurrah.As the Gregory Brothers Facebook page notes,  A lot of emotion from President Obama for his final SOTU. Really can t believe he brought a dance team. So far the video has been viewed over 3 million times on YouTube and Facebook and the song is now being sold on iTunes as a single.The Gregory Brothers are Michael Gregory (drums and vocals), Andrew Rose Gregory (guitar and vocals), Evan Gregory (keys and vocals), and Sarah Fullen Gregory (bass and vocals). The group is probably best known for their series of videos parodying current events called  Auto-Tune the News. Their most well-known video was the music video  Bed Intruder  featuring Antoine Dodson, in which an interview he did with a local news station was auto-tuned and set to music (the chorus was  Hide your kids, hide your wife ). It was the most popular YouTube video of 2010 and currently has over 130 million views. The single based on that video sold over 1 million copies and was certified platinum by the RIAA.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Muslims Respond To Republican Mess By Bringing 30,000 Bottles Of Clean Water To Flint Residents","Muslims care more about the people of Flint, Michigan than Republicans do.The Republican-caused disaster unfolding in Michigan is incredibly infuriating. In a penny-pinching scheme, Governor Rick Snyder and his emergency management henchmen decided to switch Flint s water supply from Lake Huron to the nearby river, which has been undrinkable for decades due to high levels of lead and other industrial chemicals.For well over a year, the residents have been forced to drink and bathe in this water all while Republicans insist that the water is perfectly safe.So far, Republicans have done very little to fix their mess. Instead, they been busy trying to absolve themselves of any responsibility, which is why President Obama stepped in to do their job for them. And now, Muslims are coming to the rescue as well. Who is Hussain?  is an organization honoring the memory of Imam Hussain ibn Ali, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad who was killed by extremists by speaking out against violence. He died by being denied water over the course of several days. The organization believes that denying water to any human being is unacceptable and bringing water to those who need it is part of their campaign.And the organization has already collected 30,000 bottles of fresh drinking water for the Red Cross to distribute to the residents of Flint, even though Republicans and conservatives across the state and the nation have demonized Muslims repeatedly. Despite the hatred and racism hurled against them, they have chosen to help anyway. Prophet Mohammad taught us  Your neighbor comes before your own household.  As a resident of Detroit this is not only a Flint problem this is a Michigan problem and I feel obligated to help to the best of my ability,  said Mohammed Almawla, who helped collect water for Flint. We saw what needed to be done and we decided to do it,  said event organizer Dr. Aziza Asakari.  We reached out to schools, neighbors, friends, mosques, anyone and everyone to help us by donating a case of water, or money towards a case. This inspiring story is the very definition of American values. A group of people coming together for the purposes of helping a community in need. No one would blame these Muslims for turning their backs on their fellow citizens for the way they have been treated recently, but they chose to come to their aid despite the discrimination they have faced by the right-wing in recent months.Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. They poisoned the citizens of Flint, Michigan and have failed to take responsibility. Governor Rick Snyder should have resigned by now but he refuses to do so. Now Muslims are working to provide clean water to the residents in an act of humanity that proves once and for all that conservatives are full of shit whenever they talk about Muslims. Muslims are helping the American citizens that Republicans willingly chose to harm. It s pretty easy to recognize that it is Republicans, and not Muslims, who are the real threat to our safety and security.Featured Image: Washington Times ",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Meet The AWESOME Couple Who Is Going To Heckle The Bundy Militia Until They Leave,"For more than two weeks now, the nation has watched in frustration as a band of wannabe  patriots  who are nothing more than domestic terrorists have continuously disrupted the lives of the good people of Harney County, Oregon with their armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. Well, it seems that these fools may have met their match.Kieran Suckling, who is the Executive Director of the Center for Biological Diversity, says that there is a couple who is challenging the armed idiots in their own way, and it is nothing short of glorious. According the the Center s Facebook: Each night, these two tent camp in the rain and snow. Each morning, they wake up, warm up, and go down the road to protest the Bundy militia s daily press conference. They won t leave until the militants do, they say. They are here, they say, because our laws and public land deserve the dignity and protection of people standing up peacefully yet forcefully against those who would steal them at gunpoint. I love these people. We offered them a warm room at our hotel, but they declined, saying that the land needed people who love it to be present at all times. What this unidentified couple is doing is nothing short of heroic. It is certainly more than the authorities are doing. These fools have been disrupting lives, terrorizing the locals, destroying property and committing any number of felonies unchecked for way too long as it is. Kudos to these REAL patriots for standing up to them.Suckling said that on Monday, there was to be a celebration of the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, and expressed his thoughts on what Dr. King would think of this occupation, and how he would react: Dr. King understood nature deeply, teaching us  It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied into a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one destiny, affects all indirectly. But we ll also peacefully confront the Bundy militia at the buildings and land they have taken from us all by armed force. We believe that is what Martin Luther King, Jr. would do. We must bear witness to this great injustice and show the militia thugs that America won t be scared away from its public lands by guns and threats. So right. It really is great that people are finally standing up to the these militants, with or without the help of law enforcement.That couple deserves a medal for what they are doing.Featured image via Raw Story",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Rand Paul’s Horrendous New Anti-Ted Cruz Cartoon Titled ‘Audit The Ted’ (VIDEO),"You know how we can tell Rand Paul s campaign for president is out of money and out of hope?He produced a  cartoon  that attacks his former ally in the Senate, Ted Cruz, which features ugly, simplistic animation and voices performed by a cheap online vocal processor, Xtranormal style.The  cartoon  shows two stick figures, a man and a woman, standing in a the middle of nowhere discussing how Ted Cruz borrowed money from Goldman Sachs, while also accepting huge donations from the financial sector and special interests to pay for his campaign for U.S. Senate.The title of the video?  Audit the Ted.  Get it? The characters suggest we should engage in a process similar to the conspiracy theory meme about auditing the Federal Reserve.Here s a typical exchange:MALE STICK FIGURE:  Does the Goldman Sachs want to audit the Fed? FEMALE STICK FIGURE:  I don t think so. They are the Fed. Huh?The male stick figure goes on to pitch Rand Pand, saying in his inexplicably British-sounding robot voice,  He is for individual liberty, the free market and auditing the Fed. Yes, Rand Paul is for  individual liberty    except for a woman s individual liberty to have a safe and legal abortion, or to acquire inexpensive birth control through Obamacare, which Rand Paul wants to repeal.The female stick figure, whose stick figure lady parts aren t included in Rand Paul s definition of  individual liberty,  replies,  Yes, I like this Rand Paul. And his hair. Maybe he should audit the Ted as well. Now we know for sure it s a robot voice. No living human being would say they liked Rand Paul s ridiculous wig.The cartoon is part of an  Audit the Ted  website being launched by the Rand Paul campaign, targeting Ted Cruz s failure to vote on an audit-the-Fed bill proposed just before the president s final State of the Union address. The whole thing is a huge pander to the Alex Jones wing of the GOP.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdxyDPl9Wl0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Guess What UK Political Leaders Really Think About Donald Trump – Hint: He isn’t ‘Ace’ (VIDEO),"The British Parliament conducted what can only be described as a  national celebrity roast  when they took up the petition signed by more than 500k Britons, requesting that their government ban Donald Trump from entering the country based on the fact he  foments racial, religious, and nationalistic intolerance, which should not be welcome in the UK. The 3-hour debate was done more out of respect for the process of public petitions, and due to the huge number of signatures, rather than because they were legitimately serious about banning him. However, it did give Parliament time with which to vent their frustrations and engage in some brilliant Trump bashing, which is something we can all thoroughly appreciate.Watch one of the compilations of what the UK really thinks of Trump below:If ONLY the Republican Party felt that way Even some Tory Party members (which are like the British version of Republicans, except that they are not insane) have come out against his comments, although not as strongly as Labour and Scottish National Party members had done.Some took a more serious stance on the idea of Trump not being permitted in the UK, by implying that allowing his presence would embolden the nationalistic and Islamophobic groups that already exist in the nation.Watch more footage of further discussion below:Ultimately, Trump will not end up being denied entry to the UK because there will not be a vote held at the end of the debate which would be required to enact a legitimate ban. However, members of Parliament felt that the 500k+ British citizens who signed the petition, deserved both an answer to it, plus a strong statement by their government against the sort of hate that Trump peddles daily.featured image via fox news screen capture",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" THANKS, OBAMA: Gas Prices Have Plummeted To 47 Cents A Gallon In Michigan","Michiganders in Flint may be literally dying thanks to the GOP s horrific cost-saving measures, but people in nearby  Houghton Lake got to enjoy the lowest gas prices in more than a  decade on Sunday. Prices at two businesses dropped below a half-dollar per gallon, while another nearby station was pumping out fuel for less than a dollar a gallon. There have been long lines at the stations for most of the weekend, according to the three stations, with police officers directing traffic in the area due to the congestion,  CNBC reports. Prices at a Marathon station hit 46 cents per gallon, while the Beacon & Bridge gas station was as low as 47 cents. The third station dropped its prices to 95 cents a gallon.These drops were the result of a price war between the three stations, but thanks to the President s hard work with the Iran deal, fuel prices are reaching record lows. The Huffington Post reports that oil prices dipped down past a 2003 low of $28 per barrel on Monday as Iran prepares to flood the market after the lifting of sanctions over the weekend:Worries about Iran s return to an already oversupplied oil market drove down Brent crude LCOc1 to $27.67 a barrel early on Monday, its lowest since 2003. The benchmark was down 12 cents at $28.82 by 1537 GMT.U.S. crude CLc1 was down 27 cents at $29.15 a barrel, not far from a 2003 low of $28.36 hit earlier in the session. Iran s return to the oil market has been on the agenda for some time and therefore does not really come as any great surprise,  Commerzbank senior analyst Carsten Fritsch said of the situation. Nonetheless, prices were bound to react negatively in the short term in view of the negative market sentiment. It is expected that Iran will increase oil on the market by an extra 500,000 barrels per day in the short term, but Tehran says it will add 1 million barrels per day to its current output by the end of the year.While some, particularly investors in the oil market, may cringe at this new reality in the oil market, average Americans will enjoy not having to mortgage their homes to drive to work. Normally, it would be uncouth to blame a President for high gas prices (or credit one with low prices) but Republicans have repeatedly reminded us that President Barack Hussein Soetoro Obama, socialist dictator, owns the Iran deal.Watch a report on these historic prices below:Featured image via ABC/Fox News",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 How Wounded Warrior Project Treated A Triple-Amputee Marine And His Family Should Enrage Us All,"This just goes to show that you should always do your research before donating to a charity.Despite being a charity that supposedly provides support to wounded military veterans and their families, the Wounded Warrior Project(WWP) failed one family so badly that it should anger every American who claims to support our troops.Courtney Leigh Schumacher was preparing to deliver her second child when her husband was severely injured. Jon Schumacher lost both of his legs and required major medical care at Bethesda Medical Center in Maryland. The only problem was the family was stationed in California and Courtney needs to figure out how to fly across the country and make sure her husband, her baby, and herself had everything they needed for the long recovery ahead.So she reached out to the Wounded Warrior Project seeking travel assistance, baby items, and other needs to get through the hardship. Wounded Warrior Project denied her requests. In fact, the only thing they managed to send her was a box full of merchandise including hats and stickers instead of what she and her family actually needed. Needless to say, Courtney Schumacher was angry, so she posted her story on social media.Dear Wounded Warrior Project,Please stop sending us merchandise.We do not want the hats, stickers, magnets, clothing and backpacks you send us throughout the year. I don t understand how you have the funds for these items, yet you can t help the countless Veterans who need it. You can show us your programs and have a few Veterans testify for you, but it means nothing. I m not a person who read a negative article about you and is now deciding to speak out. I am a caregiver who approached you in my time of need and I was told no.I was 3 weeks away from delivering our second son when my husband was injured. I flew from California to Bethesda to be by his side. I asked for baby items and assistance with travel for our immediate family so I could recover. I was told no. These were two of my dozen of requests that were all denied. I asked then what can help us with and you said  whatever you need.  Merchandise was the only thing we have ever received from you.Luckily, Courtney and her family found support from a charity that actually went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure they had everything they needed.Fortunately for us, an organization did support us and fulfilled our needs. They gave us a swing and a pack n play for my husbands hospital room so I could continue his care. They flew our family out in time for the birth and flew out our oldest son, who was 4, across the country to spend Christmas with us. This organization was the Semper Fi Fund.As for Wounded Warrior Project, Courtney refused to waste any more time supporting the organization.I will be sending an email today to be removed from your mailing list. I hate to see anymore of your donor s funds wasted. Sincerly, the caregiver of a triple amputee. @wwp @semperfifund  # wwpgear   # woundedwarriorproject   # semperfifund Here s an image of the post via NewsFoxes:Now, there is no denying that Wounded Warrior Project has helped many veterans. But what happened to this family is totally unacceptable, especially when you read an account of what Courtney went through in Bethesda for months, which she wrote after her original post went viral.We were stationed in 29 palms, Ca and made under $1900 a month for a family of three. When my husband was injured, I was flown to Bethesda, MD. I decided to leave our four year old son in California with my parents. I was expecting a swift return to San Diego and I didn t want him to see his dad in that condition. I had a automatic payment set up for my parents back home so all his needs were met.There was no savings for our needs in Bethesda. I was never looking for a handout or a check from WWP. I just wanted help.I had nothing to lay my newborn baby in while in the hospital room. I slept on a chair and my husband had MRSA. I asked for a bassinet, I was told no. I asked for someone to take my debit card to Target and buy me one. I was told no. I didn t have a vehicle or a car seat. I was desperate. I flew to Bethesda in October and stayed through January. I didn t own any warm clothing. I walked to and from the hospital through snow in flip flops until my family bought me boots during their visit. I never asked for things for myself.We couldn t afford plane tickets across country during the holidays. I was due to deliver our second son on December 17th. I knew we needed family bedside to continue my husbands care while I delivered our son. We were told no. Luckily, Semper Fi Fund flew our family out for two weeks. It made our hospital room Christmas morning much more pleasant. I had a hard time getting my husband dressed everyday for therapy. He was still connected to wound vacs in his legs and tubes throughout his body. We asked if there was a way to get some snap athletic clothing, we were told no. Luckily  Sew much comfort  provided Jon with velcro clothing. There were more requests I made and I was told no. I asked what do you do and they said whatever you need.Indeed, despite that declaration by Wounded Warrior Project, Courtney still only received a two-letter word that made it clear that her family wasn t going to receive help from that particular organization, and she ripped them a new one for it.If you only provide specific services, then make that information available. If you outsource most of your Veterans to other non profits, yet sue them for stepping on your toes, then state that.If you cant help my family then state that instead of keeping us hooked with false hope. I see organizations like Homes for our Troops who can put a Veterans family in a mortgage free handicap accessible forever home with a tiny portion of what WWP makes a month and it upsets me. All I ask, if you know of a specific need of a Veteran that you want to see happen, then donate to that specific organization.Here s an image of the family Wounded Warrior Project refused to help.Wounded Warrior Project may have began as a worthy cause that helped a lot of people, but it has since become a questionable charity that is struggling to make the grade.According to Non-Profit Quarterly, WWP received a  D  rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy, C+ by Charity Watch, and  three out of four stars  from Charity Navigator. In short, it s a mixed score that doesn t exactly inspire confidence.In addition, Wounded Warrior Project brought in $342 million in 2014, and only 55 percent of that goes to actually helping veterans in need while the other 45 percent is used for administrative expenses, $473,015 of which is the salary paid to CEO Steven Narduzzi. One has to wonder how it feels to get rich off the backs of veterans.In contrast, the Semper Fi Fund that Courtney and her family received help from has a spectacular rating. It has a four star rating from Charity Navigator, an A+ rating from Charity Watch. And unlike WWP, only 6 percent of the funds donated to Semper Fi Fund are used for overhead.This really shows which charity organization has their priorities straight. So, perhaps it s time for all of us to do research before we donate to an organization, especially when that organization claims to support wounded veterans and their families. If we really believe our troops and their families deserve the best, shouldn t they also deserve the best charitable organizations as well?Featured Image: News Foxes",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Repeated His Truly Horrible JFK Impression And Got The Quote Wrong. Again! (VIDEO),"For the second time in the last ten days, slimy and loathsome Ted Cruz totally botched another painful impression of the late President Kennedy.You might recall how Cruz first performed a painfully awkward rendition of the  Miracle Max  scene from the beloved film The Princess Bride, thus nearly ruining the film for all time. There s something wrong in the universe when someone as repugnant as Cruz likes such a fantastic movie to the point where he can recite entire passages in the voices of the characters. The voices were, of course, terrible and he got many of the lines wrong, which once again verified that most conservatives shouldn t bother trying to be funny. They re never funny, even when the source material is stellar.Then, earlier this month, Cruz entertained a small crowd of Iowa yokels with a flop-sweat inducing JFK impression, just after suggesting Kennedy would be driven out of the modern Democratic Party for being too conservative. Regarding the latter, no. First, Kennedy was arguably more liberal than most Democratic leaders of 2016. Second, there are moderate and conservative Democrats who continue to be welcome in the party, including presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.It s also worth noting that Cruz fumbled the quote. The line he attributed to JFK was actually said by Robert Kennedy years after JFK was assassinated. RFK s line, which was cribbed from George Bernard Shaw, by the way, went:  Some people see things as they are and say why. I dream things that never were and say why not?  And this is the line Cruz used for his John Kennedy impression.He did it again on Monday.Cruz s verbatim line: During the 1960s, I will point out that one of the most powerful, eloquent defenders of tax cuts was John F. Kennedy. As JFK said,  Some men see things as they are and ask, Why? I see things that never were and ask, why not?  These are the principles that work. Once again, it was RFK who popularized the line. Not JFK. And no one noticed.Cruz also said that JFK was a champion of tax cuts. This, believe it or not, is mostly true. Kennedy proposed fairly deep cuts to the marginal tax rates at a time when the top bracket was nearly three times higher than it is today.But that wouldn t have forced him out of today s Democratic Party. How do we know this? President Obama is responsible for the biggest middle class tax cut in American history. That s no exaggeration. The infamous  stimulus  bill, which almost entirely helped to keep the economy from sliding into a Depression, included $282 billion in tax cuts. As a point of comparison, President Bush s tax cuts amounted to roughly $174 billion. Obama s tax cut was also larger than Reagan s cuts.So, Mr. Cruz continues to lie to his people, assuming they re too ignorant to know the difference between JFK and RFK, or the difference between Obama and Kennedy on tax cuts.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rurnz8HuBE&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Scholastic Yanks Children’s Book For Its Portrayal Of Happy Slaves (IMAGE),"On Sunday, publishing company Scholastic announced that it would be removing A Birthday Cake for George Washington from shelves over criticism that the book portrayed happy slaves.In a press release, Scholastic explained that the book needed to include more context on the  evils of slavery  and that all returns would be honored. The statement read: While we have great respect for the integrity and scholarship of the author, illustrator and editor, we believe that, without more historical background on the evils of slavery than this book for younger children can provide, the book may give a false impression of the reality of the lives of slaves and therefore should be withdrawn. We do not believe this title meets the standards of appropriate presentation of information to younger children, despite the positive intentions and beliefs of the author, editor, and illustrator. The book, which was released on January 5th, happens to be about an enslaved man and his daughter faced with the task of baking President George Washington a birthday cake. Here s the cover:Scholastic s description of the story reads: Oh, how George Washington loves his cake! And, oh, how he depends on Hercules, his head chef, to make it for him. Hercules, a slave, takes great pride in baking the president s cake. But this year there is one problem   they are out of sugar. Scholastic s reaction is a complete turnaround from its previous defense of the book, which claimed the topic of slavery had been approached with the  utmost care.  Scholastic also previously claimed the book depicted the slaves being happy because they were living in  near-freedom  and simply enjoyed cooking. Scholastic even allowed the book s author, Ramin Ganeshram, to explain the intention behind the book on the publisher s blog last week as public outcry increased. Graneshram insisted that his story was based on historical research and was meant as a compliment to the slaves  resiliency and resourcefulness. Graneshram wrote: How could they smile? How could they be anything but unrelentingly miserable?  Ganeshram wrote.  How could they be proud to bake a cake for George Washington? The answers to those questions are complex because human nature is complex. Bizarrely and yes, disturbingly, there were some enslaved people who had a better quality of life than others and  close  relationships with those who enslaved them. But they were smart enough to use those  advantages  to improve their lives. Even before Scholastic made its decision to pull it, the book had over 100 one-star reviews on Amazon. At the time the announcement was made, only 12 of those reviews were positive.School Library Journal called the book  highly problematic,  advising people not to buy it. Kirkus Reviews, another trade publication, said the book was  an incomplete, even dishonest treatment of slavery.

 Spike Lee Celebrates MLK Day By Announcing Boycott Of ‘Lily White’ Oscars (IMAGE/VIDEO),"The film industry wants us to believe that it is liberal, that there is no racism. However, nothing could be further from the truth, and the fact that for the second year in a row all of the Oscar-nominated actors are white. Yes, you read that right. Even with iconic films such as Selma out there, the Academy didn t see fit to nominate any actors of color.Well, this obvious bias didn t go unnoticed by powerful and successful actors of color, most notably Spike Lee. To that end, on the annual celebration of the Martin Luther King, Jr holiday, the celebrated actor took to Instagram to tell the world that he would not be attending this year s Oscars, and why. Using the hashtag #OscarssoWhite, Lee said, in part, after acknowledging and thanking Cheryl Boone Issacs, President of the Academy, for giving him an honorary Oscar this past November:But, How Is It Possible For The 2nd Consecutive Year All 20 Contenders Under The Actor Category Are White? And Let s Not Even Get Into The Other Branches. 40 White Actors In 2 Years And No Flava At All. We Can t Act?! WTF!! It s No Coincidence I m Writing This As We Celebrate The 30th Anniversary Of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr s Birthday. Dr. King Said  There Comes A Time When One Must Take A Position That Is Neither Safe, Nor Politic, Nor Popular But He Must Take It Because Conscience Tells Him It s Right .Here is the post, in full:#OscarsSoWhite  Again. I Would Like To Thank President Cheryl Boone Isaacs And The Board Of Governors Of The Academy Of Motion Pictures Arts And Sciences For Awarding Me an Honorary Oscar This Past November. I Am Most Appreciative. However My Wife, Mrs. Tonya Lewis Lee And I Will Not Be Attending The Oscar Ceremony This Coming February. We Cannot Support It And Mean No Disrespect To My Friends, Host Chris Rock and Producer Reggie Hudlin, President Isaacs And The Academy. But, How Is It Possible For The 2nd Consecutive Year All 20 Contenders Under The Actor Category Are White? And Let s Not Even Get Into The Other Branches. 40 White Actors In 2 Years And No Flava At All. We Can t Act?! WTF!! It s No Coincidence I m Writing This As We Celebrate The 30th Anniversary Of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr s Birthday. Dr. King Said  There Comes A Time When One Must Take A Position That Is Neither Safe, Nor Politic, Nor Popular But He Must Take It Because Conscience Tells Him It s Right . For Too Many Years When The Oscars Nominations Are Revealed, My Office Phone Rings Off The Hook With The Media Asking Me My Opinion About The Lack Of African-Americans And This Year Was No Different. For Once, (Maybe) I Would Like The Media To Ask All The White Nominees And Studio Heads How They Feel About Another All White Ballot. If Someone Has Addressed This And I Missed It Then I Stand Mistaken. As I See It, The Academy Awards Is Not Where The  Real  Battle Is. It s In The Executive Office Of The Hollywood Studios And TV And Cable Networks. This Is Where The Gate Keepers Decide What Gets Made And What Gets Jettisoned To  Turnaround  Or Scrap Heap. This Is What s Important. The Gate Keepers. Those With  The Green Light  Vote. As The Great Actor Leslie Odom Jr. Sings And Dances In The Game Changing Broadway Musical HAMILTON,  I WANNA BE IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS . People, The Truth Is We Ain t In Those Rooms And Until Minorities Are, The Oscar Nominees Will Remain Lilly White. (Cont d)A photo posted by Spike Lee (@officialspikelee) on Jan 18, 2016 at 5:03am PSTSpike Lee is right, and he isn t the only actor who is upset about these gross and racially motivated injustices when it comes to recognition for achievements. Lee is just the latest person of color who also happens to be a member of the Hollywood elite to criticize the all-white Oscar ballots. Jada Pinkett Smith has made similar comments. She said of the entire situation: The Academy has the right to acknowledge whomever they choose, to invite whomever they choose, and now I think that it s our responsibility to make the change. Maybe it is time that we pull back our resources and we put them back into our communities, into our programs, and we make programs for ourselves that acknowledge us in ways that we see fit, that are just as good as the so-called mainstream ones. Begging for acknowledgement or even asking for it diminishes dignity, diminishes power. And we are a dignified people and we are powerful, and let s not forget it. In addition, Pinkett Smith made her views on the matter known on Facebook via a powerful video, also uploaded just in time for MLK Day, just like Spike Lee s Instagram post:  // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;We must stand in our power!We must stand in our power.Posted by Jada Pinkett Smith on Monday, January 18, 2016 They are both right. We have to realize that we are the ones who are going to have to create change. It won t be White America, and it sure as hell won t be Hollywood. It will be Black Americans with voices, especially those in positions of power and influence, who will stand up and say what needs to be said, and do what needs to be done. If it takes boycotting what is arguably the biggest film industry event of the year, then so be it.Thank you, Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith for telling it like it is.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Desperate MI Governor Tries Claiming Flint Poisoning Was ‘Natural Disaster’, Obama Slaps Him Down","Michigan Governor Rick Snyder is still desperately clinging to his job, but there are signs that his fingers are slipping.For weeks, the country has been learning with growing horror the depths to which Snyder s administration sank to save a few bucks. A startling picture has finally come into focus: Rather than listen to scientists and residents, Michigan s state government decided to simply ignore all signs that the water system in the city of Flint was beginning to corrode away. As a result, dangerous chemicals including lead had begun pouring into the drinking water. The fix to prevent a mass poisoning of residents from their tap water would have cost barely anything, but they gambled it all   and Flint lost.As early as October 2014, there were problematic signs. A local General Motors engine plant stopped using water from the Flint river because parts were becoming rusted, but officials nevertheless continued to reassure residents the water was safe to drink   a decision deemed  unconscionable  by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton this week.Tests also revealed elevated levels of chemical compounds in the water supply that can lead to liver or kidney issues. Nonetheless, officials downplayed residents  concerns, saying   confidently   that the water was safe to drink.How bad was the lead poisoning in Flint s water? Ten people have died from drinking it. Doctors now warn that every child in Flint under the age of six   over 8,000 of them   must now be treated for lead poisoning. The long-term effects to their health and mental development won t be known for some time.It s gotten so bad that President Obama was forced to declare a federal emergency in Flint. National Guard troops have begun pouring into the state to help get water to people who can t trust their faucets not to kill them. Celebrities such as Cher and Michael Moore have flown in tens of thousands of bottles of water.Through it all, Michigan s Republican governor has spent almost all of his energy trying to spin this epic disaster as not his fault. Absolutely nobody is buying it.In a bold move, Hillary Clinton even used her time during the Democratic debate to put a spotlight on Flint and the failures of Snyder s administration. I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what s happening in Flint, Michigan, and I think every single American should be outraged. We ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care. Snyder responded to this forceful condemnation of his pathetic actions by giving a more pathetic response.Political statements and finger pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the Flint water crisis.  Governor Rick Snyder (@onetoughnerd) January 18, 2016How convenient that the man that every finger is pointing to now believes finger pointing isn t important.Another person not buying Snyder s buck passing? President Obama. Snyder recently demanded the federal government give him $96 million in  natural disaster  aid money to help him pay for the fall out of his negligence. Obama, who has already pooled resources to help Flint residents out, said  No way. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator W. Craig Fugate, in a letter to Snyder, said his request for a major disaster declaration was denied because the water contamination  does not meet the legal definition of a  major disaster  under federal law. The incident was not the result of a natural catastrophe, nor was it created by a fire, flood or explosion,  Fugate said.This wasn t a hurricane or a tornado or a wildfire, this was a Republican Party that was so interested in turning a profit that they gambled with the lives of their constituents. Calling this a natural disaster would be one of the biggest political lies ever told.It should also be noted that while Snyder would like nearly 100 million dollars from the federal government   hypocritical coming from a small government conservative, no?   his state just posted a $575 million surplus. Flint s lawmakers have asked that some of that money be used to help out the city. So far Snyder hasn t offered it. As we ve seen time and again, a Republican governor wants nothing to do with the government until he needs its help to clean up one of his screw ups. President Obama and federal agencies routinely serve as punching bags for Republican politicians who pretend that government equals tyranny. Now, with a man-made disaster unfolding on his hands, Snyder is mad that this very same  tyrannical  government won t do more to help save him from himself.If Snyder wants help he should take responsibility and confess that it was his actions that brought on this water crisis. He can clarify that this wasn t a  natural disaster  in his resignation letter.Featured image via Michigan Municipal League/Flickr",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Amy Schumer Rightfully Blasts Young Critic Who Snagged Photo Just To Bash Her (TWEET),"If there s one person that you don t want to mess with, it s Amy Schumer. She s a badass who will call you the f**k out no matter who you are. So, when one young critic decided he would bash the comedian in a tweet, needless to say, Schumer had the last word. In fact, the original tweet looks to have been deleted.However, the internet being what it is, the evidence remains.The young film critic took a photo with Schumer on the red carpet of the Critics Choice Awards. However, instead of just being proud of that moment, because getting a photo with Schumer is an honor in and of itself, he decides to try to be funny on Twitter and tweets out: Spent the night with Amy Schumer. Certainly not the first guy to write that. Seeing this, and obviously not amused, Schumer tweeted back: I get it. Cause I m a whore? Glad I took a photo with you. Hi to your dad. When misogyny starts young  pic.twitter.com/1pTNVdXILv  Emma Gray (@emmaladyrose) January 18, 2016The young critic has since apologized because of the backlash that was thrown at him from all directions I truly apologize for the tweet I posted earlier. I'm not a comedian and it wasn't funny. @amyschumer  LightsCameraJackson (@LCJReviews) January 18, 2016  but the greater point still remains that this young man thought he was being funny by bashing a woman. This sort of humor is never thrown at men, and it is blatantly misogynistic. And to expand of Schumer s remark of  Hi to your dad,  she is likely implying  nice job raising a new generation of jerks. This sort of humor from, mainly men, who think they re being funny going after women isn t anything new. It s an age-old story that harkens back to the Bible when Eve was blamed for being tempted. Men have always gotten a free pass when it comes to sexual promiscuity, and women are always shunned or made fun of for daring to show they are human beings too. So while, sure, this kid apologized for his stupid joke, because he was likely forced to by to the power of social media, he still thought it was okay to say in the first place.Let s stop shaming women. Let s stop teaching young men that it s okay to shame women. Then this sort of thing will never happen in the first place, and there will be no need to apologize.Featured image: Twitter",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Greg Abbott Picks Supporting Israel Over Obama – Plans With Bibi To Antagonize Iran,"Governor Greg Abbott of Texas recently traveled to Israel to kiss the ring of Bibi Netanyahu. While there, he pledged that he will do what he can as Texas  leader to obey Israel s desires and begin working on new ways to re-antagonize Iran.Abbott, like most Republicans, owes his true loyalty to Netanyahu s craving for discord instead of America s effort at peace and cooperation. Abbott pledged to craft laws in Texas to curb the flow of any public funds to Iran. He seeks to accomplish this by banning any state-level investments in Iran or by banning Texas government from doing business with any company that does business in Iran. The second part of that is particularly hypocritical. Republicans have always used terms like  free trade  and the concept of little to no government regulation of business to attack liberals. However, when  free trade  conflicts with the desires of Benjamin Netanyahu   a leader of a foreign nation   there suddenly isn t enough regulation that can be enacted.When asked for an example of how many Texan public dollars flow to Iran, Governor Abbott s office was unable to provide any figures. Without some real data, the impact of Abbott s new laws will be unproven at best, and he would likely have to spend more state money to audit companies to make that determination. Fiscal conservatism at its best Governor Abbott will obviously not be able to single-handedly bring Iran to its knees over new state-level  sanctions,  but the politics on this are clear. Republicans still want to do everything they can to sabotage what is otherwise an incredibly successful and historic win for President Obama on his diplomatic victory with Iran. Being able to show their undying loyalty to a foreign leader in the process is just a nice bonus.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Messes Up BIG TIME At Liberty University When He Majorly Flubs Bible Verse (VIDEO),"If there s one quality Republican voters are looking for in a candidate, it s being a Christian. You don t have to know much about foreign policy, or domestic issues, or for that matter, the Constitution, but if you say you re a Christian, well, that s your golden ticket into the hearts of GOP voters everywhere. Knowing this fact, for the past several months Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has been telling people far and wide about how much he s a Christian, how much he loves the Bible, and even that it s his  favorite book. Unfortunately for Trump, his blatant maneuvering to try to convince people that he s a great Christian who follows the Bible is all crumbling down. This was incredibly evident at a campaign event at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Monday morning.In front of a large crowd of people who actually do know their Bible verses, Trump says: We re going to protect Christianity. I can say that. I don t have to be politically correct Two Corinthians, 3:17, that s the whole ballgame. He then goes on to call Liberty University  Liberty College  and it s clear that he s reading something someone prepared for him to say. Because anyone who s ever gone to church at one point or another in their lives knows that the book of the Bible Trump is referring to is Second Corinthians, not  Two Corinthians.  However, if you re reading it off a piece of paper and you re just trying to pander to your crowd, but don t really know what you re talking about, it s going to read  Two Corinthians. The verse he s referring to is  Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom,  which does indeed sound like the perfect Republican slogan to try to pander to  freedom  loving  Christians  everywhere. However, too bad Trump doesn t actually know what he s talking about.And as fellow candidate Marco Rubio s faith outreach director said, so honestly:""Two"" Corinthians    It won't matter. Nothing seems to matter.

 Tea Party Official Banned From Schools After A Statement That Will Make Your Skin Crawl,"Liberals have been questioning the intelligence of Tea Partiers since the movement arrived on the national political scene complete with misspelled signs and idiotic conspiracy theories. Their leaders include such great minds as Michele Bachman and Ted Cruz, two people with impressive educational backgrounds who can t seem to stop saying incredibly dimwitted things.That mentality trickles down to the state and municipal level as well, as members of the crowds of tea bag wearing  patriots  decided to go home to seek public office and crusade for a return to 1789. Never has that been more obvious than in the case of Hampstead, NH Advisory Budget Committee Chairman, Jorge Mesa-Tejada.The school board in Hampstead was seeking approval for upgrades to the local elementary school, using the security of the students as one of their reasons. Looking to eliminate the use of remote classrooms outside of the main building, the board cited that the traveling back and forth of students may provide an opportunity for a sniper to shoot children.While that may seem a little bit extreme, it is nothing compared to the chairman s argument against the upgrades. In an open committee hearing broadcast on local cable access television, Mesa-Tejada outlined exactly how he would use his military training to wipe out children, killing them at recess from the woods behind them.  I would have a field day,  he said.Reaction from the school board was swift. Mesa-Tejada has had a no trespassing order issued against him, banning him from being anywhere near school property. Not only did he outline what could only be the delusions of a very sick mind, he also gave other lunatics the perfect plan of attack to pull off the next Newtown.The chairman has since apologized, but it s too little too late for the school board and the residents of Hampstead.  When I saw the recording, I had two first reactions,  said Caitlin Parnell, a mother of two children at the school.  One was disbelief that an elected official would be talking this way, and my second reaction was to feel sick to my stomach. You can watch Mesa-Tejada s despicable comments below:Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Creationist Ken Ham Is Building A $101M Noah’s Ark In Kentucky, And He Wants You To Pay For It (VIDEO/TWEETS)","Australian-born Creationist Ken Ham and his fundamentalist Christian organization Answers in Genesis (AiG) are looking to build a $101m Ark Adventure in Kentucky, with the centerpiece of a reconstructed Ark. The problem is, they want you the taxpayer to pay for it.Ham, AiG and their so-called Young Earth Creationist movement believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible when it comes to the age and creation of the Earth and all life that ever inhabited it. They believe the Earth and all life was created in 6 days, by an omnipotent God, just 6,000 years ago. They believe dinosaurs and man inhabited the planet at the same time, because everything that is was created in those same 6 days. So yes, there will be a pair of dinosaurs on the ark.According to Newsweek, AiG purchased a 99-acre plot of land just outside Williamstown, Kentucky got the city for just a dollar five years ago. But since then, the project has hit one hurdle after another. Many of Ham s own making.The principal issue at stake now, is that Ham and AiG want the taxpayer to pick up the bill for around a quarter of the construction costs of the project in the form of tax rebates. The group sought to exploit subsidies provided by the state to boost tourism through the Tourism Development Incentive program. Projects of $1 million and upwards can recover 25% of project development costs by recouping their sales taxes.After much debate on their initial application, Kentucky approved the site for the scheme so long as AiG agreed to non-discriminatory hiring practices. This means, they could only recover the cash if they recruited people of all faiths and none. They could not specifically hire Creationists.A few bumps down the road later, and Ham and AiG had to significantly strip back their pans for the park. They were unable to gather together the funds and investment to create the full theme park. Due to the substantial changes to the plans, they had to resubmit their application to Kentucky for the tax rebate. This time is was denied. Why? Because apparently, honesty and integrity mean nothing to this group of creationists.Despite their reluctant agreements to get their hands on state cash, AiG had released a decidedly discriminatory recruitment policy for the Ark Adventure. The website demanded a salvation testimony  and a creationist statement of faith from all prospective job applicants   clearly ruling out non-believers.So now, Ken Ham and AiG are suing Kentucky for the money   claiming religious discrimination. Greg Lipper, senior litigation counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State points out the muddled-thinking that AiG is applying in this case. AiG is confusing what they have the right to do as a private organization with what taxpayers are required to fund, They re saying Kentucky taxpayers should pay for them to expand a religious ministry. That kind of argument would make Thomas Jefferson turn in his grave. No one is telling Ham as a private citizen, who or how he can hire. It is only as a recipient of state funds, which he is free to enter or not, that he is required to follow the stipulations that would be applied to any organization or individual doing the same. Just like chances of his theory of genesis being true, Ham s chances of getting his lawsuit through are slim to none.And his Ark hasn t escaped the attention of social media users either I just realised that America's immigration policy doesn't weed out Australian Ark Building Lunatics. #kenham  Gotapulse (@gotapulse) January 3, 2016If #KenHam could get a 500 yr old dude & his kids to build the Ark themselves w/o modern technology I would give the park more credit.  Uncle John (@azmoderate) January 18, 2016If Ken Ham wants to replicate the trials and tribulations of biblical Noah, then he should probably cease seeking to exploit tax loopholes to make up for his lack of fundraising skills. Religious freedom requires that if a man wants to spend $101 million of his own money to build a giant ark in Kentucky   he is free to do so. However, he has no right under religious freedom to expect you and I to pay for him to do so.Featured Image via YouTube Screengrab",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ann Coulter Slips Up During Interview And Gives Us The Greatest Reason Ever NOT To Vote Trump (AUDIO),"Ann Coulter will be wishing she had the chance for a second take after a bizarre interview, during which she accidentally gave Americans the greatest ever reason not to elect Donald Trump: it will be the end of her career, and the Republican Party.Coulter became near-hysterical during an interview with the The Eric Metaxas Show last week. According to her, Trump is basically the second coming of Christ. He is an emissary, sent by God, to save the United States of America (and humanity) from destruction. And no, this is not satire, or an embellishment.First, she compared herself to Jesus. Asked about her reputation for being rather a  divisive  figure on the right of US politics, Coulter replied: Yeah, I m  divisive  because I say things I believe, generally. So does Jesus. But her delusions of grandure also extend to her favorite candidate, Donald Trump. We are talking about the future of not only of America but of the last genuinely Christian country on earth and thus the world. If we lose America, it is lights out for the entire world for a thousand years.It is like the fall of Rome but, thank God, and I am not using the Lord s name in vain, I mean that absolutely literally, thank God for raising up Donald Trump and giving us a chance to save the country.Unless Donald Trump is elected, we re never going to have another Republican president. So firstly, in the gospel according to Ann Coulter, it is prophesied that the failure of Donald Trump to win the GOP primaries would mean no Republican in the White House ever again. As good a reason as any for kicking the trust fund tycoon out of the race. But every cake needs a cherry on top, and this came in the form of Coulter s reaction when asked what she would do if Trump loses.She vows she would  stop wasting my time with politics.  That s right America, political commentary would be Coulter-less, permanently. Ann sees no point continuing her quest without the bright star of Trump to follow. What is the point of talking about abortion or anything else unless you get Donald Trump in to build the wall, deport illegals, end this  anchor baby  nonsense, stop importing 100,000 Muslims a year, in addition to two million Third Worlders per year, It s probably time to spread the word far and wide. After all, opportunities to kill three birds with one stone don t come along very often. America without Trump, Ann Coulter, or a Republican in the White House. Now, that really would be great.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons/Flick Creative Commons",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Oregon Militant Flips Over His Vehicle, Breaks More Laws – Guess What The Cops Do (IMAGE)","A man affiliated with the illegal occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in the Oregon standoff with police was out and about driving around town in his white 2003 Ford van, when he ended up crashing his vehicle into a barb-wire fence, completely flipping the car over in the process.We re not sure if he was out looking for snacks, but The Oregon State Police posted a picture of the crash on their Twitter page on Sunday. Now, get this   not only was he being an unsafe driver on icy roads (propelling the car more than 150 ft. away from the road), but he was also driving without a license! Fortunately, he wasn t injured (we wouldn t wish that on anyone) but safety issues aside, all the police did was cite him for operating a motor vehicle without a license. That s it. He wasn t arrested, as many would presume.State Police Spokesman Bill Fugate wouldn t provide more details about the incident, other than to say: Oregon only cites for No Operator s License, we do not arrest. Pic via Twitter.It looks like the police aren t too concerned with Mr. Burke s activities of occupying federal property. Perhaps one reason is that he wasn t driving a federal van from the property; it appears to be his own.Just a few days ago, another militant by the name of Kenneth Medenback left the compound for a  snack run.  State police decided to arrest him for theft of two government vehicles, not the occupation itself. And, that was the very first arrest of the occupation so far. At this rate it s going to take forever to arrest all these guys. So, while law enforcement doesn t appear to be taking an active stance of ending the illegal protest itself, they are still somewhat concerned with upholding some of the laws on the books. That s some good news, at least.Featured image via Twitter.",News,"January 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Reveals His Full Health Care Funding Plan: The 1% Are Going To Hate It,"Just hours before the final Democratic primary debate, Bernie Sanders has finally released his full healthcare plan.On his campaign site, Sanders lays out how important the Affordable Care Act has been. He notes that he, himself, helped contribute to the huge piece of legislation that helped to provide 17 million people with health insurance.But Sanders believes that it is time to move forward with a national healthcare system that provides coverage to all. He writes on his site: All Americans can benefit from increased protections against lifetime coverage limits and exclusion from coverage because of pre-existing conditions, Sanders says. But as we move forward, we must build upon the success of the ACA to achieve the goal of universal health care. Twenty-nine million Americans today still do not have health insurance and millions more are underinsured and cannot afford the high copayments and deductibles charged by private health insurance companies that put profits before people. There has been some controversy between Democrats this week relating to the issue of Sanders  proposal to implement a universal healthcare system in the United States. Concerns over how this program would be funded have been of particular interest to the public. Sanders lays that out in plain detail for all to read.Most of the health care plan receives its funding from new progressive taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Some people in the middle class might pay a tiny bit more in taxes. According to the campaign website,  A family of four making $50,000 a year taking the standard deduction would only pay $466 this year.  That small increase in taxes isn t anything to what a similar family would save under Sanders  plan. They would save around $5,000 dollars a year. Last year, the average working family paid $4,955 in premiums and $1,318 in deductibles to private health insurance companies. Under this plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the single-payer program, amounting to a savings of over $5,800 for that family each year,  the site reads.It long past time that the United States join every other industrialized nation in the world and implement a national single-payer healthcare system. That s what the ACA was presented as a stepping stone towards. Regardless of who is the eventual Democratic nominee, the fight for healthcare as a right need to be at the top of the Democratic platform. Democrats should not have to apologize for wanting to live in a nation where every person can get the healthcare they need.Should a better proposal than Sanders  be presented, it should be adopted. There may be some strategic advantages to wanted to expand the ACA very gradually, but we are talking about people s lives. But there are some big cracks in the ACA. Cracks that 29 million people have fallen through. It is time that we come together and demand that, no person deserves to be left behind.You can read a full break down of the plan here.Featured Image Credit: Phil Roeder via Flickr ",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bundy Militant Loses Foster Kids, Blames It On The Tyrannical Government","One of the Bundy  militiamen  has lost his sole source of income thanks to his decision to join the merry mob of marauding morons in their armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. Was he skipping work? Nah   he would have to have a job for that. Robert  LaVoy  Finicum tells Oregon Public Broadcasting that he lost his meal ticket   children.Over the past decade, Finicum and his wife s home has served as nothing more than a revolving door for foster children, with more than 50 kids coming through their home. The children, who often came from mental hospitals, drug rehabs, and group homes for emotionally distressed youth not only provided the happy couple with a steady income thanks to money they received from the state, but also with workers on his ranch (which barely makes enough money to stay afloat). My ranch has been a great tool for these boys,  Finicum said.  It has done a lot of good.  Unfortunately, when Finicum ran off to play terrorist with his friends and he left four young, emotionally disturbed boys home alone to be cared for by his wife, let s just say some flags were raised. Within four days of Finicum s departure, the Arizona Department of Social Services began to remove his meal tickets from the home. They didn t go out at the same time,  Finicum said.  One was there for a year, one of the boys was there six months, another eight months, and a month. I don t know where they ended up.  Rather than blame his involvement with a terrorist group or his own irresponsibility, Finicum says the removals resulted from  pressure from the feds : They were ripped from my wife. We are very successful (foster parents). Our track records are good, it s been a good relationship. (Federal authorities) must have gotten to the governor, who told the state to get them out of there. OPB reports that this is a staggering loss of income from the Finicums, who have depended on the between $22.31 to $37.49 per day they were paid to take care of the children. According to a 2010 tax filing, the Finicums received $115,343 in 2009. At the maximum rate, this means they  cared for  an average of 8 children per day that year. And it s exactly those dollar signs that concern Finicum, not the children he was tasked with caring for as his own: That was my main source of income. My ranch, well, the cows just cover the costs of the ranch. If this means rice and beans for the next few years, so be it. We re going to stay the course. Another of the Bundy militants, Blaine Cooper, also claims that Child Protective Services removed his children from his home. At the Facebook page All Your Base, Cooper claimed that the removal of his children, which can not be independently verified, was an attempt by the FBI to  draw him out,  blaming the removals on  bias media and asshole s like  the page owner. I hope people are seeing the sacrifices we re making here,  Finicum said.  I want to show what my government is doing. You need to understand the cost being paid by many people. Finicum has pledged to die in defense of the militants  armed encampment  proving that he is someone who should not be entrusted with the care of children. Watch him threaten violence against the government below:Featured image via NBC News",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Debate Moderator: Facts Are TOTALLY IRRELEVANT During Republican Debates (VIDEO),"It s about time someone came out and said it directly. One of the moderators from the recent CNN debate, right-wing talk radio host Hugh Hewitt, finally blurted it out during a segment on CNN: Republicans don t care about facts or accuracy.The rest of us have been aware of this problem for quite some time now, but it s nice to hear it articulated by one of the most prominent Republican talkers from the conservative entertainment complex. GOP voters, he said, aren t concerned with fact-checking the candidates. All they care about is who managed to fire off the best zingers.While chatting about the Fox Business debate and fireworks between candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Hewitt said:HEWITT: Using my boxing analogy, in the 15th round, Marco Rubio laid one on Ted Cruz. But here s the deal about fact checkers. Nick Kristof, a terrific columnist for  The New York Times,  tweeted out that Donald Trump said, in fact, in his hearing that he wanted a 45 percent tariff. Fact checking doesn t matter in these things. What matters is personality, an aura and your command presence. And of all those two, the best command presence last night was Donald Trump and Marco Rubio. And I keep marveling at how Donald Trump can dominate a television screen. He reaches through the screen sometimes, and you know, you re back on  Celebrity Apprentice.  It s an amazing skill set.So, basically, the Republicans can say anything they want with impunity   just as long as they say it with a commanding presence. Got it. Well, this explains a lot. By the way, it s not entirely unique to the 2016 race, either. Mitt Romney used this fact-free strategy against President Obama in 2012. You might recall how Romney more or less trampled Obama during the first debate. But it was only   and I mean only   because Romney blurted out any old nonsense that popped into his head, and he said it with authority, leaving Obama somewhat confounded as to the best way to counterattack Romney s fabricated gibberish.Knowing all this, and now that the cat is out of the bag, the next GOP debate should be especially chaotic.Watch the video below:Via Crooks & Liars:Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The GOP Is Sharing Conference Space With PERFECT Metaphor For Republican Party (VIDEO),"There are seldom those moments in life that seem so poetic, but the people sharing the space where the Republican congressional retreat is being held is pretty much the perfect metaphor for the embodiment of the GOP party platform.It s all happening at the Marriott Hotel at the Baltimore Harbor, and right down the hall from where Republicans are trying to put together strategies for the coming year   that is where the Mid-Atlantic Monument Builders  Association is holding their annual summit. And within the room where the Monument Builders are meeting, there is a huge sampling of headstones.How is this the perfect metaphor for the Republican party? So glad you asked.The GOP has spent nearly the past thirty years trying to make sure people have a rougher go at life than they could if they had a government that actually worked in their best interest. Instead of fighting for people to have greater access to health care, they ve been mercilessly fighting against broadened access and affordable coverage. They ve also been trying for decades to privatize social security instead of strengthen our existing government pension program that guarantees income for senior citizens who worked hard all their lives. They d prefer a system that relied on an unsteady market where people could, quite literally, lose everything. The GOP has also consistently tried to make it harder for low-income citizens to have access to Medicaid and food assistance programs. Not to mention the GOP s love for war and lust for sending American lives to die for causes still unknown.So, to see gravestones just steps away from where congressional Republicans are talking about ideas is absolutely perfect. Their ideas and plans for the people of this nation would lead to the early demise of several citizens. Kudos to whoever chose that space to hold the event, it s very telling of GOP policy.

 Ted Cruz Birth Certificate Spawns Questions About Illegitimate Birth,"On January 17, Dallas News published a copy of Ted Cruz s birth certificate. The fact that the Republican presidential hopeful was born in Canada is really no big surprise to anyone who has been following the Trump/Cruz birther frenzy.While Cruz s Canadian birth is not a surprise, the fact that his mother is identified as Eleanor Wilson on the candidate s birth certificate, rather than Eleanor Cruz, is.According to Dallas News, Wilson was the name of Cruz s mother s first husband. The couple had been divorced for about seven years at the time Cruz was born.It gets even more interesting when you learn that the former Ms. Wilson gave birth to another child, Michael, approximately three years after her divorce and three before she supposedly married Ted s father, right-wing pastor Rafael Cruz.The baby s name was Michael Wilson. He later died from crib death.In his book, A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America, Cruz claimed his mother s divorce from Wilson took place in 1965, two years later than the actual date. He also claimed that Michael was born the same year, in 1965, and that the child s death was what ultimately led to the divorce.Unfortunately for Ted, Dallas News verified that the divorce took place in 1963 and that Michael Wilson was born and died in 1966.Dallas News contacted Eleanor Cruz s former husband, Alan Wilson, who was born in Forth Worth Texas,  but has lived in London, England since the 1960 s.During the interview, Wilson said he was not Michael Cruz s father, and he only learned that his ex-wife had given birth by chance. We were divorced and she was living on her own,  said Wilson. He said that Eleanor asked him if she could use his last name on the birth certificate. When Michael Wilson later died, he said,  I hadn t even met the baby. Alan Wilson said by chance he and Eleanor Wilson were being treated in the same hospital when she was pregnant when a nurse told his  his wife  was there   startling the Fort Worthian.  I didn t know she was pregnant. We were definitely divorced. It s interesting that while Rafael and Eleanor Cruz are reported to have married in Texas in 1969, the year before Cruz was born, the state s online public records site does not show a record of the couple s marriage. The exact date of Cruz s parents marriage remain a mystery.The couple divorced in 1997.As the drama over whether Ted Cruz is eligible to run for president began to unfold this month, numerous documents have been published, including Eleanor Cruz s (maiden name Darragh) birth certificate, showing that she was born in the U.S. state of Delaware.In addition to his mother s birth certificate, Talking Points Memo and Breitbart (among other media outlets) also published Ms. Cruz s Canadian voting records. Those records tell us two things. First they tell us that Ms. Cruz was registered to vote in Canada in 1974, a right the country reserves only for legal citizens. Second, the record tell us that the candidate s mother used the name of her second husband, Rafael Cruz on her Canadian voting record.So leaves us to wonder why she used the name of her first husband on Ted Cruz s birth certificate, if indeed she was married to Rafael Cruz at the time Ted was born.None of this would be considered fair game if the candidate wasn t running for the position of God s appointed King of America. It wouldn t be fair game if Ted and Rafael Cruz had not made ridiculous and insulting statements about single mothers and unwed mothers. It would not be fair game if Ted Cruz had not appointed himself as a spiritual dictator to the masses.Most importantly, though, the birther movement that viciously attacked President Obama throughout his first term as president used the word  illegitimate,  as a matter of routine, when referring to the leader of our country.Ted Cruz spent a lot of time catering to the right-wing extremists who viciously attacked the leader our country.Apparently he never expected any of that to catch up to him.But now a lot of people are not only asking if Cruz is able to be a legitimate president, they re asking if Cruz is even the legitimate son of the religiously insane Rafael Cruz.Maybe Ted should have read that Bible he likes to wave around in front of the crowd. After all, it does warn that eventually  you will reap what you sow.

 Here Are Photos Of Detroit’s Public Schools That Michigan’s Governor Does Not Want You To See (IMAGES/VIDEO),"While much of the nation s attention has been focused on the horrors of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, there has been a revolt growing in the state of Michigan. Darnell Earley, is not only the unelected emergency manager who created the Flint water crisis, he also is in charge of Detroit s public schools. Earley has done to Detroit s schools, what he did to Flint s water system.The conditions of Detroit s school system are so bad, that teachers are on the verge of going on strike. They have been increasing their resistance to the attack and mismanagement of Detroit s schools over the past week. They have been engaging in a tactic called the  sick-out.  That s a protest where so many teachers call in sick, the school is forced to close.A picture is worth a thousand words. Here are some photos that show the deplorable conditions that students and teachers are being subjected to.Does your school look like this? #supportDPSteachers pic.twitter.com/jBGbkqoM4z  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 15, 2016#supportDPSteachers pic.twitter.com/JJPDlBRPfG  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 15, 2016Mushrooms in a classroom. #SupportDPSTeachers pic.twitter.com/97FZ53fxxe  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 12, 2016No empowered school board.

It shows what life is like for teachers and students in Detroit.Detroit s mayor, Mike Duggan recently went on a tour of DPS schools. He was  heartbroken  over what he saw. I saw 4-year-olds in a classroom where it was about 50 degrees,  he said.  They told me they usually wear their coats until lunchtime, when they warm up a bit   because there s a part of each day they actually expect to have to wear their coats in the classroom. It s nice to hear that Duggan still has enough of a heart left to be broken. The tour was nothing more than a publicity stunt created to make it look like the state is trying to do something to fix the problem. Now that the nation is watching the state of Michigan and the Snyder administration s corruption and incompetence that has infected the entire state on every level, they really, really need to convince people that they care.Even with the Flint water crisis, the Detroit water crisis, the shame that is the DPS, Snyder cannot even bring himself to criticize emergency manager Earley. Here is what Snyder had to say about Earley and the teacher protesters last week: He s been doing a good job. He s been working hard. If you think about it, our goal is to get the Detroit Public Schools to be successful. I ve proposed a package that involves an investment of over $700 million to improve education in Detroit. I m not sure why people would want to go out and protest against a solution like that. The state of Michigan has been in control of Detroit Public School system for almost seven f##king years. The cries of anyone who have spoken out against the Snyder administration have been meet with silence. Snyder s $700 million dollar proposal should, at this point, be seen as nothing more than a last-minute attempt to try to bribe his way out of being lynched by a growing mob.Snyder and all his cronies must be brought to justice for their crimes against humanity.Featured Image Courtesy: Detroitteach via Twitter",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Carlos Santana Praises President Obama, Says Trump Is Something He Saw At A Zoo Once","In an open letter to President Obama, legendary guitarist Carlos Santana praised the State of the Union Address and Obama s leadership before taking a significant shot at Donald Trump.Santana posted the letter on Facebook, but it has since been removed, perhaps due to so much hateful criticism from conservative fans of the music icon.He begins by telling President Obama how inspired he was by his speech the night before and thanked him being a true leader who strives to heal and unite the world. Santana then turned his thoughts to Donald Trump by telling the story of how the billionaire Republican presidential wannabe reminds him of a poop-throwing ape he once saw at the San Diego Zoo when he was a child. Santana concluded by urging leaders to strive for peace instead of what Trump and other Republicans stand for.Here is the full letter via Clutch Magazine.Dearest Mr. President Obama,I witnessed your speech last night. I am deeply inspired, encouraged and profoundly grateful for your words. Your consciousness soars with clarity and divine purpose. Your articulated your views, subjects and comments with compassion. You made me feel how blessed we are to share life with your leadership. Even more than any other President I have witnessed (including JFK). Your words of spirit and global healing, unity and harmony for the betterment of the world .not just the USA. I pray for your continued safety for you and your family. Regarding Mr. Trump .I remember when I was a child living in Tijuana I often crossed the border to visit the San Diego Zoo. I would hear loud screams and commotion in the distance. As I came closer to the sound, I noticed everyone was staring at an ape in a glass cage. The ape was staring back at the crowd that gathered. With an angry look of disgust, the ape defecated in his hand and threw it at the crowd. This is what I hear when Mr Trump speaks. He lacks consciousness as well as integrity. The Republicans and Mr Trump are selling hate and fear. That is the opposite of what our Country stands for. Let s go forward with light and love into the future. Global Peace is within our grasp in this lifetime. Pull humanity up, take the high road and look at the aerial view. Peace on Earth now, not later.With deep respect and admiration, Carlos SantanaThis is an epic letter by Santana, who hails from Mexico and is a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He must have been truly moved by what President Obama had to say and it must have felt especially good to smack down Donald Trump after listening to him offend the Mexican people over and over again since he announced his campaign for the presidency.If the Hispanic community shares Santana s feelings about Trump, the GOP could be in for a world of hurt on Election Day.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Donald Trump Fail So Hard At Trying To Pander To Right-Wing Christians (VIDEO),"During an interview on CNN s State of the Union on Sunday, Donald Trump was questioned by host, Jake Tapper, on his religious beliefs and support among the socially conservative, right-wing Christians.Things have been getting heated between Republican primary frontrunner Donald Trump, and the runner-up Ted Cruz, to say the least. Cruz has been surging in the polls as Trump maintains his lead. While Trump s lead appears to be unshakable, his support is also static. So the two have been at each other s throats trying to win over voters. In order to win over those voters, they have to convince people that they are the true spokesman for god and the Christian religion.In that arena, Cruz has a major advantage over Trump.  During the Family Leadership Summit, last July, Trump made the mistake of saying something somewhat reasonable to a crowd of hardcore social conservatives. He was asked if he had asked God for forgiveness. Trump responded, saying: I m not sure I have. I just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don t think so. I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don t bring God into that picture. I don t. He tried to explain away the gaffe, but it was too late. For those not in the know, asking god, and or Jesus, for forgiveness for their sins is the first and most important thing you can do as a Christian. For many, Trump might as well have said that he is not actually a Christian.This was brought up early in the interview. Trump was asked the question again, to which he replied that he has  a good relationship with God.  Tapper then goes on to question Trump about his behavior that has been seen in tabloids for the past two decades. Trump says that, he has been living a  good life  now for the past few years, so that shouldn t matter.Let s compare that to Cruz, who has a  strap-on  set of God s armor. Whether is trying to take away the rights of LGBT people, or claiming that atheists should not be able to hold public office, Cruz embodies all the terrible qualities that are revered by right-wing Christians.Based on the sentiments expressed in the interview, I don t think Trump has any idea how these people work. Trump can stir up and exploit hatred towards minorities without it coming back to hurt him, but pandering and exploiting the Christian right takes both skill and experience. Two things Trump has neither of.If the Republican primary race was a 90 s boy band, Trump would be the bad boy of the group. Many conservatives might be attracted to him, but Cruz is the one they are going to invite over for Sunday dinner. They might even let him say grace.You can watch the interview, below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" What Cher Just Did For The Residents Of Flint, Michigan Is Absolutely Incredible","What s happening in Flint, Michigan is beyond heartbreaking. Residents cannot drink their water due to lead contamination, but to add insult to injury, the water was originally declared safe. Then, as children began getting sick and the water was exposed as being toxic, government officials, including a slow to react Gov. Rick Snyder (R) finally thought they should do something about the toxic levels. To be blunt, what s happening there is criminal, and someone needs to be held responsible. President Obama has even declared a state of emergency.Stepping up big time to help the residents of Flint is none other than the legendary artist Cher. She has been very outspoken in her feelings about what s been happening. Now, she s not only voicing her opinion, but putting action to her words, she s bringing fresh water to the people there who so desperately need it.Partnering with natural spring water company Icelandic Glacial, Cher is donating 181,440 bottles of water to Flint. According to the press release: After reading about the catastrophic situation in Flint, a city of 100,000 people who have not had clean water in over a year, Cher contacted her friend Brad Horwitz, an investor in Icelandic Glacial, who reached out to the company s Chairman and Co-Founder, Jon Olafsson, about Cher s desire to purchase water for Flint s residents. Icelandic Glacial committed to doubling Cher s purchase which is being trucked in to Michigan beginning Monday, January 18th.The water will reach The Food Bank of Eastern Michigan (www.fbem.org) beginning Wednesday, January 20th. FBEM will immediately begin the distribution process to those who need it most for drinking, cooking and washing. The water will go directly to community centers, food banks and fire houses focusing in on low income housing areas where 40% of Flint s population is living below the poverty line. The bottles, once finished, will return to the food banks and will be recycled with money raised going right back into the food banks. Cher stated: This a tragedy of staggering proportion and shocking that it s happening in the middle of our country. I am so grateful that Icelandic Glacial has come on-board to help the city of Flint.  I cannot wait for the water to get there to help these people who have been poisoned because the water they ve been getting out of their taps has been polluted for so long and remains that way without the state or the federal government stepping in with any substantial plan to resolve this problem. While this doesn t solve Flint s horrific water crisis, it will definitely be a welcomed effort and is sorely needed. The citizens of Flint have been poisoned, and in the most horrible way possible   by the people who are elected to work in their best interests. However, thanks to the efforts of Cher and Icelandic Glacial, fresh water is on the way.Featured image: YouTube",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Grab The Popcorn, Trump Unloads On Ted Cruz: ‘Nobody Likes Him’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump continued to unload on rival Ted Cruz as the reality star once again went on the attack on Sunday.Appearing on ABC s This Week, Trump talked about just how unlikeable Cruz is. Nobody likes him, nobody in Congress likes him, nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him,  Trump said in an interview airing on ABC s  This Week. Trump also hit Cruz over his secret dark money loan that he secured from Goldman Sachs in order to win his Senate race. Cruz failed to disclose the loan on forms submitted to the Federal Elections Commission. He wants to look like Robin Hood,  Trump said.  That he s the one protecting the people from the banks, while he s actually borrowing money and personally guaranteeing it and not disclosing it, which is illegal. For months Trump and Cruz refused to directly attack each other, preferring to aim their arrows at other Republicans like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. But now as Cruz has started nipping at Trump s heels in Iowa polls, the front runner has begun to give Cruz the business.For his part, Cruz has also fired back. He accused Trump of having  New York values  a phrase that some have seen as a dog whistle to base Republican voters about New York s more diverse culture with is large population of Jewish people, gays, and minorities.Trump responded by pointing out that  New York values  are what terrorists targeted on 9/11. To add insult to injury, Trump received praise for those comments from both Hillary Clinton (who was New York s senator at the time) and current New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio.Additionally, Trump has been concern trolling Cruz about his eligibility for the presidency. Citing the fact that Cruz was born in Canada, Trump has been egging on Cruz to defend himself against possible challenges to his candidacy if he s the nominee. Trump has been a long-time promoter of the conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States.Over the course of the race, Trump has shown a propensity to dig in and go nuclear in his attacks on anyone who directly challenges him, and this latest salvo directed at Cruz seems to signal that the next two weeks ahead of the caucus could be immensely entertaining.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Was Martin Luther King Jr. A Republican? The Truth Will Make Conservatives Freak Out,"Conservatives and Republicans love to claim that Martin Luther King, Jr. is one of their own. They claim that the legendary clergyman and civil rights icon was a Republican, and sometimes even claim that he was a conservative.This is a lie.Dr. King had harsh words for both parties:Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.  [The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957   December 1958. University of California Press. p. 84]But he said in an October 1956 letter to a civil rights supporter that he had  always voted the Democratic ticket. And in his autobiography, Dr. King said he voted for John F. Kennedy in 1960 because he  felt that Kennedy would make the best president.  He also wrote that  had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964. As far as the Republican Party, Dr. King specifically attacked them for their hard turn to the right in 1964 with the nomination of conservative Barry Goldwater. King said that the party had begun pandering to racist elements, and as a result, he could not support Goldwater in the election versus sitting President Lyndon Johnson:The Republican Party geared its appeal and program to racism, reaction, and extremism. All people of goodwill viewed with alarm and concern the frenzied wedding at the Cow Palace of the KKK with the radical right. While not himself a racist, Mr. Goldwater articulated a philosophy which gave aid and comfort to the racist. His candidacy and philosophy would serve as an umbrella under which extremists of all stripes would stand. In the light of these facts and because of my love for America, I had no alternative but to urge every Negro and white person of goodwill to vote against Mr. Goldwater and to withdraw support from any Republican candidate that did not publicly disassociate himself from Senator Goldwater and his philosophy. [The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.]Similarly, the right s claim that Dr. King was a conservative is laughable. King was well to the left of even the Democratic Party, and opposed the party on key issues like the Vietnam War, to which King objected. King was also a big supporter of an increased minimum wage as well was worker s rights like unionization. Does that sound like a conservative?Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most effective and dynamic leaders in American history. He was not a Republican, supported Democratic presidential candidates, and was a strong liberal on a host of key issues. Too often King is depicted as sort of a black Santa Claus, devoid of politics and ideology. But that isn t the true King. He was a man of the left, and he succeeded because of that political leaning combined with his faith and the hard work of millions committed to progress.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Gets Burned By Fox News Host For War-Mongering Without Military Experience (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz got his ass handed to him on Fox News Sunday for calling President Obama weak because he hasn t carpet bombed the Middle East out of existence.It was not a good time to be Ted Cruz during his appearance on Fox with host Chris Wallace. Throughout the interview, the Republican presidential wannabe desperately tried to appear tough by talking about how quick he would be to wage total war against Iran and ISIS. I will apologize to no one with how vigorous I will be winning the war on terror,  Cruz replied when Wallace pointed out that former U.S. Army War College commandant Robert Scales dinged Cruz for his call to carpet bomb as  just one of those phrases that people with no military experience throw around. The Texas senator then attempted to describe what carpet bombing is by using the Gulf War as an example, whining about how the military has shrunk since 1991. And you want to know what carpet bombing means? Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of Desert Storm. In 1991, we had roughly 8,000 planes. Today, we have 4,000. Our Air Force has dropped in half. In 1991, we had 591 ships in our Navy. Today, we have 272. It s dropped nearly in half. In 1991, we had over a third more soldiers in our Army. And we were launching 1,100 air attacks a day. We were carpet bombing them. And after 37 days of 1,100 air attacks a day, our troops went in in a day and a half and mopped up the remnants of the Iraqi Army because that s the effect of carpet bombing. Cruz made his initial carpet bombing remark in December, saying we should see if  sand can glow in the dark. Of course, carpet bombing is when the military drops hundreds or thousands of bombs over a large swath of land, hitting every thing in its path. It s indiscriminate destruction that kills civilians as well as military targets. In short, innocent people get slaughtered. It has also been a war crime since 1977.Chris Wallace, of course, knows quite a bit more about the Gulf War than Cruz does. Wallace covered the war from Tel Aviv as a reporter for ABC while Cruz was busy not studying nearly hard enough at Princeton. We did precision striking,  Wallace corrected Cruz.  In addition   if I may   the Iraqi Army was all massed by itself in the Kuwaiti desert. We re now talking about ISIS soldiers who are not massed, they are embedded in Mosul, they re embedded in Raqqa with civilians. Cruz then went on a rant about how we should be bombing every building and oil field we can find regardless of whether or not ISIS has a connection to them or not and said that he would do exactly that if he becomes president.Here s the video via YouTube.In another part of the interview, Cruz claimed that the only reason Iran detained American sailors earlier this month is because of  the weakness of President Obama.  In reality, Iran detained them and had every right to do so because the naval vessels went off course and entered Iranian waters. It wasn t intentional, but it happened. And Iran released the sailors 14 hours later after the servicemen apologized for the mishap and it was confirmed that a navigational error sent them off course. Also, Iran is helping us fight ISIS, which makes Cruz s next statement all the more harmful.Chris Wallace even informed Cruz of that fact, but nevertheless, Cruz declared that as president he would have punished Iran with  full force and fury  and that  any nation that captured our military officers, captures our soldiers, should face serious repercussions. Here s the video via YouTube.Ted Cruz would be a disastrous president if he were to win in November. He would start endless wars over the smallest disagreements and would stoop so low as to commit war crimes and kill innocent people to prove how tough he is. This is not the kind of president America needs. We already had a president who did these kind of things. President Bush sent thousands of American troops to their deaths fighting two wars and used torture as a method of interrogation despite it being a violation of the Geneva Convention.The fact that President Obama has killed many high-ranking ISIS leaders with precision drone and air strikes proves that we don t need to carpet bomb to achieve the same goals. The fact that President Obama secured a nuclear deal with Iran and the release of American prisoners they held as well as the quick release of American sailors also proves how diplomacy is effective at achieving our goals without firing a single shot or spilling blood.The only thing Ted Cruz demonstrated today is that he is dangerous and irresponsible and shouldn t be allowed anywhere near American foreign policy nor should he be given control of the military.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Gets Destroyed On Twitter For Using 9/11 Image To Attack Cruz (TWEETS),"The Republican candidates continue to sink to newer lows on a daily basis. After Ted Cruz denigrated the people of New York by accusing Donald Trump of having  New York values,  Trump immediately saw an opportunity to score points. At Thursday s Republican debate, Trump condemned Cruz s statement by invoking the resolve of New Yorkers following the September 11th attacks. Sounds pretty good so far on Trump s part, right? That s until he milked the opportunity dry on Twitter by posting a picture of 9/11 to attack Cruz. However, some of the responses are not what Trump expected. Here is what he tweeted:Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? pic.twitter.com/rYGX9vazku  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016People clearly knew what Trump was up up to. Here are some responses:.@realDonaldTrump See? I'll use some tragedy to further MY goals. I have no shame. I want to win this bitch and will do whatever it takes!  Fake Donald Trump (@TheFakeTrump) January 16, 2016Yes, as Trump would say:  That s disgusting! @realDonaldTrump You forget that the attack was on the USA, not just NYC. AND you forget we came to help!~  Judy Stines (@jstines3) January 17, 2016Indeed, the attack was on the United States and it was the country as a whole that came together with the necessary resolve. The people that died that day weren t only New Yorkers, but people from around the country and around the world. This was an American tragedy that was resisted with American resolve. Tribalizing it for political gain is not only silly and low, but it clouds the true picture.@realDonaldTrump And stop pimping out the worst terrorist attack in US History because your poll numbers are dropping.  Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) January 16, 2016Donald Trump has shown a knack for being very adept at finding the right moments to attack his opponents. Thus far, he s made a mockery of other Republican candidates, especially Jeb Bush. The media and many in the public have found his antics both humorous and outrageous and have tolerated him and even rewarded him: he s been the most covered candidate by the media thus far.However, we should be very careful with this individual. There will come a time (and that time is coming very soon) when America will have to make an important choice about Donald Trump: Does America want a president who attacks minorities, has clear disdain for women, and uses the worst attack on US history for political gain against his opponent?Let s hope that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and the rest of the Republican lineup continue to cancel each other out and show their true colors with their classless antics.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" This One Factor Determines If You’re A Trump Supporter, And It’s Not What You Think","Trump supporters have a lot in common. They lack education. They re a bunch of horrible racists. They want to  make America great again  by viciously beating African-American protesters and homeless people. The idea of keeping brown people out of  Murika appeals to them. His appeal to racists is so great that white supremacists are actively campaigning for him and terrorist groups are using his hate speech to recruit. But did you know that one factor you haven t thought of defines Trump support better than jingoism, racism, homophobia, extreme anti-Muslim sentiments, or a desire to build a gigantic wall so we never have to even look at a Hispanic person again?Politico s Matthew MacWilliams says he has discovered one factor that predicts whether or not someone is a Trump voter:In fact, I ve found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether a voter supports Trump and it s not race, income or education levels: It s authoritarianism.That s right, Trump s electoral strength and his staying power have been buoyed, above all, by Americans with authoritarian inclinations. And because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate, among Democrats as well as Republicans, it s very possible that Trump s fan base will continue to grow.MacWilliams just finished conducting a national poll which sampled 1,800 voters across the nation.  I found that education, income, gender, age, ideology and religiosity had no significant bearing on a Republican voter s preferred candidate,  he writes.  Only two of the variables I looked at were statistically significant: authoritarianism, followed by fear of terrorism, though the former was far more significant than the latter. MacWilliams explains that Trump s pledge to make  America great again  as well as his horrific suggestions that Muslims be banned from the United States, wear special ID badges if they re already here, and be rounded up into concentration camps (as well, of course, as his Great Wall of Murika), all cater to authoritarian inclinations:Authoritarianism is not a new, untested concept in the American electorate. Since the rise of Nazi Germany, it has been one of the most widely studied ideas in social science. While its causes are still debated, the political behavior of authoritarians is not. Authoritarians obey. They rally to and follow strong leaders. And they respond aggressively to outsiders, especially when they feel threatened.This, of course, describes Trump supporters perfectly. Frighteningly, authoritarianism (while prevalent among Republicans) is not limited to the Right. In the 2008 Democratic primary, the political scientist Marc Hetherington found that authoritarianism mattered more than income, ideology, gender, age and education in predicting whether voters preferred Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama,  MacWilliams notes.  But Hetherington has also found, based on 14 years of polling, that authoritarians have steadily moved from the Democratic to the Republican Party over time  since they began to embrace civil rights, gay rights, and other hallmarks of liberalism that are common in the party today.MacWilliams notes that authoritarianism is not  a statistically significant factor in the Democratic primary race  thus far, but  it does appear to be playing an important role on the Republican side,  as 49 percent of Republicans score  in the top quarter of the authoritarian scale. MacWilliams  poll asked voters some simple questions about parenting to gauge authoritarianism:  whether it is more important for the voter to have a child who is respectful or independent; obedient or self-reliant; well-behaved or considerate; and well-mannered or curious. Based on these questions, Trump was the only candidate Republican or Democrat whose support among authoritarians was statistically significant,  he concludes. This, combined with the 52% of respondents who live in fear of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, gives us something to fear. While it s easy to say President Trump  can t happen here    that Americans won t stand for the ideological reincarnation of Adolf Hitler being elected   MacWilliams points out that it s time that Democrats and all who oppose fascism begin taking Trump seriously.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Everybody Laughed After Watching This Bizarre Fantasy From Marco Rubio,"If you listen to Senator Marco Rubio, ISIS is outside your door and is about to attack your family, and the only way to defend against this threat is to buy a gun.Senator Rubio needs the support of diehard conservatives if he is to make any headway in the Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary, and they are almost as suspicious of his conservative bona fides as they are of figures like Jeb Bush.So in order to get those voters on board, Senator Rubio has to do what he does so well   pander.That s why when he appeared on CBS  Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Rubio went into detail about the latest revelation from the campaign trail   his Christmas Eve purchase of a gun.Rubio told host John Dickerson that he bought a gun in order to defend his family from ISIS.Rubio explains why he purchased a fire arm recently. Explains that it is the last defense between his family & ISIS https://t.co/2AkdTHZ5yh  Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) January 17, 2016He explained: I m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I have a right to protect my family if someone were to come after us, in fact, if ISIS were to visit us or our communities at any moment, the last line of defense between ISIS and my family is the ability that I have to protect my family from them or from a criminal or from anyone else that seeks to do us harm. Rarely does a politician so blatantly pander to a constituency group that he or she needs to be viable, but Rubio has gone there.His rhetoric echoes the fevered donation-seeking fantasies of the NRA, who has recently told their followers that they need to have a gun in the house to defend against an ISIS attack just outside their homes.Of course, the unfortunate reality is Senator Rubio and other gun owners are far more likely to hurt themselves or members of their family than to engage in a fantasy shoot-out with an ISIS terrorist.But keeping this level of fear up continues to benefit the right in many ways. Telling people to go out and buy guns creates a false sense of security, and fills the coffers of the gun manufacturers who then donate to Republicans and help to keep them in office, resulting in lax gun legislation or opposition to new laws. Everybody benefits, except public safety and security.Marco s got a gun.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Victorious Obama Schools GOP War-Mongers: Breakthrough With Iran Based On ‘Smart’ Diplomacy (VIDEO),"While Republicans continue to reveal their true colors by openly complaining about the release of American prisoners in Iran, President Obama is using his latest diplomatic success to teach his critics a lesson in what effective leadership really looks like.Obama had deliberately waited to talk about the hostage exchange until the American prisoners were out of Iran and safe, but upon news that the swap was a success and that the United Nations had certified that Iran was upholding its end of a landmark nuclear disarmament deal, the White House held a press conference that quickly turned into a  teachable moment  for those who had irresponsibly advocated for war over diplomacy. This is a good day, because once again we re seeing what s possible with strong American diplomacy,  Obama said at the White House. Yesterday marked a milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,  he noted.  Most of important of all, we achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East. And yet, somebody might want to tell the Republican Party that a victory like this without a single shot fired is considered a good thing. The friends at Fox and Friends were practically despondent when they had to tell their audience that the American prisoners in Iran were coming home.A good day for America is a bad one for Fox.Obama s negotiations were a massive blow to their narrative.For years, Republicans have insisted that the only way to get Iran to listen to the United States is through threats of war. Infamously, Republican Sen. John McCain ran for president on the platform of  bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.  Even now, certain conservatives regret not being able to send troops into another Middle Eastern conflict. War is a tough addiction to kick.Nobody knows how much Republicans want war than President Obama. He s been boxing out the war-mongers for years. During his comments, he took a dig at those who say war is the only answer.Citing the cooling of tensions with Iran, Obama pointed out that his  smart, patient and disciplined approach to the world  has yielded results. America can do   and has done   big things when we work together,  Obama said.  We can lead this world and make it safer and more secure. But we can only do that if we stop listening to those who think threatening violence will make us look tough. America has tried that approach for decades and the situation with Iran had only been deteriorating. The change in recent months cannot be overstated.The nuclear talks have brought a sense of normalcy to relations with the U.S. and Iran, with top officials from each country in somewhat regular communication. While Obama emphasized that the U.S. continues to have deep concerns about Iran s destabilizing actions in the Middle East and its threats to Israel, he also opened up the prospect of Tehran working more cooperatively with the rest of the world.It s worth noting that those who want war with Iran represent a small minority of Americas   mostly Republican politicians and Fox News hosts. It s not a coincidence that McCain s  bomb Iran  campaign strategy contributed to his being absolutely smoked by Obama s  smart, patient and disciplined  one in the election. It s also not a big secret that Americans are tired of sending young kids off to die in intractable wars in the Middle East. With the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finally winding down, it s only those in the GOP who seem eager to embark on a new one.If accomplishing America s goals of neutralizing Iran s nuclear program while avoiding war was the goal   and for most of the country, it was   then this deal represents a massive success for the country. For the bloodthirsty, it probably stings a little. Obama s clearly not sorry.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xABl2Aeaycc]Featured image via White House ",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michael Moore Tears Into Michigan GOPers For ‘Killing’ Flint Residents With Polluted Water (VIDEO),"Filmmaker Michael Moore, who was born in Flint, Michigan, recently ripped Gov. Rick Snyder (R) and other GOP lawmakers for keeping the city s unsafe water a secret not only from the predominately minority population, but the federal government.In an impassioned speech to reporters, Moore accused Snyder and Michigan Republicans for  killing  those 10 people. Moore said: This is not a mistake. Ten people have been killed here because of a political decision. They did this. They knew. Moore said that the state s GOP politicians had continued to provide Flint s citizens with polluted water from the Flint River to cut costs. As a result, the state Department of Environmental Quality had failed to call for corrosion control chemicals to be added to the water, resulting in lead entering the water from pipes. Moore insisted that what is being called the  Flint water crisis  is not actually a  crisis  at all   it was a planned, measured decision by lawmakers that are now trying to deflect blame. Moore urged the media and others to call the  Flint water crisis  what it really is   murder: We need to start using the proper words when we talk about this. Ten people have been killed in Flint because of Legionnaire s disease now that has broken out here. And I want the media to please use the word  kill.  If it was ten people killed in a tornado, you d say  ten people killed. Moore ripped Michigan s Republicans for making  political decisions  that put at risk the lives of people in a city that is majority African-American, where 41 percent live below the official poverty line. It s a crisis created by the Republican governor and is visited upon a city that is majority black and majority poor. Speaking over the angry chants of protesters in the background, Moore said: There are people who are very angry here, because their lives are at risk. They should be angry. We are all angry.

 Montel Williams To Republicans Criticizing Iran Prisoner Exchange: ‘Sit The Hell Down And Shut Up’,"Montel Williams took Republicans to the woodshed on Saturday for putting American lives in danger by criticizing the Iran prisoner swap.It was a gesture that Iran did not have to take. After all, it wasn t part of the nuclear deal reached with President Obama and other world leaders last summer. But Iran released four Iranian-American prisoners on Saturday, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, pastor Saeed Abedini, and former Marine Amir Hekmati, in exchange for Iranians imprisoned in the United States for sanctions-related violations.Republicans had demanded that the release of the Americans be a condition of the nuclear deal, and had President Obama listened both efforts would have been put in jeopardy. Six months after the nuclear deal was finalized, President Obama has now successfully negotiated an end to Iran s nuclear program and the release of the Americans the GOP used as pawns to sabotage the deal.But the good news didn t stop Republicans from whining anyway. Even though the released prisoners weren t even home yet, GOP presidential wannabes cried that there should not have been any swap at all. We shouldn t have to swap prisoners,  Christie said.  These folks were taken illegally in violation of international law and they should have been released without condition. Rubio claimed that the swap will embolden other nations to take Americans prisoner so that they can get something in return. Governments are taking Americans hostage because they believe they can gain concessions from this government under Barack Obama,  Rubio said.  It s an incentive for more people to do this in the future. Jeb Bush responded by saying he would have threatened Iran with war to get the prisoners freed. I would say . . .  If you do not release them, that there s going to be military action, that that s an act of provocation, an act of war,  he said.In other words, Republicans would have left these Americans in jail because they didn t get their way or they would have declared war on Iran and sent thousands of American troops to their deaths over the imprisonment of four people. That doesn t sound like responsible foreign policy. And former Marine and talk show host Montel Williams feels the same way.As reports trickled in that the four Americans were being released, Williams took to Twitter to blast Republicans who criticized the prisoner exchange before it had been completed.Beyond inappropriate for Republican candidates to criticize a deal to release hostages before they are home. Sit the hell down and shut up.  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 16, 2016 Dear Americans: Just for today, let s #StopWithTheStupid, just absorb that something monumental has happened. Leave politics till Monday.  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 16, 2016Only the tea party could manage to criticize a deal to bring hostages home before said hostages left where they were being held. #NotBright  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 17, 2016On Saturday evening, Williams continued ripping Republicans a new one on Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;It s beyond irresponsible that some of the Republican candidates criticized the swap that will bring our hostages home Posted by Montel Williams on Saturday, January 16, 2016Republicans have now given us a clear demonstration of how they would handle international affairs and it doesn t look good. The GOP would risk war and the sullying of our reputation around the world in a desperate effort to not look weak. Since when did peace and diplomacy come to equal weakness? Not only did diplomacy secure a nuclear agreement that will keep the world from being set ablaze for decades to come, it helped four Americans gain freedom. The fact that President Obama was willing to swap prisoners and make concessions makes him a strong leader, not a weak one. And the seven Iranians released in exchange were not even a threat to us. They simply violated the economic sanctions put in place to get Iran to the bargaining table. They weren t terrorists.The bottom line is that President Obama achieved success on both initiatives without having to fire a single shot or spill one drop of American or Iranian blood. That is true strength that Republicans will never have.Conservatives can either wake up and join the majority of the country and celebrate return of our hostages or be relegated to irrelevancy.

 NYC Cop Under Investigation After Being Busted With Instagram Account Full Of Violence (TWEETS),"New York City Officer Matthew Langone sure does love his Instagram account. It is also the reason he is now facing an investigation.While off duty, Langone moonlights as a producer of pro-cop merchandise. There would be nothing wrong with this, except for one little fact: the merchandise blatantly advocates for police violence against members of the community. In fact, at least one t-shirt is the very definition of fascism.The latest shirt from the Langone collection boasts zip tie wrist cuffs shaped like a heart, with the slogan,  I [heart] protesters.  The  OT  in protesters is in blue, clearly promoting the widely popular police narrative that they rake in the bucks from all the overtime they get policing the ever-increasing number of protests. Keegan Stephan, an activist against police brutality, discovered the photos on Langone s Instagram account and uploaded them to twitter. Here is the image:Officer Langone of the @NYPD103Pct doesn't think much of free speech, except of course as ""OT."" pic.twitter.com/SGODDv8Nwh  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016If you think that s bad, you ain t seen nothing yet. Suspecting more horrible content lay within the confines of Langone s Instagram, Stephan kept looking. He found it to be full of horrible memes and derogatory language directed at the very people this cop is sworn to serve and protect. Here are just a few:In fact, his whole instagram account is pretty unbecoming of an officer, imo, @NYPD103Pct. https://t.co/gABdz1zpHj pic.twitter.com/xM1myPSziZ  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016To be clear, this appears to be an active duty cop w/the @NYPD103Pct posting this filth: https://t.co/gABdz1zpHj pic.twitter.com/zq9bSlGfNB  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016It s the last meme, in which Langone refers to community members as  hoodrats,  that got the attention of Rory Lancman, of the Queens City Council. Lancman called on the 103rd precinct, at which Langone works as an active duty officer, for an investigation. Lancman said of the posts: I m deeply disturbed by the reprehensible Instagram posts of a police officer in the 103rd Precinct, which covers a significant portion of my district. It s completely unacceptable for someone who has sworn to protect our city to post messages advocating violence and referring to community members as  hood rats.  Such comments erode public confidence in our police and undermine our efforts to improve police-community relations. I urge the NYPD to take immediate disciplinary action and make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated. But of course, the Blue wall of silence is always more important, than, you know, keeping the community safe from a cop with fantasies of fascism and violence and who clearly has nothing but contempt for the people who live there. The cops at the precinct only had this to say: We want to make sure that the posts are his. How many fake Instagram and Twitter pages are out there? Someone may have been putting this out in his name. How convenient. Even more insidious is that they have now blocked Keegan Stephan from following their precinct on Twitter. Stephan posted the proof:Wow, way to deal with the problem, @NYPD103Pct. pic.twitter.com/Vtugh5V76i  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016I think, after this, it is safe to say that their  investigation,  will just be another in a long line of countless cases where they investigate themselves and determine that there was no wrongdoing.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Reveals What He Carries In His Pocket Everyday – Conservatives Freak Out (VIDEO),"President Obama carried out his annual YouTube interview on Friday and revealed what he carried around with him each and every day inside his pockets. While normally what s in a person s pockets might be self-explanatory (i.e.,. phone, wallet, etc.) the president is no ordinary person. And the items he carries around aren t ordinary, either. There s also an in-depth explanation for each one of them.Here s Obama in his own words: I stick these in my pocket to remind me of all the people I ve met along the way and the stories they ve told me. So, this is what I had in my pocket today: this is rosary beads Pope Francis gave me that obviously means alot to me cause I so admire him and it makes me think about peace and promoting understanding and ethical behavior. This is a little Buddha that a Buddhist monk gave me. This is a lucky poker chip that s metal that this biker gave me. This is a Hindu statuette of the monkey God Hanuman that a woman gave me. And, I ve got a coptic cross; this is from Ethipia. So, I ve got a whole bunch of this stuff but the reason I showed you these is because I carry them around all the time. President Obama says he s  not superstitious  and reiterated that the real reason he carries them around is because he likes to be reminded of the people who gave him the distinct privilege of being President of the United States.Even though President Obama clearly carries around both a cross and rosary beads from the none other than the Pope himself, the only thing religious extremists can focus on is the Hindu monkey God and little Buddha. Why is that? They somehow think this is evidence that he really is the Antichrist, after all.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Now compare this to what George Bush is known to have had in his pockets. In November 2005, at a roundtable with Latin American reporters, Bush was asked what he carried around with him. Here is how he responded, according to the Associated Press: The president stood up, fished in his pockets, then dramatically pulled his hands out holding nothing but a white handkerchief that he waved playfully in the air. He said:  Es todo. That s it. No dinero. No money. No mas. Nothing else. No wallet.' The joker that he was, he was also asked if he brought a watch, to which he replied: Si, Timex. But I m not supposed to be endorsing products. It s amazing how what s in a president s pockets can reveal what kind of commander-in-chief they are. Clearly, Obama has put a lot of thought into this, while Bush hadn t.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Tim Allen Cracks A Joke About Obama – Would Be Destroyed If POTUS Made The Same Joke (VIDEO),"Self-proclaimed  fiscal-conservative  Tim Allen cracked a joke about President Obama at the conclusion of the show Last Man Standing on Friday, and let s just say, not only was it not funny, but it wasn t exactly substantiated in fact either.Here s what he had to say: So, if you re a young person not exactly sure where life is taking you, that s okay. We can t all be Barack Obama and have our first job be president. In case Tim Allen wasn t aware, here s a full list of every single job President Obama has had before being elected. We can assure you, being president wasn t his first, not by a long shot.Tim Allen may think he s funny, but unfortunately for him, his joke isn t even close to being even halfway true. But, while we re on the subject perhaps we should discuss one of Tim Allen s first jobs. Typically, we wouldn t bring up somebody s past in such a light, but Allen brought it up first. In 1978, Allen was arrested for cocaine possession and almost spent life in prison. And, it was no small amount   he had over 650 grams on him. That s a lot of Columbian snow. Does Allen really want to compare his list of previous jobs with the president? We didn t think so.This wasn t the first time Allen has used jokes on the show to make fun of President Obama, either. Back in October, he blamed Obama for not being able to have a pit underneath his car. We must admit, this joke, however, was kind of funny. It helped that Jay Leno was on the show, backing him up. You have a pit. I ve always wanted a pit. You can t have a pit these days  cause of zoning laws. (Because of) Obama. Tim Allen has repeatedly gone on television and proclaimed himself to be a conservative and every single time he has showed us how little he actually knows. One of his most recent talk show appearances was when he went on Sean Hannity and discussed his story on why he considers himself to be a conservative: I like problem-solving. And a lot of it is about how are we going to pay for this? In my neighborhood, we wanted to put in trees, (but) here in communist California it s difficult because there are so many regulations. Perhaps Tim should do some fact-checking first the next time he decides to talk about  fiscal-conservativism.  According to The Atlantic, a conservative publication, GOP presidents have been the WORST contributors to the federal debt. Just take a look at the chart below. The last four Republican presidents all significantly contributed to the national debt.Numbers don t lie, but people do.Pic via The AtlanticFeatured image via screen capture.",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SNL SAVAGELY Lampoons The GOP Clown Car In Hilarious Debate Cold Opener (VIDEO),"Once again, the comedic geniuses at Saturday Night Live proved their prowess when they lambasted the embarrassing quagmire of bullsh*t, hysteria, and jingoistic, nonsensical willful ignorance that was the first GOP debate of 2016. As always, Republicans failed to present a single workable idea at bettering our nation, but they did provide some downright hilarious soundbytes   like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump s hilarious attempts to out- birther  one another, or Carson s paranoid claims that ISIS hackers will down our electrical grid (even though squirrels are actually a bigger threat than any hacker).The SNL cast poked fun at Lindsey Graham s departure from the race (yes, we assure you he was running for President), Chris Christie s almost unredeemable unpopularity and terrible temper, Ted Cruz s supposed ineligibility for office (Let s face it   he s eligible, just awful), Christie s nonsensical desire to kick Obama out of the White House (which he will be leaving of his own accord next January no matter what),  Jebrah  Bush s stupid Clinton joke, and other  hits  from the real embarrassment to America that was the debate. They even translated Ted Cruz s  New York values  remark for us.Sure, we can laugh, but when you think about it one of the men who mainstaged the debate has an almost barely perceptible yet present chance of becoming the next President if Democrats don t get out and vote. Look what the GOP accomplished in 2014, after all.As you watch this, consider that the SNL cast didn t have to reach very far for their jokes   most of them were almost directly written by the Republicans  extensive cast of bigots, hatemongers, and monumental imbeciles from the 2016 field.For now, of course, we ll just laugh   and hope the joke doesn t become too real.Watch the hilarious video below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzysfuve9XM&w=420&h=315]Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Gets Booed Off The Stage In Front Of The Tea Party – Yells Back At Them (VIDEO),"Donald Trump practically got booed off the stage talking to a bunch of Tea Party activists on Saturday after he started talking about Ted Cruz in a negative light. Shortly after getting a taste of his own medicine (i.e. throwing people out of his events, simply because he doesn t like them) Trump suddenly called it a night and ended his speech. He must not have liked the booing very much.Here s what Trump started saying before the commotion started: You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want. And he s a very nice guy but you have to get   right? As soon as these very words left the crevice of Trump s mouth, the booing immediately commenced. Let s just say this, Mr. Entertainer didn t seem to like it very much. He quickly snapped back, saying a lot of the same things over and over very nervously while trying to maintain his composure: Excuse me, excuse me. He didn t report his bank loans. Say whatever you want. He didn t report his bank loans. He s got bank loans from Goldman Sachs. He s got bank loans from Citigroup. And then, and then, he acts like Robin Hood. Say whatever you want but it doesn t work that way. Right now Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are locked in an intense battle for the top spot in the Republican party. Their so-called truce earlier on in the primary season is essentially over if the last Republican debate is any indication. But, that s to be expected. This is when the crazy season begins; the Iowa caucuses are only two weeks away.Trump plans on hitting Ted Cruz more on his alleged birther status, and Cruz will still pretend to like Trump as long as his poll numbers continue to rise. That s the thing   it all goes back to the polls. Republican candidates worship those numbers more than the Bible. They ll do whatever works to win this thing.Expect Trump to keep on saying negative things in an attempt to drive up his numbers. With Ted Cruz rising in popularity that only means the possibility of more booing for Trump.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: We Found Donald Trump’s Campaign Theme Song (VIDEO),"Way back in 1998, when Fox s MadTV was still on the air, an actress/singer named Nicole Sullivan performed a three-minute comedy sketch that so accurately predicts the Donald Trump campaign, we just had to write about it.For the sketch, Sullivan adopted the character of Darlene McBride, a huge-haired country music singer, who is promoting her upcoming  Take Back America  tour.As the video opens, Sullivan s character can be seen strumming her guitar, while belting out the words to her new song,  Take Back America. Take back America to 1955,  she sings.  Take back America to when god was still alive. As the music fades into the background, McBride is seen sitting at a mirrored dressing table, dressed in camo, an American flag displayed proudly on the shoulder of her military fatigues. Truer words were never spoken, or sung,  she says.She then introduces herself. Hi, I m Darlene McBride. You know I love this country, the way it used to be, simple-minded, with simple values, simple people. But then the big government, the Supreme Court and those bleeding heart liberals just couldn t leave well enough alone. And now look at it? A big, ugly melting pot just boilin  over on what used to be a nice, white stove. From there, McBride goes on to talk about her upcoming tour, where she says she ll  be coming to a city near you, to sing traditional songs with traditional values. She then provides the audience with a few samples tunes that you can hear during the tour.For starters, there s a little ditty called The Lord Loves the NRA. The lord loves the NRA, he told me so the other day. He spelled it out in bullets in the sky. He s sitting up in heaven with his AK 47. He s a rough-and-ready, macho kind of guy. Then there s the song called The Back of the Bus.Leading into that one she says  Excuse me Mr. Negro, but I ve got a question to ask you. She then breaks into the song, asking in the lyrics,  What s so bad about the back of the bus? Next up is a song called Nothing Would Be Finer. Nothing would be finer than to drop a bomb on Chiner in the morning. She also has a song about illegal immigration called Hey Senorita.To be fair, all of the songs in this sketch would work for any GOP candidate, not just Trump. The NRA lovin , republican-Jesus fearin  racists and warmongers that vote for them would likely never realize they were listening to a musical parody of themselves.Watch the MadTV video below, courtesy of Migrainemaker on YouTube.While the sketch might seem like it was written to mock today s Teapublican Trump supporters, it s actually 18 years old.It goes to show, no matter how much time passes, the republican party does not change. It s the same today as it was almost twenty years ago, and will most likely be twenty years from now.Featured image credit: video screen capture, MadTV via Migrainemaker on youtube",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Wife Of Pastor Freed In Iran Just Demolished The Right-Wing Criticism Of Obama’s Actions (VIDEO),"Ever since President Obama made history with a groundbreaking nuclear disarmament deal with Iran, Republican lawmakers have tried to undermine the nature of the agreement by pointing to several American citizens who were still languishing in the country s prison. They argued that no deal can truly be reached until Iran released the imprisoned Americans. That all changed on Saturday, January 16, when the Obama administration pulled off yet another victory: Securing the release of five American prisoners, who will now get to return to their families.This is great news, right? Apparently, not if you are a conservative politician.Rather than celebrate, Republicans  still allergic to acknowledging Obama s accomplishments, no matter how uncontroversial   whined and complained. Donald Trump, the current Republican front-runner, even suggested the prisoners should have stayed in Iranian prison because it was a bad deal. They re getting seven people, so essentially they get $150bn plus seven, and we get four,  the billionaire said.Marco Rubio agreed with Trump that the prisoner swap was a bad idea. His disingenuous argument was that  swapping  made America weak  despite the fact that America has had no problem using the technique since the Revolutionary War.One of the main criticisms Republicans leveled at Obama was that he didn t care about the prisoners. Just days before the White House announced the release of the prisoners, Republican politicians and pundits were claiming Obama didn t care about them at all.You can t ask #JasonRezaian bc Obama did a deal with Iran thugs who have held Jason hostage for almost 600 days. https://t.co/jzd7EyzbI0  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 13, 2016Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay.  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 12, 2016In fact, we now know with certainty that nothing could be further from the truth. Secretary of State John Kerry has been working around the clock to get these Americans home. (Note: Obama isn t the only one who gets no credit. Not a single Republican thanked Kerry for his efforts, either. Ted Cruz did thank God though.)Praise God! Surely bad parts of Obama's latest deal, but prayers of thanksgiving that Pastor Saeed is coming home. https://t.co/rad1VcWUml  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 16, 2016This political posturing might play well with the fringe right who love to hear about Obama s  failures,  but the families of the victims are telling an entirely different story. According to the wife of one of the prisoners, Obama was dogged about getting these Americans home to their families.On CNN, Naghmeh Abedini, the wife of Christian pastor Saeed Abedini (imprisoned in Iran since 2012), said Obama assured her that he and his administration were doing everything they could to bring him home   even while Republicans screeched on Fox News saying the opposite. Speaking with Wolf Bltizer, Abedini said: It s been wonderful. Especially the last year. Constant communication. Constant updates. Of course last year, we met with President Obama. He was in Boise, Idaho, [and] we had a private meeting with [him]. The last  year has been the best support. They were continually updating us  talks they were having with Iran and the side negotiations. I had a feeling in the last few months that it was coming to a close, but I wasn t really sure and I wouldn t trying to get my hopes up. In other words, the Obama administration had been doing all the things you would hope a president would when wrestling with a tense negotiation with a foreign country that doesn t exactly love America.This has been a common theme during Obama s presidency. Fox News pundits and right-wing politicians hoping to score cheap political points take potshots at the president, because they know he can t respond. Obama s silence wasn t apathy, it was necessary in order to make the deal work. So rather than tank the negotiation for his own reputation, he took the punches and worked on in silence.It s worth remembering, particularly on a day like this, that the Republican alternative to these successful negotiations was to quite literally start a war with Iran. It s never been clear how exactly they reasoned that a new world war would help things, but then, war has always been an easy answer. Diplomacy takes more intelligence, and a heck of a lot more courage.Watch Abedini s interview via CNN below:Featured image via CNN",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Oath Keeper Leader: If You ‘Waco’ The Bundy Militia, There Will Be ‘Bloody, Brutal Civil War’","The occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Reserve in Harney County, Oregon, has now reached the two week mark, and there are no signs of a coming resolution. Many people want this over and done with, especially those whose lives have been disrupted by the presence of Cliven Bundy s sons and a bunch of other pathetic wannabe  patriots.  Well now, the founder of another militia group, the Oath Keepers, has a message for the authorities who are monitoring the situation.Stewart Rhodes uploaded his warning message to the group s website, and insisted that the government better watch out because there will never again be a free Waco,  and if they aren t careful there will be  a conflagration so great, it cannot be stopped, leading to a bloody, brutal civil war. While Rhodes and his group are deliberately staying out of the Bundy situation, his message was no less threatening. In the piece, entitled Warning to U.S. Military and Federal LEOs: Do Not Follow Orders to  Waco  Ammon Bundy Occupation, or Risk Civil War, Rhodes said: This situation (Oregon occupation) must not be handled in a military or paramilitary fashion, using military assets, military rules of engagement, or otherwise attempting to end it suddenly by use of dynamic assault, resulting in catastrophic loss of life, as has occurred twice in recent American history, with horrific results (at Ruby Ridge in 1992, and at Waco Texas in 1993). If you do it  Waco  style here, you risk pushing this nation over the edge into a civil war, because there are  no more free Wacos. This is precisely why, frustrating as it is, these people are still being allowed to occupy this space unlawfully. The authorities have already suggested that another Waco is exactly what these idiots want. Rhodes went on to say: Despite that reality of there being no emergency here, we have very good reason to believe that ideologue leftist bureaucrats within the Obama Administration   such as within the D.O.J., and their politically minded  perfumed prince  puppets within the D.O.D.   are pressuring you to prepare to use military assets and military rules of engagement to conduct a dynamic raid. We hear things. We ll just leave it at that. After this warning, Rhodes went on to attack the Obama Administration, as well as President Obama, himself. We agree, and therefore we warn you to do this right, no matter what the Obama Admin overlords try to demand.  Do it right, or risk starting a conflagration so great, it cannot be stopped, leading to a bloody, brutal civil war. And do it right, because it is your duty to refuse those orders, under your oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And that includes the domestic enemies now  occupying  Washington D.C. Your brothers in heaven are watching.  Do the right thing.  Stand down, and refuse to obey evil, ghoulish sociopaths who salivate at the prospect of watching Americans die on camera, like they watched during Benghazi,   he stated.  Tell them that if they want American patriot blood, they need to strap on a plate carrier, chest rig, and an M-4 and go do it themselves. That s what these numbskulls don t get. These people are not patriots. They are criminals. This occupation cannot go on forever. Something will have to be done. While it is understandable that no one wants to see bloodshed, this cannot continue indefinitely.Then again, the Oath Keepers are a fringe group of lunatics much like these Bundy idiots, only much more organized, which also makes them more dangerous. Hopefully, the authorities aren t listening to a word they have to say, and will move to get these yahoos out of that wildlife refuge so that the local residents can get back to living their lives.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Iran Proves Republicans Are Full Of Crap As United Nations Says Nuclear Deal Has Been Honored,"Iran is fulfilling their obligations under the nuclear deal reached with the Obama Administration, and Republicans can t handle being proven wrong by those they consider enemies.On Saturday morning, Iran released several Americans from jail. Among them included Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, pastor Saeed Abedini, and former marine Amir Hekmati. As you may recall, Republicans repeatedly used the imprisonment of these three men as a reason to oppose the nuclear deal and demanded that President Obama make their release a condition of the negotiations.But President Obama wisely refused to tangle the two issues, which kept the nuclear deal alive while preserving a future opportunity to bring the prisoners home.And on Saturday, President Obama s wisdom paid off, as all three men have been released just as the deal goes into effect. Not only that, but the United Nations has announced that Iran has honored the terms of the deal in a statement by International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano.Here is the full statement via the IAEA.Today, I released a report confirming that Iran has completed the necessary preparatory steps to start the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The report was submitted to the IAEA Board of Governors and to the United Nations Security Council.It was issued after Agency inspectors on the ground verified that Iran has carried out all measures required under the JCPOA to enable Implementation Day to occur.This paves the way for the IAEA to begin verifying and monitoring Iran s nuclear-related commitments under the agreement, as requested by the U.N. Security Council and authorised by the IAEA Board.Relations between Iran and the IAEA now enter a new phase. It is an important day for the international community. I congratulate all those who helped make it a reality, especially the group of countries known as the E3/EU+3, Iran and the IAEA Board.In line with its commitments, Iran will start to provisionally implement the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA. Together with other nuclear-related measures under the JCPOA, this increases the Agency s ability to monitor nuclear activities in Iran and to verify that they are peaceful.We have come a long way since the IAEA first started considering the Iran nuclear issue in 2003. A lot of work has gone into getting us here, and implementation of this agreement will require a similar effort. For our part, we are ready to get on with the job.In other words, Iran met their obligations and showed the world that Republicans were full of bullshit every time they demonized the deal or accused Iran of not cooperating.Even Secretary of State John Kerry took a victory lap around those who doubted the deal would succeed, calling the deal an  ambitious set of promises  that Iran is keeping, which makes the entire world safer. Iran has undertaken significant steps that many, and I do mean many, people doubted would ever come to pass. And that should be recognized, even though the full measure of this achievement can only be realized by assuring continued full compliance in the coming years. Today marks the moment that the Iran nuclear agreement transitions from an ambitious set of promises on paper to measurable action in progress. Today, as a result of the actions taken since last July, the United States, our friends and allies in the Middle East, and the entire world are safer because the threat of the nuclear weapon has been reduced. Clearly, the deal is working and Iran must continue to honor it since other sanctions won t be lifted for another ten years down the road. For now, however, Iran is working with the world and the world is rewarding them by lifting sanctions.This deal will go down in history as one of the greatest achievements of President Obama s time in office, and will go down as a humiliating defeat for Republicans. The GOP hoped to sabotage the deal in preference of war with Iran that would cost thousands of lives and add even more to our national debt. It s likely they are furious that they failed so badly, but they should really be embarrassed that they stood in the way of history and the diplomatic negotiations that brought the deal to fruition. They acted like little toddlers who didn t get their way while the Iranians and President Obama were the adults in the room. And the results make it absolutely clear that Republicans do not have what it takes to lead or make American foreign policy.Featured Image: Tumblr",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bigoted GOPer Calls Obama ‘The Most Racially-Divisive President’ Since The Civil War (AUDIO),"Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL)   a congressman who at one time cracked jokes about shooting undocumented immigrants   has recently called President Barack Obama out for being  the most racially-divisive president  America s had since slavery.Brooks, who happens to be the chairman of GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz s Alabama leadership team, made these comments during a radio interview on the Dale Jackson Show on Thursday. Commenting on the president s State of the Union speech, the Alabama Republican said, There probably has not been a more racially-divisive, economically divisive, president in the White House since we had presidents who supported slavery. Host Dale Jackson pressed Brooks to clarify what exactly he meant   considering that Obama is the nation s first black president   and Brooks  explanation threw Obama a bone for not being the absolute worst president in the entire history of the United States   just within the last 150 years: We did have presidents in the first 80 to 100 years of our country that supported slavery. You cannot say Barack Obama was worse than them. But he s probably the worst one since the Civil War and the passages of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. You can listen to the recording of the show below: Later in the show, Jackson commented on how much racial tensions have become a focal point in the political arena, and Brooks accused Obama and Democrats of using race and sex to divide Americans  to a level of perfection not heretofore seen. In true GOP fashion, Brooks chose not to give specific reasons why Obama was  racially divisive    but his Civil War comment means that he s forgotten quite a bit about history, and how racist some of America s presidents from the last 150 years were. To say that Obama is more racially divisive than post-Civil War presidents such as Andrew Jackson, Rutherford Hayes, Woodrow Wilson and even George W. Bush is absolutely ridiculous.Brooks should know a bit about being racially divisive himself   he s made several racist statements in the past. For example, there was that time he said Syrian refugees wanted a  paid vacation,  spread lies about Obama s childhood past in Indonesia, blamed a measles outbreak on  illegal aliens,  and stated that Obama s immigration policy was based on  skin pigmentation.

 Here’s What Happened When Black Protesters Did What The Bundy Terrorists Are Doing (VIDEO),"When the Bundy Moron Militia decided to illegally occupy the Malheur Federal Wildlife Reserve in Oregon, one of the things some people wondered about was what the government s response would have been had the perpetrators been black. As it turns out, there is a precedent for that very situation if you go back in time to 1979.The nitwits in Oregon are where they are under very different circumstances. They re taking a stand in a place where nobody wants them against an oppression that doesn t exist. In 1979, a group of 40 African-Americans took a stand at a wildlife refuge in Georgia under very different circumstances.In 1942, the federal government took a tract of land given by eminent domain to freed slaves in Georgia after the Civil War by a wealthy plantation owner. They came with bulldozers and destroyed churches, schools, factories and homes, paying black residents and landowners far less than whites were paid, giving them three weeks to leave.The town was called Harris Neck, and while it served as a military base during the war, it was never returned to its rightful owners; it was instead turned into a wildlife refuge. in 1979, the 40 protesters, descendents of families ousted nearly 40 years earlier, staged a protest at the property. It was almost like the protest the Bundy a**holes are engaged in, with a few notable differences.They showed up with backpacks and tents. They didn t destroy any property or break into any buildings. They were unarmed. Their protest was actually about something that affected them, not a desperate cry for social media attention. And last but certainly not least, they were black.The government responded a bit differently than they have to the Bundy debacle. They didn t leave them alone with free utilities to enjoy the comfort of a taxpayer-funded rebellion; they went to court and got an order to remove them   within 24 hours of their arrival. All but four of the protesters left when served with the court order. The government moved in and removed them by force.The Bundy terrorists are armed and have broken law after law, and still the feds haven t so much as cut their power. The circumstances are certainly very different, but still It doesn t seem very fair, does it?Here s a video of the struggle over Harris Neck, which is still going on today:Featured image via sott.net",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: The Damning Video That Will Utterly Destroy Donald Trump (VIDEO),"For months now, Donald Trump has been leading the polls for the republican party s presidential nomination. His devoted followers hang on his every word, while he promises to do impossible things, like build a wall across the Mexican border and ban Muslims from entering the United States.Is Trump taking these voters for a ride?This twelve-minute video compilation, published by the non-profit foundation One World Voice, gives an interesting overview of Trump s many changing faces and contradictory political positions.The video includes clips of Trump praising Bill and Hillary Clinton, stating his pro-choice beliefs, supporting partial birth abortion, praising the Chinese, even giving democrats credit for creating a better economy than republicans have ever been able to create.After more than twelve minutes of video evidence that seems to contradict many of Donald Trump s recent statements on the campaign trail, the video s creators ask: Still think Trump is a true conservative?

He s been sued for fraud over everything from bogus real estate deals to his sham school, formerly known as Donald Trump University.It s likely Trump doesn t mean anything he says. Over the past several months what s become obvious is that he will say anything that is likely to get him publicity or attention, no matter how disgusting it is.Like Ben Carson s campaign, Donald Trump s bid for president is just another way to gain publicity and boost his bank own account.As Addicting Info reported here, Carson s campaign has been exposed as nothing more than a publicity stunt, designed to boost his book sales and increase the size of his own bank account. His staff began dropping like flies on New Year s Day, with more and more resignations rolling in all the time.Trump s campaign is not much different than Carson s. Donald Trump has been a money-grubbing attention whore for decades. A presidential bid is no doubt just a way to get his face on TV and his name in the press, all while bilking his devoted followers out of millions and millions of dollars.*Featured image credit: video screen capture One World Voice via Facebook ",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Obama Just Declared The Flint Water Crisis A Federal Emergency, Here’s What That Means For Flint","On Saturday, President Obama officially declared that the Flint water crisis is now a federal emergency. The President s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in Genesee County,  reads a statement from FEMA.Just two days ago, Michigan s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, requested that President Obama declare the Flint water crisis a federal emergency.In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster.There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water. One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system.The statement from FEMA goes on to say that: Emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. This emergency assistance is to provide water, water filters, water filter cartridges, water test kits, and other necessary related items for a period of no more than 90 days. This is great news for the city of Flint. The people of Flint are almost completely reliant on bottled water and emergency water stations. The National Guard and other governmental bodies, along with grassroots community groups, have been tasked with providing the residents of Flint those emergency water supplies. Now, they will receive funding and coordination from FEMA, which should alleviate some of the burden.Featured Image Credit:By The White House [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Why GOP Presidential Candidates Are Angry Iran Released Hostages,"The release of Americans being held prisoner in Iran comes as welcome news to most patriotic citizens, happy to see these people come home. Except for the Republican presidential candidates.The top tier of men seeking the GOP presidential nomination released messages about the hostage release on Saturday, but almost to a man they had to be mealy-mouthed in their missives, upset that once again under President Obama, an international situation has been defused and resolved without the world going to war and hundreds or thousands of people being killed.Donald Trump, the current front runner: Iran is  getting seven people, so essentially they get $150b plus seven, and we get four,  adding,  I m happy they re coming back, but I will tell you it s a disgrace they ve been there so long. Ted Cruz released a tweet:  Praise God! Surely bad parts of Obama s latest deal, but prayers of thanksgiving that Pastor Saeed is coming home Chris Christie: The prisoners  should have been released without condition, but you know, the Iranians have treated this president with disrespect for years and he continues to take it. Marco Rubio: Iran takes  people hostage in order to gain concessions and  the fact that they can get away with it with this administration I think has created an incentive for more governments to do this around the world. Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian is going to be home with his family, as will former Marine Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari and Matthew Trevithick. So will the Navy sailors who were detained by the Iranian government. Nobody has died. We didn t have to go to war or fire rockets. At the same time we have negotiated a deal   now underway   that will prevent Iran from becoming a dangerous nuclear state.All of these developments have come under the leadership of Barack Obama, who defeated the Republican candidate in 2008 who promised to simply  bomb Iran.  America chose a different path and it has worked out.And that is driving Republicans crazy.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The President Is Doing Something Amazing For Working Class Americans Who Lose Their Jobs (VIDEO),"The president s Saturday morning address is chock-full of good news for working class Americans. Unemployment is at the lowest it s been since before Bush tanked the economy. With 70 straight months of job growth, confidence that the American jobs market will reach full employment is high. As President Obama points out, however, it s never enough to stand on your laurels.One of the major problems with the recovery has been that when companies started hiring again, they hired at lower wages. It may have been out of fear that thew worst may still be ahead or it could be out of a need to recoup the losses they experienced from 8 years of Bush policies. Regardless, the working class American is the one who pays the price. Most of corporate America operates on bottom line numbers, not whether or not their employees can afford to eat. Passing on the losses to those who work their butts off to rebuild their companies has become standard operating procedure.The President has vowed to change that in his final year in office, starting with those who need it most. He s initiating a plan of not just improved unemployment insurance and job training for those who still can t find a job, but wage insurance for those people making under $50K per year who are re-hired for a job at a lower wage. The plan would cover up to $10K in wage replacement over two years to struggling families making less now for the same job they were doing before they were let go.The president says in his address: If a hardworking American loses her job, regardless of what state she lives in, we should make sure she can get unemployment insurance and some help to retrain for her next job. It s a way to give families some stability and encourage folks to rejoin the workforce   because we shouldn t just be talking about unemployment; we should be talking about reemployment, Moving the country forward has been the goal of this administration from day one. It used to be that we could be sure that Republicans would block whatever the president tried to do, causing him to move on to the next thing, but lately he s been taking matters into his own hands, not giving a sh*t what the Republicans think or want.That s the way we like it, Mr. President. Keep up the good work.Watch President Obama s full address below:Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Seems SUPER Bummed They’re Forced To Report Iran Released Prisoners (VIDEO),"If there s one thing that conservatives and Fox News want more than anything, it s for President Obama and his administration to fail. This has been their narrative since he took office, and they d love for him to follow through with what they ve been saying. Unfortunately for them, that s just not the case. The economy has recovered, more people have health insurance, Osama bin Laden was killed, marriage equality is the law of the land, credit card companies are better kept in check, and a deal for a nuclear-free Iran was reached on top of countless other achievements.On the latest edition of Traitor TV, Fox News seems rather upset that Obama and his administration are actually getting the job done. Five prisoners have just been released from Iran, four as part of a negotiation. One of the prisoners released is Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian who was held for more than 500 days in Iranian captivity. According to CNN: The release was arranged as part of a prisoner swap involving seven Iranians held by the United States on sanctions charges, the officials confirmed. The deal comes after more than a year of secret negotiations. This is a huge development, and also goes directly against the narrative Republicans have been touting during debates, and Fox News has been delivering for years. They ve insisted that President Obama is going to get us into war with Iran, but more and more evidence to the contrary keeps making itself known.And because they re technically a news media outlet, and not officially the media branch of the Republican party, Fox News  Fox & Friends had to report these latest negotiated releases with Iran. However, by the looks on their faces, they don t seem thrilled to deliver the good news. After all, they ve just been proven to be the liars that they are, yet again.

 ‘WHO’S SPYING ON US?’: Bundy Militia FLIPS Over ‘Hidden’ Cameras In Plain View (VIDEO),"The armed militants occupying federal property in Oregon still haven t been arrested   but they are absolutely continuing to do damage. Unsatisfied with tearing down fences and building roads, disrupting the delicate ecosystem, Y all Qaeda is on a hunt for something even more dangerous to humanity than a tyrannical bird sanctuary: cameras.The pretend militia chose perhaps the only person whose hands aren t covered with some of the 55 gallons of lube a good samaritan sent them to climb a ladder and investigate the creepy science box.The box itself, which has a sticker reading  SCADA CIRCUIT 10  on the outside, doesn t try to hide what it is.  SCADA  stands for   supervisory control and data acquisition,  as a simple Google search can tell you, but these folks apparently lack the computer expertise needed to do more than visit World Net Daily s website. There s also a blinking red light, an antenna, and a  WiFi in use  sticker.  In other words, it is very clearly a not-so-hidden camera.While most would expect cameras to cover a federal wildlife preserve, the Armed and Stupid were completely taken aback by this development. The  militiaman  up the pole struggled to open the housing, so he solved the problem in the traditional Bundy way   by hitting it with something. What s that look like to you,  he yelled to his posse.  This is United States federal government surveillance. Welcome to America. I m tellin  you! Who s spying on us?  a woman yelled, as though the cameras were in place simply to keep an eye on them. Your federal government,  Utility Pole Guy replied.  Wake up people. Ammon Bundy, a product of generations and generations of inbreeding, shared his thoughts on the matter: This tells me that, uh, the government wants to be oppressive. They gotta watch us, control us, and use these things to do that with. This is not what it means to be free. A free people does not need to be watched. A free people needs to be left alone. Wake up America,  Bundy said.  Let s get our freedom back,  adding that the cameras are a  sophisticated piece of equipment    though to be fair, a spoon is a sophisticated piece of equipment to Bundy.The Bundy terrorists then dismantled the cameras because they re  sick of being spied on  as they illegally occupy property that is nowhere close to theirs. Then, of course, they were off to hunt for more signs of government oppression.The footage of the Bundy idiots discovering that cameras exist is downright hilarious. Of course, there s always the possibility that the cameras are not government cameras at all.  There s also the possibility that the cameras belong to the electric company, since they seem to be pointed directly at a substation located near the property,  Winning Democrats  Charles Topher notes.  Wouldn t that be a hoot.

 Bernie Sanders Releases Scathing Statement On Rick Snyder Over The Flint Water Crisis,"On Saturday, Bernie Sanders released a much-anticipated statement on Michigan s governor Rick Snyder and the Flint water crisis. In the statement, Sanders calls for Snyder to resign. There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint s water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign,  Sanders said in a press release.In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster. There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water.One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. There has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one. When evidence was shown that Flint s water had become contaminated, Snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act. That s why Snyder is currently being investigated by the EPA.Just before the new year, Snyder released an official apology to the people of Flint and Michigan. Considering people are so angry at Snyder, that they are calling for his arrest, the apology has been almost universally lambasted. I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this happened. And I want all Michigan citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure,  Snyder said in the apology.Sanders, like so many others was critical of that apology. Because of the conduct by Gov. Snyder s administration and his refusal to take responsibility, families will suffer from lead poisoning for the rest of their lives. Children in Flint will be plagued with brain damage and other health problems. The people of Flint deserve more than an apology,  Sanders said.Sanders is absolutely right, Snyder should resign. It is the only move he could make that would leave him with a scrape of dignity. Every moment that Snyder continues to stay in office, is a slap in the face to residents of Flint and the rest of Michigan. Though, I am sure Snyder won t resign.Featured Image Credit: Gage Skidmore via Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0)",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Humiliates GOP As Iran Releases WaPo Reporter Before Nuclear Deal Goes Into Effect,"Republicans have once again been made to look like the fools they are as Iran releases the Washington Post reporter they attempted to use as a bargaining chip in an effort to sabotage President Obama s nuclear deal.President Obama must have been laughing hysterically this morning after news broke of Iran finally releasing Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and several others, including pastor Saeed Abedini and former marine Amir Hekmati, from their imprisonment in exchange for the release of Iranians who were imprisoned by the United States for violating sanctions.The release of these Iranian-Americans comes just before the nuclear deal goes into effect as the United States government prepares to lift economic sanctions that have been crippling Iran over the years.As you ll recall, Republicans shamelessly attempted to tie any deal with Iran to the immediate release of Rezaian and the others, demanding that President Obama make it a condition during the crucial negotiations. Marco Rubio even penned a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry in March 2015 with the same demands. It is unacceptable that as the United States engages with Iran, human rights violations at the hands of Iranian officials go unchecked and Americans languish in Iranian jail cells,  Rubio wrote. We urge you to discuss these imprisoned Americans and demand their unconditional release as you engage in discussion with Iranian officials.The Iranian government  is unjustly punishing Mr. Rezaian, Pastor Abedini, and Mr. Hekmati  Once again, Iran s government is showing they will spare no means to stifle dissent and use innocent Americans as political pawns. The letter was signed by 19 Republican senators, including Tom Cotton, who would go on to pen a letter of his own to Iran, warning them that Republicans would refuse to honor the deal if they gained control of the White House in 2016. 47 Republican senators would sign that treasonous letter and the incident has been seen as a major international embarrassment ever since.But the Obama administration refused to bow to such demands, insisting that making unrelated demands would endanger the opportunity to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and could hinder efforts to secure their release.And in the end, President Obama has once again been proven right. Not only did he successfully negotiate an end to Iran s nuclear program, which the Iranians turned over earlier this month, he has now secured the release of Rezaian, Abedini, and Hekmati all through the use of diplomacy without putting either effort at risk by tying them together. And he did it despite constant Republican efforts to sabotage him.According to The Guardian:Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, said the release of the prisoners was  a triumph of diplomacy that should be universally commended.  Now, the freed Americans can be reunited with their families and friends after an extraordinarily trying time for everyone involved. We hope that they find solace in their freedom from the turmoil that they endured. Parsi said their release was long overdue but that it was unlikely to have happened if US-Iran diplomatic relations hadn t improved as a result of the nuclear agreement. The US and Iran should deepen their engagement on the serious issues that continue to separate the two countries so that further pragmatic solutions can be reached. This is a humiliating defeat for Republicans and proves without a shadow of a doubt that the GOP is unfit to handle American foreign policy.Featured Image: Pete Souza",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Oregon Terrorist: Locals Want Us Gone, But We’re Staying Because U.S. Is A Republic (VIDEO)","The Bundy militia has now been making a nuisance of itself and terrorizing Harney County, Oregon with its armed occupation of Malheur Wildlife Refuge for two weeks now. It s been frustrating to sane people nationwide, but especially to the area s residents, whose lives have been disrupted by this nonsense. Unfortunately, though, it has been confirmed that these people have no intention of going anywhere. In fact, one of the militants, LaVoy Finicum, says they have a right to be there, even if the local residents want them to leave.Finicum said to the press that he knows that the people who actually live in the area want the militia to get out of dodge, and a third says we like what you re doing but not liking your method, appreciate it but we want you to go, and about a third saying don t go, stay.  However, the United States is a republic, so they aren t going anywhere. He went on to say: Let s talk about a republic. It s the right of an individual that we re looking at, not the right of the collective. You know if there is just one rancher that is saying please help me, please don t go, what about him? What about the Hammonds? What about that family that is in prison? Let them be released,  he said.  It is about the one family right now. Nevermind the fact that the Hammonds want absolutely nothing to do with this band of nutcases, and their attorney has said that these idiots do not speak for them. That matters not to these yahoos, though. This isn t about the Hammonds, this is about men wanting to play army and who are committing treason while fulfilling that fantasy. Arrest them all, now.Watch the video of Finicum s remarks below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oregon Congressman Rips Justice Department For Not Arresting And Prosecuting Bundy Militants (VIDEO),"Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio took federal authorities to the woodshed on the House floor over their failure to do their job and arrest the armed terrorists led by Ammon Bundy.As you probably already know, Bundy and his band of right-wing militants illegally seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge two weeks ago. Ever since then, they ve destroyed government property, snooped through government files, struck fear into the hearts of the local citizens, and have broken several laws in the process. But law enforcement has done very little to remove the armed occupation, which is a stark contrast to the way law enforcement treats unarmed black men in this country.And DeFazio wants that to change right now. The heat and the lights are on at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, illegally occupied by ultra-rightwing anti-government extremists, but you gotta wonder if the lights are on or is anybody home down there at the Justice Department,  DeFazio said.DeFazio then angrily demanded that federal authorities take down the militants and end the standoff so that people can move on with their lives. Hello! I don t think there s anybody there. I believe that this illegal occupation, this destruction of federal property was directly emboldened by the fact that their father of the two leaders, Cliven Bundy, stood down the government two years ago when he owed a million dollars   other ranchers paid their grazing fees, he refuses to do it. And he was grazing in areas that were prohibited. And he stood down the government at the point of a gun, and he s still grazing and nobody, nobody at the Justice Department has seen fit to raise a finger against him.He celebrated the anniversary of the takeover and said  this is how it s done.  And now his sons are replicating that in my state of Oregon, where we abide by the laws. Yeah, we disagree over a lot of federal policies, but we abide by the laws.It s time for the Justice Department to take some action. Wake up down there! Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, so far, the only militants who have been arrested were caught driving a federal vehicle to town in search of snacks. Meanwhile, the rest of the militants have been allowed to come and go as they please and they ve even been allowed to destroy federal fence lines and access government computers. Furthermore, the militants broke the law by carrying firearms on federal property and their seizure of a government building is an act of domestic terrorism that should not be tolerated.If this were a group of African-Americans or Muslims, law enforcement would have already shot up the place and killed every one of them by now. But because these gunmen are white rednecks, authorities are treating them with kid gloves, which perfectly demonstrates that law enforcement truly has different rules for different people. These militants are costing taxpayers millions of dollars, and they are interrupting the daily lives of citizens who do not want them there. Their actions are illegal and they should be treated like any other terrorist. It s time for law enforcement to do the job they are paid to do or they should resign in disgrace so that we can hire people who will actually do it.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FINALLY: Two Members Of Bundy Militia Arrested,"For the last two weeks, armed domestic terrorists have been wreaking havoc on an Oregon town in a treasonous occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. They have been able to come and go freely, and no move by law enforcement, local or federal, was made to round up and arrest these criminals. That is, until Friday.Two of the militiamen made the mistake of using federal vehicles to go grocery shopping. That s what got them arrested, but not the occupation itself.first arrest made of #bundymilitia   two fed vehicles from compound were driven to Safeway. vehicles now impounded pic.twitter.com/RM94eKj2Uh  John Sepulvado (@JohnLGC) January 15, 2016This is the problem with the whole situation: What these people are doing is absolutely illegal, and they should most definitely be jailed for it. Instead, the authorities have let them play pretend Army for the last two weeks unimpeded. Instead of arresting them right away, instead they waited until they stole cars and charged them with that crime. And even then, it s only two members, when there are more than a hundred others there as well.This insurrection has cost the taxpayers an insane amount of money as well, as federal workers have been put on paid leave until the situation is resolved. The situation isn t any closer to any sort of peaceful resolution than it has been since its inception though; in fact, if anything, it is getting worse. Ammon Bundy and his hillbilly partners in crime are actually planning to completely ignore the government (like they aren t already), and instead set up their own laws on the occupied land. They also reportedly have plans to arrest the Harney County Sheriff. It has even been suggested that they should take on the FBI station that is keeping tabs on them.All of these fools need to be in jail. NOW. This has gone on long enough. They have disrupted the lives of every citizen in the area on an absolutely ridiculous level at this point, and the whole thing should have ended long ago.Featured image via YouTube screen capture",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Concerned Adult Literally Pays Young Black Kids To Play Inside So Cops Don’t Shoot Them (VIDEO),"An unknown man saw some children playing on the side of a street with toy guns. This normally would be no big deal. It happens all across the nation more times than can be counted every day. However, in this case, the kids and the person talking to them were people of color. That really does change everything.The man approached the kids and pleaded with them to get off the streets and take their toy guns indoors to play with them. He was so concerned that he even offered them money to do it. The reason he was so worried is because he was afraid that the police would come by and shoot them. The man didn t seem to be trying to frighten the children, but when they heard what could happen the look on their faces said it all.Watch the look on the kids  faces when they hear what could happen to them below:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Man Pays Kids To Play With Toy Guns InsideThis is heartbreaking.Posted by The Peak on Wednesday, January 13, 2016What kind of statement does that make about our society? These are two kids who have no malicious intent and were not doing anything wrong, and they could have ended up dead due to aggressive police. White kids run around with toy guns constantly in America. Yes, it is possible that a cop might arrest or shoot a white kid with a toy gun, but we know that a cop will arrest or shoot a black kid with a toy gun. Tamir Rice is a perfect example of the  kill first, ask questions later  attitude that police have adopted towards people of color. Tamir was only 12 years old, but police shot him dead in under 5 seconds of arriving on the scene where he was playing with a toy gun. They didn t even pause to evaluate the situation. It is so bad that just walking down the street is enough to be shot 16 times if you are not white, in the case of LaQuan McDonald.It s great if this adult s intervention helped these kids on this day to keep them safe, but this is not the state in which we should make them have to live. Instead of them being required to lives in a way to be more compatible with raging, predator cops, how about we force our police to remember what protect and serve actually means.featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Karma’s Latest Victim: Birthers Drag Ted Cruz To Court To Challenge His Eligibility For Presidency,"They say karma s a bi*ch, and it continues to be for the Republicans. First, it was Rubio who was dragged off to court by the birthers who claim that he s not eligible to be president. Now, birthers have gone after Ted Cruz in Texas.A Texas attorney has filed suit in federal district court saying that Cruz can t be president because he s not a  natural born citizen  of the United States. Cruz was born in Canada. One of the few requirements to become president in the U.S. Constitution is to be a  natural born citizen  of the United States. Attorney Newton B. Schwartz, Sr.. in a 28 page complaint, is demanding that the U.S. Supreme Court address the issue since  natural born  has never been defined. Schwartz said:  This 229-year question has never been pled, presented to or finally decided by or resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. Only the U.S. Supreme Court can finally decide, determine judicially and settle this issue now. Cruz, who ironically is an anti-immigration hawk, believes there is no issue. During Thursday s debate, Cruz went on the defensive against Trump, who s been at the forefront of questioning Cruz s eligibility. Cruz said:  There s nothing to this birther issue. Since September, the Constitution hasn t changed. But the poll numbers have. I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law are really clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen abroad is a natural born citizen. Not so simple says respected constitutional lawyer Mary Brigid McManamon at Widener University s Delaware Law School: The Constitution provides that  No person except a natural born Citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President.  The concept of  natural born  comes from common law, and it is that law the Supreme Court has said we must turn to for the concept s definition. On this subject, common law is clear and unambiguous. The 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone, the preeminent authority on it, declared natural-born citizens are  such as are born within the dominions of the crown of England  while aliens are  such as are born out of it.  The key to this division is the assumption of allegiance to one s country of birth. The Americans who drafted the Constitution adopted this principle for the United States. James Madison, known as the  father of the Constitution,  stated,  It is an established maxim that birth is a criterion of allegiance. . . . [And] place is the most certain criterion; it is what applies in the United States.' Based on this interpretation, Cruz is disqualified. The irony in all this is that Cruz supports denying citizenship to children born in the United States, but whose parents are not US citizens.Is it karma that the Republicans are now reeling from the prospect of two of their leading candidates being ineligible for the presidency?  Throughout President Obama s seven years in the White House, many Republicans have floated the idea that he was not born in the United States. In fact, they propagated the idea so much that 53% of Republicans believe this nonsense today.The birther movement, which consists of many Republicans, has attacked and tried to discredit the president for years. Now, that same movement is after the very same institution, the Republican Party, that propagated it in the first place.Featured image via Nation of Change",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Released Emails Show Carly Fiorina Illegally Working With Her Super PAC,"Carly Fiorina is going to be in a world of hurt for this one. Hillary Clinton s email  scandal  or whatever you want to call it, doesn t even come close to what Carly Fiorina and her super PAC have been doing.The International Business Times reported on Friday that they have email evidence proving that Carly for America (Fiorina s super PAC), has been unlawfully coordinating with campaign stops where Carly has been speaking. As everyone knows, it is a direct violation of FEC laws for super PACS to coordinate with campaigns for any reason. Yet, that doesn t appear to have prevented Carly or her super PAC from trying to work around that law.Up until this point, candidates have tried various measures to exploit loopholes in the law, the most popular one being waiting to announce their presidential runs formally in order to finance their campaigns early on. Carly has done this and taken it to the extreme. Her super PAC now handles all the functions at her campaign stops that a campaign normally would. It s practically unheard of. This by itself isn t a violation, though. The New York Times even said Carly s campaign s strategy of posting her schedule online to alert her super PAC of where she ll be giving speeches so that her super PAC can show up and set up shop, has been a brilliant a run around of the law. That way, they can claim they haven t  coordinated.  They can just show up and claim to be independent.New email evidence shows this not to be true. In fact, if anything, Carly s super PAC has even helped organize the events. The International Business Times reviewed a handful of emails between employees at Winthrop University in South Carolina (where Carly had a September event), staff for the Fiorina campaign, and Carly for America. They found that when an employee had trouble getting in touch with Fiorina about correcting details on an Eventbrite website for the event, that employee then decided to reach out directly to Taylor Manson, a super PAC employee, who coincidentally, was also listed as a person of contact on the Eventbrite page. The lines of campaign coordinating are being blurred more and more. I have a few questions about the location. What is the address of the building? Where should people park? Is there handicap parking available? Do y all plan on putting something out to your students to let them know she ll be there? It didn t take long for Manson to receive an advance walkthrough of the event location. While some might claim that it was the university that acted inappropriately, Larry Noble, a former FEC counsel who works for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, says this is evidence that proves that the law has been broken. It s known as an  in-kind contribution,  and super PACs are prohibited from doing so. This fits the larger narrative that the super PAC is basically running the campaign s events. The whole thing frankly makes a mockery of the law. When the super PAC gets there, they hand out flyers, collect voter information, everything campaigns are known for. And   wealthy donors can finance all of it since they can make unlimited contributions to a super PAC but only a few thousand dollars directly to a candidate.That s not the only instance though that will plague Carly s campaign going forward. An event at George Tech last month also appears to be entirely organized by her super PAC, as well, according to emails provided to IBT by the University.Reps for Carly for America have repeatedly stated in the past that the group hasn t coordinated with Fiorina s campaign, but this new information shows otherwise. At the very least, a formal investigation needs to be launched to verify these new allegations. It should be interesting to watch how the Republican party responds to an email scandal that affects their own party, especially when campaign finance laws are being broken.

 ‘Shoot Hillary In The F*ckin Head’: Conservatives Freak Out Over Benghazi Movie,"The new movie about the attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, is stirring up conservatives and their now legendary hatred of Hillary Clinton.Gawker writer Christopher Hooks went to the premiere of Michael Bay s 13 Hours at the Dallas Cowboys stadium in Arlington, Texas. After interviewing some of the attendees, he came back with a report on the intense Clinton hate that the movie had activated. It wasn t pretty.Certainly, the people who d come to the stadium because they didn t like Clinton felt fired up after seeing it.  She s a piece of shit,  said one man who declined to give his name and didn t make eye contact.  But I already knew she s a piece of shit. I hope it defeats Hillary,  said another, Don Lochran.  They covered the whole thing up.  It was Lochran who then suggested bombing them all.Others were less sanguine.  Oh yeah. I d shoot Hillary Clinton in the fuckin  head. I don t like the bitch at all,  said Len Toomey, who identified himself as a veteran of Desert Storm and Somalia. He d seen the movie with some VFW friends.  Choke her. She should be in the pisser and I should be pissin  on her every night. Whether you back Clinton or not, the abject misogyny and hate that base conservatives have for her is grotesque to behold. About the only thing rivaling it in intensity is their hatred for President Obama.To many factions of the right   and those are often the same people yelling the loudest for Donald Trump s white power presidential campaign   the former Secretary of State and First Lady is the absolute devil incarnate.In this go-around they erroneously believe she and the President left men to die in Benghazi, when in fact real life is NOT like an action movie and forces were constrained by the reality of time and space in how they could respond. Even so, they did eventually get on the scene, something conservatives leave out of their Benghazi storytelling.13 Hours is unlikely to change anyone s minds pro or con with Clinton, but it at least is serving a purpose in once again putting on display just how hateful the right can be without even trying that hard.Featured image via Paramount Pictures",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Did Hillary Clinton Seriously Criticize Bernie Sanders’ Grandchildren? (VIDEO),"The short answer? I don t think so, but it s possible.The other day on Morning Joe, the Democratic presidential frontrunner said the following during a phone-in interview with the MSNBC morning show hosts: I guess at the end of the day, for me   you know, people talk about their extraordinary grandchildren, but I actually have one   and we re going to do everything we can to give her opportunities. And we re going to do everything we can to give her opportunities. But it s not enough.And I think too many people are forgetting what are some of the biggest determinants as to what happens to your children and grandchildren. The first being what kind of country we are and whether we re still providing the opportunities to realize your promise and potential and what kind of world s going to be out there waiting.And I feel passionately that just because we had it in the past, doesn t mean we re going to keep it in the future. You shouldn t have to be the granddaughter of a former president to have your American Dream realized. I think every kid should have a chance to live up to her god-given potential. A debate has erupted online in which Bernie Sanders supporters are suggesting that Clinton s remarks about how she actually has a grandchild is a not-so-subtle jab at the fact that Sanders has seven grandchildren through his current wife of 27 years, Jane O Meara Sanders, whose three children were from her previous marriage.To be clear, Clinton launched into a long answer to a question from Mika Brzezinski that began with something about the contrast between her and the other Democratic  candidates  plural. But there was a long section preceding her grandchildren remarks about what she intends to do and what her qualifications are. Then the thing about the grandkids. So, there wasn t an explicitly Sanders-oriented context for her remarks.But if this was, in fact, a cut at Sanders, it s confounding as to why she would make such an esoteric remark. What does she gain with Democratic voters by implying that her grandchild is legitimate, while Sanders  grandchildren somehow aren t? I mean, how many primary voters know that much about Sanders  family? I ve been following Sanders  career for ten years now, and I had no idea he was even married until recently much less that he had three step-kids and seven step-grandchildren. I also didn t know until today that three of his grandkids were adopted from China.One blogger, Shane Ryan, observed that Sanders, during his stump speeches, often refers to his grandkids as  extraordinary.  I tried to confirm this, but didn t turn up any transcripts or pullquotes to verify it. So, chances are   if true   very, very, very few people know that Sanders uses the word  extraordinary  to describe his grandkids, making Clinton s jab   if intentional   even more obscure.Is Clinton capable of lashing out when backed into a corner? Sure. Is it possible she intended to randomly criticize Sanders  grandkids via some sort of twisted political calculation? Absolutely. But it d be terrible politics. You don t mention families   much less criticize the origins of an opponent s children. The topic is off limits. By doing so, she d only make herself look like terrible human being.One thing enemies and fans alike can agree upon: she s smart enough and experienced enough to understand blowback. Seriously, what kind of Democratic primary voter would  get  her attack and then vote against Sanders because his seven grandkids aren t biological, while Clinton s grandchild is blood-related? It seems like there s more risk than reward in such a gambit.So  what do you think?[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0iaI3YRCiw] Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Carly Fiorina Lose Her Damn Mind As She Keeps Shouting And Repeating Herself (VIDEO),"One really has to wonder why Carly Fiorina is still running for president. She s a failed CEO, a failed senate candidate, and seemingly just an awful human being. People haven t been drawn to her as a candidate, so much so, in fact, that s she s been booted down to the undercard junior debate, which is basically just a pity party for people who haven t realized no one likes them yet. All the candidates in the junior debate really should realize they, in no way, have a shot at winning, do themselves and the rest of the nation a favor, and drop out.However, there they still are. They re still there saying the stupid things that have made them unpopular in the first place, and clearly showing America why they shouldn t be in any sort of leadership role.During the most recent junior debate, Carly Fiorina decided that she would attack Hillary Clinton s marriage with former President Bill Clinton. She said: Unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband. That s a pretty awful and unnecessary thing to say about another candidate, and just seems like a pathetic, weird attempt at trying to diminish Hillary.Noticing this bizarre statement by Fiorina was MSNBC s Chris Matthews, and he held Fiorina to task asking her to explain herself. Matthews asked Fiorina if she thinks the Clintons have a  real marriage.  And every time Matthews tried to get her to answer, the failed HP head would reply, and awkwardly repeat: They ve been married for a really long time. Then, Fiorina lost her damn mind and launched a verbal assault on the MSNBC host: There are so many other things we could talk about like the fact that Mrs. Clinton wants to go to the White House   she s qualified for the big house  She should be prosecuted. She has not been prosecuted for things that took a great warrior out of office, David Petraeus So let s talk about that, Chris. Let s talk about how amazing it is that this woman, that cannot be trusted, who should have been prosecuted by now, has just raked in more money than any single candidate. Wow, bitter, party of one.Actually, Carly, if you re going to talk about a woman who has done horrible things in her past, let s talk about all the jobs you shipped overseas. Let s talk about how you took a once thriving company and lead it down the sh*tter. How about that? Let s not hyperbolize and make false accusations against Hillary Clinton, all while throwing some backhanded jab at her marriage. That makes you look no better than the mean girl in Middle School who is pissed she got picked last for dodgeball. Grow up, and while you re at it, drop out. .@CarlyFiorina and @hardball_chris get into a testy exchange over @HillaryClinton. https://t.co/NsOHREczLI  MSNBC (@MSNBC) January 15, 2016 Video/Featured image: Twitter",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" MI Gov. Dick Sends SEVEN National Guardsman To Help 100,000 Flint Residents","Earlier this week, as public outrage and media attention focused on his failed response to the Flint water disaster, Michigan s republican governor announced that he was calling in the National Guard to help deal with the escalating crisis.On January 13, those troops arrived in the city of 100,000 people. All SEVEN of them. Yes, seven. As in one less than eight.Doing the math, Snyder s response equates to one guardsman per 14,285.7 people.The city of Flint is experiencing a crisis of epic proportions, thanks entirely to the Snyder administration. Water poisoned with lead, and water that is potentially contaminated with the Legionella bacteria (which has already caused 87 serious illnesses and ten deaths) is just one aspect of what is happening in Flint.After the governor and his appointed emergency managers switched the city s water supply to the Flint River, they decided not to bother to treat it with standard corrosion control measures.According to researchers from Virginia Tech University, Flint is the only city in the U.S. that did not have these measures in place.As Marc Edwards of the Virginia Tech water study described to Michigan Radio back in October: What we discovered to our shock was that they switched to a new water source that was obviously very corrosive, meaning it would eat up the lead pipe and iron pipe and essentially put the metals into the water, without controlling the corrosion. And this is a horrible idea in a city full of lead plumbing and lead pipe like Flint. He went on to describe the standard practice for changing a water source. Before you switch to a new water source, six months to a year ahead of time, you are supposed to do laboratory experiments to determine the corrosivity of the water, and the chemistry   the pH, the alkalinity, and the phosphate that you need to make sure that the lead stays on the pipes and out of the water. Edwards explains that Flint s new water system had to have a  corrosion control  plan in place, otherwise the result is that you re  doing an uncontrolled human experiment on a city s population. The decision by Rick Snyder s emergency manager to just skip what was apparently viewed as an  unnecessary  corrosion control expense has basically been just that.  An uncontrolled experiment on a city s population. The amount of damage done to the city s infrastructure is just beginning to be realized.This photo from Flint Water Study researchers Ni Zhu and Siddhartha Roy shows the magnitude of the situtuation.Image credit: Flint Water StudyAccording to a new report released today, researchers believe that the damaged and corroded pipes that are transmitting water throughout the city are likely to become a breeding ground for bacteria, such as the Legionella bacteria which causes Legionaire s disease, along with a host of other potential pathogens.Because of the nature of the Legionella bacteria, which is transmitted through tiny droplets of water in the air, Virginia Tech researchers are recommending that vulnerable populations have minimal contact with the water. That includes people who smoke, the elderly, people with diabetes, people who have recently had surgery and others who might be at greater risk of contracting a waterborne respiratory disease.About 100,000 Flint residents are affected by this unmitigated disaster.In response, Governor Snyder put on a big show of  sending in the National Guard.  Now we know that only SEVEN guardsmen were actually dispatched to the city.After being forced to respond to questions regarding the number of guardsmen he sent to the city, the governor s office proclaimed that there could be as many as 30 or 40 National Guardsmen sent to Flint by the end of the week.During his PR conference on Tuesday, Snyder told the people of Michigan  As we work to ensure that all Flint residents have access to clean and safe drinking water, we are providing them with the direct assistance they need in order to stretch our resources further. The Michigan National Guard is trained and ready to assist the citizens of Flint. He neglected to mention that he was sending SEVEN guardsmen.As reported by Fox 2: The Governor s rhetoric is not doing much to quiet the growing fury in Flint. Gov. Rick Snyder called in the National Guard to assist those helping to get bottled water and filters to the people of Flint. Just seven members of the National Guard showed up to help the nearly 100,000 people in Flint. Watch this video on Governor Snyder s pathetic response to the Flint water disaster, via Fox 2.

" President Obama Just Sent The Climate Change Industry Some Very, Very Bad News","On Friday, President Obama gave climate change activists a small, but potentially game changing victory. U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell will temporarily cease giving out permits to new coal mining leases on federal land. This pause will take place while the federal government s coal program is brought under review. It has been about thirty years since major changes were made to the program. How do we manage the program that is consistent with our climate change objective? There is no short answer,  Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said during a news conference.  It is also clear that we need to take into account the science we have now on the environment and climate change. There is no certainty to how long this leasing pause lasts. Reuters reports that it could last as long as three years. This is not good news to the coal industry, which has been in substantial decline for the past few years. Due to a combination of regulations, and competition from other fuel sources, such as natural gas and the massive cost decrease in solar, and the hard work of climate activists, big coal has been forced to survive by exporting coal. We have an obligation to current and future generations to ensure the federal coal program delivers a fair return to American taxpayers and takes into account its impacts on climate change,  Jewell said.What does this mean for the climate? According to Climate Central, this is big deal. They report that: About 40 percent of all the coal produced in the U.S. comes from mines on federal public lands, mainly in the West. As of the end of 2014, there were 308 active coal mining leases on more than 464,000 acres of public lands in Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Montana and Colorado, with an additional 10,500 acres in Kentucky, Alabama and West Virginia.Burning coal and other fossil fuels for electricity is the largest single source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change, accounting for about 31 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gases. Now of course, without congressional action, an incoming President could end this pause. But a Republican victory seems unlikely, and the Democratic candidates do not have a lot of love for big coal. Bernie Sanders has pledged to halt all new federal leases for fossil fuel mega projects. Sanders could do this without the need of approval from Congress. A move like that would be a giant victory for the planet and all the people who live in it.Featured Image Credit: By The Official White House Photostream (P060809PS-0350) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rhode Island Official Dresses Middle Aged Man As Little Old Lady For Senior Citizen Photo Op,"A Rhode Island city official has resigned after she was caught dressing up a male middle aged bus driver as a little old lady to  prove  how well her snow shoveling program was helping senior citizens.Apparently unable to find a single real senior citizen to fill out her press conference, director of senior services Sue Stenhouse got a man who worked at a nearby senior home to don a wig, earrings, lipstick, and a dress to stand next to her while she bragged about the program. Let s just say it was not an effective disguise.Almost immediately, reporters began to question the ridiculous situation, but the sheer audacity of the stunt was such that initially no one called out Stenhouse or the  woman.  It was only later that things began to fall apart.When NBC affiliate WJAR-TV reported on the bizarre story, Stenhouse grew angry. I ve been in a meeting all night being a great public servant for the city of Warwick,  Stenhouse said.  Now, I get this (expletive.) And you guys did not reach out to me. And that was a big lie on the news. However, just a few days later she was turning in her resignation letter.There are, of course, a lot of questions that remain unanswered. Why didn t the officials simply ask a resident from the senior home they were standing in front of to join them for the presser? Why did they need an elderly woman to be in the shot in the first place? What was she thinking? And did Stenhouse get the idea from Mrs. Doubtfire or a Chris Farley sketch?It s difficult to fathom why Stenhouse, who by all accounts had a long and promising career in Rhode Island politics ahead of her, would torpedo her chances on something so monumentally silly. A few of her colleagues expressed shock and alleged deceit when asked to comment on the incident.One theory that seems plausible is that Stenhouse s snow removal initiative was struggling thanks to a mild winter. While not her fault, the lack of bad weather meant holding a press conference to brag about snow plowing was going to go down in flames. What followed was a series of desperate decisions worthy of a sit-com. According to witnesses, city officials had snow shipped to the front of the senior center and dumped in the background of the press conference. The bus driver-turned-old woman was just an extension to an already completely fabricated situation. Whats one more lie, and a little lipstick, after all?Featured image via Mashable",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill O’Reilly: I’ll Flee The Country If Sanders Is Elected President (VIDEO),"Fox News blowhard Bill O Reilly really doesn t want the future to give us a President Bernie Sanders. That s no surprise; after all, O Reilly is obviously as far right as Sanders is left. However, O Reilly has taken his fear of another left-winger as president to a whole other level. In fact, he says that if Sanders gets in, he ll move to Ireland.On a recent edition of the O Reilly Factor, the bloviating talking head said that things would be even worse than they are under President Obama, because Sanders would take all of Obama s policies and amp them up. He says that Sanders would  dismantle  current social programs, specifically Obamacare  in the sense that it would be Berniecare and it would be much more than it is now.  That s when he said he ll be leaving the United States if forced to live under such rule. And you know, look, I m fleeing. If Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I m fleeing. I m going to Ireland. And they already know it. I shouldn t say it publicly because that will get Sanders more votes. But I m not going to pay 90 percent of my income to that guy. I m sorry. I m not doing it. Well, I got news for ya, Bill-O. Look at the clown car that makes up your side of the aisle. It s gonna be either Bernie or Hillary for the next eight years, if the good people of this nation have any sense at all. So, you better be packing your bags and getting your affairs in order.

 The Head Of The NRA Just Issued The Dumbest Challenge Ever To President Obama (VIDEO),"Wayne LaPierre has a way about him that defines  a**hole.  maybe it s the condescending look his beady little eyes get from behind those frameless glasses. Maybe it s the tone in his voice as he declares that the tens of thousands of U.S. gun deaths since his tenure began have nothing to do with guns.Or maybe we all remember his impassioned call for more guns in our schools after 20 1st graders were gunned down on one of the coldest days in American history.No matter the reason you may despise Wayne LaPierre, the fact remains the he is despicable. He s a disgusting human being whose moral code has been lost to the cold hard cash of the gun manufacturers who want as many guns as possible in the hands of whoever has the money to buy one.Understanding all of that, this video will enrage you. LaPierre has decided to challenge President Obama to a one-on-one gun control debate. His terms are that the debate be one hour with a moderator, no pre-screened questions and no long answers.It s difficult for the ammosexual mind to come up with much other than  criminals won t follow laws,  so the last stipulation isn t really that surprising. He may want to consult with Taya Kyle before he assumes that the president isn t willing to answer tough questions from the opposition.Rather than simply issue the challenge, LaPierre attached it to 8 minutes of propaganda attacking not only the president s stance on gun control but also the affordable care act and yes, you guessed it Benghazi. He calls the president a tyrant who ignores the constitution just before he calls on him to mobilize a national force to  turn Chicago upside down  in search of felons and criminals with guns.Because sending the National Guard to black communities to illegally search the residents and their homes without warrants or probable cause is just fine, but asking  law-abiding  white folks to fill out a form and wait ten minutes is an egregious act of tyranny.The entire video is nothing but a propaganda piece aimed at keeping the far-right extremists mobilized and ready to do things like occupy the Oregon wilderness in the name of  Murica or shoot up a Planned Parenthoood office in the name of life. In the very least he wants the status quo conservative argument of fear for your guns to weigh on the minds of every idiot who believes their firearm is the most important thing in their lives.You can watch the ridiculous challenge and the bloviating blowhard who issued it in the video below.

 Mike Huckabee Thinks Poor Americans Benefit From Treating Them Like We ‘Train Dogs’ (VIDEO),"Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee, in predictable conservative fashion, has just said something extremely offensive about people who aren t wealthy white men like him.During Thursday night s GOP undercard debate, Huckabee stated that it was only  common sense  to treat poor people with the same punishment/reward techniques that people use to  train dogs  if we want to improve the economy. Huckabee claimed that because  the tax system punishes them,  the current system made it impossible for Americans to really get ahead. He said: If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket so the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do. It s time for something big. As an alternative, the former governor of Arkansas suggested the  Fair Tax  plan, which would enforce a national flat sales tax of 10 percent. It s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids and train dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And you punish behavior you want less of. That s how I raise kids, it s how I trained our dogs. And folks, it s not that difficult. Even if you remove all offensiveness and privilege from Huckabee s suggestion that poor taxpayers should be treated with the same systems we use to train our pet dogs, Huckabee s 10 percent tax suggestion is still an awful one. Last year, the Tax Policy Center put the theory to the test and determined that Huckabee s proposed alternative would actually be more detrimental and punish the nation s poorest Americans (no surprise there). The Tax Policy Center observed: The problem is that very high-income households spend only a fraction of their income, while low- and middle-income people spend all or most of what they make. A sales tax, by design, exempts a large share of income at the top. If it includes a prebate to protect people at the bottom and doesn t add to the deficit, then it must raise taxes on people in the middle. Here s the debate footage where Huckabee talks about treating poor people like dogs:Huckabee s attitude toward poor people echoes the rest of the GOP s line of thinking. Struggling Americans are nothing to the Republican Party, and are often looked over and cast aside. If you learned anything from last night s Republican presidential debate, it s that the GOP candidates only have certain interests at heart: their own.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bush Once Apologized To China In Order To Free 24 Detained U.S. Soldiers: America ‘Is Very Sorry’,"To hear conservatives, including those in the Republican presidential race, tell it, President Obama made America look weak by talking to Iran in order to get 10 detained U.S. sailors, rather than, say, immediately ordering carpet bombing of Tehran. Some right-wing media outlets were even more despondent. Breitbart, America s preeminent dumping ground of right-wing hysteria, devoted several articles to framing the incident as a humiliation for Obama.However, as much as conservatives would love to have this story be about Obama s weakness, the facts simply do not support that conclusion.For one thing, the entire duration was less than 24 hours. U.S. sailors had a GPS malfunction near the border of Iran. When they floated into that country s sovereign territory, they were picked up by Iranian military ships. By all accounts, they were treated well during their  captivity.  Secretary of State John Kerry worked tirelessly with the Iranian government, who sent them back with their boats the next day. No missiles were launched. No wars were started. No lives were lost.Getting no bloodshed, a perversely disappointed Republican Party were left instead to squabble over the details. At issue was whether Obama  apologized  to Iran for encroaching into their territory. This, Republicans said, was a serious blow to America s reputation. According to these warmongering blowhards, to apologize is to surrender.There are just two problems with this narrative: First, the Obama administration never apologized to Iran. And secondly, back in 2001, George W. Bush absolutely did apologize to another of America s economic foes, China, when he was faced with a similar situation. Nobody thought offering an apology was a sign of America s crumbling power when Bush did so.In April of 2001, 24 US Air Force members were  captured  by the Chinese government after crashing on a Chinese island. It was, without a doubt, a colossal screw up. America had been flying spy planes into China s territory, and one of those spy missions wound up crashing into a Chinese plane, killing the pilot. For 11 days, the U.S. soldiers were held in China while diplomats from both countries scrambled to figure out what to do. But then George W. Bush said he was sorry.The letter delivered today to China s foreign ministry by the US ambassador, Joseph Prueher, said Mr Bush and the secretary of state, Colin Powell, expressed  sincere regret  over the loss of the Chinese plane and the missing pilot, Mr Wang. Please convey to the Chinese people to the family of pilot Wang Wei that we are very sorry for their loss,  said the letter.The document letter appeared to be a complex linguistic compromise.A Chinese-language copy of the letter released by the US embassy did not use the term Chinese officials had insisted on    daoqian , a formal apology that admits blame.Even worse   if you re a writer for Breitbart   Bush went on to apologize for entering Chinese airspace. The same might be expected of Obama when two of America s ships entered Iranian waters.We are very sorry the entering of China s airspace and the landing did not have verbal clearance, but very pleased the crew landed safely. We appreciate China s efforts to see to the well-being of our crew.While the situation was extremely tense at the time, and although the Bush administration was reluctant to say  I m sorry,  they eventually backed down. (Note: The Bush administration would go on to repeatedly insist this apology was not an apology. Take that for what it s worth.) America didn t become the laughingstock of the world. Nobody felt like anyone had lost any respect. Instead, the two sides moved on. The American soldiers got to return home unharmed.As we ve seen time and again, the Republican Party, infuriated that they have no legs to stand on in complaining about Obama, create mountains out of molehills. A diplomatic issue that could have led to a very bad situation for 10 U.S. service members was resolved in less than 24 hours by two governments which strongly dislike each other and conservatives think that s what losing looks like. Are they crazy? No. Just extremely disingenuous.Or as the saying goes: There are lies, damned lies, and the right-wing media. Up is down. Cold is hot. And 10 soldiers getting to come home to their families safely is a  loss.  George W. Bush might want to have a talk with his colleagues.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trevor Noah Notices Something Oddly Familiar About The Flint Water Crisis (VIDEO),"On Friday, The Daily Show did a segment on the Flint Water crisis. During the segment, host Trevor Noah began the segment by offering this bit of advice,  I have a very simple rule in rule If the water s brown than me, I don t drink it. In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster. There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water. One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system.Noah noticed that the problem with Flint s water is so bad, that it reminded him of the ads that charities run, that try to raise money for people in Africa. A hundred dollars a day? Why didn t you say something? I want to call out to all my people in Africa right now watching The Daily Show. Because my friends: for only a hundred dollars a day, we can save a village in America and get these people drinking the water that they so badly need. There has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one. When evidence was shown that Flint s water had become contaminated, Snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act. That s why Snyder is currently being investigated by the EPA.Republican policies have officially destroyed an entire city s water infrastructure, making Flint resemble a third world nation when it comes to infrastructure. For so called  fiscal conservatives  the policies that led to the Flint water crisis are born out of the same values that most Republicans hold dear. Cut spending, at all costs. It doesn t matter if any entire city is poisoned. In their view, a pound of cure is worth more than an ounce of prevention.You can watch the segment below, in full.The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video ArchiveFeatured Image Credit: Screenshot via Comedy Central",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The NY Daily News Has Just LITERALLY Told Ted Cruz To F*ck Off For Trashing NYC Values (IMAGE),"If there s one thing you never do in life, it s piss off a New Yorker. If there s one thing you really never do in life, it s make fun of New York City on national television telling a city of millions, a city where liberty literally stands, that it has bad values.Well, Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz has now done both of those things, and needless to say, the city is pretty damn pissed. During the recent GOP debate, Cruz, tried to insult Trump by bashing  New York values.  He said: Donald comes from New York and he embodies New York values Everybody understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal and pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage.

The statue that embraces all. A statue that is the very embodiment of the United States of America.New York is a city that has some of the most prestigious colleges, the best theater and art, and is home to millions of people who come from every corner of the earth.New York is a city, that when attacked in the worst domestic terror attack in the history of the nation, stood together, stood strong, never gave up on one another, and citizens literally gave their lives to save one another.THOSE are New York values, and for Cruz to trash New York City, he s showing himself as the un-American, horrible person that he truly is.

 RNC Leader’s Backstage Rant Shows What The GOP Really Thinks Of Donald Trump (VIDEO),"Footage has been released of a leader of the Republican National Committee ranting for a full five minutes about the need for a rebellion against Presidential candidates like Donald Trump. The video serves as evidence that it s not just liberals who know that conservatives are going to lose in 2016 with extremists like Trump on the ticket.The star of the footage   Holland Redfield, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands   uses some rather colorful language in his incitement against the likes of trust fund tycoon Donald Trump. If I didn t say this, I d go home very troubled.  Redfield tells the audience of the private, RNC Winter Meeting. When we have allowed the party to be representing a tremendous amount of anger we are playing a very dangerous game.Does the tail wag the dog, or does the dog wag the tail? He rails against the gutter-level language being used by candidates like Trump and others, and the  disrespect  for ethnic minorities which risks making the party unelectable to Americans who aren t white. Not only is this morally reprehensible, but it s electoral suicide in a rainbow nation.And what happens when a party member voices concerns about these issues? Redfield argues that  we re almost terrorized as members of our party.  Shut up. Toe the line, embrace each other, and let s go forward. Redfield refuses to name Trump because he fears:  I will be targeted. It is likely Redfield speaks for a sea of moderate conservatives across the United States who cease to feel represented by a party which has been seized by Christian and right-wing extremists. These moderate conservatives might well be forced into the position of voting Democrat in 2016, or abstaining altogether, with the absence of a GOP candidate who speaks to their vision of America. The Eisenhower Republicans, who aren t afraid to invest public money to make America a world leader in education, science, technology and engineering; who would rather the U.S. spent a little less on engaging in permanent war overseas, and a little more on roads, schools, and hospitals at home. How could they ever vote for a Trump, or a Ted Cruz?This video of this desperate plea for a new direction by this lone RNC leader speaks to the bigger crisis for conservatives in America. The religious right has pulled the entire party off it s axis, and is speaking to an ever smaller, echo chamber of extreme conservatism. In doing so, they are doing the job of putting a Democrat in the White House in 2016 all by themselves.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" U.S. Air Force Advertises Martin Luther King Day ‘Fun Shoot’ Event, Claims It Was An ‘Honest Mistake’","Put this one under  Shit You Just Can t Make Up :A U.S. Air Force base in Georgia was forced to pull a flyer advertising a Martin Luther King Jr. Day  fun shoot  after public outcry, reports WMAZ.The flyer   featuring the face of the civil rights icon   promoted a noon gathering on Jan. 18 for the Robins Air Force Base Trap and Skeet Club, where participants would get two rounds of shooting and lunch for $20. Air Force officials pulled this provocative MLK Day  Fun Shoot  flyer: https://t.co/F65HoNYfwu #gapol pic.twitter.com/trss95PIcJ  Greg Bluestein (@bluestein) January 14, 2016 Officials at the base insist that the whole thing was just an honest mistake and, aw shucks, they didn t mean nothin  by it! They were just some good ol  boys never meanin  no harm. The official apology cleared the whole thing up: We realized the inappropriateness of the advertisement several days ago and immediately began removing the flyer. There was no malice of forethought in the flyer s creation and it was never the base s intention to portray Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in a negative light,   It continued.  It was an honest mistake, to which we ve personally counseled the parties involved and will provide them with remedial training and appropriate oversight to prevent this sort of inattention from occurring in the future. If it was a state less prone to overwhelming racism, the apology might be believable. But this was Georgia. And it was the Air Force, the branch of the military most heavily infested with Christian extremism. If you weren t aware of it, the Christian Right has been trying to turn the United States military into a religious institution for decades. They ve had the most success in the Air Force so far.Unsurprisingly, where there is Christian extremism, there s systemic racism as well. So, keeping these facts in mind, the MLK Jr.  Fun Shoot  starts to take on a much more ominous tone.

 The Winner Of The GOP Debate Is…Bernie Sanders (AGAIN),"If a debate is won according to who generates the most buzz, Bernie Sanders has once again kicked Republican ass on twitter. According The Hill,  Sanders had two of the most retweeted tweets during the debate with a pair touting his position in polls and going after GOP front-runner Donald Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. Both got more than 5,000 retweets. The Republicans seem to think they could beat our campaign. They haven t seen the polls. #GOPDebatepic.twitter.com/XitW9T28Vq  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 15, 2016I love the little frowning Republican faces; they so perfectly capture the frustration they must be feeling at losing in the polls, badly, to a *GASP* Socialist! Republicans are, of course, all for socialism but only as long as it s the rich that benefit and not all of the dirty lower classes that Bernie represents. Privatize the rewards, socialize the cost. It s the American way.Sanders also hit Trump over his naked appeals to racism and bigotry:I have a message for Donald Trump: No, we re not going to hate Latinos or Muslims. We are going to stand together. #GOPDebate  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 15, 2016The problem with running on hate is that it only gets you so far. Once you get past the angry white old person demographic, no one else is interested.But what makes it even more remarkable that Sanders continues to outshine Republicans on twitter during their own debate is that Sanders only has 1.14 million followers compared to Trump s 5.69 million. Although if we follow Trump s track record, there s a good chance a lot of those are paid for followers. I have a hard time believing that the average Trump supporter is smart enough to turn on a computer, much less use social media.While Trump did pick up more new followers than Sanders during the debate, that s of little comfort to the Republican Party. They may fear a Sanders presidency, but they fear a Trump presidency even more. Sanders will move the country to a place where the rich won t be AS rich and everyone else will get richer. Trump will turn America into the laughingstock of the world and cost Corporate America far more money than that dastardly Socialist Sanders ever could.Faced with that kind of choice, Republicans may not have a choice but to go all in for Bernie.Featured image via twitter",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Obama’s Epic Win Vs Ebola The Media Never Told You About (IMAGE),"The world is now reporting zero cases of ebola, the deadly virus that killed thousands in Africa. That good news comes after a sustained global relief effort led by President Obama and the American military, scientists and relief workers.President Obama marked the occasion in a Twitter post, pointing out that the moment is a  Great example of what we can achieve when we lead. Before I start, wanted to share this. Liberia is now Ebola-free. Great example of what we can achieve when we lead. pic.twitter.com/qjVcwg8tIi  President Obama (@POTUS) January 14, 2016From the World Health Organization report cited by the President:No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 3 January. On 29 December, WHO declared that human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus has ended in Guinea, after the completion of 42 days with zero cases since the last person confirmed to have EVD received a second consecutive negative blood test for Ebola virus RNA. Guinea has now entered a 90-day period of heightened surveillance. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have all now succeeded in interrupting human-to-human transmission linked to the original outbreak in West Africa.Yet Obama had to swim against the tide of right-wing scaremongering and media sensationalism in order to accomplish this vital task.In September 2014, Obama deployed 3,000 American troops to West Africa to help with efforts there to fight the spread of the disease. He also appointed an  Ebola czar  to coordinate the response, along with existing leadership from the Centers for Disease Control and other elements of the U.S. government.As Obama did this, the right was in the middle of hysterics. They were calling for the borders to be shut down, Chris Christie was unnecessarily quarantining a nurse, and Fox News figures were seriously claiming that Obama wanted an Ebola outbreak in America. Another Fox News talking head said Obama welcomed Ebola because his  affinities  are with Africa.At the same time, the more mainstream press was whipping itself into a frenzy, devoting hours and hours to what should be done if there was an Ebola outbreak in America despite the hundreds of safeguards in place from medical professionals. CNN hyped the non-problem more than even MSNBC and Fox.Curiously, this mainstream Ebola hype consisted of about 1,000 segments in the four weeks before the 2014 midterm elections, when Republicans were often campaigning on Ebola hype against Democrats, then fell off after the GOP increased its Congressional seats. Convenient.Still, President Obama refused to give into the fear and frankly hysterically overwrought madness embraced by the right and the media. As a result, a killer outbreak is in full retreat. Ebola hasn t been eradicated, but in all likelihood this latest outbreak is over   and Barack Obama stepped up to the plate and led yet another successful fight.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Lying B**tard Behind The Fake Planned Parenthood Videos Gets Slapped With Federal Lawsuit,"David Daleiden, the mastermind behind the debunked and now possibly criminal Planned Parenthood videos, got slapped with a federal lawsuit [PDF] by Planned Parenthood this Thursday in San Francisco.The lawsuit includes compensatory and punitive damages for what Planned Parenthood has suffered since the video release, as well as attorney fees. Beth Parker, a Planned Parenthood lawyer, did not comment on how much money would be sought but indicated that the amount would include extra money spent since the release of the videos for increased clinic security.Daleiden and his organization, the Center For Medical Progress, are responsible for publishing completely fake videos that suggest Planned Parenthood illegally sells fetal body parts for cash. The videos provided a mountain of fodder for Republican outrage in 2015, resulting in wasted hearings, time, and money. There have also been some accusations that the videos causing increased violence at Planned Parenthood clinics, and a mass shooting.The lawsuit accused the Center For Medical Progress and a fake company called  Biomax  of violating the RICO Act, committing fraud, invasion of privacy, illegal recording and trespassing. David Daleiden, Troy Newman, and a group of other individuals used forged government ID s to gain entry to private conferences where they secretly recorded conversations with Planned Parenthood employees. Afterward, the group took the recorded conversations, cut and combined them together out of context with fake footage to make the now infamous videos.David Daleiden was completely unrepentant, calling the lawsuit  frivolous.  In an email he gave the following statement:My response is: Game on. I look forward to deposing all the CEOs, medical directors, and their co-conspirators who participated in Planned Parenthood s illegal baby body parts racket.Source: ABC NewsYou have to ask the question. Does Daleiden actually believe what he made is real or is he being intentionally obstinant at this point? He already was forced to admit that he was lying on live tv. How much deeper in denial can he possibly go?Daleiden continued on to say that Planned Parenthood is currently under investigation by multiple law enforcement agencies and the U.S. Congress, implying that this would reveal some truth about the matter. Currently, Planned Parenthood is under no investigation by any law enforcement agencies. However, Daleiden is now officially unable to say the same thing about both his organization, and himself.featured image via youtube screen capture",News,"January 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Debate Screeches To A Halt After Trump Goes Birther On Cruz (VIDEO),"Fox Business held their second Republican debate, and things went off the rails almost immediately.Just a half hour in, Donald Trump was asked to address the comments he made alleging that fellow candidate Sen. Ted Cruz was not legally allowed to run for president because he was born in Canada. Cruz defended his eligibility by pointing out that the Constitutional requirement to run for president has always been interpreted to mean children of American citizens born in foreign countries were considered U.S. citizens just like anyone else. In one of the biggest burns of the night, Cruz went a step further by pointing out that some of the more  extreme  birther theories that Trump s fans support hold that not only does a child need to be born in the United States, but both parents need to be born in the country as well. By that logic, Cruz said, Donald Trump would be disqualified himself, because his mother was born in Scotland.Trump was not happy.Feigning concern for Cruz, Trump claims that if he were to choose Cruz as his vice presidential candidate, the Democrats would  sue, because we can t take him along for the ride.  Trump later claimed that if Cruz were to win the presidency, he would possibly face being kicked after a lawsuit over his eligibility. The entire auditorium was booing, but the jeers had been going on so long it was impossible to tell if they were meant for Trump, Cruz, or for the painful death of brain cells happening to everyone watching.By this point, the Republican Debate had come to a complete standstill. No questions were being asked. No other candidates were allowed to speak. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the two front-runners, were arguing on national television about birther conspiracy theories. As far as television goes, it was entertaining stuff.

Yes, Rick Santorum wants us to  Google  him. Why is this so goddamn funny?There was a time when the absolute last thing Rick Santorum ever wanted you to do was to  Google  him. Not too long ago, LGBT commentator Dan Savage produced one of the greatest political pranks of all time. In response to Santorum saying publicly that same-sex marriage will lead to man-on-dog sex, Savage re-defined the word  Santorum  to mean the  frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex. Worse, enemies of Santorum rigged it so that googling the Republican s name would only produce results that led to that definition. Hence, Santorum probably didn t spend much time asking people to Google him.Until Thursday night. Brave of him because, fortunately, Google no longer produces the new definition as a search result.

 Karma’s a Bi*ch: Birthers Go To Court To Challenge Rubio’s Eligibility For Presidency,"They say karma s a bi*ch. It appears that at least two serious contenders for the Republican nomination for the presidency may not be eligible to be president according to birthers. Ted Cruz was born in Canada and Marco Rubio is being challenged as well. This week, Rubio sought to have a Florida complaint on his eligibility thrown out saying the argument  would jeopardize centuries of precedent and deem at least six former presidents ineligible for office. Rubio was born in Florida in 1971. However, Rubio s Cuban immigrant parents did not become U.S. citizens until 1975. That, according to birthers, means he s disqualified from becoming  president under Article 2 of the Constitution, which states that  no person except a natural born citizen   shall be eligible to the Office of President.  This is despite the fact that Rubio was born in the United States. Here is the birther argument about Rubio:  Birthers rely on various passages to back up their argument. One is the treatise The Law of Nations by Swiss philosopher Emer de Vattel, which they say influenced the founding fathers. The natives, or natural-born citizens, are those born in the country, of parents who are citizens.   They also cite the U.S. Supreme Court, which in the 1875 case Minor vs. Happersett, used the term  natural born citizen  in reference to persons who were born in the United States, of U.S.-citizen parents. Birthers argue that since his parents were not citizens when he was born, that disqualifies him from becoming president. Rubio filed a motion to dismiss on Jan. 11. The 34-page filing shows that Rubio s legal team spent considerable time researching the issue. The report concludes the following: Senator Rubio is a natural born citizen of the United States and he is eligible to be President of the United States. Is it karma that the Republicans are now reeling from the prospect of two of their leading candidates being ineligible for the presidency?  Throughout President Obama s seven years in the White House, many Republicans have floated the idea that he was not born in the United States. In fact, they propagated the idea so much that 53% of Republicans believe this nonsense today.Now, it s the Republicans that are destroying any credibility they have left. It s not just Rubio. Trump is after Cruz, saying he s disqualified from being president because he was born in Canada. Trump even plays Born in the USA, by Bruce Springsteen, at all his rallies as a shot at Cruz.The birther movement, which consists of many Republicans, has attacked and tried to discredit the president for years. Now, that same movement is after the very same institution, the Republican Party, that propagated it in the first place.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Poll: 0.0% Of Young Icelanders Support Creationism,"For Americans, religion permeates almost every aspect of our daily lives whether we want it to or not. The United States is so religious, in fact, that when, say, a university instructs its professors to hold inclusive holiday parties, rather than focus solely on Christmas, many people believe Christianity itself is under attack. It is therefore always surprising to see just how non-religious other countries have become while America was busy having its pretend war on Christmas.A shocking new poll out of Iceland demonstrates the degree to which young people are abandoning organized religion. The survey of Icelanders found that while many older people (80.6%) still identified as Christian, those in their 20s or younger were astonishingly non-religious. In fact, when asked whether they believed the story of a biblical creation, like the kind found in American  creation museums , a whopping 0.0% of those 25 or younger said they did. Inversely, 93.9% said they believed the universe was created during a big bang.Of those younger than 25 93.9% said the world had been created in the big bang and 0.0% believed God had created the world. 77.7% of those between 25 and 44 years old believed the world had been created in the big bang and 10.1% believed God had created the world. In all but the oldest age category a majority accepted the big-bang theory. Only 46.1% of those older than 55 believed in the big bang, and nearly a fourth, 24.5% believed God had created the world.Perhaps because of this growing lack of religion, the poll also found that a large proportion of Icelanders of all ages expressed support for  the full separation of church and state. But before televangelist Pat Robertson goes dismissing the entire country as godless heathens, there is a bit of a caveat. As Icelandic Redditor avar points out, the implication that zero percent of young Icelanders don t believe in God is a bit misleading. The poll doesn t go that far.Now, what many outside of Iceland and I d say especially Americans need to understand is that even Christians in Iceland and for that matter in most of Europe don t literally believe in the origin story in the Bible in anything but trivial numbers. Maintaining the literal interpretation of that is very much an American evangelical thing. I bet if you polled priests in Iceland and asked them whether they thought the Big Bang happened you d get a 100% response rate in the affirmative.It s a fair point. In America, we often assume  religious  to mean  creationist  because so much of our religious discourse is consumed by conservative fundamentalists. Waking up to the fact that other countries and other churches don t have to be Bible literalists to still believe in God can be jarring for some. As part of a television show, an American religious conservative flew to Scandinavia to learn about how those countries worship. When he discovered how secular people were, and how even the church embraced things like science and same-sex marriage, his brain almost couldn t handle it.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuDqEGlKOus]Meanwhile, back in America, the country remains an outlier in the Western world. Thanks to conservative lawmakers that work to undermine education and special interest groups that push religion into schools, American students still struggle to accept well-supported scientific theories like evolution or the big bang. Slowly, that appears to be changing. Recently, the United States had a bittersweet moment when new polls found a majority of the American public (finally) accepted evolution over Creationism. We still have a long way to go to reach Iceland s numbers though.Feature image via Wikimedia",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Senate Democrats Will Force Senate Republicans To Vote On Trump’s Racist Policies,"Senate Democrats want Republican senators to vote on some of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump s racist policies, including his stance on banning Muslims from entering the United States.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said that the Republicans should vote on the policies of the front-runner since many Republicans have refused to distance themselves from Trump s racist rhetoric, nor say whether they would support him should he win the Republican nomination. Senator Reid said: These votes will give all Senators a chance to take a stand on the policy issues dominating the public debate   and Republicans a chance to stand with the frontrunner for their nomination. The senator is correct. After all, Trump s the leader of their party for the presidential nomination and despite the fact that some Republicans have disagreed with him, the overwhelming majority have not taken a stand on his divisive policies on Muslims and Hispanic Americans, especially Mexicans. That s because they fear alienating his popular support in their party. Trump currently leads all other Republican candidates by a wide margin for the nomination. Senator Reid said that it s both important and easy to ascertain what other Republican senators think of Trump and his policies. Reid said the votes: Can be done easily and efficiently under an open amendment process, with no interference to the light workload Senate Republican leaders have announced for 2016. Reid s move is actually very smart and it could show the true colors of the Republicans. It will also put them in a tough spot. There are a few Republican senators running for reelection in blue-leaning states.  Republicans are defending a total of 24 Senate seats in November.Senator Reid s suggestion comes as congressional Republicans are in Baltimore for their annual policy retreat to decide on issues the party will collectively take stances on for the year.With Trump s enormous popularity among Republican voters, senate Republicans have been treading water with the first-place candidate.  Whether Trump is holding his fellow Republicans hostage because of his popularity or whether they secretly feel the same way, the Republican party appears to be screwed. Some may criticize Senator Reid s tactic as politically motivated. Well of course it is! However, it s also useful. We need the Republicans to come out and say who they truly are.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Flint, MI: Ten Dead, Eighty-Seven Infected With Deadly Waterborne Bacteria (VIDEO)","On January 13, 2016, Michigan governor Rick Snyder held a press conference to announce the  discovery  of an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease in the city of Flint.According to officials in the Snyder administration, there have been 87 confirmed cases of the disease. Ten people have died as a result.Legionnaire s disease is caused by a deadly waterborne bacteria, called Legionella.Unlike lead poisoning, the other major water-related health crisis now facing the people of Flint, Legionnaire s disease is not caused by drinking contaminated water. Instead, the bacteria enters the body through the lungs, via water droplets in the air.On Wednesday Snyder officials claimed that they can neither confirm or deny that the outbreak is linked to the city s contaminated water supply.As The Atlantic reports here, the outbreak began shortly after the Snyder administration switched the city of Flint s water supply to the Flint River.According to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease occurs when two or more people are infected with the bacteria.In Flint, almost ninety people are known to have been infected by the disease between June 2014 and November 2015.What s infuriating about the Legionnaire s outbreak in Flint is that officials in the Snyder administration certainly knew about it long before Wednesday s press conference. Yet they said nothing until now.As reported here, between June 2014 to March 2015, the number of confirmed cases of Legionnaire s Disease in Flint skyrocketed.During the previous five years the city saw a fairly steady number of cases of the disease, which averaged about eight to ten cases during a ten month reporting period.But by March of 2015, the number of confirmed cases had spiked to 4x the prior average. Between June 2014 and March 2015, there were 45 confirmed cases of the disease. Seven people died from Legionnaire s Disease during that ten month period.Yet after seeing this sudden increase, officials in the Snyder administration took no action. There was no effort made to identify a possible source, although the Center for Disease Control provides specific guidelines for doing so. The public was also not notified that there was an outbreak, although the state health department knew, or should have known, at least by March of last year, if not sooner.Between March of 2015 and November of 2015, another 42 cases of Legionnaire s Disease were confirmed in Flint. Three more people died after being exposed to the waterborne bacteria.Still there was no mention of an outbreak until January 13, 2016.Snyder s press conference on Wednesday was the first time any official made mention of a Legionnaire s outbreak in the city, although at least ten deaths have been caused by the disease.State officials virtually ignored this deadly outbreak for almost a year. Then all of the sudden, on Wednesday, Governor Snyder called a press conference to inform the public that there is an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease in the city.The question of how state officials could have just now discovered something that has been going on for this long may not be difficult to answer.Last week the federal government announced a Justice Department probe into the Flint water crisis. The announcement followed an investigation by the ACLU, which revealed that state officials had falsified documents and rigged tests to cover up the fact that the city s water is contaminated with lead.Over 200 children are confirmed to have lead poisoning because of the actions of Snyder and his appointed representatives. An additional 9,000 children are likely to be impacted. The number of adults who are affected is currently unknown, but likely stretches into the thousands.A Justice Department investigation into the Flint water crisis would undoubtedly reveal that the Snyder administration concealed information on the Legionnaire s outbreak from the public.What else has Rick Snyder s administration been hiding and lying about? We may never know.Just as the Snyder administration was coming under intense scrutiny over the city s toxic water, someone allegedly broke into Flint City Hall. As Addicting Info reported here, the break-in conveniently targeted the vacant office where Flint s water records are stored.According to the CDC, a state health agency is responsible to conduct an investigation into the source of an Legionnaire s outbreak. Such an investigation is advised by the CDC any time there is an increase in the number of people who are diagnosed with the disease or an increase in the severity of cases (such as when the disease causes hospitalizations and deaths.)Outbreaks of Legionnaire s disease, such the one happening in Flint, would require an immediate investigation to determine the source as well as an urgent response from the state health department.Because of the timing and severity of the outbreak, which directly coincided with the switch of the water source, public health officials should have started an investigation into the source of the bacteria months ago. Instead they did nothing.State officials say they haven t made a  direct connection  between the city s contaminated water and the outbreak of the disease. That s more than likely because they never tried to identify the source of the outbreak. They just ignored it.Watch this video, recorded by club937 in January of last year, which shows the quality of the city s water.  We know that the water in Flint is contaminated with lead, a substance that causes a wide range of physical and mental disabilities, especially in children. We also know that the citizens of Flint were repeatedly told by the governor and members of his administration that the water was perfectly safe to drink.What s most frightening about the possibility that the city s water is the cause of the outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease is that people do not have to drink it to be exposed to the bacteria. This bacteria is associated with inhaling water particles, meaning that people can become deathly sick from simply bathing, showering, washing their hands or performing other tasks that most of us take for granted.Handing out bottled drinking water and lead filters isn t going to cut it.I cannot think of a single reason why the people of Flint would trust anything that Governor Snyder or members of his administration tell them about the water. They have been told lie after lie by this administration, ever since the city s water source was switched to the Flint River.What we can already say about the Legionnaire s outbreak is that state officials were aware of it months ago, yet they took no steps to protect public health. Ten people are dead.Snyder says he s not sure if the city s water is responsible for those deaths. That acknowledgment alone is enough to cause public outrage. It is his job to know. It was his job to know back in March, when there were already seven deaths attributed to this disease. But he didn t give a shit back in March. You know why? Because the federal government was not investigating Flint s water crisis back in March.Snyder and every member of his administration has got to go. Every shred of trust the public may have had in this administration is gone. It will never be back. No amount of PR from the governor s office is ever going to repair this.These are life and death issues for Flint residents. They need answers that they can trust, and they deserve to have representation that they can trust as they try to navigate their way through this incalculable nightmare.It was bad when they couldn t drink the water. Now there s a new threat looming over their heads, and that threat comes from the possibility that any contact with the water whatsoever could cause them to become deathly ill.These citizens cannot be expected to look to the same people who caused this disaster for answers now. They cannot be asked to trust the same administration that has lied to them over and over in the past, to tell them the truth now.Snyder and his administration are now saying they aren t sure if the city s water killed ten people. They don t exactly know if the water is safe to shower in, bathe in, wash your hands in. That s what they re saying now, when last week they said they were sure the water was safe for all of those things.At least a dozen petitions to recall Governor Rick Snyder have been filed in recent days. The Michigan Board of State Canvassers continues to throw the recall Snyder petitions out.Oddly enough the right wing majority board had no problem approving two Tea-Party backed recall petitions targeting state legislatures who voted in favor of a tax increase to help repair the state s dangerously neglected roads.To the citizens of Michigan I would ask, how many people have to get sick, and how many children have to be poisoned, and how many deaths have to be counted, before partisan political bullshit takes a backseat to the health and safety of your fellow citizens?You need to get this man, and every member of his blatantly corrupt administration out of office.*Featured image credit: Video screen capture club937.com",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Terrifying: Watch Donald Trump Turn These Adorable Little Girls Into The Hitler Youth (VIDEO),"Being a xenophobic bigot and a confirmed fascist wasn t enough for Donald Trump. He had to go and involve the children. These unfortunate little girls now get to go the rest of their lives knowing they sang a song of hate and fear in support of a man who embodies the absolute worst America has to offer.It may have been one thing had the song been a cute little ditty about Trump and his family or a generic and non-offensive tune about America, but it s not. It s a song of pure hate, with lyrics that can be described as nothing but stupid:CowardiceAre you serious?Apologies for freedom, I can t handle this.When freedom rings, answer the call!On your feet, stand up tall!Freedom s on our shoulders, USA!Enemies of freedom face the music, c mon boys, take them downPresident Donald Trump knows how to make America greatDeal from strength or get crushed every timeFace the music? Take them down? Get crushed every time? Seriously? The main problem is, while this asinine song may seem like it s about America s enemies, it s actually about America itself. Trump may well be looking to  destroy  our enemies abroad, but from the actions of he and his supporters at their rallies, the meaning couldn t be more clear: Stand in Trump s way and pay the price, no matter who you are.We ve seen his fascism in his platform. Registering American Muslims and refusing entry to all others into the country. No cure for immigration: deport them all. Build a wall; keep them out. If they dissent, silence them. These are the things we gasp at when we hear, knowing how much support this new age Hitler has. The press are tossed from his rallies for not focusing their cameras exclusively on him. He stops every five minutes when he speaks to encourage the mob mentality and have someone thrown out.This man is nothing but dangerous and because of that these poor girls won t soon be forgotten.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Looks Like The Founding Fathers May Have Actually Disqualified Ted Cruz From Running,"Now, some may say because Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) was born to an American citizen, even while in Canada, he is to be considered a  natural born  citizen. However, when looking at the Constitution in the context of the time frame that is was written, and in regards to how certain laws were to be read, that  natural born  status actually may not apply to the senator.Why? Because, unlike today, in 2016, when woman are considered equals among men (for the most part), when the Constitution was written by our Founders it was quite a sexist time.Legal scholar Thomas Lee from Fordham University believes that Cruz should be disqualified. And as the Washington Post describes: On this straightforward, intuitive, and deeply conservative reasoning, several prominent legal scholars have argued Cruz is arguably not a natural-born citizen. As the Founding Fathers and their contemporaries probably would have understood that phrase, the argument goes, Cruz is ineligible for the presidency   not because he was born in Canada, but because he was born in Canada to a Cuban father. Furthermore: Under King Edward III, who reigned from 1327 to 1377, England expanded this definition to include the children of ambassadors and soldiers who were serving the monarch overseas. In the centuries to come, Parliament modified the definition further to include the children of private English subjects who happened to be abroad.In the late 18th century, though, that definition did not include English mothers who were traveling. If they conceived children with foreign men, it was assumed those children would not be loyal English subjects and were not considered  natural born. Yikes! Looks like Cruz isn t a natural born citizen after all. Well, at least if we go by the United States Constitution as it was originally written and intended. Which, strict  constitutional conservatives  like a certain Sen. Ted Cruz claim so adamantly to be. He might as well excuse himself from the presidential race right now. Unless, of course, he s not a strict constitutionalist and doesn t want to abide by the Founding Fathers original intent.HOW. DARE. HE?!Truth be told, we really don t know the Founding Fathers true intention, and can only go by how  natural born  was defined in the era that the phrase was first prescribed. Everything else is hearsay and interpreted to fit specific agendas (such as, wanting to allow a Canadian born to a Cuban dissident to be President of the United States). Sure, his mother was an American citizen, but if we are to abide by the law as originally intended, this surely may disqualify Cruz. All because the Founding Fathers were harshly sexist.How much do you want to bet Ted Cruz wishes he was a women s rights activist now?

" Sorry Conservatives, Obamacare Isn’t Killing Jobs; In Fact, The Private Sector Is SOARING","If you listen to Republicans, the Affordable Care Act is the worst thing since Caillou first aired on television   or, something to that effect. While Ted Cruz may claim that  millions of Americans are hurting  because of the jobs that have been  destroyed  since the passage of Obamacare, Marco Rubio says that We have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people,  and Carly Fiorina ignorantly asserts that   Obamacare is crushing small businesses,  none of that seems to be happening.Not only do we enjoy the lowest uninsured rate in history, but 2014   the first full year of implementation of the Affordable Care Act   treated us to a 15-year high in job growth. 2015 wasn t too shabby either, with the two full years in which Obamacare has been up and running being the best back-to-back years since there were new episodes of Full House.As Forbes Dan Diamond noted last week, since Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010 (or  Armageddon  as conservatives call it) the private sector hasn t lost any jobs. In fact, Obama is the worst job-killing President in recent history, if that is actually his goal.MSNBC took Diamond s graph and made some alterations showing job  growth  under George W. Bush compared to under President Obama. Clearly, after inheriting the dismal economy left to us by the Bush administration, the President and his evil socialist cohorts attempted to destroy America by putting people back to work: But whenever this or related topics come up, I hear from conservatives who insist that the data is deceptive because most of the new jobs are part-time, not full-time,  Maddow blog s Steve Benen notes.  This pesky detail makes the seemingly good news appear far more discouraging.  This would, of course, be heavily disconcerting, he notes   if it were true. Vox s Sarah Kliff reported on Monday that the  part-time  theory is complete and utter bullsh*t:[N]ew research in the journal Health Affairs suggests they weren t the norm: The data shows no national trend toward more part-time employment under the Affordable Care Act   even if you drill into the type of people you d expect to get hit hardest.Is Obamacare hurting the economy or the job market? All signs point to no   but that won t stop Republicans from trying to figure out a way. Or, of course, they might just make some stuff up. They re good at that.Featured image via MSNBC",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Who Had Never Fired One Gets Concealed Permit In A Single Day,"Today s lesson in the horrors of how easily a person can obtain and legally carry a firearm come from   big surprise   Texas. For two weeks now the Lone Star State has been imposing its ammosexuality on not just the residents who feel the need to keep an arsenal at home but on the college campus communities as well.That s right Like it or not   and most colleges say  not,   campus carry  has become a reality. Now any student over 21 with a legal concealed carry permit can carry a loaded weapon onto any college campus across the state. Texan lawmakers, proving they are dumb as stumps, have decided that would be the best way to curb the onslaught of campus shootings.Some people may say,  well, at least they have to be properly trained. Concealed carry permits come with a safety training course.  While that may sound nice  it s true on paper   in reality it s far more frightening.University of Texas at Austin student Zachary Stone, in preparation for a debate on the issue of  campus carry,  decided to go out with zero experience, having never fired a gun before and see what it took to get the concealed carry permit necessary to carry at school. He chronicled his experience for The New York Times and it is absolutely horrifying.The class required is a 6-hour course where you learn such important rules as  you can only shoot in self-defense.  No vigilante justice, not to intervene in a crime, and certainly not to stop someone from running away.  That would be murder,  his instructor told him. Stone says everything he needed to learn to pass the written part of the test, which was basically a list of where you can carry a concealed weapon, he learned in the last 10 minutes. He got a 100 on the written test.When it came time for the live-fire portion of the test, Stone was a wreck: Fire! I shot. The gun flew back. My neighbors each hit the center, but I missed a foot too high. Fire! I didn t realize I d have to shoot again so soon. I hadn t taught myself how to aim yet, and I wanted a few seconds to learn from the first shot. I also hadn t learned how to deal with the recoil. Anxiously, I pointed and shot   a few seconds after my neighbors. I still missed.That s when the instructor yelled at me.  You need to line up your sights!  I had no idea what that meant. He explained that for me to aim properly the dot at the front of the gun needed to be inside the post at the back of the gun.That was remarkably useful information. Fire! My next shot hit the center  X. Stone found himself being screamed at every step of the way, because he had no idea what he was doing. Lining up his sights paled in comparison to the reloading process, which required him to eject the magazine   something he had no clue how to do:I tugged on the magazine. It didn t move, so I pulled harder. I pulled as hard as I could, nervous to put so much force on a gun   empty or not.I called out to the instructor.  My magazine s stuck! Show me. Try to pull it out. That really shouldn t happen. I pulled on the magazine for the instructor.  You need to push the release,  he said. What s that?  I asked. The button. I pushed something. No. The button,  he said.That did the trick.Keep in mind that this young man had already passed the written portion of the test and was now on his way to being a  responsible gun owner  legally licensed to carry a concealed weapon to school. After repeating the live-shooting portion until 50 rounds had been fired each, it was time to tally the score and see if Zachary had the marksmanship necessary to be considered safe enough for public places.To pass, you need 175 out of 250 points. If you fail, you get two more chances. I did pretty well in the end   I got 216 points.The targets are huge; the distances close. In 2014, 99.7 percent of those who applied were given licences to carry concealed in Texas. As Stone proved, it s nearly impossible to fail. After less than one day s time, with a rented gun and absolutely zero real training, Zachary Stone had a permit to bring a gun to class.At his debate, after telling the story, he asked one question that the pro-gun crowd would struggle with: Given that the system allows me   lacking firearm experience   to get a license, would you be comfortable if we sat with each other in class, upon learning I m secretly carrying a gun? The system sucks.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Attacks Obama’s National Cancer Initiative By Claiming Obamacare Won’t Cover It,"President Obama gave America a bit of the spirit of the 60 s back when he announced, during his final State of the Union address, his support for a new American  moon shot  to develop a cure for cancer. It harkened back to the days of John F. Kennedy s  We choose to go to the Moon  speech he delivered at Rice University in 1962, and Richard Nixon s signing of the National Cancer Act of 1971 where he dedicated federal funds towards working on a cure for the disease.A national goal to cure one of the worst and widespread diseases known to humanity is an incredible undertaking. If it were successful, it would save countless lives, ease untold amounts of suffering, and reduce the colossal expenses we incur by managing the disease every year. But, because Obama suggested it someone had to have a problem with it.For years now, there has been a running joke of  If Obama is for it, Fox News hates it.  This included such silly notions as drinking enough water every day, to breathing oxygen, and other common-interest items like these. Reality has overwritten satire yet again when Fox News insisted that Obama s national cancer cure initiative was a waste of time because Obamacare won t allow it to happen.One of the objectors was Dr. Marc Siegel, who appeared on Fox and Friends to declare that Obama was the  wrong president to cure cancer.  It was a strange way to start his argument, but the implication was clear. Some conservatives like Siegel just don t want to see Obama with a  win  even if it meant we could cure cancer starting tomorrow.Jumping immediately onto the anti-Obamacare bandwagon, Fox hosts started suggesting that the Affordable Care Act inhibits cancer research. This is something that is not proven true. Some trade groups have made the disingenuous leap connecting cost-saving measures to a reduction in research. However, there are other aspects of the ACA that promote more research across the board.Seigel continued on, implying that Barack Obama had not committed substantial funds to cancer research, by citing Richard Nixon directing $100 million towards cancer research during his presidency. Barack Obama has actually directed $264 million towards cancer research as part of a $2 billion raise to the National Institutes of Health.Seigel also claimed that the ACA wouldn t provide enough coverage for treatments developed during a national cancer initiative:Obamacare is narrow networks of doctors,  he continued.  It doesn t include most of these major medical centers, the cancer institutes. It won t include these treatments that are $100,000 per year. And not only that, as you just said, it stifles innovation.Source: Raw Story Seigel is trying to conflate the coverage of current treatments with cures that have not been invented. It s a bit disingenuous to suggest that a cure that has not actually been developed yet will not be covered by the ACA. Data on which insurance policies cover treatments that have yet to be invented simply do not exist.Seigel s argument about existing treatments does not have merit either. Media Matters had previously pointed out that conservative media had misrepresented the facts in an AP report about narrow health care networks to falsely claim enrollees in ACA exchanges cannot get coverage for treatments at advanced cancer centers. The  narrow networks  that were used as the basis for the right-wing misinformation was a marketing tactic to provide lower premium options to customers and had virtually nothing to do with the ACA forcing them into that position.Watch the full clip below:It s ridiculous that Fox News is actually fighting back against a national cancer cure initiative, simply because they can t let it go on Obamacare, but that is exactly what is happening. He already won on jobs, national security, ending wars, ensuring marriage equality, providing health insurance to tens of millions and bringing America back into the hearts and minds of the rest of the world. They can t stand the thought of him also being the president that  cured cancer  as well.featured image: screengrab",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Paul Ryan Reveals This Really Weird Reason He Hated President Obama’s SOTU Speech (VIDEO),"Paul Ryan sat down for an interview with USA Today on Wednesday. During the interview, the House Speaker revealed his thoughts on President Obama s final State of the Union speech. It was made immediately clear in the interview that Ryan loathed a lot of what President Obama had to say. Ryan was so upset with one point in Obama s speech that he said it  degrades the presidency. Ryan was mad the President Obama had mentioned how the hatred towards others that Donald Trump is fanning and exploiting for political gain is hurting the United States. In case you missed it, here is the part of President Obama s speech that Ryan is referring to: We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn t a matter of political correctness. It s a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that  to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.  When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn t make us safer.That s not telling it like it is. It s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country. President Obama received a well-deserved standing ovation for that small piece of political sanity.So why is Ryan so mad? Well, he says that agrees with President Obama, saying that  Putting a religious test on anybody coming to this country is wrong,  but goes on to say that President Obama is wrong for commenting on the politics of the Republican Party. I think it sort of degrades the presidency to then talk about primary politics in the other party, during primaries. That s not what presidents ought to be talking about in State of the Union addresses,  Ryan said.  Speaking up for our values and speaking up for our beliefs is one thing. But kind of wading into the primary politics of the other party is just not really what presidents ought to do. If this were a normal primary election, Ryan might have a point. However, this is not a normal election and Trump is hurting the United States without actually being in any office. Trump was even called out during the Republican response when governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley said,  Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference.  A statement that could easily be seen as a chastisement of Trump for his refusal to keep his racism on the down low, rather than for being racist to begin with.This all boils down to the Republican establishment being angry and scared over the fact that Trump has the Party s racist base out of the shadows. Now that they are exposed, they can be criticized for it, at their expense. President Obama did that in a super classy way, wrapped in a message that draws on the better ideals of the United States.You can watch the interview, in full, below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Huckabee Flips Out As Voter Confronts Him Over Support For Duggar Child Abuse (VIDEO),"GOP Presidential candidate and religious right poster boy Mike Huckabee was confronted over his relationship with the Duggar family and decided to browbeat an Iowa voter for pointing out his dysfunctional relationship.The voter asked Huckabee why he announced support for the Duggar family, pointing out he propped up  child abuse  and the subsequent cover up of that abuse while attaching himself to Josh Duggar, who molested five girls. The Duggars have been influential with the  religious right,  a key constituency of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee s support base.In response Huckabee melted down, accusing the woman of making a scene and getting her facts about the case.Huckabee yelled at the woman and insisted that because he had known the Duggar children  since they were babies  she had no right to speak out about how the Duggar family patriarch, Jim Bob Duggar, had avoided reporting his son s abuse towards young children.But the voter was right. Huckabee had backed the Duggars.When the revelations about Duggar came out, Huckabee announced he was still backing the Duggar clan.Janet and I want to affirm our support for the Duggar family. Josh s actions when he was an underage teen are as he described them himself,  inexcusable,  but that doesn t mean  unforgivable.  He and his family dealt with it and were honest and open about it with the victims and the authorities. No purpose whatsoever is served by those who are now trying to discredit Josh or his family by sensationalizing the story. Good people make mistakes and do regrettable and even disgusting things.Yet as the campaign heated up and media scrutiny increased, Huckabee apparently felt the heat and scrubbed his campaign website of material showing the Duggar connection.So far Huckabee has been able to capture the magic of his 2008 campaign when he won the Iowa caucuses. He has been unable to qualify for the top-tier debates and currently polls at an average of 2% among Republicans. In all likelihood Huckabee will return to the lucrative world of being a Fox News pundit and cranking out history propaganda videos targeted at impressionable children.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Major Study Finds Marijuana Perfectly Safe For Teens,"We ve come a long way from the days of rampant stupidity concerning marijuana use. We used to believe in  reefer madness,  the laughable idea that smoking pot would drive you innnnsaaaannnnne! Then there was the idiotic idea that marijuana was a  gateway drug  that would inevitably lead potheads to become heroin addicts. Then, more recently, there was the belief that getting high would make teens less intelligent. But, like most propaganda, the myth of the pot-addled teen ahem went up in smoke when science got involved:The study, published online January 6 in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found a statistical association between cannabis use and decreased intellectual performance. However, this association vanished when the researchers took other variables into account.  The notion that cannabis use itself is causally related to lower IQ and poorer educational performance was not supported in this large teenage sample,  wrote Claire Mokrysz of the University College London and her colleagues.A quick disclaimer here: I don t smoke marijuana. I have never smoked marijuana. I will never smoke marijuana (even if I didn t have asthma). Not interested, don t care. However, I grew up around a lot of people that smoked pot so I find the hysteria over it to be ridiculous. I find the idea of putting people in jail for smoking it offensive in the extreme. Cigarettes and beer are far more harmful but marijuana is dangerous? Spare me from your ignorance. Smoke m if you got em.That s not to say that the low I.Q. story appeared in a vacuum. A study released in 2012 clearly pointed to the possibility that marijuana use over a long period of time could lower your intelligence. People familiar with the drug were, needless to say, skeptical but the anti-pot crusaders latched onto this for dear life. After all, all of their other talking points (addictive, lethal, causes violence, etc.) have come up short. But now that the original research has been duplicated and expanded on, we know that the original study was flawed. That, of course, is the beauty of science, it self-corrects: People often believe that using cannabis can be very damaging to intellectual ability in the long-term, but it is extremely difficult to separate the direct effects of cannabis from other potential explanations,  Mokrysz added.  Adolescent cannabis use often goes hand in hand with other drug use, such as alcohol and cigarette smoking, as well as other risky lifestyle choices. It s hard to know what causes what- do kids do badly at school because they are smoking weed, or do they smoke weed because they re doing badly? This study suggests it is not as simple as saying cannabis is the problem. Will the anti-marijuana crusaders amend their narrative or will they continue to insist that smoking pot makes you dumb? Considering their fear of cannabis is irrational to begin with, it s unlikely they ll let go of such a useful fiction.Featured image via twitter ",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Five Republican Candidates Will Join Bigot Pastor Who Says God Punishes Gays With AIDS (VIDEO),"Five Republican presidential hopefuls are scheduled to speak at an ultra-conservative pastor s  religious freedom  event, to prove what the GOP believes religious liberty is REALLY about   i.e. bigotry, exclusion and treating those who live different lifestyles like scum.On Saturday, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee will appear on the Free to Believe Broadcast, which is being hosted by the Family Research Council s Tony Perkins and Vision America s Rick Scarborough   two men who have become infamous for their anti-gay activism. Both Perkins and Scarborough have taken it upon themselves to fight against gay marriage because it is apparently violating their Christian rights. In the past, Perkins has said that America s persecution of anti-gay Christians is inspiring ISIS and Scarborough said he ll burn to death to outlaw gay marriage.  Live and let live  is completely lost on these two, and they intend to keep fighting with more fear-mongering, threats and punishment.Scarborough, who is a pastor, has repeatedly said that God punishes gay people for their  immoral act  with AIDS and has even called for a class action lawsuit  against homosexuals in 2013. Scarborough has claimed that if only Americans would wake up and stop supporting gay rights, God would probably give us the cure for AIDS today.  Last year, Scarborough said God would be completely justified in sending a nuclear bomb to destroy America just because Obama appointed a few gay ambassadors. Here s a video of Scarborough preaching about AIDS and  God s judgement  on gays:Perkins  record of homophobia isn t much better.It should come as no surprise that the five GOPers listed above would support such a vile event. Cruz in particular has rained praise on Scarborough and similar anti-gay activists before, expressing his support for the Religious Right s rhetoric that God will punish gays. Cruz, along with Huckabee, have also supported anti-gay radicals by making appearances at a 2015 conference hosted by Kevin Swanson, who believes gay people should be put to death. The two candidates also stirred up controversy last year with their alliance to anti-gay Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who became infamous for her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples after the Supreme Court s ruling.Extreme events like the broadcast these five GOP candidates are planning to attend are a perfect example of what the party truly stands for. It s not about  religious freedom  at all   it s about hate, shame, fear and punishment and has very little to do with the true values of Christianity. When Republican candidates attend and participate in events like this, they re showing America who they really are and what they truly support   bigotry. Hopefully, America is paying attention.Featured image via Alex Proimos / Flickr",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative Columnist Tries To Declare War On Iran On Behalf Of America,"Dear America, I would like to apologize on behalf of Britain for the awful political commentators that have migrated from our shores to yours. First Piers Morgan, and now Louise Mensch   who has just attempted to declare war on Iran on behalf of your country.And no, this is not satire.The people of Britain awoke, five to eight hours earlier than you this morning (depending on your timezone), to discover Louise Mensch had embarrassed both our nations by hate-tweeting the President of Iran. Mensch served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for our Conservative party (all aristocrats and private school types), before migrating to New York to serve the interests of media magnate Rupert Murdoch more directly.Think of Ann Coulter having been put through the washing machine on too high a temperature, and you have a pretty accurate mental image of Mensch.However, she seems to have gone a bit native and thinks she can declare war on your behalf, and put a Republican president in your White House.I will rejoice the day a new US President, a Republican, brings the hammer down on Iran and @HassanRouhani https://t.co/i6im0P3MBd  Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) January 13, 2016But Mensch didn t stop there. She has carried on hate-tweeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani all day. Quite what she thinks this will achieve is anyone s guess. It appears she believed the President of Iran would be stopped in his tracks by an over-stuffed western media hack carping at him on social media.The sexist, racist @HassanRouhani forces a US sailor into repellent forced hijab #Iran pic.twitter.com/mXpbiVlF6E  Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) January 13, 2016In the meantime, President Obama and John Kerry were busy executing the kind of grown up politics and diplomacy one has to in this scale of international incident. Unlike conservative lawmakers and pundits, they bear the burden of responsibility for actually getting those sailors home   not merely scoring political points from their capture and treatment.In fact, they were able to secure release of the sailors, entirely unharmed, within hours. No embarrassing ultimatums, no extended hostage crisis, no saber-rattling   problem solved and time to move on. Meanwhile, the entire conservative media and political sphere remains in total meltdown, hyperventilating over an issue that has already been resolved expertly.And that s why America, and the world, cannot afford to put them in the White House in 2016.Featured Image via Wikimedia/Flickr",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas Pastor Explains How She Can ‘Move Clouds’ – And How You Can Perform Miracles Too (VIDEO),"Texas Christian Pastor Cindy Jacobs stood in front of her Trinity Church congregation in Cedar Hill, Texas, this month and described how she literally  moved clouds  and performed other miracles like  preventing typhoon flooding.  Really? You don t say? We re listening   teach us, Sensei.But, all kidding aside (okay   no kidding aside) if this is true, we really wouldn t mind knowing her secret. Here s how she says you can move clouds, too: Just read the Book! So I did, I just put my hands up, and Mike had the word that I should pray that the clouds dissipate.Did I get it right this time? yay! So, I lifted my hands and I said these simple words,  In the name of Jesus, I command this cloud layer to dissipate.  Now didn t that seem weird? You know what happened? Within a half an hour, no more clouds! Amen! Okay, so, in case  cloud moving  is not your thing, maybe you d rather get rid of typhoon flooding instead. If so, Pastor Jacobs has you covered there, as well: And so we said,  In the name of Jesus, we command the flooding to stop, the river to stop flooding and the streets to dry up!  You know what happened? In one hour, one hour, it stopped and I told them, prepare the van because we re going! It looks like anything is possible with Jesus. Maybe we can try this theory out with child hunger? Might as well give it a shot. Let s try it now: In the name of Jesus, we command child hunger be gone! Be gone with you! Did it work? I guess we ll find out here in an hour or so. Let s be patient.Let s not stop there. There are a few other miracles worth performing: In the name of Jesus, we command you, diseases, be gone! Be gone with you horrible diseases! Now!We re hoping this pastor isn t full of shit, really. Why? Because we d also like to win the lottery. One more time: We command you, lottery, give us the winning numbers! That s an order!And, God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley Says We’ve Never Passed Racist Laws In This Country,"We ve never passed racist laws in this country, says the woman who is the governor of a former slave state where Jim Crow laws flourished and the Confederate flag flew until July 2015.It s most definitely the most ridiculous thing Nikki Haley has ever said, and it comes just a day after she delivered the Republican response to the State of the Union Address.Only six months have gone by since Haley called for removing the Confederate flag off statehouse grounds after a racist gunman murdered nine African-American parishioners at a black church in Charleston.The flag has been a symbol of white supremacy and slavery since the Civil War and actually flew on the statehouse itself after a law was passed mandating it. That s why it took a vote of the South Carolina House and Senate to remove it for good.So, it s pretty damn mind-boggling to hear Haley claim that we ve never passed racist laws in this country.According to Talking Points Memo, Haley responded to criticism of her speech by Donald Trump, who called her weak on immigration. And let s just say it didn t go well. When you ve got immigrants who are coming here legally, we ve never in the history of this country passed any laws or done anything based on race or religion. Let s not start that now. We ve gone too far than to go back into a race and religion issue. I ve been through those fights. That s not worth it. Yes, she really claimed that there have never been racist laws in the history of this nation, even though Haley lives and works in a state that seceded from the Union because they feared their pro-slavery laws would be abolished by President Lincoln.As Gawker points out, South Carolina also had many Jim Crow laws on the books, including making it  illegal for  any white man to intermarry with any woman of either the Indian or negro races  until 1967,  and banning restaurants from serving  white and colored passengers in the same room, or at the same table, or at the same counter  until 1954.Racism is even present in our own Constitution as the Founding Fathers made it the law that African-Americans could only count as three-fifths of a person when determining the number of congressional seats each state has every ten years.In addition, there s the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, literacy tests for voting, Operation  Wetback  of 1954, and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, just to name a few. To see more, click here.Either Nikki Haley doesn t know the history of America and our legal system, or she is whitewashing it. Conservatives must be proud.Featured Image: Flickr and Flickr.",News,"January 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted ‘Duck Hunter’ Cruz Goes Full Camo In BIZARRE New Ad Pandering To Idiot America (VIDEO),"Politicians have been known to do a lot of things to get elected. They usually cater and pander to a group of people who they think will have the best chance at casting a vote in their favor. In the case of Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz, those he s decided to cater to are the residents of Idiot America.Cruz has decided to go all in trying to get the ultra-religious, absent from reality, guns and God group of folks who love to hunt, hate gay people and live far away from populated areas. People otherwise known as extreme, right-wing Republicans.Perfectly pandering to this demographic, Cruz paired himself up with Duck Dynasty and their bigot-in-chief Phil Robertson. Robertson is about as anti-gay and bigoted as one could ever hope to be, so of course he s now endorsed one of the leading bigot candidates running for president   Ted Cruz.In a new campaign commercial for Cruz, Robertson, with his face painting black camo for hunting, tells everyone the qualifications he wants to see in a president: Is he or she godly? Does he or she love us? Can he or she do the job? And finally, would they kill a duck and put  em in a pot and make up a good duck gumbo? I ve looked at the candidates. Ted Cruz is my man. (Let s just pause for a second and acknowledge that Robertson said  he or she.  Got to at least give credit where credit is due)Now, as far as Cruz being the man for the job of President of the United States? Yeah, not so much. He s a smarmy man who will say or do anything to get his way. This includes, but is not limited to, likely not even being as religious as he says he is, or as  constitutional  as he claims to be.Cruz tends to do things for show, and no greater example of this can be seen than in this very commercial where he puts on blackface, pardon me, hunting camo paint that looks remarkably like blackface and someone should have told him that, and sits down to hold his gun and  hunt  with Robertson.Cruz is all like,  Look at me! I m just like you! I like to hunt and play make-believe Rambo, too! Ignore the fact that I m insanely wealthy and married to Goldman Sachs! Vote for me!  He knows exactly what he is doing. He s a smart guy, gotta give him that much, which also makes him irrefutably dangerous. He knows how to play the game, get what he wants, and he doesn t seem to care who might get hurt along the way.However, this ad right here, as funny as it may be, because it s pretty goddamn funny, also show to the depths he ll go to cater to a specific voter population. In this case, idiot America.

 Rick Scott Kills Babies By Eliminating Medical Standards After $200K Bribe From Hospital,"Rick Scott is an absolutely horrible governor and literally gives zero f*cks about the people of Florida   even babies. Governor Scott is being accused of eliminating health standards for children s heart surgery after a hospital donated $200,000 to Republicans, including his own political action committee.In 2015, CNN revealed that St. Mary s Medical Center in West Palm Beach had an extremely high mortality rate in their pediatric cardiology program. Between 2011 and 2013, the hospital had a 12.5 percent death rate for open heart surgeries on babies and children; by comparison, the national average was 3.3 percent. So many children were dying at the hospital that in 2014 five independent pediatric heart doctors arrived at the hospital to review the program. The doctors were horrified by what they found, and recommended that the hospital stop performing surgery on babies under six months old and not perform any complicated procedures on older children.The hospital ignored their advice and more children and babies died. The state of Florida was warned by multiple highly respected cardiologists that the hospital had problems, but the state did nothing. Actually, that s not true, they did something far worse than nothing.Two moths after CNN s investigation was published, the state eliminated standards that have been in place for nearly forty years to protect pediatric heart patients. Why? Because during the same period of time that all of the children were dying in St. Mary s, the owners of the hospital, Tenet Healthcare, donated $200,000 to Rick Scott s PAC and the Republican Party of Florida.David Nykanen, co-director of the Heart Center at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, called the move to eliminate the standards AFTER the donations  too much  of a coincidence: The coincidence is just a little too much. It s just a little hard to swallow. Tenet s Shelly Weiss Friedberg told CNN that they had nothing to do with the state s decision: At no time have we discussed the pediatric cardiac standards with the governor or his office, or with any elected official or anyone on their staff. Our opinion was not sought on the standards nor have we expressed a position on the possible repeal of the standards or the role of the Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel. Nyakanen was not convinced, saying, If someone is contributing at that level, obviously they have to have some influence. If Tenet Healthcare contributed so much money, you d think they have the ear of the governor and the politicians. Last month Administrative Law Judge John Van Laningham agreed that the state should do away with the standards, claiming that suggesting the quality of healthcare would diminish is a little insulting to the health care professionals who personally deliver those services.  But at St. Mary s the quality was never there to begin with and if anything the state should have stepped in and prevented the hospital from ever operating on tiny humans again. Of course, this is Rick Scott s Florida that we are talking about and he cares little about the people of the state he was elected to serve.This is not the first time Rick Scott has screwed over the people of Florida when it comes to healthcare. The former hospital CEO/Medicare thief and House Republicans brought the government to a grinding halt when they refused to expand Medicaid to nearly a million of the state s working poor. Now that they have done this, it is absolutely crystal clear that Florida s GOP-led government will stop at nothing to help their donors   even if that means killing your children.Featured image via Facebook",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" President Obama Hammers Republicans: They’re Full Of Hot Air, Bluster, And A Word Starting With A B (VIDEO)","A day after he schooled Republicans during his historic State of the Union Address, President Obama smacked them down again in their own backyard.On Wednesday, President Obama traveled to America s heartland to speak to a crowd in Omaha, Nebraska and just like he did on multiple occasions on Tuesday night, called out Republicans for their bullshit claims about the state of our country. That s how crazy our politics has gotten. Where we now feel obliged to not root for America doing good. So when you hear people peddling this fiction about our enemies getting stronger, America getting weaker, when you hear folks say we can solve challenges by looking meaner or talking tougher, or carpet bombing wherever we want. That s just hot air. It s bluster. It s not serious. There s another word for it that starts with a B  It s baloney. Here  the video via YouTube.During the State of the Union Address, President Obama chided Republicans for refusing to accept the science of climate change, and slammed them for not voting for military action against ISIS even as they claim that he isn t doing enough to stop them.Despite what Republicans like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump say, America is already great and has been getting stronger every day as President Obama s policies continue to make Republicans desperate to destroy him. America has witnessed an unprecedented job growth streak that has reduced unemployment to 5 percent. Meanwhile, more Americans than ever before are gaining health insurance for themselves and their families. President Obama has also taken actions to fight climate change and has struck back against terrorist organizations time and time again over the course of his presidency, dealing heavy blows to their leadership structure in particular.Yet, to hear Republicans talk, you would think that America has been rendered into a wasteland that somehow only they can save. The only problem is that they have to lie repeatedly to make anyone think that. The facts, however, tell us that America is progressing and flourishing despite every Republican attempt to sabotage it over the years. And that s because President Obama has been a great leader, which is why Republicans are so desperate to have us believe that America is falling apart or faces destruction. Because the only way they will ever win the presidency again is if enough Americans actually believe them.Featured Image: Pete Souza",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Virginia Republican Says Conservatives Own Christianity In Attack On Obama For Citing Bible (AUDIO),"A House Tea Party Republican declared that conservatives own Christianity during an attack against President Obama.In his moral defense of granting asylum to thousands of Syrian refugees, President Obama cited the Bible in November to counter anti-refugee conservatives. Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger  - we were strangers once, too,  Obama said. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship. Indeed, the Bible commands Christians to love foreigners and treat them with respect and compassion. Deuteronomy 10:19 states:And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.And Leviticus 19:34 states:The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.The verse President Obama referenced is Exodus 23:9, which states,You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the heart of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.As we all know, Republicans are constantly claiming that America is a Christian nation and that we must adhere to Christian values. So if that is the case, you would think Republicans would jump to support President Obama and his effort to help refugees who are fleeing war and death in their homeland.But they aren t. In fact, they not only oppose President Obama, they are attacking him for using the Bible against them.During an interview with American Family Radio host Sandy Rios on Monday, Virginia Rep. David Brat argued that President Obama can t use the Bible to hit back at conservatives because he says the right-wing owns Christianity, and must indoctrinate people to make sure they are brainwashed to believe that conservatives have a monopoly on Christian values. Our side, the conservative side, needs to reeducate its people that we own the entire tradition. If you lose the moral argument, you lose the policy argument every time, so we need to reclaim the moral argument, where we re so strong. He also claimed that President Obama is using the Bible to build federal power. He s using the Christian tradition and trying to bring about compassion by bonking Republicans over the head with the Bible. It s almost a comedy routine on what compassion and love is. He s mocking his enemies in order to compel a larger federal state using the tradition of love. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.So David Brat believes that Republicans alone own Christianity and have the only right to use the Bible to push their political agenda. Of course, he is assuming that only Republicans are Christians, which is complete bullshit.Brat and his fellow conservatives are just pissed that President Obama used the Bible to reveal them as complete hypocrites. If Republicans really gave a damn about what the Bible said, they d be pushing for universal healthcare, a stronger food stamp program and would welcome refugees with open arms. But they don t, thereby proving that they are nothing more than opportunistic cherry-pickers who abuse religion for their own gain.Featured Image: Wikimedia ",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Dark Money: Ted Cruz Bought His Senate Seat With A Secret Loan From Goldman Sachs,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz (R-TX) secretly obtained a loan from the big pockets of financial giant Goldman Sachs, which he used to provide a decisive financial edge to his U.S. Senate campaign in 2012.Cruz has previously accused Goldman of being the beneficiary of  crony capitalism,  and said they  they seek out and get special favors from government. The loans obtained by Cruz were not disclosed on forms filed with the federal government.Neither loan appears in reports the Ted Cruz for Senate Committee filed with the Federal Election Commission, in which candidates are required to disclose the source of money they borrow to finance their campaigns. Other campaigns have been investigated and fined for failing to make such disclosures, which are intended to inform voters and prevent candidates from receiving special treatment from lenders. There is no evidence that the Cruzes got a break on their loans.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz s presidential campaign, Catherine Frazier, acknowledged that the loan from Goldman Sachs, drawn against the value of the Cruzes  brokerage account, was a source of money for the Senate race. Ms. Frazier added that Mr. Cruz also sold stocks and liquidated savings, but she did not address whether the Citibank loan was used.Cruz is now characterizing the omission of this information as  inadvertent  and a  technical  matter. He went on to say  The facts of the underlying matter have been disclosed for many, many years.  He also told reporters,  All of the information has been public and transparent for many years, and that s the end of that. But the election was over in the fall of 2010, and it is now 2016   a six year gap between when he spent the money and when he finally acknowledged where it came from and how it was used. Cruz failed to amend or update this information for a large sum of money. Considering the candidate s history of playing fast and loose with the truth, there is no independent verification of his claim that the filing was  inadvertent. Cruz s wife Heidi is a managing director at Goldman Sachs in Houston, but is currently on a leave of absence from her job as her husband campaigns for president. When speaking about his wife s career, Cruz omitted the ten years of experience she had at the company.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Westboro Baptist’s Protest Of David Bowie’s Funeral Has Been Perfectly Trolled By Love,"It really doesn t get more pathetic than the folks over at Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas.

 Right-Wing Broadcaster: Teenage Girl Is A ‘Prostitute’ For Being Afraid Of Bundy Militia (VIDEO),"We recently saw the heartbreaking plea of 15-year-old Ashlie Presley, who lives in the area that is currently being occupied by Ammon Bundy and his band of would-be domestic terrorists. She bravely took the microphone and tearfully explained why she was begging the militia to leave. One would think that most people would feel sympathy for her, but no, some people are too callous to feel anything at all. One such person is right-wing broadcast personality Pete Santilli.Presley is the granddaughter of Judge Steven Grasty, and Santilli decided to capitalize on that fact. He said that Grasty had allowed his grandchild to become a  prostitute.  In one of his broadcasts, live from the wildlife refuge where the militants are camped out, Santilli said: That judge was prostituting his granddaughter for political purposes, I m going to call it for what it is. If it were my granddaughter, I would not treat her like a prostitute like he did. He then went on to attack anyone and everyone who opposes what this militia is doing, calling them   bunch of effing communists  for letting the child speak at the meeting. Santilli ranted: What he did with his granddaughter is disgusting. It s called prostitution, okay? Except you gave it up for free  She s a young girl, she did just a masterful dramatic performance. The only reason that anyone needs to be fearful about what s going on around here are the corrupt bastards like her grandfather. He needs to be fearful because we re going to investigate and we re going to bring some justice to a judge. So, it sounds like this guy is not only attacking a vulnerable, scared teenage girl, but he is also threatening a judge. When will these yahoos be arrested?Watch the video of Santilli s vile remarks below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Have To See The Trolls Who Repeatedly Shouted ‘BORING!’ At Donald Trump (VIDEO),"You might ve noticed that Donald Trump didn t really care for President Obama s final State of the Union address. During the address, the billionaire Twitter troll noted the following:The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016See, first of all, State of the Union addresses aren t supposed to be like President Camacho s speech in Idiocracy. In fact, they re not supposed to be like literally any of Trump s nonsensical, lie-filled, stream-of-consciousness pander shows.Also, Trump s talking about Obama here   arguably the greatest political orator in modern history.But here s another explanation for Trump s ridiculous tweet. Hours earlier, Trump held another one of his spoken-word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish, frivolously conducted presidential campaign   wait, correction. He s not satirizing anyone. On purpose. During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting  Boring!  and  We re bored! We came here to be entertained!  at the presumptive Republican nominee. Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered,  Get  em outta here. If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room. Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDML9Cfuw-0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FL Crowd Says ‘Amen’ When ‘Christian’ Man Brags About Molesting Children And Getting Away With It (VIDEO),"Jacksonville, Florida police are investigating a man after he stood in front of the City Council and told them he spent most of his life molesting children and getting away with it.The comments came during a Tuesday night debate over Jacksonville s Human Rights Ordinance, which would further protect the LGBT community in the city. Roy Bay, 56, stood up during the public comment part of the council meeting and said: I lived most of my life sexually assaulting kids and never went to jail. Because why? Kids believed me that hey this is, you re alright son. This is not a problem. Okay? This happens in homosexual lifestyle. Bay claims that the reason he started molesting children was because he was  sexually assaulted by the homosexual community  from the age of ten to twelve.The WHOLE homosexual community? Really? WOW.He said that he  entered into the life of homosexuality  afterwards and that is when he started molesting kids. He then claimed that in 1995 he became a  born-again child of God  and  God set him free  from his lifestyle of raping innocent children. When he mentioned  God  some members of the crowd began to clap and say  amen. News4Jax reports that the sheriff s department was informed of Bay s criminal confession and they said that there will be an investigation into his alleged crimes. There is no statute of limitations for child molestation in the state of Florida if the victims are under the age of twelve. So, it is entirely possible that his LGBT-bashing confession might land him in prison.Bay s assertions that the gay community is filled with predators like himself is completely unfounded. UC Davis published a 1982 study by Dr. A. Nicholas Groth that found that children are not in greater danger of being molested by homosexuals than heterosexuals:Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual.This is because, contrary to what Bay says, rape is never about sexuality, it is about power. The desire to have complete control over somebody is what fuels rapists and if Bay is the predator he claims to be, that is likely the reason he was raping children. The crowd members who shouted  amen  and clapped are probably the same imbeciles who support known child molester Josh Duggar. People like Duggar and Bay hide behind their Bible and commit atrocious crimes all while pushing disgusting stereotypes about the LGBT community to hide their own crimes.Hopefully, the police will find some evidence about this guy s crimes and put him in prison where he belongs.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot ",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Bill To Derail Iran Deal Goes Down In Flames After 100+ Republicans Forget To Show Up To Vote,"The Republican Party is an absolute mess and we re starting to reap the benefits.While the GOP has spent Obama s entire presidency attempting to do nothing to help the country, they ve recently taken it so far that they hardly bother to show up at the Capitol at all. This is creating some really, really stupid problems.It s easy to see why House Speaker Paul Ryan was reluctant to take the job because one of the unenviable tasks he s expected to do is to somehow trick the hundreds of Republican lawmakers he leads into actually doing their jobs once in a while. It s not easy.Recently, an increasingly frustrated Ryan even told Congress that they needed to make more of an effort to show up on time for legislative votes. The process is supposed to take 15 minutes, but with lawmakers slowly trickling in when they feel like it, oftentimes it can go on for an eternity. (If you re getting the sense that lawmakers are behaving worse than high school students dragging their feet to homeroom, you re not the only one.) The lack of urgency means Congress hardly gets anything done. Members should be reminded, members should attempt to come to the floor within the 15-minute period as prescribed by the first ring of the bells. All sides of the aisle,  Ryan said. As a point of courtesy to each of your colleagues, voting within the allotted time would help with the maintenance of the institution. The chair appreciates the members  attention to this matter,  he said with a smile.Apparently, nobody listened, least of all Ryan s fellow Republicans.When it came time for Republicans to vote on a measure meant to derail Obama s historic nuclear deal with Iran, over 130 lawmakers, mostly Republicans, were visibly absent. It appears that voting for a thing they themselves had introduced had slipped their minds. An unhappy Ryan slammed down his gavel after 15 minutes and abruptly ended voting which vacated the tally due to insufficient votes.How big of a screw up was this for Republicans? The window to truly derail Obama s Iranian deal closed with Ryan s gavel. They blew it. Instead, Secretary of State John Kerry says America will begin upholding its obligations to the deal starting in a matter of days, barring any setbacks from Iran. Implementation day, which is the day on which Iran proves that it has sufficiently downsized its nuclear program and can begin to receive sanctions relief, is going to take place very soon, likely within the next coming days somewhere. In a supreme irony, many Republican lawmakers were probably catching up on sleep after spending last night giving breathless interviews disingenuously spreading the lies that Iran was holding American Navy service members hostage. As usual, their lofty rhetoric doesn t match their actions. If Iran was really so dangerous and they cared so much for the troops, would skipping this vital vote really be an option?Yet another example that the dysfunction in Washington stems largely from the Republican Party. As the right-wing movement continues to become swallowed by anti-government extremists who were once considered the radical fringe, even doing the jobs you were elected to do   say, pass legislation   can paint you as a  RINO.  Instead, many Republican lawmakers try their best to destroy the government from the inside by willfully throwing wrenches into the works. But as we ve seen, this  scorched earth  approach can backfire. During those times when Republicans actually do want to accomplish something, they fall apart. We see it here.Another Republican chance to hurt Obama goes down in flames by a needless unforced error due to stupidity, apathy, and laziness. What a legacy this Congress is building for itself. Republicans ought to be so proud.Feature image via io9",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Tries To Discredit POTUS For Saying He Wants To Cure Cancer (VIDEO),"When a president says one of his main goals is to cure a disease that has killed millions and is one of the main causes of death in the United States, one would think that all would applaud such a noble goal. Not so with Fox News, who found a way to try and discredit the president for saying he wants to cure cancer. Here s what the president said last night at his final State of the Union Address: With the new moon shot America can cure cancer. So tonight I m announcing a new national effort to get it done. Let s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. On Fox and Friends, the hosts said that the president or his writers got the idea about curing cancer from the show West Wing because the words he said were apparently similar to a scene from the hit show. Rob Lowe s character, Sam Seaborn  says: We ve reached for the stars, and never have we been closer to having them in our grasp. And so I announce to you tonight, we will cure cancer by the end of this decade. As usual, Fox has the tendency to sensationalize a message instead of applauding the effort of the president.  If you re going to rip off somebody, rip off Aaron Sorkin,  said one of the hosts, referring to West Wing s creator.Whether the words the president said are or aren t similar to a television show is irrelevant because the message itself is so much more important. One can only imagine if the country utilized all its resources to tackle a disease that has wreaked havoc on virtually every American family.Unfortunately, for Fox, finding a way to attack the president takes priority over a wonderful message. It s typical of their so-called right-wing journalism.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 House Republicans’ Attempt To Be Cool With Snapchat TREMENDOUSLY Backfires,"Try as they may, Republicans have just not figured out how to connect with younger generations. They ve locked down a good portion of older white America, but it seems millennials just really don t want much of anything to do with them.However, in an attempt to try to appeal to this younger vote in an election year, the House Republicans decided they would join Snapchat, the infamous social app that deletes what is sent shortly after sending it. It s hugely popular among younger Americans, so they thought they d give a whirl.One problem, though. The man who they used in the GIF to advertise their Snapchat campaign was NOT happy they used him.How do you do fellow kids? House GOP will Snapchat the #SOTU https://t.co/5Tv5hb0GjP #SNAPoftheUnion pic.twitter.com/xc4XF3fmuR  mcbc (@mcbc) January 12, 2016You see, the man in the House GOP s #SnapOfTheUnion campaign is none other than HitFix writer Louis Virtel who also happens to be openly gay. The GIF highlights a moment he snapped his fingers while appearing on Jeopardy last May.Here s Virtel s reaction to being used by the GOP: Hey, GOP! Your candidates are horrifying garbage who ve done nothing for LGBT rights. Don t use my image. GOP, I think every day about closeted gay kids who want to kill themselves because their parents are ignorant, fearful Republicans. Dear GOP: The reason people liked my snap was because it defied regressive, homophobic, scary-ass losers like you. My image is STILL on the odious GOP site.

Way to tell them, Louis!Too bad that GIF is still up on their website, and they are clearly either too stupid or too pompous to take it down. Likely both.The GOP will never catch the clue that younger generations just DO NOT like them for their blatantly derogatory actions taken against not only the gay community, but against nearly every minority in existence. They need to realize, hopefully sooner rather than later, that they are myopic in their views and archaic in their policy. They also need to learn how to make sure the people they are using in their campaigns are on board with being used. However, it s clear they just don t care.Featured image: GOP.gov",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Christian Extremists In Oregon Launch Campaign Of Terror Against Family For ‘Race-Mixing’ (VIDEO),"Christian extremists in Oregon are dragging the nation back to the dark days of Jim Crow laws and cross-burning, with a campaign of terror against a bi-racial family for breaching their racist rules on  racial purity .According to KPTV, the family in Salem, Oregon have become prey to a group of  Christian  KKK Klansmen who want an end to so-called race-mixing. The group have been sending the family handwritten notes containing racial slurs and threats of death   each of them signed with  KKK  and a Christian symbol of the cross. The report states that:One note said,  you and your family will die by the hands of me, die slow. Another note threatened to kill a family member if the police were called again.Brian Lewallen, a neighbor living in the same street as the family, believes the actions of these Christian extremists betrays their cowardice. If you can t deal with your neighbors in a way that is socially reasonable, then what are you doing aside from stoking fears?  he told KPTV.The local police force in Salem are investigating the matter. But as of yet, there are no suspects.The campaign brings to mind some of the darker periods of American history, where segregation laws barred non-whites from schools, universities, libraries and other public spaces. Where black people were forced to sit at the back of the bus. Where African-American men were called  boys , and white children had to be addressed as  Sir  by their black elders.The KKK terrorized the African-American community with almost unimaginable violence, as depicted in gut-wrenching images of lynchings like the one below.Warning: Deeply distressing image.Image via Atlanta Black StarIn total, the Klan murdered 3,446 African-Americans in 86 years. But the terror spread far wider than those killed.Now, in 2016, African-American and bi-racial families in Oregon are in a maddeningly similar situation as they would have been in 1926, 1936, 1946 or 1956. Under threat from Christian extremists, with an openly-racist police chief, and a GOP Party Chair who sold a pro-slavery novel which suggested African-Americans are like  retarded children.

" Man Without Shirt Was Shivering On Train, What Happens Next Restores Faith In Humanity (VIDEO)","Sometimes in life, with all the negativity that seems to saturate our media outlets, it s important to be reminded that there are still extraordinarily kind human beings still out there. One great example of this could be found in a recently taken video on a New York City subway train.NYC in the winter can be brutal. It s even more brutal if you re homeless and don t have much of anything to your name, including the necessary items of clothing to stay warm. On one subway train a man was without a shirt and visibly shivering as he sat by himself. However, what happened next was absolutely breathtaking.Another subway passenger strips down and takes off his shirt. At this point you can see this is where the video recording of the event begins. The man walks over to the man without a shirt, and not only offers him the shirt off his back, but also helps him put it on. And he didn t stop there. He went back and got his warm stocking cap and placed it on the downtrodden man s head.This good samaritan s name is Joey Resto, and according to ABC news: [He]  was taking the downtown  A  train to his home in Brooklyn after work this past Friday when he noticed a homeless man without a shirt shivering from the cold. At the time, temperatures in the city were hovering around 45 degrees. Resto said: He looked cold, hungry like he had just gotten beat up He looked so weak and frail. I had to help him, or he would not put it on. It just came from the heart. I don t know how anyone could have walked past him and had extra clothing and not given it to him. On top of everything he did, Resto still wishes he could have done more, and maybe had something warmer to offer him.Not everyone is the type of person to do what seems so innately right. Many stand by and watch as others suffer, but then there are people like Joey Resto who did what he could, no matter how big or little, to make someone else s existence just a little bit better. Well done. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ <span class=""mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span></span>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, <span class=""mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">fjs</span></span> = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3"";  <span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">fjs</span>.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', '<span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">facebook-jssdk</span>')); // ]]&gt;WATCH: Good samaritan gives shirt off his back to shivering homeless man on NYC train: abcn.ws/22Xc9pLPosted by Good Morning America on Tuesday, January 12, 2016Video/Featured image: Facebook",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Behold, Donald Trump’s 4th-Grader Response To Obama’s ‘Zero F*cks Left’ State Of The Union (TWEETS)","It s been a lousy 24 hours for Donald Trump s campaign to  Make America Great Hate Again    what with President Obama giving a  zero f*cks left  State of the Union Address that reminded the nation of the real gap between conservative and liberal politics. It s the difference between voting for Project Fear or Project Hope.So, how did Donald Trump respond to the State of the Union address? Did he point out any errors in the president s arguments of fact? Did he share a hopeful and ambitious dream for America which we could all get behind? Did he acknowledge the achievements of the president, but call for greater progress?Sadly, Trump did none of those. Instead, he reacted like an overstimulated, under-achieving fourth-grader. Remember the ultimate fourth grade put down to a teacher or authority figure? The feigned yawn and sleep? You re so dull you ve put me to sleep, Sir.Well, that was Trump s response to the 2016 State of the Union speech.The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016Apparently, there were too many grown up words for Trump to follow in this political event. He clearly got so bored that he stopped watching and decided to punch his GOP classmate in the arm to distract himself for a moment.Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016By the time he came back, the speech was over and he felt the need to pass comment. Although it must be said, he may well have just passed wind.The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016And with that, he ran out to the playground to pull on the pigtails of the girl he rather fancies but stands zero chance with.Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016Like any fourth-grader who can t compete in the spelling bee, or get the girl, Trump returns to the common role of playground bully. He decides that he s not satisfied with just punching that GOP classmate in the arm, so goes back to kick him in the shins too.Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016We ve already learned that Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level, but it looks like maybe he is just a spoiled man-child in every way that matters? America, there s a reason U.S. Presidents need to be aged 35 or over   maybe we should have specified that was mental age too.Featured Image via Flickr",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Paul Ryan Try – And Fail – To Hold In A Laugh During One Of Obama’s Jokes (VIDEO),"During last night s State of the Union, Republican politicians attempted to put on a brave face and avoid showing any sort of approval for a single thing that President Obama said. Some succeeded better than others.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan had the toughest job. Sitting directly behind the president, the camera was directly on his face throughout most of the speech. America cringed as Ryan desperately tried to keep his face emotionless and dead while Obama spoke. For the most part, the effect was to make Ryan seem nearly comatose. His dead eyes barely moved. His slackjawed expression radiated defiant stupidity. It was really hard to watch.The farce was blown apart, however, when Obama landed a particularly great zinger and Ryan couldn t help but break into a laugh. Knowing that even flashing a brief smile could send his fanatical Republican colleagues into a blood-thirsty rage, Ryan did everything in his power to stop himself from laughing. His face did things I didn t know a face could do. On live television, Ryan s face went to war with itself.Here s Paul Ryan trying reeeeally hard not to laugh at one of Obama s jokes pic.twitter.com/gqekuYJ1BF  GQ Magazine (@GQMagazine) January 13, 2016At one point, Ryan appears to physically put his tongue in cheek in order to keep it from betraying its Republican values.But if Republicans were trying   and failing   to put on a brave face, President Obama was clearly enjoying himself. In his final State of the Union address he took time to go over the many successes his administration had been able to achieve. He also used the opportunity to blast Republicans for the childish games they continue to play in order to score cheap political points at the expense of real governance.It s unclear whether Obama had known ahead of time that Republicans would be obsessively focusing on not smiling throughout his speech or if he just guessed based on past behavior, but Paul Ryan s idiotic attempts to avoid giving Obama any sort of credit perfectly accented the president s point. Need an example of how delusional the GOP has gotten? The Republican Party, which once claimed to be the party of ideas, couldn t even applaud when the sitting president of the United States said  America is the most powerful nation on Earth.  Even agreeing with him on that point would be  controversial  for these partisan hacks.Thank you, Paul Ryan. Your weird facial expressions can be used whenever America needs a reminder of where your party s priorities really are. And we ll try not to laugh.Watch the full State of the Union address below (Ryan s failed attempt to stifle his laugh begins almost immediately):[youtube https://youtu.be/j4Qp7DxYWYY?t=57m21s]Feature image via C-SPAN",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ammosexual Anti-Obama Organizer Shoots Fellow ‘Patriot’ In Drunken Fight Over A Gun (VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS),"The planned right-wing extremist event Paul Revere 2016 Final March to Restore America hit a snag on Monday when one of the organizers was shot dead. No, the socialist Communist Muslim atheist fascist tyrant Obama didn t have him killed, and he certainly wasn t taken out because he threatens the New World Order s agenda to use chemtrails and HAARP to kill Christians  Charles Carter died at the hands of a fellow conservative in an argument over (shockingly) a gun.Authorities have not released details of the shooting, which occurred in Grayson County, Texas, but the Paul Revere event page announced Carter s death in an emotional plea to God to give the poster  understanding  of the incident.Apparently, God responded, as the event page s current administrator, an organizer of the failure that was the 2 Million bikers 2 DC rally, Bill Williamson, had many more details later in the day.  I am behooved as to what has happened with Charles Carter and Vincent Smith from the Paul Revere event,  the admin complained.  The event that sky rocketed in a week has gone to hell and a handbasket in less then 24 hours Charles is dead, shot in the fore head by Vincent Smith.  The administrator explained that Carter attacked fellow organizer Smith in a drunken argument over a gun (though Smith was allegedly sober):I was in chat with Charles Carter most of the morning and I could see in his post that shit was not right within him. Shortly after Vincent shot Charles then I was on the phone with him and he explained what happened, Vincent was attacked by Charles that was liquored up and enraged. Charles attacked Vincent, snatched his side arm from him and was going to shoot Vincent. Vincent had a spare gun on him and was SOBER and faster then Charles Carter. Vincent Smith I Pray for You Brother as I am Praying for Charles Carter. I Pray that you both find peace. The Texas Marshal has ruled this a self defense, and from talking to Vincent IN DEPTH  I Bill Williamson BELIEVE HIM!  the administrator wrote.  If I am wrong them so be it. Right-wing online radio host Keith Williams also shared his sorrow over the unnecessary example of  responsible gun ownership.  Williams says that Carter was killed by a  fellow patriot  who  was suppose to be his brother in arms and friend. One of their fellow  patriots  says Carter was  shot between the eyes. Recently, the state of Texas made it completely legal to open carry handguns. While it is a felony in the state to carry any firearm while intoxicated, conservatives have traditionally opposed any and all firearms safety laws, viewing them as some sort of plot to grab guns from  patriots  like them. Unfortunately, we can expect to see  responsible gun owners  and  good guys with guns  (as the NRA calls every (white) person carrying a weapon until, of course, they commit a crime) shooting their friends family members, and enemies alike until we reform our firearms laws.Watch a video of Carter ironically begging conservatives to stop fighting with each other below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Stop behaving like childrenPAUL REVERE 2016 FINAL MARCH TO RESTORE AMERICA ( PAGE )WAKE UP AMERICA ( PAGE )Posted by Charles Carter on Saturday, January 9, 2016Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 These Memes Of Republicans During State Of The Union Will Totally Make Your Day (IMAGES/VIDEO),"Much like all of his other speeches, President Barack Obama s 2016 State of The Union speech was visionary, engaging and all-around amazing. Touching on a variety of political issues such as gun violence, addiction awareness, the Syrian refugee crisis, racial injustice and education, last night s speech definitely lived up to all of the president s previous State of The Union addresses and was possibly even greater.As we ve come to live in such a digitally connected society, it should come as no surprise that the internet started to respond immediately to Obama s final SOTU broadcast. As millions of Americans watched Obama, Twitter worked overtime to churn out a seemingly endless number of hilarious, quick-witted memes, capturing some of the most notable and comical moments of the event s guests and members of Congress. No one was spared   if you ended up on camera, you were pretty much instantly made into an internet meme. This was especially true if you were unfortunate enough to be a Republican.From GOP presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump to Kim Davis and Paul Ryan (who REALLY got it bad!), these memes have made our Commander-in-Chief s last SOTU all the more memorable. Here are our Republican-slamming favorites from last night s address:TwitterThis woman s face is something we can all relate to when it comes to Republican front runner Donald Trump TwitterSpeaker of The House Paul Ryan got slammed particularly hard!

 The Bundy Militia Now Has An ISIS Supporter Handling Their Computer Work (VIDEO),"David Fry is a self-titled  computer expert  that has joined the Bundy occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. He is also a huge fan of Adolf Hitler and supports ISIS.A post that Fry made to his Google+ account read as follows: ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS FOR ISIS TO NUKE ISRAELHELL! Source: opb.orgWhen asked by OPB to explain why he supported ISIS and liked Hitler, he spoke about government conspiracies, plots against other nations, the September 11th attacks, the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the world with nuclear meltdowns.One week before Fukushima happened, an Israeli security team installing security equipment was there at Fukushima.Source: opb.orgFry explained that he drove from Ohio to join the occupation because he felt the Bundy militia consisted of  pretty good people. It was (a) miracle, that I got here,  Fry said.  I ve had quarrels with the government myself, and I feel there has to be some point where people have to put their foot down against the problems.Source: opb.orgFry is currently occupying his time using government computers to allegedly make a website for the Oregon occupation. The website is defendyourbase.net, which has various videos of militants, but it also has videos from video games and other very non-freedom related items, some of them from months ago.Why would a website made for the militia, have videos from months ago of some dude playing video games? It s a good question and I can offer one suggestion.Fry didn t make the website for the occupation.

 Colbert’s Merciless Mockery Of Oregon Militants’ Supply Requests Is Absolutely Perfect (VIDEO),"The domestic terrorists currently occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon sure are soft. As their occupation stretches out, they have been sending around supply lists. These requests include everything from clean underwear to shampoo and conditioner. In fact, the mother of lead occupier Ammon Bundy has been making sure the militants are comfortable, by helping them beg for the things they need to keep breaking the law.Cue Stephen Colbert s endless supply of comedy. And no, Bundy s mother was not off limits. With regards to her helping spread the word about needed supplies, Colbert said: She would deliver the items herself, but the clubhouse sign clearly says,  No girls allowed. Colbert then went on to mock the militants  requests for things like shampoo and conditioner, saying: It s one thing to face off against the jackbooted thugs of the tyrannical government, (but) it s another to have to fight the frizzies. You want hair to bounce and behave. They really gave the Late Show host plenty of material when they begged for French Vanilla coffee creamer and throw rugs. They re either starting a revolution, or they re opening a bed and breakfast. It s just like Patrick Henry said:  Give me French vanilla or give me hazelnut   they re both yummy.

" I Got This! GOP Melts Down Over Iran Detaining Navy, Obama Brings ‘Em Home (VIDEO)","As President Obama delivered his final State of the Union address, America once again was given a textbook case of the contrast between the right s erratic, dangerous leadership and Obama s calm and effective posture.When news broke that members of the U.S. Navy had been detained by Iran, the right went into meltdown mode.Marco Rubio said it was part of a pattern of Iran testing a  weak  Obama administration. Ted Cruz said it was  striking  that Obama didn t throw out his address and instead speak about the situation. Ben Carson whined,  While President Obama is complaining about global warming 10 of our American sailors are held in Iranian custody.  John McCain thundered that  Iran has already achieved a propaganda victory by announcing that they had  arrested  Americans on board American warships. Minutes before the State of the Union address was set to be delivered, Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) told CNN that the President should consider delaying it until the seamen had been returned while Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) described the situation as  humiliating  for Obama.The pundits were in action too, with MSNBC s Joe Scarborough tweeting,  Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay. But as we ve seen so many times over this presidency, while the right was throwing feces and freaking out, President Obama was getting something done. The seamen were freed on Wednesday morning without shots being fired, without a lot of noise and fury and drama, without a lot of unnecessary saber rattling.Iran has released two United States Navy patrol boats and 10 crew members who were described as  trespassing  in Iranian waters near a major naval base, state news media reported on Wednesday.The Pentagon and the State Department said that one of the boats had experienced mechanical problems en route to Bahrain from Kuwait on a routine mission on Tuesday, and the Iranians appeared to have accepted that explanation.Secretary of Defense Ash Carter praised the successful resolution: I am pleased that ten U.S. Navy sailors have departed Iran and are now back in U.S. hands. I want to personally thank Secretary of State John Kerry for his diplomatic engagement with Iran to secure our sailors  swift return. Around the world, the U.S. Navy routinely provides assistance to foreign sailors in distress, and we appreciate the timely way in which this situation was resolved. America was able to quickly and safely resolve the situation because unlike during the Bush administration, a diplomatic line of communication is now open between America and Iran. Instead of a wall of silence between the two countries, there is now a process in place to deescalate tension and an agreement now in operation to steer Iran away from becoming a nuclear state.Instead of freaking out and pounding his fist leading to Iran making the world more dangerous, President Obama has chosen the other path and it is a brand of leadership that has and will make the world safer.Featured image via Vox",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Kim Davis Utters Four Words To Describe Obama’s Speech – Gets Burned Alive For It (VIDEO),"Rowan county clerk Kim Davis already had her five minutes of fame; her time is over and done with. Or is it? At, least, it was until some Republican by the name of Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) gave tickets to President Obama s last State of the Union address to the Family Research Council, who then, in turn, gave the exclusive rights to one of the tickets to Mrs. Davis.Now, unfortunately, her five minutes of fame has been extended to six minutes. Heck, we wouldn t even grant her that right if she wasn t one of the top trending topics in the internet chatter world Tuesday night. But, the reality is, she is. For some reason, people can t get enough of Kim Davis   she must have all the makings of a star.A reporter caught up with Davis after Obama concluded his last remarks for the night, and uttered just four words of what she thought about her experience: It was a speech. En exclusivit  mondiale, Kim Davis pour l'AFP. ""Je voulais encourager tous les Chr tiens"" pic.twitter.com/yoCzflde2m  Ivan Couronne (@ivancouronne) January 13, 2016While not the kindest reply (it certainly was much more of a speech), it also wasn t the most thought-provoking either. But, hey, what else do you expect coming from the mouth of Kim Davis? Here is a suggestion for Kim, in four words:  just do your job.In all fairness, the internet was much harsher to her than her characterization of the president s speech ever was, and it s not even close. While it s never a good thing to be mean, she must have known a good roasting was coming her way.Here are a few of the top (and funniest) comments she received on the internet after so brazenly deciding to show her face on the most important day in politics.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.What can we say? Kim keeps showing up in the limelight and we, as a people, continue taking the bait. She may not be relevant, but she sure is a target   no one can disagree with that. Her facial expressions were probably some of the most scrutinized, right up there with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. He appeared virtually emotionless throughout the entire speech, with a few slight movements here and there. It was almost like there was an unannounced contest between him and Kim Davis on who could appear to be the least interested in whatever the president was saying. Maybe they were playing chicken with each other; we don t know. What is clear is that Kim Davis will forever be in our memories, if not in our hearts.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Nikki Haley Inadvertently Supports Obama’s Refugee Policy While Exploiting The Charleston Massacre (VIDEO),"Tuesday night, after President Obama gave his final State of the Union Address, Governor Nikki Haley (R-SC) delivered the Republican rebuttal. During her speech, though, she accidentally supported the Democratic Party s Syrian refugee policy while trying to exploit the Charleston massacre to take political shots at Donald Trump.After she was finished calling President Obama a failure, Governor Haley turned her attention to our immigration problem and the Syrian refugee crisis, saying: At the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. We can t do that. We cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally. And in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined. That line about refugees is one Republicans often say to justify their refusal to help the desperate families fleeing from unthinkable violence in Syria. While this comment was not surprising, later on she said something that sounded an awful lot like a contradiction.Towards the middle of her speech, Governor Haley spoke about the Mother Emanuel massacre that took the lives of nine black churchgoers when a white supremacist decided that he wanted to start a race war. She said: This past summer, South Carolina was dealt a tragic blow. On an otherwise ordinary Wednesday evening in June, at the historic Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, twelve faithful men and women, young and old, went to Bible study. That night, someone new joined them. He didn t look like them, didn t act like them, didn t sound like them. They didn t throw him out. They didn t call the police. Instead, they pulled up a chair and prayed with him. For an hour. She went on to take a not-so-subtle shot at Donald Trump: We didn t turn against each other s race or religion. We turned toward God, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world. So, while trying to exploit the Charleston massacre and taking shots at Trump, she accidentally supported Obama s policies. She said even though Dylann Roof did not look like the Mother Emanuel churchgoers, they embraced him because those are real American  values.  Haley is absolutely right! That is what our country is all about.The United States was built on the intrinsic belief that we are a free nation that welcomes everyone   especially the desperate, downtrodden souls of other nations. We are also a nation the does not let the fear of  others  overcome us and scare us into not helping people. Obviously, by this statement, she understands that the Syrian refugees perfectly fit this description and we should open our arms just like the beautiful victims of the Charleston did. I m sure that if you ask her if she meant her comments in this way, she ll say  no  and THAT is what makes them so great.Thanks for the support, Governor Haley! Obama appreciates it!Watch her rebuttal below:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"January 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The Good, The Bad And The Ugly Aspects Of Obama’s Latest Presidential Report Card (IMAGE)","With President Obama s final State of the Union address is receding into history, FactCheck.org has released its presidential report card for January, and the news is mostly positive for the administration. Homicides have dropped 13 percent, but gun sales have surged.  The economy has added more than 9 million jobs, and the jobless rate has dropped to below the historical median.  The number of long-term unemployed Americans has dropped by 614,000 under Obama, but it is still 761,000 higher than at the start of the Great Recession.  Corporate profits are up 166 percent; real weekly wages are up 3.4 percent.  There are 15 million fewer people who lack health insurance.  Wind and solar power have nearly tripled, and now account for more than 5 percent of U.S. electricity.  The federal debt has more than doubled   rising 116 percent   and big annual deficits have continued.The chart below illustrates in more detail some of the positives and negatives, but at a glance, the president seems to been doing extraordinarily well on the economy, with the exception of income inequality and the comparatively flatlined weekly wages. An increased number of food stamp recipients since 2008 is never a good thing, but the good news is that the number has dropped since the previous FactCheck report.Regarding jobs, the following analysis of the decline in the infamous  labor participation rate  jumped off the screen:Contrary to many of Obama s critics, however, that decline is due mostly to factors outside the control of any president   factors such as the post-World War II baby boomers reaching retirement age. Survey data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in December show that those outside the labor force in 2014 said their reasons for not working were retirement (44 percent), illness or disability (19 percent), school attendance (18 percent) or home responsibilities (15 percent). Only 3 percent said they couldn t find a job, or gave some other reason.In other words, the Republicans often cite the low labor participation rate as a consequence of Obama s policies. Only, it s not. It s retiring baby boomers. Again, only three percent of the rate can be attributed to jobs. At most.Here s the entire FactCheck report card.Featured image via WhiteHouse.gov.",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 How Kim Davis Got A Seat To Attend State Of The Union Is Just As Pathetic As Kim Davis,"If there s one person in this entire nation who does not deserve a seat at the State of the Union, it s Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis. Her reckless abuse of her position of power to deny same-sex couples the right to marry was outright unconstitutional. So unconstitutional, in fact, that it put her in prison.To top it off, she s not even attending to listen to the president, but rather just be a bigot counterweight  in the crowd. According to her lawyer, Mat Staver: She is not so much looking forward to going so much because of what President Obama has to say, she doesn t have much interest in that, as much as just to be there, to be a visible counterweight. The most bizarre part of her invitation is that the Congressman who invited her didn t even know that s who he was inviting. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) apparently didn t have a clue. He told HuffPo: I didn t invite anyone,  Jordan initially said late Tuesday afternoon, as he was jogging to House votes. When pressed on whether he had given his ticket to the Family Research Council, which then gave it to Davis   which is what a Democratic aide told HuffPost had happened   Jordan said he would have to confirm with his office.  I don t know,  he said.When Jordan was seen later, he confirmed the invitation: Yeah, so we gave a ticket to   at the request of the Family Research Council   we gave the ticket to Kim Davis  family I found out today. I m being totally honest with you: That s   Family Research Council asked us, her family wanted a ticket, and we said  OK.' Jordan seems clearly okay with the decision, because even though she s a criminal who didn t follow the law, conservatives nationwide see her as some sort of religious martyr doing her due diligence in the name of the Lord, Constitution be damned.Should Davis be able to attend one of the most prestigious annual events in the nation? Of course not. But leave it to Republicans and their quest to bring bigotry front and center as part of their party platform.Featured image: YouTube ",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" ‘Tehran’ Tom Cotton Insults U.S. Troops, Tries To Spark War With Iran In Disgraceful Interview (VIDEO)","Nobody has spent more of his political career trying to undermine his own government than Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK). The Tea Party Republican most known for his borderline treasonous letter he sent to Iran in a shameful attempt to derail sensitive nuclear negotiations between President Obama and Iran s government. His ravings failed to accomplish anything and in recent months he s been relegated to the obscurity he deserves. Until now.On the night of the State of the Union, Cotton went on CNN s  Situation Room  to openly and egregiously spread lies about President Obama, even while a difficult situation was unfolding in Iran. On Tuesday evening, the Navy announced that two of its ships, and 10 U.S. sailors, were being held by the Iranian government after the boats floated into the country s territory.Conservatives rapidly lost their minds, even while details continued to come in suggesting the international incident was minor and, in all likelihood, harmless.The Americans were on a training mission in the Persian Gulf when the riverine boats experienced  a navigational or mechanical difficulty  and appear to have drifted into Iranian waters, according to the Pentagon. Iranian Coast Guard boats brought the vessels to a Revolutionary Guard base on Farsi Island, officials said.U.S. officials said they believe that craft steered off course and that the crew was aided, not captured, by Iranian forces. There doesn t seem to be anything malicious at work on either side,  according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal assessment.Iran said it was working on releasing the crew members  promptly. No big deal, right? In fact, the very lack of hostilities supports the idea that the tensions between the United States and Iran is cooling off, thanks to President Obama s commitment to negotiations.Not as Sen. Cotton tells it. Speaking straight into the camera, Cotton spews lie after lie. His only agenda, to hurt the president s reputation and provoke a hostile response from Iran.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3j8cFq6vUU]In labeling the ships  captured  and the crew held  hostage,  Cotton is viciously lying about the troops. They weren t taken by force. They aren t gagged and bound somewhere in enemy territory. Their boat experienced difficulties and they were rescued by Iranian ships. They never surrendered. The United States was never asked to  apologize  to the Iranians.But by fear-mongering to score political points, Cotton does risk inflaming tensions. Not that the lives of these men and women register in the deep, dark cavity where Cotton s brain allegedly lives. It s clear that even waiting until the sailors are safely out of Iran is too much to ask for a Republican who is hell-bent on painting the Middle Eastern country as a dangerous enemy.As usual, American soldiers are being used by a Republican to serve his agenda. Secretary of State John Kerry couldn t do an interview with CNN, even if it might have helped Democrats in the polls, he was too busy talking personally with Iranian officials, coordinating the release of these soldiers.So going into tonight s State of the Union, where rhetoric on both sides will be high, ask yourself this: Which politician  supports  the troops more? The one who uses them as bargaining chips to lie his way into better poll numbers or the one who spent the last few hours making sure they get home safely.Feature image via YouTube",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ann Coulter Gets EATEN ALIVE By GOP Strategist, And It’s WILDLY Entertaining (VIDEO)","There s something wildly entertaining about conservative infighting, especially when the person on the receiving end is Ann Coulter. She s not only racist, she s unapologetically racist, so clearly her choice for president is Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.As some say, the Republican Party may not be racist, but most racists are Republican. This was proved more so now than ever, and calling Coulter out on her anti-immigration/pro-Trump stance is GOP strategist Liz Mair.It all happened on MSNBC s Hardball where host Chris Matthews invited the two women on to discuss their viewpoints. After several minutes of meaningless banter, Coulter eventually settled on saying: It s all about immigration. It doesn t really matter what a Republican s position is on saving Social Security or how they re going to reform Medicare. Americans are being outvoted by foreigners, and Americans have been begging their own party to shut it down, to stop this endless immigration for decades now. As well as insisting that  Donald Trump is the first one to actually take America s side on immigration. That s why he is sweeping the polls. Mair jumped in and shut her down, saying: I think that that s a patently ludicrous notion. Most of the time, when we ve been looking at  amnesty fights,  they ve actually been shut down by a set of groups that are funded by population-control enthusiast liberal who is actually involved with zero-population growth and the Sierra Club. That s who s actually shut it down. It s not actually in any way advancing the economic interests of the American people. Free-market economists actually agree with that. Mair even goes so far as to call Trump a liberal. However, Trump is more of a  I m gonna say what makes me popular  kind of guy, and since his racism is working, he s run with it, or rather, on it. When Mair brought up that Coulter used to support Romney, Coulter bit back: My ideal ticket is Trump/Romney. That s what I m really hoping for. That s a dynamite combination. She s not wrong, that ticket certainly would be explosive for the United States, but not in a good way. Mair, however decided to continue tearing Coulter apart, saying: That is the proof right there that you are in no way conservative and no way interested in conservative policy. It s true. Coulter seems to only be concerned with being as racist as possible, and Trump fits the bill for that. Her love of Romney likely stems from the 47% remarks that were blatantly racist in his attack against President Obama and his supporters. And while conservative politics aren t always that blatantly racist, they aren t exactly inconspicuous either. Mair seems to believe that Trump supporters are just  liberals who just happen to hate Mexicans. Here s the thing   BOTH women are wrong about pretty much everything.So, while it was a pleasure to see Coulter get torn apart by a fellow conservative, Mair needs to realize that Coulter is pretty much the exact epitome of modern-day conservatism and conservative policy in the new GOP.

 Virginia Republicans Want To Verify Kids’ Genitals Before They Use School Bathrooms,"Conservative Christian lawmakers in Virginia have gotten extremely pervy and filed a transphobic bill this week that would force schools to verify a child s genitals to ensure that they re using the restroom that agrees with their  correct anatomical sex. Sponsored by Republican Del. Mark Cole, House Bill 663 (otherwise known as  Use of restroom facilities; penalty)  would prevent transgender students from using the bathroom that matches their gender, defining  anatomical sex  as the physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person s anatomy.  The bill states: Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Under the legislation, schools would be given the discretion and flexibility of letting students use a  single stall restroom  or  controlled  access to an empty restroom. The penalty for students who use the wrong restroom could be a fine of $50.Since the bill s filing, many have raised questions about how exactly the Republicans intend to verify a child s anatomically corresponding restroom. After the bill was proposed, civil rights advocate Tim Peacock criticized the bill, stating that  adults would be required to inspect children s genitals before they use the bathroom  for the law to be enforced. Peacock warned that the bill violated children s privacy, and was completely inappropriate and unnecessary: This is what the conservative movement has devolved into: forcing children to allow adults to examine their genitals out of misplaced fear that transgender kids and adults might commit a hypothetical never-before-seen act of violence or sexual aggression (that would still be against the law with or without transgender protections). This is just the latest   and certainly not the last   assault on transgender people by the religious right. In the past, Republican Colorado lawmaker Gordon Klingenschmitt tried (many times) to prevent transgender people from having access to public restrooms. Even Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee has disrespected the trans community and made a disgustingly insensitive joke by saying he wished he d been able to say he was transgender in high school so he would have been able to shower  with the girls. Transgender people are becoming a target for the God-fearing Republican party more and more often, and protections must be put in place to control these outbursts of bigotry.Featured image via Mark Cole Facebook page",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bundy Militia Just ADMITTED They Have Been Accessing Government Files,"Recently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is looking into allegations that the armed militants who staged a takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge had accessed government files on the computers at the federal facility. The allegations arose after the group accidentally allowed Oregon Public Broadcasting to see that multiple computers had been turned on and government IDs and files were strewn about an office at the wildlife preserve. After Finnicum realized he shouldn t have allowed OPB to access the room, he quickly picked up lists of names and Social Security numbers by the computers, and hid government employee ID cards that were previously in plain sight,  OPB noted in its report   though Ammon Bundy denied at the time that his pretend army had touched anything: No, we haven t touched a single personal item. We haven t touched any of the computers, we haven t tried to log on   we haven t done anything. We re not here to hurt people, not even the people who work here. On Tuesday, terrorist group leader Ammon Bundy admitted that he and his followers have been going through government documents stored at the refuge. Not only does he intend to release the documents to the public, but Bundy claims that they will help get Steven and Dwight Hammond, two dangerous felons currently serving prison time for arson, released back into the population.Frighteningly, this means that the armed domestic terrorists now have access to personal information of Refuge employees, some of whom have already been threatened and harassed   causing them to flee the area. While Bundy still denies accessing computers, he fully admits to going through paper files at Malheur. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who manages the facility, says that because personally identifiable information may be among the files they have accessed, the agency is   is taking necessary steps to ensure employee and family safety.  Spokesman Jason Holm strongly condemned the actions of Vanilla ISIS: Removing fences, damaging any Refuge property, or unauthorized use of equipment would be additional unlawful actions by the illegal occupiers. Any movement of cattle onto the Refuge or other activities that are not specifically authorized by USFWS constitutes trespassing. There are sixteen full-time and one part-time employee at the refuge, all of whose lives are threatened by this rogue militia s illegal access of the information. Strangely, unlike unarmed and peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters, these terrorists have been met with zero interference from law enforcement, who has given them permission to come and go as they please. They re even free to be sent literal bags of dicks and other items from supporters and haters across the nation. Their presence creates such a strain that a Harney County judge has announced he will be billing Ammon Bundy upwards of $70,000 per day for the additional security needed in the area because of their insurgency.The militia s presence has caused numerous school cancellations up to 30 miles away, and forced refuge employees to work from home, at another office, or take administrative leave   as well as make locals fearful for their lives. However, the passive response to the Bundy militia may not last much longer. Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward says that law enforcement will not be intimidated from doing their jobs  and   there s an hour glass and it s running out. Hopefully, it runs out soon   before someone is hurt or killed.Featured image via OPB",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rand Paul Throws A Fit After Being Kicked Out Of Next Republican Debate (TWEETS),"Rand Paul and Carly Fiorina have recently received word that they have been left out of the next Republican presidential debate   and one of them isn t taking it very well.Thursday night s GOP debate in North Charleston, South Carolina is set to feature the usual knuckleheads: Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich. Paul found out that he wasn t included in the debate last night, and couldn t contain his disappointment. Referring to the slight as a  rotten  thing to do, Paul posted several angry tweets about his exclusion from the line-up,  and even told CNN that he is boycotting the debate and  won t participate in anything that s not first tier because we have a first tier campaign. .@RandPaul: I will not participate in an undercard debate https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/s27wHk5elS  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 11, 2016Fox Business  January 14 debate marks the first time only seven candidates will be in the Republican debate, allowing candidates to be included based on the average of the five most recent national polls and the top five candidates in Iowa or New Hampshire. Paul didn t qualify, but he doesn t want to accept that. He told CNN: It s a mistake because the thing is we actually have been in the top five or six in most of the recent polls. In fact, last week in a national poll we were just one point out of fourth place. So I think it s a mistake to try to exclude me from the national debate. Continuing his temper tantrum on social media, Paul busied himself with retweeting posts from supporters that painted him in a more favorable light.Rand was so angry, that he also released this statement:And of course when all else failed to get his point across, Paul begged his  supporters  for donations to prove the media wrong:Paul has not had much luck in the polls, coming in consistently low compared to his fellow GOP candidates   but he apparently felt entitled to this debate and felt he should be given the chance to bore voters with his speeches, despite the fact that they ve already proven that they re not interested. For a man who was once considered the most interesting man in American politics, that s certainly a hard pill to swallow.Featured image via Medill DC / Flickr",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bundy Militia Loses It Over Bag Of D**ks (VIDEO),"Last week, social media was filled with memes mocking the Bundy Militia s plea for snacks. Unfortunately for the imbeciles currently occupying federal land, America had a lot of fun and sent the militants a bunch of stuff that they did not like. Patriot  and well-known white supremacist Jon Ritzheimer posted a video on Facebook on Monday complaining about the various items people have sent the militia in lieu of the snacks, tampons and cigarettes the group asked for: It was really mind-blowing to me that people would actually spend their money (on this),  he said.  This box right here, $17.90 (for shipping). They spend and waste their money on all this hateful stuff to send out here to us and buy this ridiculous stuff. This one was really funny   a  bag of dicks.  Rather than going out and doing good, they just spend all their money on hate and hate. In the video you then see Ritzheimer rage sweep the stuff off of the table and onto the floor. He declares: We re going to clear the table and we re going to continue to do work and do good for our country. We re not going to be deterred, we re not gonna let you and all your junk and hate mail sidetrack us Honestly, we don t know what he s talking about. Americans were just trying to give him a nice bag of d*cks to snack on! They re gummy and delicious, why doesn t he want our gifts?Perhaps the best part of the video was the caption under it. Ritzheimer often exploits his military service to justify his hatred for the Muslim community, but under the video he says: To my family, I love you very much and I am sorry I can t be there with you. Please look at this as a deployment, only this time I m actually serving my country rather than being sent over seas to line the pockets of corrupt politicians. So, what? Now he doesn t believe he honorably served his country while in the military? If that s the case he needs to stop talking about being a former Marine. Our military deserves more respect that some guy who just rolls out his service when it s convienant for him   like so many other Tea Party Republicans do.I think that what this  patriot  really wants is more stuff. So if you have a few extra dollars to spare, maybe you could also send him some mouth watering d*cks to chew on while he is actively fighting against the country he claims to  love  so much.Watch his angry rant:https://www.facebook.com/scrappyphx.rider/videos/469856286535510/Featured image via video screenshot ",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Teary-Eyed 15-Year-Old Girl BEGS Y’all Qaeda To Leave: ‘I Shouldn’t Have to Be Scared In My Own Hometown’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that the Bundy militia s presence at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon is unpopular. Even those who agree with the sentiments behind the right-wing armed occupation of the federal property feel that it s best for the wannabe cowboys to skedaddle. Despite being offered a free pass out of the area, the ammosexual clan has made it very clear that they intend to stay  for years    even putting out calls for snacks, tampons, and clean underwear (mommy forgot to pack for them and isn t there to do their laundry) to help them on their mission to get even more free stuff.On Monday, Harney County residents put their differences aside and, whether or not they agree with the professed sentiments of the Bundy clan, rallied behind one thing: getting the armed madmen the f*ck out of there. While many made some excellent points about the grown men playing Army, one 15-year-old-girl s emotional plea stole the stage. I am 15 and I m a freshman in high school,  Ashlie Presley said, barely able to get her words out through the tears.   Being here with all this honestly has scared me. And it shouldn t.  She continued, fighting through the sadness of what the Bundys and their buddies have done to her town: I should not have to be scared in my own hometown. I know that all of my friends have been scared and have come to me to know what to do and I have to be the one to tell them that it s going to be OK, that everything s going to be OK. I shouldn t have to be scared, and none of us in Harney County should have to be scared in our hometown,  she concluded.While law enforcement refuses to take action and, for some reason, criminal prosecution seems unlikely, a local judge has vowed to bill Ammon Bundy up to  $70,000 per day for security costs to the county   so, at least it will become more expensive for Bundy s pretend army to continue its armed occupation of a bird sanctuary.Watch this teen beg Bundy and friends to stop terrorizing everyone below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

To help him along in this endeavor, he called in one of his correspondents, Roy Wood Jr., who tried to help Noah to know what to expect.However, there was only one thing Wood seemed certain of: Obama is leaving office and he s gonna say and do whatever the f*ck he wants. Wood told Noah: More of a preview of the exhibits in the Obama presidential library   the Affordable Care Act, the climate change deal, how he taught not one but two Portuguese water dogs to fist-bump. But what I do know for sure about this year s speech? Obama has no more f*cks to give. Wood referenced the twitter photo, tweeted out from President Obama s official account while hammering this most important point home.This is it President Obama's final #SOTU. Say you'll be watching: https://t.co/W8niWpEVnX pic.twitter.com/NmLWydsePO  Barack Obama (@BarackObama) January 4, 2016Wood continued, commenting on Obama s smirk: Look at his face   he does not care. That s the same face I make when I m about to leave my job. He then went on to point out to Trevor Noah just what the SOTU actually is, and how the president is supposed to, no matter what, assure the American people that things are going great, no matter what is actually happening. You know Trevor, when America asks you if it looks fat in its jeans, it s not really looking for an honest answer. Just say America has a bangin  a*s and be done with it. And he s exactly right. And after all President Obama has been through, all the right-wing hate and obstruction, yet still managed to accomplish so much, he deserves to have a bit of fun.So, go for it, Mr. President.

" Oregon Judge Sticks It To Ammon Bundy, Plans To Charge Him $70,000 A Day For Security Costs","An Oregon judge has had enough of the hillbilly Bundy militia and is now saying that he plans to bill the leader, Ammon Bundy, up to $70,000 a day for security costs.The armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge by the anti-government group has caused major disruptions in Harney County, and it doesn t seem like the merry band of imbeciles plan to leave anytime soon. According to reports, the group has used federal equipment to remove fences that separated the federal property from a local rancher.In addition to the damage they have caused on the property, the militants forced 800 kids to miss a week of school because the school board was worried about the safety of students.Police also report that they have had to relocate the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife employees from their homes  out of an abundance of caution  because the group possibly found out their personal information.  The group has been accused of illegally accessing the government computers in the building. Reporters with Oregon Public Radio claim that they say the computers on screensaver mode and a list of social security numbers out on the desks.Harney County Judge Steve Grasty spoke at a town hall meeting on Monday night and said that the militia is costing taxpayers between $60,000 to $70,000 a day. We re going to send Mr. Bundy the bill,  said Grasty.It s ironic that this group of jackasses, who claim to love the citizens of this country, are wasting taxpayer dollars every single day with this nonsense. Tea Party Republicans claim to be  fiscally responsible  and then waste $700,000. What s even worse is that GOP lawmakers are supporting the continued occupation of federal land and that is costing Harney County so much money. While these lawmakers encourage this behavior, they actively deny all sorts of social programs to low-income families because they claim that we cannot  afford  it. Seems legit, right?

" President Obama: Surely, Trump Can Only Be President On A Saturday Night Live Skit (VIDEO)","Only hours before he is set to deliver the last State of the Union Address of his historic presidency, President Obama found time to lampoon Donald Trump s chances of becoming president.The Today Show asked President Obama if he could possibly imagine a scenario where Trump wins on Election Day in November, only to receive a ten word quip in response.  Well, I can imagine it   in a  Saturday Night  skit,  Obama hilariously said.Then President Obama took a serious tone and warned that anything is possible. After all, who would have ever predicted that George W. Bush would use the conservative-leaning Supreme Court to steal the 2000 Election? That s why Obama warned Americans to not be complacent, essentially telling them that staying home on Election Day could give Trump the victory ever has nightmares about. But Obama was also expressed faith that Americans would reject Trump and his hateful rhetoric. I m pretty confident that the overwhelming majority of Americans are looking for the kind of politics that does feed our hopes and not our fears, that does work together and doesn t try to divide is that isn t looking for simplistic solutions and scapegoating. Vice-President Joe Biden was also interviewed by Today, and he warned that allowing Trump to become president would only make America weaker. He is divisive   I think he d have to acknowledge that he s very divisive   and that s not healthy. We always do best when we act as one America. We always do poorly when we appeal to our fears and our differences. Here s the video via Today.Trump currently enjoys a wide lead in New Hampshire and has regained the lead in some Iowa polls over Ted Cruz. It s not decided yet, but Trump appears to be heading toward becoming the Republican presidential nominee and he ll either face Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in a general election that is sure to be one of the nastiest presidential contests in history. Some Democrats have suggested that they will stay home if their preferred Democratic candidate is not on the ballot. And that is precisely the kind of complacency and irresponsibility that President Obama just warned against because that kind of divide is exactly what would let Trump become the leader of the free world with a Republican-dominated House and Senate instead of keeping him in Saturday Night Live skits where he belongs.Featured Image: Instagram ",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Views On China’s Handling Of Tiananmen Square Will Make You Despise Him Even More,"The protest turned massacre at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989 is one of the defining moments of the 20th century. The world looked on as a young man jumped in front of a tank to stop its progress a day after the Chinese military enforced martial law on civilian protesters. Reports state anywhere from hundreds to thousands of civilians were killed with possibly tens of thousands more beaten, wounded and imprisoned.It was a humanitarian nightmare so disturbing that the Chinese still won t allow anyone to talk about it more than a quarter-century later. Virtually everyone with a conscience condemned the Chinese for the unnecessary use of force they exacted on their own people. Everyone, that is, but Donald Trump.In an interview in 1990, when the blood was still visible on the sidewalks of Beijing, Trump talked about the massacre in an interview with Playboy Magazine: When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak   as being spit on by the rest of the world. Even back then Donald Trump was all about  strength.  To a nitwit like him, the strength of the Tiananmen Square massacre came from the tanks that ran over students on bicycles leaving in their wakes some of the most horrific images ever caught on film. To him, the Chinese government would have  blown it  had they allowed people to mourn the leader they loved and lost that led to unimaginable violence.Donald Trump sided with the Chinese on Tiananmen Square.His delusions about a  weak  America were also obvious. This was 1990. The Berlin Wall was about to come down. The United States military was about to wipe the Persian Gulf region clean of Soviet defense systems in use by Iraq. We were on the verge of declaring victory in the Cold War. How is that weak, exactly?The only people who perceive America as  weak,  militarily anyway, are the numbskulls who support  Donald Trump. We won t be looked at as strong if Trump is elected, we ll be looked at as stupid. Our country will lose what credibility President Obama has rebuilt after the disaster that was the Dubya administration.Rightfully so.Featured image via screen capture ",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Gets Some Pretty Outspoken Praise From Biden (VIDEO),"Vice President Joe Biden has nothing but glowing praise for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Biden, who contemplated a run for the presidency but decided to opt out, said of Sanders: Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it. And that is the absolute enormous concentration of wealth of a small group of people, with a middle class now being left out. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkFFh2M8rAc]Biden was referring to Sanders  consistent record of speaking out on and pushing initiatives about income inequality throughout his  career. Sanders has made the issue a central theme of his campaign. Biden also believes the issue of income inequality is of vital importance to the country. He said: There used to be a basic bargain. If you contributed to the profitability of an enterprise, you share in that profit, and that s been broken. Productivity is up and wages are stagnant. Sanders  strength is with young voters, with polls showing that he leads in double digits in that demographic. Many millennials, for example, have enormous college debt and they continue to have a tough time in the job market. Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, an organization that encourages young people to get involved in politics, said:  Part of it is really sort of the age that they grew up in. If you think about the millennials, that age group, they turned 18 as President George W Bush took office. That s the world they grew up in: their country is at war, it seemed to have lost purpose. And then as they were graduating from college the recession hit. So the social contrast that people generally have   that you invest in your education and you get paid off   was a myth for them. One thing is his genuineness. He s been consistent warrior against economic inequality since the 60s, and he hasn t changed a bit. Although Biden has not officially made an endorsement, he did meet with Sanders last October to discuss campaign finance reform.Bernie Sanders  campaign is moving in the right direction, gaining momentum at the right time more than any other candidate despite the fact that the media has not paid attention to him.  If the current polls are indicative of things to come, the Republicans better look out. Polls show him trouncing all Republican candidates, including Donald Trump by a wide margin.Featured Image: Marc Nozell (flickr)",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Gets OWNED By His Own Harvard Law Professor: Calls Cruz Clueless On Constitution (VIDEO),"Laurence Tribe, who was Ted Cruz s own Constitutional Law professor at Harvard, visited MSNBC s The Last Word, to discuss Cruz s total lack of understanding on, and general contempt for, the Constitution of the United States.Professor Tribe said point blank that Ted Cruz only cares about the Constitution when it benefits Ted Cruz, or if he can use it as a weapon to hurt other Americans. Otherwise, he could not care less if the Constitution says you have a right he doesn t want you to have.You really can t argue with Professor Tribe s assessment of Cruz on that. He couldn t be more correct.Professor Tribe spoke briefly to the recent  birther  attacks put forth against Cruz by fellow Republicans and Donald Trump. He said that these attacks brought into light the glaringly obvious example of how Ted Cruz simply chooses to interpret the Constitution in any way that is convenient for him at the time, with no regard to the actual law.What this does is give us a window into the character of Ted Cruz. The sort of person he is, with respect to the American Constitution. Whats intriguing   it was true even when he was my student years ago   he used to believe in  originalism,  that is the Constitution always means what it meant when it was adopted- Except when it s not convenient for him to mean that. This is a perfect example.If the Constitution always meant what he claims, namely that if you got an American mother it doesn t matter where in the world you re born, you become a natura born citizen at birth. Well then, why in the world did congress need to pass a law dealing with naturalization and immigration in 1934, saying  from now on, although it wasn t true before, if you have a mother who s an American citizen, thats good enough? Source: MSNBCTribe s example seems innocent enough, but it speaks to a larger issue where Cruz simply doesn t care about constitutional law. Remember   we were still torturing people as recently as 7 years ago, regardless of what the Constitution said. Professor Tribe continued on even further in criticizing him even further, saying the Cruz he taught constitutional law to at Harvard is nothing like the Cruz of today. He implied that it was like the Cruz of today never studied constitutional law at all. Tribe also touched on some of Cruz s other comments, where he said that the Supreme Court s word has no impact on the law of the land. Professor Tribe could only describe it as  Scary.

 Watch Jimmy Fallon Give Mock Job Interview To Trump For Presidency (VIDEO),"Donald Trump made an appearance last night on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon when Fallon informed the Republican front-runner that he would be performing a mock interview with him for the presidency. The usually aggressive Trump seemed mild mannered at times and appeared tired, perhaps from the toll that an election campaign can take on someone.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jWw5lft4]However, Trump stuck to his previous controversial statements about Muslims, saying that although he has Muslim friends, they should be banned from entering the United States. He also took a few shots at Hillary Clinton, saying that he doesn t understand how she s not beating Bernie Sanders. Trump said: I mean, how can you lose like this? He really isn t even a Democrat. But he said he s a socialist, and I think he may be a step beyond a socialist. He also said that he would easily beat Hillary Clinton in the general election: I m winning against Hillary one-on-one. And I haven t even started on her yet, although last week I did a little bit. But we haven t even started. Later, during the mock interview, Trump was asked about his strengths to be president. His response was ironic since he described himself as a unifier of people, drawing uncomfortable laughter from the audience.This is the same Trump who has frightened millions of Hispanic and Muslim Americans in the United States with his rhetoric.Here is a transcript of the mock interview:Describe Yourself. I m an extraordinarily handsome person. I have a beautiful head of hair. I was always a good student, and I always worked hard. Why do you want this Job? Because I wanna make America great. What are your strengths? I think, believe it or not, I can bring people together. What are your weaknesses?  That I never forget. I m too nice too long, and when I become   somebody takes advantage of a situation, I become too bad for too long. Are you willing to relocate? I love the White House. This is a high-profile position. Is media attention something you d be comfortable with? Not at all. I d be very uncomfortable.

 What His Friend Barack Did When Son Beau Got Sick Brings Joe Biden To The Brink of Tears (VIDEO),"Joe Biden is as genuine as they come. For many, their first exposure to him was when they watched him decimate Sarah Palin in the pre-election debates with a brilliant mind, clever wit and award-winning smile. Four years later, it was Paul Ryan who looked like a deer caught in the headlights as VP Biden considered his preposterous answers in their debates together and couldn t help but bust out in that ever-popular Joe Biden laugh.Joe Biden is one of the good ones. He s one of us. He s not a wealthy man or a sleezy politician who manages to live large off of campaign war chests; he s just a man   who happens to be second in line for the most powerful office in the world.Last year we were thrust into the personal life of Joe Biden and his family when his beloved son Beau, who the vice president calls his  soul,  was taken from him after a battle with cancer. What many people don t know is the incredible support Mr. Biden received from the only man he can call  boss,  President Barack Obama. The president delivered a beautiful and unforgettable eulogy for Beau, but according to an interview Biden did Monday with CNN, that was just the tip of the iceberg of the love and friendship he showed the Vice President.According to Biden, after Beau had the stroke that began the path towards his passing, President Obama came RUNNING down the hallway of the hospital to see if his friend and colleague was OK. Biden assured the president that he would be; that he and his wife would sell their house to get by and take care of Beau if need be.In an incredible act of selflessness and kindness, our President offered to give Joe Biden and his family whatever financial support they needed to weather the storm. As he tells the story you can see the tears welling up in his eyes. He says repeatedly that he s certain the president will be upset that he made such a personal notion public, but this man obviously wants the country to know exactly what kind of man sits in the Oval Office.He goes on to talk about the president and his family and how they are HIS family. How the President s daughters have sleepovers with his granddaughters and how much the special friendship between them has meant.Warning: The interview is a tear-jerker. Never have I been more proud of our president MY president or more thankful for having had the opportunity to witness his historic and monumentally successful administration than I am after watching this video:Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" In The Midst Of Scandal, Office Containing Flint Water Records ‘Broken Into’","As the Department of Justice prepared to investigate Flint, Michigan s poisoned water, someone allegedly  broke into  a vacant office where the city s water records are stored.For more than 18 months, residents of the city of Flint have been sounding the alarm over the appearance, taste and smell of the water flowing through their taps.As Addicting Info reported here in January of 2014, the water had an offensive odor, foul taste and looked like  chocolate milk on tap. Yet for months officials in republican governor Rick Snyder s administration assured the public the water was safe. These assurances came even after independent testing showed high levels of lead in the city s water supply.As additional testing confirmed a sharp increase in the level of lead present in the blood of Flint s children, public outrage and heightened media attention followed.ACLU investigative journalist Curt Guyette soon uncovered a wealth of damning evidence, showing that Snyder officials knew that the water flowing into the city was not safe to drink. As we reported here the ACLU s investigation showed that officials rigged tests and falsified documents, repeatedly breaking the law, in order to cover up the fact that the water was essentially poison.On January 6, the United States Department of Justice finally announced that the agency was preparing to conduct a formal investigation into the Flint lead-poisoning scandal.Strangely enough, in the midst of all this, someone allegedly broke into Flint City Hall. On January 11, city officials confirmed that the alleged break-in targeted the vacant office where the city of Flint s water records are stored.Flint mayor Kevin Weaver and Police Chief James Tolbert have refused to say if any records were stolen from the office.When asked about security video of the break-in, Police Chief Tolbert said, The video doesn t show anything. How convenient that someone just happened to break into the vacant office where the city s water records are kept, just as those very records were about to come under intense public and legal scrutiny. The fact that the burglars managed to get in and out of a government building without being seen by anyone, or even caught on video, also seems pretty damn convenient.Across Michigan citizens have been calling for the arrest of governor Snyder, as more and more evidence emerges showing that he and his administration purposely allowed the residents of Flint to drink water contaminated with lead for more than a year, all while assuring them it was safe.Given everything we already know about Snyder, the odds that this break-in was not related to Flint s poisoned water are slim to zero.Rick Snyder s watergate scandal is looking more and more like Richard Nixon s every day.Featured image credit: Brandon Anderson, via Flckr under CC 2.0",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ellen DeGeneres Tells Hillary Clinton To Her Face Who She Wants As President (VIDEO),"With the primaries getting closer and the choice for Democratic nominee for president becoming a choice between Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, more and more people are letting their opinions be known when it comes to who they want to lead the nation.And while Sanders is definitely getting his fair share of endorsements, Clinton has been receiving quite a few lately. Between Planned Parenthood and former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords giving her the nod back to back, now another person has told Hillary to her face that she has every aspect that they d like to see in a president.While appearing on the The Ellen Show, Clinton sat down with host Ellen DeGeneres, who then let her feelings be known directly to the candidate: I mean, I ve said it before, that you ve been held to a completely different standard than everyone else seems to be, you know, held to. You know what a supporter I am. I think that you re as smart as can be, I think you are qualified, I think you stand for everything that I want in a president. And while this isn t a direct endorsement, this should really come as no surprise. Last October, while interviewing Pharrell, the producer/singer let DeGeneres know that he would be supporting Hillary, and she responded with: We have become a society where it is all about personality and celebrity and charm, instead of it being about the person who s gonna get the job done. And while we still don t know who is going to win the Democratic primary, let alone who will win the White House, Hillary definitely has the experience, know how, and wherewithal to get the job. She s seen and dealt with it all throughout her tenure in Washington DC. That being said, Bernie Sanders would still make a very formidable candidate, and honestly either candidate would be heads above any Republican candidate.Here s DeGeneres speaking with Clinton: // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt; I think that you re as smart as can be, I think you are qualified, I think you stand for everything that I want in a president.  -Ellen DeGeneresPosted by Hillary Clinton on Monday, January 11, 2016Video/Featured image: Facebook",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bombshell Reveals Nazi Connection To the Koch Brothers,"The infamous conservative Republican financiers Charles and David Koch had a family connection to the Nazis, a new book reveals.Jane Mayer, the New Yorker journalist who was among the first mainstream writers to document the Kochs  multi-million dollar campaign to effectively take over the Republican Party and the larger conservative movement, uncovers the connection in her new book, Dark Money.The book,  Dark Money,  by Jane Mayer, traces the rise of the modern conservative movement through the activism and money of a handful of rich donors: among them Richard Mellon Scaife, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune, and Harry and Lynde Bradley, brothers who became wealthy in part from military contracts but poured millions into anti-government philanthropy.But the book is largely focused on the Koch family, stretching back to its involvement in the far-right John Birch Society and the political and business activities of their father, Fred C. Koch, who found some of his earliest business success overseas in the years leading up to World War II. One venture was a partnership with the American Nazi sympathizer William Rhodes Davis, who, according to Ms. Mayer, hired Mr. Koch to help build the third-largest oil refinery in the Third Reich, a critical industrial cog in Hitler s war machine.The Kochs, who are among two of the wealthiest individuals in America, stand atop an industrial giant   Koch Industries   that has previously been fined for being one of the worst polluters in America. The brothers use their fortune to finance a political machine that often pursues goals that would enrich the brothers by pursuing a hardline right wing agenda that favors big business and opposes government oversight and regulation.The brothers bankroll a network of groups that often hide their spending on political goals under tax laws. That is the  dark money  that Mayer s book title refers to. The Kochs run groups like Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, the Center to Protect Patients Rights   and then they are also able to flow money towards groups like the NRA, Americans for Tax Reform, and the Club for Growth.What those groups all have in common is their opposition to progressive ideals and their targeting of progressive and Democratic politicians.These groups also work at the state level to prop up governors and state legislators. One particularly potent success the Kochs had was helping Wisconsin s Scott Walker in his campaign to restrict union rights in his state. And the Kochs have cells working towards similar results in all 50 states.After spending about $400 million on the 2012 election, unsuccessfully trying to dislodge President Obama, the brothers announced plans to spend at least $900 million pushing for conservatives in 2016.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 “Big F*cking Deal”: 10 Huge Things Obama Did To Fix America You Never Hear About,"When major changes happen, it is often difficult to realize they are underway when you re knee deep in day to day life. But when you take a step back and look at things on a larger scale, you can take stock of just how far progress has come.That is the case with a lot of what has been accomplished since President Obama was sworn into office at noon on January 20, 2009. Oddly, conservatives may be able to appreciate this more than the progressives who support Obama and voted for him twice. In their eyes, Obama has been radically remaking America, while progressives may often feel as if things aren t changing enough.Michael Grunwald s piece in Politico Magazine, of all places, goes through the Obama presidency and takes stock of the major changes that this president has engineered, many of which will reverberate through generations.Here are 10 of the things (and there are a LOT more) President Obama did:Grunwald explains further that Obama has not gotten a lot of these innovations   and many more   because he s been more focused on getting them done than taking a victory lap over them. He was determined to make his presidency consequential, as he believed Democrats and progressives had not done all they could to make as many lasting changes as they should have. He paid for some of these efforts through a loss of Congress to the GOP and a drop in his approval rating even as those who disapprove of him have benefitted from the stronger economy and widened safety net.The Obama years have delivered on a huge amount of  change you can believe in.

 Watch Hillary’s Unnecessary Response To Trump’s Ad Comparing Bill Clinton To Bill Cosby (VIDEO),"Short and easy quiz. Which of these things is not like the other?1) A serial rapist who drugged dozens of women in order to forcibly have sex with them without their consent. 2) A serial adulterer who had  sexual relations  with consenting women. 3) Hillary Clinton.If you answered  none of these things are like any of the others,  then you answered correctly. Number one is, of course, Bill Cosby. Number two is, obviously, President Bill Clinton. And number three is, well, you know. And yet somehow, Donald Trump and the traditional media have managed to conflate all three in order to taint numbers two and three with the rapey stench of number one.That s really all that needs to be said. And by the way, I thought more than a few conservatives have been defending Cosby against the growing list of victims who were allegedly raped by the one-time television and comedy star. But Trump is counting on the fact that his low-information ignoramus voters won t know the difference or, in fact, bother thinking for themselves for a change. Instead, they ll simply agree with Trump in spite of the facts.On Sunday s Face the Nation, Hillary Clinton was asked point-blank what she makes of this nonsensical line of attack from Trump.CLINTON: Well, if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that s his prerogative. You know, so be it.I m going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, which affects two-thirds of the women, who are the ones receiving the minimum wage, protecting a woman s right to make the most personal health care decisions.That s why I m so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I m going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports.So, there are very clear distinctions. He can say whatever he wants to about me. Let the voters judge that. But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made. It s been too hard-fought-for. And I m going to stand up and make it clear there s a huge difference between us.Yes, I get it. Trump is attacking Hillary for being a hypocrite by supporting women s rights while remaining married to a cheater. But it doesn t really make any sense. Guaranteeing continued access to affordable contraception and abortion services doesn t have anything to do with Hillary navigating a patchy marriage. But it s still an attack, I suppose.Frankly, Trump is attacking Bill Clinton more than anyone else. The message here is that a Cosby-like figure will have access to the Oval Office, and that s bad. Furthermore, there s definitely a bit of Trump racism on display here: Bill Clinton is just like a rapey black man. Run away! Trump s puritanical white voters won t like that, hence the Trump ad. The irony is that Trump s puritanical white supporters are also supporting Trump himself, who s had a rather spotty relationship with marriage fidelity himself.Bottom line: the ad makes zero sense, and it makes even less sense to demand that Hillary respond to it. Bill Clinton s behavior was Bill Clinton s behavior. Hillary had nothing to do with it.

 Black Fox Guest Accuses Democrats Of ‘Literally Killing’ African Americans ‘With Guns And Abortions’ (VIDEO),"Fox News invited blogger Crystal Wright onto Fox and Friends Monday morning to remind America just how dangerous the Democratic party is for Americans   especially if you re African American.Wright, who is African American herself, went on the show to speak about her new book Con Job, which focuses on racial injustice and the so-called  negative impact  Democrats have had on the  poorer, dumber, and more criminalized  black community. She started off by talking about how bad welfare programs were to African Americans, but inevitably made a detour into other hot topics like gun violence and abortion. In speaking about the many assertions made in her book, host Steve Doocy asked the conservative blogger and author,  You talk about over the last 40 years, trillions of dollars have been put to fight poverty, yet poverty is proliferating in many neighborhoods because? Wright said, blaming the party that actually cares about Black Lives Matter, police brutality and social justice: Well, because of Democrats and the con that they re running on black Americans. They have made black Americans poorer, dumber, and more criminalized. Doocy asked Why do you say that? That s their end game? Wright answered: It s not just me. Look, 93 percent of   you know how the president goes around, wants to talk about regulating legal gun ownership? I ve never seen Barack Obama talk about the black lives being killed by other blacks in Chicago, DC, or Baltimore. Ninety-three percent of all black homicides are committed by other black people. And you know the number one cause of death among young black men ages 15 to 34? Guns. Illegal guns, cus they re killing each other. That s the con job. But yet, black people keep voting against their interests, and I would argue the Democrat Party is literally killing black Americans from the womb to the streets. Wright is actually (and not surprisingly) wrong   President Barack Obama talks about murder in places like Chicago often. Just last week, the president said it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.  Wright is also forgetting that 83% of all white homicide victims are murdered by white people   but yet no one talks about white-on-white crime.But no matter what our president has done in terms of racial justice, Wright believes that Democrats don t actually care about black people or the Black Lives Matter movement   they only care about getting black votes (she must be completely unaware of what her party does). Dissing Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton, Wright said: That is why [Hillary] is going out and saying,  Hey, black lives matter, but oh guys guess what, I support Planned Parenthood, the billion dollar abortion industry. Wright uses Planned Parenthood as an example only because statistically African American women are more likely to seek out medically sound and affordable abortions from the clinics.To give an example of a Republican candidate that does care about black people, she cited the always offensive front runner Donald Trump, claiming that he was the most pro-black candidate due to the fact that he supports restricting immigration.You can watch the bizarre interview below:Despite what Wright says about Democrats, there s proof that her beloved Republican party has also failed to meet her expectations:Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Priceless: Yelpers Review The Moron Militia Occupied Oregon Wildlife Preserve (IMAGES),"When the right-wing terrorists took over the Malheur National Wildlife Preserve, the first thought many had was of the guy pointing his weapon at a BLM agent from between Jersey barriers when the Cliven Bundy incident happened. When we learned that it was Bundy s own sons leading the charge to free a remote corner of Southeast Oregon from oppression, those fears were multiplied.Then something magical happened. Within hours we learned that the  occupation  would be a gathering of nitwits the likes of John Ritzheimer who were too stupid to bring enough supplies to feed themselves for a camping trip, never mind a  standoff  that Ammon Bundy said would last years.We learned that the desperate plea for snacks was foolish not only because these were supposed to be those survivalists we all hear about being prepared for the zombie apocalypse but because the local authorities suggested they just go to the store since nobody was watching them.The frightening became stupid and then completely ludicrous. Now what we have left is a group of armed idiots in a standoff with nobody occupying a taxpayer-funded retreat in a bird sanctuary, threatening to give the land back to the loggers. It was never going to go over well.At least we can laugh. If nothing else the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom have provided the internet with enough material for memes by the truckload, humor articles, op-eds and satire pieces for miles and enough YouTube parodies to last the winter if you re bored enough to watch them all.One of the most enjoyable reads you ll have during this debacle has to be Yelp, where  reviewers  have gone out of their way to make your tour of the preserve a memorable one. From large Cheeto-begging mammals spotted on the trails to toothless creatures in need of our support and protection, yelpers have made the incredibly ridiculous world of the Bundy Moron Militia even more absurd   and it is magnificent.Here are some images of the best Yelp has to offer. Enjoy! Toss in a few funny pictures for good measure and the humiliation of Ammon Bundy ands friends is just about complete: You can visit the comments HERE. Yelp has been cleaning them as they come in, as their policy is to not take a political stance on anything, but new ones are popping up all the time.

" Jealous Donald Trump Attacks Megyn Kelly Again, Says Nobody Wants To Woo Her (TWEET)","After Megyn Kelly shut down his attempts to woo her, Donald Trump posted an attack on Twitter that sounds just like the jealous rant of a creep who got shot down.During an interview with Vanity Fair earlier this month, the Fox News host described how Trump made multiple efforts to gain her favor in the run up to announcing his campaign for president last summer, declaring that she can t be wooed. He would send me press clippings about me that he would just sign  Donald Trump.  And he called from time to time to compliment a segment. I didn t know why he was doing that. And then when he announced that he was running for president, it became more clear. But I can t be wooed. I was never going to love him, and I was never going to hate him. Indeed, Kelly has refused to take shit from Trump. During a debate in August, Kelly took Trump on and didn t make things easy for him. Offended, Trump lashed out at Kelly, claiming she was bleeding out of her  whatever. Even after Kelly went on vacation, Trump continued the vicious assaults with the help of his rapid conservative supporters.And now Trump has responded to Kelly s remarks in Vanity Fair by attacking her once again, this time targeting her for her looks and claiming that nobody wants to woo her. Megyn Kelly recently said that she can t be wooed by Trump,  the billionaire Republican presidential wannabe wrote on Twitter.  She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her! .@megynkelly recently said that she can t be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2016And, of course, Trump is only embarrassing himself. Say what you want about her political beliefs, it is undeniable that Megyn Kelly is not only a beautiful woman, she has a brain as well. Also, it s pretty ridiculous to say that nobody wants to woo her since she has been married twice. Clearly, at least two men have succeeded in wooing her while Donald Trump has failed repeatedly. It sounds like Trump is just jealous because a smart and sexy woman said  no  to him and refused to let him walk all over her.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Disrespectful Prick Ted Cruz Will Snub President Obama By Skipping Final State Of The Union Address,"Instead of respectfully attending President Obama s final State of the Union Address like other Republican nominees, Ted Cruz is skipping it.The Texas Tea Party Senator made the decision to campaign in New Hampshire on January 12th rather than spending a couple hours respectfully listening to what our current commander-in-chief has to say during one of his last major speeches as president.Of course, it s not like Cruz couldn t fly in and fly back out after the speech is over, which is why this definitely feels like a snub of President Obama, especially when you consider that Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Bernie Sanders are all putting their campaigns on pause for the evening to hear what President Obama has to say.But Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler insists that this isn t a snub at all. Cruz is simply working hard to win New Hampshire, he says, even though Cruz is in third place in the Granite State 16-points behind leader Donald Trump. It s not a snub. He s going to be in New Hampshire, working hard to win New Hampshire. No disrespect. It just is going to work out this way. Tyler also added that Cruz will be be  disappointed  with the speech no matter where he is at the time it is delivered.  It won t matter because he ll be just as disappointed in New Hampshire as he will be in the chamber,  he said.Adding further insult and disrespect toward President Obama, Cruz intends to hold his own State of the Union hours before the real one in what the Dallas Morning News reports is being billed as the  State of Our Union Town Hall Meeting with Senator Ted Cruz. Basically, Cruz is snubbing the State of the Union Address to run off and pretend he is already president.And his disrespectful actions could come back to haunt him come Election Day in November.James Madison University professor of media and politics Dan Schill told The Hill that while Cruz s stunt won t necessarily harm him among Republican primary voters who already cheer anybody who disrespects President Obama, it may cost him voters who see this as being disrespectful. I don t think it will necessarily turn off too many primary voters in New Hampshire and Iowa, but there is that risk,  he said.  The choice to stiff the speech can send a message it s time for change. It may also backfire for people who see it as not respecting office of the presidency. In short, Ted Cruz is being a disrespectful little prick who believes he can fire up New Hampshire Republicans to vote for him if he snubs President Obama.It s one thing to dislike the man who is president, but disrespecting the office is totally unacceptable and proves once again that Ted Cruz isn t qualified to be president, whether he is a natural born citizen or not.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Jennifer Lawrence PERFECTLY Identify What’s Wrong With Modern Day Life (VIDEO),"Modern day culture is far from what it used to be. Technology has taken over human contact and conversation, and people are seemingly forgetting what it s like the actually speak with a person who is directly in front of them. This forgetfulness can also be seen in the depths of Twitter as trolls seem to feel they can say anything to anyone at any time with no remorse for their actions or words because there is no human face attached to who they are attacking.A great example of this lack of human interaction experience occurred after Jennifer Lawrence won her Golden Globe for her performance in Joy. In what some people are calling rude, the actress was just being brutally honest and some people forget what it s like to point something out to someone s face. In actuality, the person who was being rude was a particular reporter who was asking Lawrence a question surrounding her win.The reporter begins to ask Lawrence a question, but the Oscar winner quickly cuts him off and says: You can t live your whole life behind your phone, bro  You can t do that. You ve got to live in the now. You know? The reporter continuing on, mentioned the Oscars, so Lawrence, being the quit-witted person that she is, drove home her point: We re at the Golden Globes. If you put your phone down, you d know that. Now, to the people calling Lawrence rude   Really? She was clearly giving that reporter her undivided attention and was making herself available to answer his question, and he was still staring at his phone. So, who was rude? It certainly wasn t Lawrence for pointing it out.If you go back and watch the Golden Globes during the part when Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence were announcing each other s films, you can see that there was a jab at people using their phones then, too.We ve become a culture all too reliant on our cell phones and technology that we ve forgotten basic human interaction skills, better known as social skills. Don t call someone rude for pointing out rude behavior. Take what they are saying to heart, understand why it may offend you, because you may be just as guilty, and remember that human beings should, in fact, have human interaction without technology getting in the way.Lawrence perfectly points out what s wrong with modern-day life, and kudos to her for doing so. We all need to live in the now. Life is happening before our very eyes if we make the decision to look up from our mobile devices. Jennifer Lawrence calls out a reporter for not looking up from his phone. #GoldenGlobes #backstage https://t.co/anWeQCsIL6  Variety (@Variety) January 11, 2016 Video/Featured image: Twitter",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News To Viewers: Key To Winning Jackpot Is Buying As Many Lottery Tickets As You Can Afford,"The same group of people who believed Fox when the network was telling them President Obama was a Kenyan are now rushing to drain their bank accounts for lottery tickets after some characteristically stupid financial advice on Fox and Friends.While Fox was covering the record-breaking $1.4 billion lottery jackpot that has the entire country seeing dollar signs, one of their resident  experts  decided he would share his winning strategy: Spend all of your money on tickets to maximize your chances of winning.At first blush, Fox s expert, Richard Lustig, does sound like he knows what he s talking about. He s won the lottery seven times (at various amounts). His tips, however, are painfully bad. After saying there is no  magic wand  to help a person win the lottery, Lustig says there is one exception: Buy as many tickets as you can afford.In case you needed a reality check, draining your bank account on the off-chance that you win $1.4 billion in the Powerball is not a good idea. While the large pile of cash may seem enticing, the odds that you   specifically you   will be the one who wins it are vanishingly small. (The actual number is around 1 in 292 million.) Buying more tickets only increases your chances by a very small fraction. In all likelihood, you ll simply pay more to still lose.And the Powerball is this large for a reason: the lotto recently became much harder to win. This is no longer the game Lustig used to play, the Powerball has become a bigger mirage than ever. As ThinkProgress explains:In October, the consortium of states that runs Powerball approved a series of rule changed thatmade it much harder to win the jackpot. Under the new rules you select five of 69 numbers, up from five out of 59 numbers. The choices for the Powerball was actually reduced from 35 to 26. Still, this decreased the odds of winning the jackpot from 1 in 175 million to 1 in 292 million.Why would the Powerball do this? Because huge jackpots create a media frenzy that, in turns, gets more people to scramble for lottery tickets. It s a profit-making scheme and it is working.Making matters worse for our hapless Fox News viewers, bigger pots don t make it a better deal for the average lotto player. Mathematicians have worked out that the pot would need to be vastly bigger (about 2.6 billion dollars) to make buying a lottery ticket even worth it statistically.Yikes.The hysteria surrounding the massive powerball jackpot is understandable (who wouldn t want to become an overnight billionaire?), but a respectable news outlet wouldn t run around telling its demonstrably gullible viewers that bankrupting themselves is the best way to become rich. Fox News, yet again, proves that they are much more comfortable operating as a 24-hour swindle operation rather than a responsible media giant with its audience s best interests at heart.Feature image via Media Matters",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Donald Trump Just Won A Major Award, And Ted Cruz Is Going To Be Devastated","Each year, the People For the American Way s Equine Posterior Achievement Award  is granted to public figures who drag America to a new low of right-wing extremism. For several years now, Ted Cruz has been  honored  with the top spot. But this year, the prize has been handed to Donald Trump.It s official Donald, you are the biggest horse s a$$ in America according to the adjudication panel of People for the American Way.Will Trump be as quick to crow about this victory as he was when he was crowned  Man of the Year  by WorldNetDaily? It didn t seem to bother him that the site is conspiracy theory central, and as Right Wing Watch points out, is convinced that Obama is about to throw every man, woman and child in America into a FEMA camp.Trump worked hard for this honor though. He labeled all latin American immigrants as drug dealers and rapists, he called for Muslims to be banned from entering the U.S. (even Muslim Americans returning from holiday), he lied that  thousands and thousands  of Muslims in America cheered while 9/11 was happening, and failed to retract or apologize when he was busted for it. Instead he chose to stand up at his next rally and physically mock the disabled reporter who had exposed his lie. On top of this, he spends the majority of time hate-tweeting any journalist or media outlet that dare refuse to kiss his trust fund tycoon posterior.This level of commitment to running for President as a bigoted man child needs to be honored somehow, and thankfully, People For The American Way solved the problem for us. Sadly, it does mean that Ted Cruz  winning streak is over. He will clearly have to work harder to win back the accolade next year. His brand of evangelical, homophobic, anti-choice, anti-science, pro-gun BS might well appall any rational human being   but there s a new bigot in town.Featured Image via Flickr/Flickr",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 KKK Leader Who Killed A Black Child With An Arrow Thinks ‘Finding’ God Gets Him Early Prison Release,"A few days after Christmas in 1992, Felicia Houston, 16, and two of her cousins were walking in an apartment complex when she was murdered by a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Monroe, North Carolina. Now, her murderer wants to be released from prison because he  found  Jesus.Russell Hinson was angry that a black drug dealer stole $70 from him on that fateful day. He told a friend that he was going to get revenge, I m going to shoot a n****r through the heart.  So, he and a friend, Guy Brown, drove around the apartment complex where the drug dealer was living, when he came upon the group of girls. The Charlotte Observer explained what happened next:Hinson and Brown heard their laughter. Then they saw them. Hinson reloaded and stuck the crossbow out the window. Don t shoot, Brown said. They re only girls.I don t care, Hinson said, One of them is going to pay.He fired.Felicia fell to her knees, her cousin testified, hollering,  I m shot, I m hurt! I m shot, I m hurt! Felicia died sixteen hours after she was shot and Hinson was arrested shortly after. The white supremacist went on trial for first-degree murder and it took an all-white jury just two and a half hours to convict him. Now, twenty-three years after shooting a child with a crossbow, he wants to be released from prison early.Dennis Long, Hinson s uncle, claims that prison  changed  him. He told the Observer his nephew  found the Lord  about six years ago and has expressed remorse about killing Felicia. The North Carolina Parole Commission will be reviewing his case soon and deciding whether or not he deserves release.It s always humourous to me that murderers like Hinson murder someone, go into prison and then claim to have accepted Jesus into their lives. As if picking up a Bible suddenly absolves them of the horrific crimes they committed. What s even more ironic is that this guy, a former leader of an organization that believes in white superiority, would probably spit on Jesus if he appeared before him. After all, Jesus was a Middle Eastern Jew.Hopefully, the parole board denies his request and sends him back to his cell where he belongs.Featured image via Charlotte Observer",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ex-KKK Grand Wizard: Maine Gov. Right To Call Out Black Men’s ‘Defilement’ Of White Women,"David Duke is perhaps one of the most notorious Grand Wizards of the Ku Klux Klan alive today. He also had quite a bit to say about Maine Governor Paul LePage s recent racist rant. LePage suggested that black drug dealers are coming into his state and selling drugs, and while they re at it, getting white women pregnant.Of course, the backlash was ferocious for LePage s remarks, and he tried to walk them back.  But David Duke, being the vile racist that he is, devoted airtime on a recent edition of his radio show to defend LePage. Calling LePage s racism the Trump effect of people not talking in politically correct manner,  Duke said: You are probably picking yourself off the floor to think that an elected governor in the United States of America would actually talk about this horrible destruction and defilement of young white women. These are not Anglo-Saxon guys from rural Maine doing this. These are, again, like the Puff Diddys   or whatever they want to call themselves   from New York. So, a black man having sex with a white woman is  defilement.  These remarks are especially egregious, considering the history in the United States of black men being lynched at the drop of a hate when a white woman cries rape. In the eyes of racists, there is nothing worse than a white woman coupling with a black man. If David Duke thought the historical context of what he is saying here would be lost on the rest of us, he is dead wrong.Duke also had a guest on his show who echoed his racist beliefs, Pastor Mark Dankof. Duke and Dankof then turned their attentions to Democratic Presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, because of her speaking out against police brutality against people of color. Duke said to Dankof: Isn t this the same Hillary Clinton who has constantly told us about black people being victimized by police? She says that this is a racist problem that police are shooting down blacks. When the fact is, they shoot down proportionally a far higher capita of a white person who acts criminally. This is a lie, of course. See the Bundy militia for Exhibit A. If those were black people, they d have been dead the first day. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is white privilege. But then again, of course the likes of David Duke would never understand that, and nor would he want to.Duke s full comments can be heard here, at his media archive.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Host Calls For American Muslims With Links To ISIS To Be Executed Without Trial (VIDEO),"Fox News host,Judge Jeanine Pirro appeared to endorse the summary execution of Muslims suspected of links to ISIS-related terrorism without due process under the law.Pierre asked her viewers if the U.S. should apply the death penalty for ISIS-related violence. There was no real definition of what scale of violence or links to ISIS would apply. And the U.S. already lists 41 crimes as capital   meaning they are punishable by death   including murder, assassination, espionage, treason, and death resulting from aircraft hijacking. It is not supposed to matter what religious, racial or other motivation a suspect has of committing these crimes   the court is only interested in whether they committed the acts or not.In short, there is no need for a new capital crime specific to Muslims. Unless of course, you re a Fox News blowhard with an axe to grind.The responses from her viewers began as expected.A viewer named Josephine raged: They aren t afraid to kill us, so why should we be afraid to give them the death penalty? While Kevin wrote: We ve got a few guns down here in Texas, and more than happy to handle it!, Pierre reads this out with a grin reaching from ear-to-ear as if she s about to break out into a  Happy Birthday  song or something   when she is infact, calling for the summary execution of Muslims.She reads out Al s comment with the same hysterical smirk on her face: Why waste taxpayer money holding them in prison? They d kill us in a heartbeat. Adding her own snarky reply: Hey Al, and if we held them in prison Obama would let them out! But even amongst the viewership of Fox News, there are some people who have a respect for law and order   and the need to actually investigate a person suspected of committing a crime, rather than arbitrarily killing them. One such viewer, named Kimberly, said: Don t get ahead of yourselves. Everyone deserves a fair trial. Let the courts decide. This sent Pirro into a rage-induced tailspin of a rant in which she saw fit to lecture Kimberly. Hey Kimberly,  she snorts.  I drafted legislation all the time to increase sentences for punishment. The courts are the ones that implement the laws that we draft. Here we have a Fox News host openly endorsing the summary execution of Muslims, presumably Muslim-Americans, who are even suspected of ISIS-related violence. A channel which calls it unconstitutional to ask a white christian to register his gun, thinks it s totally appropriate to summarily execute a Muslim. Fair and balanced? Not a chance.Featured Image vis Screengrab",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chuck Todd GRILLS Trump For Attacking Clinton: ‘Your First Divorce Was Ugly’ (VIDEO),"On NBC s Meet The Press, host Chuck Todd cornered Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump for his attacks on Hillary Clinton s marriage and the sexual indiscretions of her husband by pointing out something Trump doesn t want Americans to focus on   his own romantic history.During the segment, Trump continued his attacks on the Democratic front runner by bringing up ex-president Bill Clinton s controversial sexual past in response to her admission that Trump had a  penchant for sexism.  Trump called the former president  an abuser  and brought up the fact that there were sexual allegations against him.Confronting Trump for his threatened attacks against Clinton, Todd told the business mogul that if he continued to go after Clinton in this way, his own marital disasters would come bubbling to the surface and be back to bite him in the *ss. Todd reminded him: Your first divorce was ugly  All over the tabloids. Trump shrugged and stated that his own struggles from his love life mattered far less than Clinton s and weren t really up for discussion or ridicule. He said, You know what? I wasn t the President of the United States, and I wasn t dealing in the Oval Office, all right? Big difference. Trump then lied through his teeth and claimed that his first wife Ivana considers him  great    leaving out the part where he d actually cheated on her with Georgia beauty queen Marla Maples, who became his second wife. Trump also conveniently failed to mention that he has also been accused of  violent  sexual assault (by Ivana herself) and has a long history of misogyny.You can watch the footage below, courtesy of Mediaite:Although Trump said that Clinton s camp has been  unresponsive  to his attacks, Clinton responded to Trump this morning, stating that American voters didn t want to relitigate the past.Featured image is a screengrab",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 David Bowie Using MTV Interview To Blast MTV’s Racism Is A Beautiful Reminder Of Icon’s Impact,"While the enormous sense of loss the world experienced upon learning of legendary pop icon David Bowie s passing from cancer at 69 has been understandably hard to accept, the impact that the legendary pop icon had on society cannot be overstated. During his ever-changing, boundary-pushing career, Bowie continuously used his celebrity and visibility to shed light on social issues that were being ignored.As we mourn the loss of Bowie, it s worth taking a moment to recall just one time that the singer called out injustice in the most rock n  roll way imaginable.In 1983, Bowie was shocked to learn that many of his African-American musical peers were being purposely ignored by MTV because  black music  was making white Americans uncomfortable. Never one to let people s discomfort dictate how he behaved, Bowie blasted the music network for its cowardice.Using an interview with MTV as an ironic platform for critiquing the network, Bowie grilled MTV VJ Mark Goodman about the network s shameless whitewashing. The exchange has become a legendary example of Bowie s sheer lack of patience for bullshit.There are many reasons to love David Bowie. Here's one. 1982: challenging MTV on their refusal to play black music: pic.twitter.com/0ku30wccVG  Charlene White (@CharleneWhite) January 11, 2016Like many television networks, MTV had decided to censor black performers so as to not offend the predominately white audience from  middle America.  Unlike the other networks, however, MTV was marketed on the premise of being edgy and revolutionary. Bowie revealed what a sham that image was. Is there anything less rock n  roll than being cowered by white, middle class mom s from Iowa who were afraid to see Prince or Rick James on television?Bowie (along with James, who explicitly called the network racist in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine) had brought up an issue that could no longer be ignored. It also may have saved MTV from itself. Just months after the public backlash, MTV exploded with the release of Michael Jackson s  Billie Jean,  followed by  Thriller.  The music videos would become among the most iconic ever released and, to many, would later come to define what a  music video is.Bowie passed away on January 10, 2016, but it s clear that his music, and his legacy, will live on for much, much longer. To honor him, we should not just listen to the incredible wealth of music he left us, but also never be afraid to stand up to inequality and injustice, wherever we find it.Feature image via Wikipedia",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SIX Republican Lawmakers Have Quietly Met With The Bundy Militia In Oregon,"When Cliven Bundy was engaged in an armed standoff against federal authorities in 2014 on his Nevada ranch, Republicans like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and a host of others threw their support squarely behind the criminal. Now, less than two years later, his sons are engaged in an armed occupation of a federal wildlife reserve in Oregon and six GOP lawmakers from various states have gone to meet them to applaud the latest criminal act waged by far-right, anti-government extremists.Rep. Dallas Heard (R-OR) recently brought in a group of out-of-state lawmakers to meet with the Bundy Militia, against the recommendations of law enforcement officials. The other five Republicans include Reps. Graham Hunt and Matt Shea of Washington; Reps. Judy Boyle, Heather Scott and Sage Dixon of Idaho. Another GOP fool, Rep. Michelle Fiore of Nevada, took part in the meeting by telephone. Fiore, if you remember, is the same lawmaker who said she would like to shoot Syrian refugees. A real gem.On the meeting with the other lawmakers and Bundy nuts she said: It s refreshing to see a representative like Dallas Heard care and lean on the side of citizens, versus our federal government Everyone knows I m a supporter of the Bundy family. Our relationship is pretty well documented. To be perfectly clear, she is a supporter of people who have pointed guns at federal law enforcement officials and others who have threatened to shoot anyone who tried to forcibly remove them from the land they are illegally occupying. By doing so, she, and her fellow Republicans, support the Sovereign Citizen movement the Bundys belong to. The movement that police officers all across the country have deemed on of the most dangerous threats to this country   possibly more so than the Islamic terrorists she claims to be so worried about.According to The Oregonian: Heard confirmed the meeting with the militants, including top leader Ammon Bundy, in a phone conversation. He described the trip as  a fact-finding mission.  Heard said he was worried about violence and wanted to prevent another tragedy such as the shooting last year at Umpqua Community College, which is in his district. I was concerned that some of my constituents might have been mixed up in this,  Heard said.  A good shepherd s job is to take care of all his flock. So, in order to prevent another massacre by an ammosexual(s), he went and supported with the very people who have said they want to engage the federal authorities in a Wild West shoot out and made videos saying  goodbye  to their family members? That seems legit.By meeting with these dipsh*ts, Republicans encouraged their dangerous behavior. The Bundy hillbillies are already emboldened by their father s success at holding off police officers by threatening to kill them, now they are receiving the same support he did. The more people applaud their volatile behavior, the less likely they will be to end their asinine occupation of the Refuge. Furthermore, while it is our lawmakers  jobs to represent us, it is borderline treasonous to represent a group of people who want to take over the government.Republicans, always showing how much they love America.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Stephen King Plows Through What’s Left Of Disgraced GOP Governor LePage’s Dignity (TWEET),"Being a resident of the beautiful state of Maine myself, I have a special place in my heart for Stephen King. His vocal opposition   or rather downright hatred   for Republican Governor Paul LePage has made him even more likable to those of us who have witnessed the second-term antics and complete disintegration of what little integrity  Governor LeRampage  had left.His first term was a nightmare. His re-election was made possible by a third-party run from a rich buddy pretending to be a Democrat. Watching him campaign on a platform of hatred for the poor and fear of the few thousand Somali refugees living in the Portland area was terrifying, especially when it became apparent that he would win a second term.In that second term, LeRampage has amped up his fight for the wealthy, essentially destroying the food stamp program and creating a quagmire of restrictions and red tape to sort through for any other kind of assistance that people have stopped bothering to try, opting instead to reverse Lepage s one victory as governor by increasing the crime rate that was at a 40-year low.People gotta eat. When the governor takes away their means without providing an environment that creates sufficient jobs, they do whatever they can to feed themselves and their families. They aren t running to the supermarket with the promise of lower property taxes for oceanfront millionaires.After LePage s latest racist rant sparked outrage around the country, Stephen King, whose tweets at LeRampage have earned him quite a few hearts and arrows on Twitter, sent this out on Sunday, tearing down what little dignity the governor may have had left:One must admit LePage has elevated assholery to a level far past the extraordinary and into a rarified sphere that might be termed divine.  Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 8, 2016Ahhhh The beauty of a Stephen King passage that will stand the test of time. The man just has a way with words. By taking everything the failed governor has ever done and reducing it to a single act of  divine  a**holery, King has summed up the feelings and frustrations of hundreds of thousands of Mainers who lament that they allowed this man to be elected, never mind re-elected.Thank you, Stephen King, for this wonderful tweet.

" WATCH: 20 Years Ago, David Bowie Saw America’s Dark Future","Almost 20 years ago, David Bowie released a music video in conjunction with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails that was disturbingly prophetic. The song  I m Afraid of Americans  was heavily critical of the accelerating dumbing down of American culture. The video took a slightly different tack and was heavily critical of America s increasingly out of control obsession with guns. Together, they gave us a painfully accurate glimpse of America two decades later: Loudly belligerent, proudly ignorant and dangerously violent.And this video was released back in 1997, well before America declared war on the Middle East and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of revenge, racism and religion. When Bowie sings the lyric,  God is an American,  he wasn t commenting on religion so much as commenting on America s theocratic tendencies and what they mean for the rest of the world.  I m Afraid of Americans  might as well be the national anthem of any country with a sizable Muslim population. Or oil. And Allah help you if your country has both.But the predictions didn t stop there. With a few simple lyrics like  Johnny wants a brain, Johnny wants to suck on a Coke,  Bowie accidentally summed up the entire career of Sarah Palin:The video is just as prescient, showing several scenes of Americans pantomiming gun violence. It turns out that David Bowie s character in the video is being delusional (no one had a gun) but it s an accurate reflection of how the world saw the United States back then. Even more so now than in 1997. Not for nothing, in 2015, we averaged more than one mass shooting a day. What s horrors await us in 2016?Here s  I m Afraid of Americans. On Sunday, January 10, 2016, David Bowie died of liver cancer after an 18 month fight. His musical legacy stretches decades and for anyone over the age of 35, he was an integral part of their childhood dreams and nightmares.

 Why Is Mitch McConnell Suddenly So Afraid To Declare War On ISIS?,"Let s face it, Obama s second term has been so wildly successful, the only thing Republicans can do to prevent him from being the greatest president in modern history is to block everything. This even includes things that Republicans keep screaming are necessary for the safety of the nation.If you need evidence of this, just look at Mitch McConnell s recent statement regarding ISIS, and why he claims he won t allow Obama s request for congressional approval for war come up for a vote.Well, the problem with what the president submitted for authorization to use military force restricted what he could do. I can t imagine that I would be voting for an authorization for the use of military force that Barack Obama would sign because the one he submitted for us to take a look at restricted his activities, what he could do based upon conditions on the ground.Look, I don t want to tie the hands of the next president. The next president may want to actually defeat ISIL. And I think an AUMF, an authorization to use military force, that ties the president s hands behind his back is not something I would want to do to a new president who s going to have to clean up this mess, created by all of this passivity over the last eight years.McConnell s Obama Derangement Syndrome is so bad that he is literally refusing to allow Obama to go to war with, of all things, ISIS. It would be hilarious if it was another nation doing this.Mitch McConnell is officially afraid that Obama will be able to defeat ISIS before he leaves office. The Obama coalition has already liberated about forty percent of previously held ISIS territory and has prevented any gains by them since May of 2015. If McConnell holds a vote for authorization for war against ISIS, every Republican would have to vote yes to approve Obama s actions. If they didn t, the knives would come out for every one of them in the next election cycle. If they vote yes, they would be seen as cooperating with the president. If Obama made significant progress in the fight against the terror group, Republicans couldn t run on ISIS in 2016 and 2018. If something bad happened, every Republican would get challenged for supporting a  failed Democratic president. The only way Republicans can stay safe is by doing absolutely nothing to fight what they would otherwise call the greatest threat to America. That is just plain cowardly.Featured image via barefoot and progressive (altered)",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ricky Gervais SLAMS ‘Future President’ Donald Trump’s Racism At Golden Globes (VIDEO),"It s pretty much a well-known fact that real estate mogul, reality television star, and the current Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is an unabashed racist. Of course, he ll say that he s not, as most racists do, but actions, and well, words   his very loud words   speak very clearly his disdain for pretty much everyone who isn t white. His rallies have become pretty much a who s who in white supremacy.Playing off Trump s frontrunner status and obvious racism was this year s Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais. While introducing actresses Eva Longoria and America Ferrera, both gorgeous, strong Latina goddesses women, Gervais was able to roast The Donald. He began his introduction saying: Eva Longoria and America Ferrera aren t just beautiful, talented actresses. They re also two people who your future president, Donald Trump, can t wait to deport. This was an obvious slam at Trump s position on Latinos, who he claims are rapists, murderers, etc., and he promises to deport them all. Well, the  illegal  ones, but really, his constant hatred of everything Latino is pretty much racism at its worst.Here s the introduction from Gervais:Then once the women were on the stage, Longoria and Ferrera seemed to poke fun at Hollywood and society in general who can t seem to tell one Latina actress from the next. And if you want to talk about under-representation in Hollywood, ask a Latina, Black or Asian actress about all the leading roles they get asked to play.The women begin, saying: Hi, I m Eva Longoria, not Eva Mendes. I m America Ferrera, not Gina Rodriguezz. And neither one of us are Rosario Dawson,  Longoria continued. Well said, Selma,  Ferrera noted. Thank you, Charo,  Longoria responded.It was a subtle jab, but brilliant nonetheless.Here are the beautiful ladies via Vulture: In regards to Trump and his obvious racism, one person who made sure to  thank  the hotel magnate was America Ferrera herself. In a piece written for Huffington Post last summer, Ferrera wrote: You, Mr. Trump, are living in an outdated fantasy of a bigoted America. Last week, America celebrated some amazing milestones   marriage equality, universal healthcare, removing of the confederate flag   making it clear in which direction the country is moving. That is why racist remarks that play to extremists won t change the tide, no matter how hard you try. They will only serve to rally more Latino voters to the polls. Your negativity and your poorly thought out speech ignited a fire in our community. Thank you, Mr. Trump!Thank you for reminding us that there remains an antiquated and endangered species of bigots in this country that we must continue to combat. Thank you for reminding us to not sit complacently at home on election day, but to run to the polls and proclaim that there is no place for your brand of racial politicking in our government. Thank you for sending out the rallying cry.You have made your thoughts on the Latino community clear and you continue to stand by them. And in return, we will do more than tweet about our indignation and beat pi atas of your likeness. We will silence you at the polls. We will vote and use our growing position in U.S. politics. Our fellow Americans who understand and value our contributions will join us. We know there is nothing that scares you more.The truth is, Mr. Trump, that your comments mean that you fail to see that immigrants are what have made this nation. They are at the core of our ideals, and they are the foundation that keeps us afloat. No, Mr. Trump, you may not reduce us to drug dealers and rapists. We are moms and dads, sons and daughters. We are valedictorians and honor students. We are college graduates, bankers, police officers, entertainers, teachers, journalists, politicians and we are the future of America.Thank you for helping us in our work to energize the Latino vote and to usher in our shared future! Keep it up! So, while Trump s racism ignites the fire under a dying breed of racism in this nation of people who would clearly still like to own people as property, the rest of the United States in living in 2016, embracing equality of all races, genders and sexual orientations, and will absolutely wallop Trump at the polls if he happens to win the nomination.All in all, Trump deserves condemnation, he deserves to be made fun of, and most of all   he deserves to lose.Video/Featured image: Hollywood Reporter",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch How White Supremacists Are Working To Win The Iowa Caucus For Trump (VIDEO),"If the current national Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump wins the Iowa caucuses, he may have to send a thank you card to a group of white supremacists.A super PAC set up by white nationalists (thanks to the conservative majority on the Supreme Court for that, by the way) is now doing robocalls on behalf of the Trump campaign to Iowa voters.https://www.facebook.com/david.dwyer.501/videos/10205589938852221/ I urge you to vote for Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who points out that we should accept immigrants who are good for America,  Jared Taylor said on the robocall, paid for by the American National Super PAC.  We don t need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump. Taylor is the founder of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance. The robocall included two more endorsements from a conservative Christian talk show host and the head of the white nationalist American Freedom Party.Since he launched his presidential campaign by blaming Mexicans for rape and murder and encouraged his supporters to rough up protesters for the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has attracted growing support from the white nationalist movement. They view his candidacy with its explicit appeal to white power enthusiasts as the first such outwardly racially bigoted campaign within the two major parties in U.S. history.Trump has also, of course, signaled that a presidency underneath his control would operate in a fascistic manner, banning travel to the United States by Muslims and also creating a national database of Muslims similar to the types of records created by Hitler s Nazi regime in Germany.Despite the outward support for Trump with figures like former Klansman David Duke and those otherwise aligned with the movement in favor of white supremacy, the mainstream media has largely shied away from labeling Trump supporters as bigots. Instead multiple mainstream articles and news reports insist that Trump s base of support comes from those concerned about  economic inequality.  Of course, Senator Bernie Sanders has made the fight to rectify that inequality as the centerpiece of his campaign, explicitly rejecting the racial and religious hatred embraced by Trump and so far not condemned by the party itself.Featured image via flickr",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives Will Hate Why Obama Invited This Woman To The State Of The Union,"President Obama is using his final State of the Union address to spike the ball on some of the accomplishments he has been able to achieve in the two terms of his presidency. As evidence of those achievements, several guests have been invited to sit with First Lady Michelle Obama.Among those guests will be U.S. Army Major Lisa Jaster, and her sterling accomplishment was becoming one of the first three women in the history of the United States to qualify as a U.S. Army Ranger.Before Obama was President, women were not permitted to try out for this elite designation. Now they are.Jaster was one of 19 women who attempted the Army Ranger course in April, when it was opened to female service members for the first time. In some ways, she was the most unusual of them: While most troops who attend are on active duty, male and in their 20s, she was a 37-year-old officer who was activated from the Army Reserve to go, temporarily leaving behind a successful career as an engineer with Shell Oil in Houston and her husband and two young children for a shot at making history.Jaster said in a phone interview Friday that she wants to show that there are men and women capable of succeeding in almost any role. I want my presence to symbolize the fact that there are competent people out there, and as long as the standards don t change, the best person for each job needs to be placed in that job,  she said.Amazingly, in this day and age there are conservative Republicans who still oppose the idea of women serving in combat positions in the military, despite most Americans realizing that if they can pull their own weight there should be no obstacle to service simply due to gender.Major Jaster shows that it can be done, and that America has finally reached a place where we have the best defending us no matter what sex they are. That s part of the Obama legacy.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Breitbart Racist Is Attacking Neil Degrasse Tyson: ‘He Is Stupid And His Politics Are Dumb’,"Let s face it, Republicans hate Neil Degrasse Tyson because he is the Obama of science. If the frighteningly intelligent black scientist gets his mitts on their white daughters, they will want to abandon their traditional values and become  ASTROPHYSICISTS.A great example of this is a blatantly racist attack piece put together at the Republican outrage mill Breitbart. In it, the author implies that liberals are racist because they love Tyson. This is followed up immediately by Breitbart using racist tropes of the  lazy black man  to attack him personally while lamenting affirmative action as the only reasons he is on TV.Tyson, whom liberals love because they are racists who can t believe a black guy could be smart enough to be a scientist and so spontaneously ejaculate and soil themselves every time they see him on TV, hasn t published anything of note for years. The advantage of being a celebrity scientist is that you don t actually have to do any science.He didn t get the PhD he was studying for at the University of Texas and had to go elsewhere for his qualification. Obviously, rather than take responsibility for his academic performance, Tyson has blamed racism. In reality, Tyson was playing in bands and appearing on stage instead of completing essays. Typical science PhD students are at any given time either studying, teaching or sleeping.In 2005, he said: I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there s equal opportunity. He of course doesn t address the fact that the only reason Neil deGrasse Tyson is on television at all, given his intellectual shortcomings, is that he is black.Source: BreitbartHere is another famously liberal scientist, who Republicans claim has  intellectual shortcomings,  that is only on tv because of his black skin and a lot of white guilt.image: RedStateQuick fact check. Tyson did not blame his lack of a Ph.D. from UT on racism. He was talking about racism on campus, like when he was stopped 7 times by campus police for walking near the physics building. It s worth noting he was never stopped by campus police walking near the gymnasium. His Ph.D. pursuit ended when the university dissolved his dissertation committee.It took 16 seconds of Google to find that information.Apparently Breitbart is an authority in Astronomy, Physics, and Astrophysics, because they have the ability to sense when a black person has  truly worked hard enough.  in the fields. They also proved their superior authority on the topics mentioned by saying Tyson hasn t published anything of note in years. Tyson has published 13 papers, which is more than Breitbart has done, and last time I checked Breitbart did not do peer-review of any published scientific material.They also hate Tyson because he thinks about something other than Jesus.On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 25, 2014Tyson hasn t published as much work as some others, but there is a context to that. He made a choice to serve the public over himself. Instead of being insulated within the scientific community, he has given up a lot of his legacy in scientific academia in order to bring science to regular people. He went out and made science cool again when Republicans have been trying to make it something to be feared.It s a strange manifestation of birtherism in a way. A black man can t both be smart and popular everywhere except within conservative America. There HAS to be a conspiracy by liberal whites to foist his blackness upon America s heartland.featured image via youtube",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Terrified Six-Year Old’s 911 Call Is Heartbreaking (VIDEO),"After her step-father began beating her mother, a terrified six-year-old child rushed to the phone to call for help.Through her hysterical sobs, she told the emergency dispatch worker that her  mommy and daddy are having a fight. As the worker tries to get more information, Lisa pleads with her to please send the police.  This has been going on forever and ever,  she sobs. A few moments later the little girl can be heard hysterically screaming at her step-father,  STOP IT! We can t see what s happening, but we can hear the anguish and terror in her voice as she begs the 911 operator to send help. He hurt mommy Can you just send the police please,  she cries.After the operator instructs her to go and unlock the door so the police can get into the house, the little girl returns to the phone.At this points we hear her scream  He just knocked my sister out,  then saying  My little sister. The-four-year-old. There s another scream,  OH MY GOD. He s got the baby. Listen to the heartbreaking call below, via FacesofChildAbuse on YouTube.  The recording, now known as the Lisa Tape, is used by agencies across the country to educate people on the impact that domestic violence on children.After listening to the call, I had to find out what happened to that little girl and her family.I found out that Lisa, her mom and her siblings made it out of the situation alive.Today, Lisa Floyd is an advocate for survivors of domestic violence.Sadly, many domestic violence stories do not have the same kind of happy ending this one does.Every nine seconds another woman living in the United States will be the target of violence from a husband, boyfriend or intimate partner. These attacks result in more than 2 million injuries to women and 1,300 deaths, annually.We know that every year at least 3.3 million children witness domestic violence in their homes.Like Lisa s younger siblings, children who live in homes where domestic violence occurs are as 1,500 times more likely to become the targets of abuse.According to the National Domestic Violence Center, 50 percent of men who engage in violence toward an intimate partner, also abuse their children.Yet sentences for perpetrators of domestic violence remain shamelessly lenient in the United States. For example, the minimum sentence for someone convicted of domestic violence in the state of California is probation. In Florida, it is five days in the county jail. In Louisiana it s four days, at least 48 hours of which must served without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.Even more shocking, the average prison sentence for a man who kills a spouse or intimate partner in the United States is two to six years.Is it any wonder that at least 60 percent of domestic violence perpetrators repeat the violent behavior?When you listen to Lisa s tape and hear the terror in her voice, or when you look at the shocking statistics that show us how many women and children suffer horrible acts of violence at the hands men like Lisa s step-father, and then you compare those things to the consequences that our society considers  reasonable,  it s nothing less than shameful.Domestic violence remains the leading cause of injury to women in the United States. It s also the number cause of homelessness for women in children in the United States.Those statistics aren t going to change until we stop letting the perpetrators off the hook with a slap on the wrist.*image credit: wikimedia commons ",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Experts Think Gas Prices About To Go Lower Than EVER – You Won’t Believe How Low (IMAGES),"For some time now, the United States has been experiencing a rapid decline in gas prices. It s almost hard to forget when the last time filling up at the tank was a burdensome thing   that s because nearly two years has gone by since gas was over $3.00 a gallon (on average across the United States). Over the last year or so, gas prices have dropped even further, due to Saudia Arabia continuing to keep up output, and the Iran deal that is expected to glut the global market even more so. All of this is great news   but it looks like the good news will keep on flowing (pun intended) according to experts in the industry.The AAA and GasBuddy, two top organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that if refinery capacity stays strong the price of a gallon of gasoline could reach historic lows of $1.00 a gallon in some areas   a level that hasn t been reached since 1999. That would be quite a remarkable event.Prices are already low by historical standards and depending on which part of the country you live in, already under $2.00 a gallon. If you look at the map below, you will easily be able to see which parts of the United States already receive the cheapest gas. There are very few areas colored in dark green (lower than $1.38 a  gallon). Most of the middle part of the country is either light green ($1.68-$1.83), or yellow ($1.83-$1.98). If gas is pushed downward to $1.00 a gallon, that s still a huge percentage drop no matter where you live.Pic via Gas BuddyGas prices are mostly driven by four things: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies.We already know that crude oil prices are going to continue to fall. Although, there are a few detractors, there always are. Nevermind that   here s what the money managers that run the economy are doing: while 6,346 of them bet on higher prices (okay   fair enough) 17,517 of them bet on lower prices. It s not even close. This is the least bullish investors have been on oil in more than five years, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.All in all, gasoline futures fell 1.83 cents or 1.6%, to $1.12 a gallon   the lowest it s been since February 2009. And   gasoline also fell 14.33 cents a gallon (11% for the week) which also happens to be the largest weekly loss since September 2009.If the experts are right, $1.00 a gallon gasoline may not be that far off. Thanks, Obama!Pic via Gas BuddyFeatured image via White House.",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Former Obama Adviser BLASTS Trump, Calls Him Out For Attracting All The Racist Idiots (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has helped America s racists feel good about showing their true colors in all their bigoted glory. Furthermore, amazingly, the more racist Trump s remarks get, the higher he goes in the polls. Things that would be political suicide for almost anyone else seem to work wonders for Trump s numbers. Well, there is yet another person who is calling Trump out: Former adviser to President Obama, Van Jones.What has Jones so upset is most ominous indeed. It seems that a  think tank  of white power types that go by the name American Renaissance is so impressed with Trump s racism that they are now making robocalls on behalf of his bid for the presidency. The calls focus specifically on Trump s  ban all Muslims  plan. The horrible message says: We don t need Muslims. We need smart well-educated white people who can assimilate to our culture. Van Jones appeared on Face the Nation on Sunday, and he blasted the dangerous, bigoted rhetoric that has made Trump so popular with racists: This is troubling. If I were [Donald] Trump, this is a time to look in the mirror. Who am I inspiring? Who am I attracting? Why will horrible racist groups say I m the only candidate that speaks for them? This is what is   my deep concern is that Donald Trump is beginning to legitimate some of the dark things that have been in our country for a long time, and now starting to let them elevate, let them rise. Jones is right, of course, but, unfortunately, Trump doesn t care. All he cares about is numbers, and if it takes being bald-faced racist to get them, then, by God, that s what he ll do. The GOP s base is full of ignorant bigots, and Donald Trump has done a perfect job of courting them. Help us all if he actually gets anywhere near the Oval Office.Watch the interview with Van Jones below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Paul Ryan Gets Slapped In The Face With A Huge Dose Of Reality About Obamacare (VIDEO),"Last week, Republicans in Congress decided to once again waste everyone s time and tax dollars trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They know that there isn t a snowball s chance in hell that President Obama was going to approve any of their attempts to repeal the law. However, they continued the ritual of passing doomed legislation anyway, only to have it vetoed by President Obama on Friday.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan discussed the Republicans  atest attempt to repeal the ACA on Sunday during an interview on Face the Nation. During the interview, the show s host John Dickerson grilled Ryan on the Party s lack of a viable option to the ACA. You said that you wanted the Republicans to offer an alternative to the president. One of the first things you did this year, though, was offer that repeal,  Dickerson reminded Ryan.  How is than an alternative?  Dickerson asked. It s not,  Ryan responded.  It s why we have to come up with an alternative. So, you re right about that one. Will you?  Dickerson asked, skeptically. Absolutely,  Ryan stated, earnestly.  My goal   I don t know how far it will go given we have a filibuster and a guy named Obama who s not going to replace Obamacare   but my goal is that, we as Republicans, if we don t like these laws, don t like the direction the country is going, I think we have to be more than just an opposition party. It should be noted that during the rest of the 10-minute interview, Ryan names a plethora of problems in the United States, yet doesn t offer anything resembling any actual solutions to those problems. We have to be a proposition party,  went on to say.  So, if we don t like this, we ve got to show how we would do things differently. And we really think Obamacare is failing, whether it s premiums, restricted access, high deductibles, families losing the insurance they wanted to keep. People are hurting and we need to offer a solution. So, yes, on this and many other issues, we need to offer alternatives. And that s exactly what I intend on having us do. Which is exactly what every Republican has said since the ACA became law. They have absolutely nothing to offer the American people to replace the ACA with. The only viable place for healthcare to move forward in the United States at this point, is to create a single payer system. And of course, the Republican Party isn t going to propose that any time too soon.You can watch the full interview below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Economist Responsible For ‘Reaganomics’ Makes Laughable 2016 Election Prediction,"Arthur Laffer, known for inspiring Republican economic ideology since the Reagan-era, and largely considered to be the father of supply-side economics, has just come out with another prediction. No, not another false trickle-down theory of  if you cut taxes on the rich  governmental revenues will somehow maximize, and we ll all be better off   this time he is weighing in on the outcome of the 2016 election.Not only does he think Republicans will win in a  landslide,  he thinks they re going to win practically every state. Here s what he told host John Catsimatidis on New York s AM-970 on Sunday: I would be surprised if the Republicans don t take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50. I mean, I think we re going to landslide this election. That s some estimation on his part. The last time that happened was when Walter Mondale was running for president against Ronald Reagan. That was three decades ago   this guy must still be living in the 1980s. Since then most economists have come out on the record stating his economic theories have been wrong, and that  trickle-down  economics is straight up bogus. His  Laffer-curve  even has it s own laughable tag line: Laughing at the Laffer- Curve. Governmental revenues have declined since it was first implemented, giving tax cuts to the rich that ultimately hurt the economy AND the federal government s source of income. Still, that hasn t kept him from being a big wig within top Republican circles. Hey   rich guys like their tax cuts, we get it. Now they ll do anything and everything to keep on justifying those lower tax rates they have become accustomed to.Here s what else he had to say in the interview: When I look at these candidates, I don t see one of them who wouldn t do a great job as president. I think Donald Trump is phenomenal, I think Rand Paul has done a great job, I even like Jeb Bush   I think Jeb Bush is great, he did a wonderful job in Florida. Chris Christie   phenomenal. He also took a few jabs at Hillary Clinton, but pretended to be nice about it, saying that her  day is over. We get that he s a fan of Republicans, but there is no hard data to suggest even what he is predicting. It would be interesting if he could cite some source or reference for why he thinks Republicans are going to win practically every state, or why he would be  surprised  if they didn t. Yet   he doesn t provide any of that.If his 2016 election prediction is anything like his economic policies, you can rest assured it s flat-out wrong.Featured image via Laffer Center.",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

I cannot tell you how ashamed I was of our country when I saw them first hand. It was the first time I d ever been surrounded by so many ignorant people. For instance, this guy was at the event I went to:Image via FacebookDanger then took a photo of the arena that Trump bragged about filling to capacity. The venue was about half full and he explained later in the evening that seats did fill out, but there were tons of empty spots.Make no mistake, this place is less than half full. pic.twitter.com/osKDaTUtkG  Daniel Danger (@tinymediaempire) January 4, 2016When Trump started speaking, the writer explained that he constantly flipped back and forth between topics.

" Bernie Sanders Blocked From Speaking At Iowa High School, Guess Who They Let Speak Instead","Urbandale High School students worked hard to get a presidential candidate come to speak at their school in Urbandale, Iowa. Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump said that they would come speak to at the high school. Trump ended up speaking during the school s homecoming. Sanders was blocked by the administration.The Des Moines Register reports on the story, saying: The billionaire Republican visited the high school s homecoming in September after students launched a month-long campaign to recruit a presidential candidate to campus. Students had also reached out to the campaign of Bernie Sanders, who couldn t make the fall homecoming dance, but expressed interest in a later visit. Campaign officials recently tried to firm up Sanders  visit, but were turned down by school administrators. Students say they were told that another candidate visit would be too much of an administrative hassle. There were allegations of the school playing favoritism by only letting a Republican candidate speak to the school. The move prompted a backlash from some of the students. We let Donald Trump come as a presidential candidate, but in reality the main focus of his appearance at our school was that he was a high-profile celebrity,  said Josh Ingham, a senior at the school.  So we wanted a politician that is only involved in politics. So when the administration turned down this opportunity, we were kind of surprised and outraged since the campaign directly contacted our school. We had the opportunity. Ultimately, the matter was resolved with a somewhat weak compromise. Sanders wasn t allowed to speak at the school but some Urbandale students were given reserved seats at a Sanders  event. They were able to meet Sanders back stage at the event.The Des Moines Register reports that Ingham who, along with other students, was about to launch a petition to get the school s administration to reverse their decision, got a very special shout out from Sanders at the event: Sanders  Iowa staffers reserved prime seats at his Saturday evening appearance at the Iowa State Fairgrounds and set up a quick meet-and-greet with the candidate. About 25 Urbandale students gathered backstage behind a black curtain that separated them from the crowd of more than 1,500 waiting for the Vermont senator s arrival.When Sanders reached the venue, he handed a microphone over to Ingham and asked him to tell the group what had happened at the school. He told them standing up to their school was  a very brave thing to do. It s great that those students who attended the event got to have that experience. However, it is antithetical to the idea of civics education to have only one candidate, from one party speak. Representative democracy is about having candidates present their ideas, and then letting people decide who they agree with. When an institution only lets one side of the aisle speak, all they are doing is providing another bully pulpit for that party or candidate. Which is totally not cool.At least some of those students learned a valuable lesson. When the establishment screws you over   organize.Featured Image Credit:By Michael Vadon (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Charles Koch Has The Sads Because He Thinks He Should Have More Influence Over Elections,"Charles Koch, the billionaire CEO of Koch Industries has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on political campaigns because of Citizen s United, but he still thinks he should have even more influence.During an interview with the Financial Times, Charles Koch whined that even as he spends tons of money trying to shape the political landscape to his will he still doesn t have as much influence as he expected to have in 2016.Koch says he presented of list of his wishes to Republican candidates, who basically ignored them, which is why he is pouting now. (It) doesn t seem to faze them much,  Koch said.  You d think we could have more influence. It is hard for me to get a high level of enthusiasm because the things I m passionate about and I think this country urgently needs aren t being addressed. In other words, Koch has the sads because he hoped Republicans would automatically be his puppets and support and enact all of his demands.The billionaire polluter actually gave the candidates a freaking LIST of things he wants them to do if they win the presidency and now he thinks he needs even more influence because the candidates didn t seem to give two shits about it.According to Politico, the Koch brothers are poised to spend nearly $1 billion on the 2016 election, in what should be seen as a blatant effort to buy the White House and Congress.Among the many aims on their agenda is the destruction of labor unions, abolishing the minimum wage, dismantling environmental protection laws, and repealing Obamacare while opposing any effort to bring affordable healthcare to the American people. And those are just a few things that the Koch brothers want to do to this country.Charles Koch attempted a run for president in the 1980s, but he failed miserably. Instead, he decided to focus on buying the government instead.But despite his massive influence on Republican politics, Koch is complaining that he still doesn t have enough power over the candidates. In reality, the American people are the ones who should be complaining about not having enough influence over elections, which the Kochs believe they are entitled to buy.If the Koch brothers are wondering why most of the American people see them as villains, this is why.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michigan’s Republican Governor Needs Your Tax Dollars To Fix The Flint Water Crisis He Created,"The water crisis in Flint is not just simply a man-made disaster, it is the actualization of unconstrained Republican policy. For more than a year, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and the emergency manager of Flint ignored the voices of all those who spoke out about the contamination of Flint s water. Now, Michigan is forced to rely on Obama and the federal government to rescue them.In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster. There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water. One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. There has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one. When evidence was shown that Flint s water had become contaminated, Snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act. That s why Snyder is currently being investigated by the EPA.For those not in the know, an emergency manager acts as the feudal lord for cities that want to behave fiscally irresponsibly. The emergency manager law was implemented by Snyder. When a local government fails to meet certain criteria, the governor appoints an emergency manager to replace the city government. The local government still exists, but those democratically elected officials do not have any real power. You might say that s just tough luck for Michiganders who elected Snyder. But you would be wrong. The emergency manager law was overturned through a ballot initiative in 2012. Snyder and Michigan s Republican-controlled state government decided to replace the law, with an almost exact copy.Now as many as 100,000 people have been poisoned by reckless neglect (and Republicans  unfaltering devotion to destroying effective government.) This disaster was entirely preventable. The same way that the massive water shut offs in Detroit, that have received international condemnation, are completely unnecessary.At this point, there is no way that the Flint water crisis can be solved without receiving financial aid from the federal government. Snyder declared the disaster a state wide emergency last week, which makes it so that he can request financial aid from the federal government. Snyder must call on the Obama administration to fix his mess.Featured Image Credit: Michigan Municipal League via Flickr Creative Commons License 2.0",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bundy ‘Militia’ Is Begging You To Send Them A Bunch Of Tampons — For Freedom,"Folks, Barack Obama s tyranny has hit the fine, upstanding patriots currently occupying a federal building in Oregon hard. Not only did the crazed, armed occupiers  mommies forget to pack snacks for them, but they seem to have run out of clean underwear and tampons   as well as other items needed for their pretend revolution (don t worry, they do have plenty of guns).Even though police have promised them the freedom to move in and out of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge   a strange thing to grant terrorists   these grown men playing cowboy seem entirely incapable of driving to the store to buy their own supplies. The new wish list, posted to Twitter by extremism analyst J.J. McNab, includes much more than snacks.The militants now want supporters to provide them with tampons, underwear, t-shirts, money, blankets, socks, bed sheets, shampoo, deodorant (let s face it   that many Teabillies in one place can get a bit smelly), gaming supplies, and cigarettes:The need for tampons is no laughing matter. Recently, one of the militants announced that they plan to use women and children as shields against anything they view as an attack   in that case, the presence of women and children was used to dissuade the evil government from shutting off the electricity. This, of course, is a tactic that was used at Bundy Ranch as well, with one armed terrorist revealing that  If they are going to start shooting, it s going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot. I personally think that helping them would be a great idea. Send as many tampons as you want (using that big, bad government mail system) to:Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, c/o Y All Qaeda36391 Sodhouse LnPrinceton, OR 9772Let s send them more tampons than they will ever use. They can find their own damn coats.If you don t want to waste money on tampons, make a phone call and urge the FBI to finally take action against these dangerous domestic terrorists.Featured image via FreakOutNation",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Likes How North Korean Dictator Kills People To Solidify Power (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has crossed another line that should disqualify him from running for president.During a speech to a crowd in Ottumwa, Iowa on Saturday, Trump expressed praise for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for solidifying his power by spilling the blood of his family members and political opponents. You ve got to give him credit,  Trump gushed. How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals and all of a sudden, you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it s a culture thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. Here s the video via YouTube. The relevant remarks begin at the 41 minute marker.Yeah, you heard that. A Republican presidential candidate who desires to be the leader of the free world admires a ruthless dictator for the way he executes people who might be a challenge to his power. Doesn t that sound like a dangerous threat to democracy?And it s not like Trump hasn t been leaning toward being a dictator throughout his campaign. After all, we re talking about a guy who has no problem with throwing people out into the freezing cold or letting his supporters beat up protesters.Donald Trump has displayed a frightening level of hostility toward his opponents and people who don t support him or his policies. He has taken political discourse to an all new low over the last year by attacking Republican and Democratic presidential candidates below the belt. He has also made it clear that he has no respect for women and would treat anyone who isn t a conservative white guy with utter contempt. If anyone has the capacity to become America s first tyrant, it s Donald Trump.And that s why it is scary to hear him praise Kim Jong-Un and his deadly power tactics.Featured Image: flickr",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Gabby Giffords Has Made Her Choice For Who She Wants As The Next President,"The adversity that former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) has had to overcome is nothing short of breathtaking. After being shot in the head during a meet and greet with her constituents five years ago, she has made a comeback that could put her at hero status. She s a hero, because not only has she made a startling recovery, but she has dedicated her life to trying to making sure no one has to endure the pain of gun violence. Through her organization Americans for Responsible Solutions, alongside her husband retired astronaut Mark Kelly, they have made it their life s work.Now, knowing that the epidemic of gun violence is still rampant, Giffords knows we will need a continued strong voice of leadership in the White House to combat the gun lobby and fight to enact gun legislation that will be proactive and lasting. Later this week, Giffords is expected to endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Clinton has released through her campaign comprehensive solutions to reduce gun violence. She knows we are well past the time to enact proper legislation.This endorsement may come as a surprise to some, but to others it will make perfect sense. Clinton has long been a supporter of better gun reform while her democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, voted against the Brady bill five times, and according to CBS news: Sanders voted in favor of 2005 law that absolved gun manufacturers of any legal liability when someone uses their products during the commission of a crime. Part of Clinton s goals for gun reform includes a repeal to the gun industry s immunity protection: Hillary believes the gun industry must be held accountable for violence perpetrated with their guns. Hillary will lead the charge to repeal the so-called  Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act,  a dangerous law that prevents victims of gun violence from holding negligent manufacturers and dealers accountable for violence perpetrated with their guns. Giffords, alongside her husband, want gun reform, and she seems to be endorsing the candidate who has a history of standing strong against the gun lobby and is most likely to continue President Obama s efforts, combat Republicans and their perversion of the Second Amendment, and get the job done.Featured image: Americans For Responsible Solutions",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" In HISTORY MAKING Kiss Cam Moment, Gay Couple Featured At NHL Game (VIDEO)","During nearly every sporting event, at one point in the game, the cameras are taken off the game to scan the crowd for loving couples to smooch each other on the infamous  Kiss Cam.

The kiss drew huge cheers from the crowd.Parr told Outsports: It was a particularly sweet night since the Kings were playing and beat my hometown Toronto. My parents and siblings live in LA but the rest of my family think I am a terrible traitor for being a Kings fan; I ve lived in LA for 17 years. Not only did these fantastic men get to smooch in front of thousands of fellow King s fans, but they are also triathletes raising money for Leukemia and Lymphoma Society s Team in Training.This beautiful moment in history is wonderful and shows the progress we ve made as a nation, but it also highlights that in 2016, we re just now getting around to acknowledging that gay couples, male and female, do in fact attend sporting events.Congrats to the beautiful couple, and if you d like to donate to help their cause, go HERE.You can see the full video HERE, but here s a highlight of just the pair in their moment in history: Progress!

 New Group Of Armed Idiots Show Up To Provide ‘Security’ For Bundy Militia Terrorists (VIDEO),"Just when we thought the situation with the Bundy militia in Oregon couldn t get any worse, it does. The drama is heating up now, because another group of lawless armed militants have decided to come be the  security  for the militia. There s just one problem with that, though: the original militia says they don t want these new folks there.The new group calls themselves the Pacific Patriot Network, and they have taken it upon themselves to send armed guards from their group to  protect  the original occupying militia. However, Todd MacFarlane, who is a lawyer for the Bundy side of the standoff, says of these new people: We don t need that. We don t want it and we re asking you to leave. According to the Bundy group, they really want to keep the situation from getting any worse than it already has. MacFarlane says that the Bundy group is, quote,  alarmed  by the Pacific Patriot Network guards. According the Brandon Curtiss, who heads the Pacific Patriot Network up, the guards he sent will only be  patrolling the perimeter  and has no plans to interfere with original occupants, or even join them in occupation.However, the point is, the Bundys people don t want them there. The new people must be really scary if the original terrorists don t even want anything to do with them. At this point, the federal government needs to simply step in and do something about these people. It really has gotten way out of hand.Watch Bundy s militia people talk about these newbies, below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Homeless Veteran Receives A Gift From A Child He’ll Never Forget (VIDEO),"Most of us don t know what it s like to be homeless, but three brothers decided to let all of us know with a video that has gone viral. As a homeless man sat in the streets of New York asking for money for food, the youngest brother Omar sat next to him and pretended to be homeless.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvoWBbYxdwc]As people passed by, it was young Omar who who was getting money in his cup while the homeless veteran received nothing. At one point, after a policewoman put money in Omar s cup, the veteran asked her for money, saying that he had nothing to eat the entire day. Annoyed, the policewoman sternly said that she works every day and that he s a grown man and then flicked his hat.Another passerby was even more abusive. After he gave Omar some money, the veteran asked for some change to which the man said,  This little kid out here. They don t know what it takes. You re a grown ass man. I got a job. I work my ass off every day.  The veteran replied,  I served my country sir.  The man then said,  You served your country! Here is something that served your country!  He then spilled the food he was carrying all over the veteran.Yet, despite being humiliated and crying, the veteran stood up, walked a few feet to a restaurant, and came back with two slices of pizza, one for him and for Omar.That s when the two brothers of Omar came up to the veteran and told him that Omar was not homeless. They gave him all of the money Omar had collected and an additional $200. Surprised and crying, the veteran and the brothers exchanged hugs.We don t know why this man who served his country is homeless, but war is damaging both physically and psychologically. What we do know is that he was extremely kind hearted to Omar despite the humiliation he suffered at the hands of strangers.One thing that we should learn from this video is that we need to take care of our veterans.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Police Investigating Possible Attempt To Murder Bernie Sanders (VIDEO),"Since at least September, people have been calling for Secret Service protection for Bernie Sanders, noting that he is vulnerable to   potentially violent confrontations with disturbed people.  With the Right s almost devout adherence to their misunderstanding of socialism and conservative politicians  desperate attempts to equate Democratic Socialism with National Socialism (After all, a man who wants to make education affordable, help the poor, and rebuild our infrastructure is just like Hitler).It seems as though people who are concerned with Sanders  safety are correct   because on Thursday, someone shot up his Nevada campaign office while the Senator was in town. Winning Democrats reports that campaign staffers found a bullet hole in the window of the Las Vegas headquarters on Thursday morning, the same day the Senator was on site.So far, the bullet has not been located, but Metro Police took a report for malicious destruction of property and are investigating the shooting. Police confirmed that a bullet appeared to have gone through the window, but were unwilling to confirm that a shot had been fired, according to the Las Vegas Sun.The Sanders campaign declined to comment on the shooting.Numerous petitions have been circulating for months asking that Sanders be given a Secret Service detail. After all, Hillary Clinton has one. Donald Trump has one. Even Ben Carson has Secret Service protection. To date, while Trump has allowed and even encouraged violence and threats at his rallies, all of it was directed at people he didn t like   African-Americans, Hispanics, and Muslims. Only Sanders has had someone attempt to whack him. According to the Secret Service website, Sanders certainly qualifies. Candidates must:Be publically announcedHave some degree of prominence as shown by opinion pollsBe actively campaigning and entered in at least 10 state primariesBe seeking the nomination of a qualified partyHave qualified for matching funds in the amount of at least $100,000Have received contributions totaling $10 millionSanders is, of course, publicly announced. While Clinton is winning in the polls, Sanders has continually shown  some degree of prominence. Prior to 1968, candidates did not receive Secret Service protection. However, after the assassination of Robert Kennedy, things changed. We began protecting major candidates like Clinton, Sanders, and Trump   and even people who don t stand a chance like Ben Carson. He is certainly registered in at least 10 state primaries. He s seeking the nomination of the most qualified party, and he qualifies for matching funds. He has also received donations well over $10 million.It s time we demand that Sanders receive Secret Service protection   after all, he s the one people seem to be shooting at.Watch a news report on the attack below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws3ajM_CEYc?rel=0&showinfo=0]Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Barbaric Bullies Set Disabled 13-Year-Old Boy On Fire (VIDEO),"Deandre Williams suffers from a disability which causes him to walk with a limp. Because of his condition, his mother says, a group of student bullies routinely picked on and bullied him, even giving him the nickname  limpy. Shortly before Christmas, this same group of students invited the teen to the community center, supposedly to hang out. The 13-year-old then went with the group to the home of one of the student bullies.Once inside the house, one of the students doused him in cologne and then lit him on fire. He was trying to leave, run out of the house but he can t because he can t run. He walks with a limp,  his mother, Ursula Allen, told Fox 5 in New York.According to Allen, there were others in the house at the time the attack occurred, including the mother and the sister of the student who set her son on fire.Although Deandre had severe burns on his face, neck, chest and arm, more than two hours past before anyone attempted to get medical attention for the injured teen. When the sister saw what was going on she covered it up,  Allen said.  She put Deandre in the shower which hurts even more. The teen was later admitted to the hospital in critical condition, due to the severity of his injuries.Here s more on this story from Fox 5.The attack on Deandre Bloomfield took place in Staten Island, New York on December 2nd.During an interview with New York Daily News on December 9, the teen said he thought the boy who attacked him was his friend. He used to bully me. Smack me around,  he said during the interview, which took place in his room at Staten Island University Hospital North.The teen described what happened on the night of the attack. First he smacked me. I got up and I said,  Don t smack me again.  And when I wanted to leave, he picked up a perfume bottle with a lighter, and he sprayed it on me. He did it two times. The first time he did it sparked on me. . . . And that s when I started to run, and he threw the whole bottle at me. His clothes caught on fire.Deandre s attacker, another 13-year-old boy, was not identified by police, due to his age. He was arrested and faces multiple charges.No charges have been filed against the boy s mother or sister, although police say they are still investigating the incident.After spending almost three weeks in the hospital, Deandre was released just before Christmas. Community organizations pulled together to send a message of support and healing to the teen, who also opened an assortment of awesome Christmas gifts, including an xbox one, OVO clothes, gear and more, courtesy of rapper Drake and radio station Hot 97.1.During an interview with the station on January 8, Deandre said he won t be able to go back to school for another few weeks yet. He still has some healing to do. When asked whether he felt safe going back to the same school, he said the students who bullied and attacked him are no longer attending classes there.According to the National Education Association (NEA) bullying impacts more than 13 million students in the United States annually. Every day in the U.S. more than 160,000 kids stay from home school because of bullying.If you think a child is being bullied, the NEA advises against just ignoring the signs, hoping the behavior will correct itself. Instead, the organizations advises adults to intervene as soon as they suspect there is a problem.The NEA says parents should: Take any and all steps to address bullying including getting professional help. And be sure to inform someone in your child s school that your child is being bullied. It s crucial that parents have a contact person in the school whether it be a principal or assistant principal, a teacher or a support staff person. *Featured image credit: video screen capture via Fox 5",News,"January 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Experts: ‘Militiamen’ Live Hand To Mouth On Gov’t Disability And Their Wives’ Hard Work,"Jon Ritzheimer, infamous right-wing terrorist and incredible douchebag, barely squeaks by on his government disability check and has said that he is  thankful to have a wife who works.  As it turns out, experts tell us that this guy who spends his days fighting imaginary battles and sucking up a good man s oxygen isn t the exception to the demographics that make up a right-wing terrorist militia, he s the definition. These guys are broke,  said Mark Pitcavage, who has been researching far-right movements for 22 years and has studied the Harney County occupiers.  Right-wing extremists, generally speaking, have very little money. How a right-wing extremist occupation like the one in Oregon would pay for itself isn t exactly an issue there s been a lot of data on. By referencing the research of people like Pitcavage, we can deduce that right-wing extremists are for the most part freeloaders, likened to teenagers who think they can take care of themselves but overwhelmed the first time they have to pay a bill or do a load of laundry. It s quite possible that a lot of them will get tired and feel the pressure to go back and care for their families,  Pitcavage explained. Those families, left behind to care for themselves, are probably better off without their  patriarch,  the almighty man who controls everything and can make the decision to just pack up and leave on a whim to occupy a forest a thousand miles away that they ve never heard of before last week.Daryl Johnson, a former DHS domestic terrorism analyst, says militia members have a warped sense of priority where their duty  is concerned. A video released by Ritzheimer showed him crying that he would probably be killed and how much he would miss his family just before he held up a copy of the Constitution and declared  But I took an oath. They ll think nothing about taking half their paycheck and using half of it to buy ammunition and guns,  Johnson told The Oregonian.The gist here is that these idiots aren t just the worst the American gene pool has to offer, they re also incredible assholes who are neglecting their families to go play soldier in the Oregon wilderness. They re holed up in a facility they didn t pay to be at, squeezing the taxpayer for their utilities and costing tens if not hundreds of thousands more in wages paid to employees who can t go to work.The sooner these imbeciles are removed and incarcerated the better off the country   and their families   will be.Featured image via thetruthaboutguns.com",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 21 Hilarious Memes Of The Bundy/Oregon Standoff (IMAGES),"With the standoff in Oregon ongoing, one can t help but laugh at the silliness of the so-called Citizens for Constitutional Freedom and their antics. Although it s always good to find humor in any situation, one can t help but wonder if a group of armed African Americans did the same thing, what the repercussions would be. Would they have been coddled by law enforcement in the same way? What about a group of Muslims? Can you imagine what would have happened if a group of armed Muslims took over some compound?

 People Are Posting Photos Of Their Food To Mock Starving People In Syria (IMAGES/VIDEO),"According to The Independent, people who support the regime in Syria are sharing pictures of food on social media in an attempt to taunt starving civilians trapped in a town currently being bombed in Syria. The town of Madaya, a holdout for opposition forces, has been held under siege for six months by the Syrian government. The famine has become so bad that locals report that there are no more cats or dogs left in the area. The local population has even resorted to eating the leaves off from trees in an attempt to curb their hunger. As many as 400,000 people may be living in the same situation in 15 cities across Syria.So, some sick f**ks decided to taunt the locals with pictures of food.# _ _ _  pic.twitter.com/75Yoq8w5Xm  Ivan Sidorenko (@IvanSidorenko1) January 8, 2016https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1554575578194629&set=a.1379661612352694.1073741829.100009266045668&type=3&theaterhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1648692928716624&set=a.1378524129066840.1073741827.100007277976718&type=3&theaterThe number of people who have starved to death in Madaya is unknown, though some say the death toll could be as high as 41 people.

 WATCH: Ted Cruz Tells Social Worker He’s Going To Deport Her If He Becomes President (VIDEO),"During a  Cruzin  to the Caucus  campaign event in Iowa on Thursday night, Ted Cruz was questioned by a young woman who is concerned that she may be deported if Cruz is elected president.According to the Washington Post, Ofelia Valdez is a 30-year-old woman, who works as a special needs social worker and activist. Her parents brought her into the United States when she was a child illegally. She tells Cruz that she is currently safe from being deported because of President Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The program mandates that homeland security focus their attention on high priority individuals who have come into the United States illegally. High priority targets are people who have a violent criminal record. DACA makes it so that government agencies are not wasting resources going after people who more than likely were brought here by their parents, and have lived here for most of their lives. I think of myself as a part of this community and you know, first day of presidency, you decide to deport, you know, people like myself, you know, it s just very difficult,  said Valdez.Cruz has vowed to reverse the executive orders made by the President during the Obama administration. It doesn t seem to matter what those executive orders are, Obama made them so they are bad. So Cruz responds, essentially telling the woman that he would deport her, should he become president. If you re a DACA recipient, you were brought here illegally, and violating the law has consequences. One of the problems of our broken immigration system is that it is creating human tragedies and there are human tragedies when people break the law,  Cruz says.Cruz then goes on to list a number of other nations that he seems to think have a singular, hegemonic system for immigration, that represents the entire world.  This is met with thunderous applause from the other attendees at the event.You can watch a video from the event below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Mark Zuckerberg Supports Vaccinations, And Anti-Vaxxers Are Super Pissed About It (IMAGE)","Mark Zuckerberg has a daughter, and unlike parents involved in the anti-vaxxer movement, he s a responsible parent who cares about the health of his kid and those around her.The Facebook founder posted a photo of himself holding his daughter Max in a doctor s office waiting for vaccinations. Doctor s visit time for vaccines!

We all care about our kids. Growing up, my mom s best friend had a perfectly healthy daughter. She received MMR and had a grand mal seizure and suffered brain damage. Her dr diagnosed her with vaccine injury. She was left unable to talk or walk for the rest of her life. So that was MY first personal experience with vaccines. Bottom line A pharmaceutical that carries at least a risk of harm to some, should never be mandated. Because, in the end, no one seems to care about the  sacrifices  made for the  common good. Another woman named Colleen Kennedy wrote furiously that  herd immunity is a myth  and proceeded to try and scare people by listing the ingredients of the vaccine as if this has not been public knowledge for years.Others attacked the pharmaceutical industry for allegedly created epidemics so that they can sell more vaccines. You know, crazy ravings from paranoid people.As we all know, measles became a national story once again as the virus became an epidemic in this country, especially in California where many parents send their unvaccinated kids to school. Measles had been largely wiped out in this country by 1997, but because of anti-vaxxers, measles made a comeback and killed an American for the first time in 12 years.The MMR vaccine is one of the most successful preventive measures a parent can take to keep their kids healthy. Not only is measles the eighth leading cause of death worldwide, it s deadlier than the Ebola virus that sent Americans over the edge with fear in 2014. Even Fox News  own medical expert strongly endorsed vaccines and ripped anti-vaxxers a new one when asked about the new epidemic.Mark Zuckerberg is being a responsible parent and leading by example that he doesn t fear vaccines and trusts science. Other parents would be wise to follow suit for the sake of their own children.Featured Image: Raw Story",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Bundy Terrorists Claim God Told Them To Act Like Toddlers And Take Over Wildlife Refuge,"Ammon Bundy and his wayward crew of temper tantrum-throwing white guys with guns are now claiming that God talked to them and told them to seize the federal wildlife refuge.On Friday, Bundy told a meeting of fellow right-wing domestic terrorists that he refuses to end the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge because  the Lord  told him to go there in the first place. I was asked to do this by the Lord. I did it how he told me to do it. It sounds like Bundy and his band are suffering from a form of mental illness. Because the Mormon church that Bundy is a member of sure doesn t agree with him.In a statement earlier this month, officials from the Church of Latter-day Saints rejected Bundy s claim that his seizure of federal property had anything to do with religion. Church leaders strongly condemn the armed seizure of the facility and are deeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they are doing so based on scriptural principles. This armed occupation can in no way be justified on a scriptural basis. Exactly, and that is why we can no longer tolerate this armed occupation. Bundy and his pals are committing treason and domestic terrorism. They have illegally carried guns on federal property, along with breaking and entering and threatening violence against federal officials. They have forced the town of Burns to live in fear as schools and businesses are closed to avoid putting innocent children and adults in harm s way.If Bundy and his group were a bunch of armed black people or Muslims, federal and local law enforcement would have already riddled the building with bullets on the first day and Ammon Bundy would look like Swiss cheese.But because these guys are white rednecks with guns, law enforcement is giving them free reign to do as they please. Bundy thinks him and his buddies should be able to walk free when this is all over and they assume the government will give in to their demands. If that were to happen, nothing will stop these terrorists from becoming more emboldened in the future. Perhaps they ll set their sights on the Capitol building or the White House next.This armed takeover has been totally unjustified from the very beginning. Not only have Dwight and Steven Hammond, the arsonist ranchers whom Bundy says he is fighting for, rejected his cause, history and the law are firmly against him as well.Bundy claims the federal government stole the land from ranchers, but that is far from the case.According to Oregon Live, the federal government has legally held the title to all public lands in Oregon since it was a territory. After exhaustive research, the Supreme Court also ruled in 1902 and 1935 that this is the case. Furthermore, ranchers have willingly sold and been paid fair value for their land by the federal government to expand the wildlife reserve over the years.In short, the Bundys do not have religion, history, nor the law on their side. They are terrorists, pure and simple, and they need to be arrested and thrown in prison, or treated just like we have treated terrorists in the Middle East, who ironically enough also claim religion justifies their cause.Featured Image: WMUR",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 How Fox News Helped Domestic Terrorists,"In the first year of President Obama s term in office, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report warning about the threat of domestic terrorism. Immediately, Fox News and the rest of the conservative media   Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and other talk radio figures   slammed the document and were soon followed by Republican members of congress.Overly sensitive to the hue and cry from the right in those early days, then Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano withdrew the report and the unit behind it was disbanded.Since then, America has had several instances of right-wing terrorism, from the South Carolina church shooting to the murder of police in Las Vegas and the Bundy clan s repeated armed run-ins with federal authorities.Daryl Johnson is the Homeland Security analyst who worked on the report, and he says that pull back has made things dangerous.On Friday, the department announced a task force with the Justice Department to focus on countering homegrown extremists radicalized by foreign groups such as the Islamic State, drawing staff members from dozens of federal and local agencies. It is unclear if the group would investigate domestic antigovernment groups. The D.H.S. is scoffing at the mission of doing domestic counterterrorism,  Mr. Johnson said.  The same patterns that led to the growth of the antigovernment groups in the 1990s is being played out today. D.H.S. should be doing more. In case you have forgotten the growth of those right wing groups in the 1990s   again, under a Democratic president they accused of  tyranny,  we had the Oklahoma City bombing, which until 9/11 was the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, and is still the second most deadly attack of its kind. 169 people died and over 680 people were injured.Even worse, today s mainstream conservatives are espousing many of the radical ideas of the extremist movement. What once was way out on the fringe has now manifested in Republican lawmakers like Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Governor Greg Abbott calling for a  convention of the states,  echoing Confederate-era arguments about diluting the federal government and leaving more up to right-wing state governments.Thanks to Fox News browbeating the government into downplaying this very real threat to Americans, we could face a major loss of life.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Gotta Love It When Idiot Conservatives Accidentally Reveal People HATE The NRA,"Conservatives alongside right-wing media outlets are trying desperately to spin the gun debate in their favor. They know that the majority of Americans support President Obama s executive actions on guns, so they need to make it look like people don t want them.One conservative media outlet, Breitbart, decided to run an article with this title: OBAMA S QUANDARY: NRA GAINING SUPPORT, GUN CONTROL LOSING IT Screengrab via BreitbartHowever, within the text of the article they try to piece together some sort of magic way of showing Americans support the NRA, but instead fail miserably, stating: In 1987, twenty-seven percent of Americans strongly supported the NRA. In December 2015, that number had risen to 38 percent. In order words, over one-in-three Americans  strongly support  the NRA. In other other words, two-in-three Americans do NOT support the NRA. It doesn t seem smart to write an article about how terribly Obama is doing and then point out with numbers how more than half the nation is actually on his side and not yours. Bravo for that. Well done.They also point out: In addition to these things, the American people are voting with their feet by walking into gun stores all around the country and buying firearms at a record pace. Figures from the FBI show that 2015 set a record for the number of background checks performed in a single year, with 23,141,970 checks performed. But then reiterate: So the NRA enjoys the  [strong] support  of more than one-in-three Americans while support for gun control is losing ground. WSJ suggests that this put Obama in a position where he had to go it alone. No, the NRA enjoys the reward of paying off members of Congress to make sure President Obama and the rest of America doesn t get the chance to hurt gun profits. Oh, and all this hysteria over FBI background checks really proves is a strong amount of paranoia from the one-third of Americans who actually think guns are a solution or are deceived into thinking they ll lose their firearms.In regards to actual support for stricter gun laws, data proves that is actually up drastically with more than 55% of Americans saying they want laws on gun sales more strict:There are facts, and then there s how one interprets facts. Breitbart chose to report only one-third of Americans strongly support the NRA, but anyone with a rationally thinking brain can decipher that this also means that two-thirds of Americans don t. They also want you to believe citizens don t want stricter gun laws, but, in fact, they do.Truth is, we need stricter laws on gun sales to make sure the wrong people don t get their hands on guns. This includes mental health background checks. If you re a law-abiding citizen without a history of mental illness, guess what   NONE of your rights will be  infringed  because you ll still be able to purchase your precious paranoia machines firearms. And just like laws regarding cars and driving don t stop every accident, they sure as hell prevent a lot, just like better gun laws would prevent unnecessary deaths as well.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Kentucky Republicans Propose Bill To Delay School Year To Accommodate Creationist Museum,"Kentucky Republicans have decided to put the profits of a creationist museum ahead of the education of their state s children, and that just about says it all.At the very start of 2016 s legislative year, Kentucky conservatives introduced a bill, SB-50, that would keep schools closed until the end of August in order to allow the state s brand new  Noah s Ark  museum to eke out a few more weeks of the tourist season. Priorities!Writer Dan Arel has been following the situation, in all its mind-numbing stupidity, for the better part of a year. He writes:As I reported back in August of 2015, Kentucky Sen. Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, and Sen. Chris Girdler, R-Somerset had proposed such a bill to help extend the vacation season to bring more attention to the forthcoming Ark Encounter. Grant County is set to become a major tourist destination due to the presence of the Ark,  Thayer said.  But there won t be many families from Kentucky visiting in August if we continue with the current calendar. And while other states have set their school schedule around economic issues, you d be hard-pressed to find a state do that to satisfy the bottom-line of a single man.Meet Ken Ham, the right-wing creationist famous for his creation museum and infamous for getting absolutely demolished in a debate with Bill Nye. He and his giant Ark have Kentucky s Republican-led legislature wrapped around his finger.Lately, Ham has been so busy hurling hatred at gay people that one might forget that he makes most of his money by running a religious-based creation museum and associated ministry in Kentucky. In the past few years, Ham has set his sights on expanding his museum to feature a  life-sized  mock up of Noah s Ark. After a ton of fundraising   and a few charges of tax fraud   Ham opened his Ark in November, 2015.To give you an idea of how obnoxious Ham can be, this is how he chose to announce his big Grand Opening ceremony set to begin this summer: We are so excited that the construction progress and schedule landed on this 7/7 date. Genesis 7:7 states that Noah and his family entered the Ark. So it s fitting we allow the public to enter the life-size Ark on 7/7. Ham s enablers in Kentucky want to extend the park s  vacation season  to September. They hope this will bring in more money, but what they don t mention is that almost none of it would be coming back to the state. Ham, for all of his religious-speak, is primarily a huckster. He continues to label his for-profit  ministry  a tax-exempt church, and therefore pays little to no taxes. Keeping kids out of school so their parents can buy tickets for Ham s park does nothing but make students in the state more ignorant, residents poorer, and Ham richer.Schools, obviously, are not happy, either. As Ham continues to count his dollars, teachers and principals are left scrambling for a way to salvage the potentially lost time. One principal was hopeful that the bill wouldn t pass, but conceded if it did, it would be a disaster.  It may help tourism, however, I think it could potentially hurt many Kentucky children. Given the fundamentalism promoted by Ham s anti-intellectual  museums,  it s safe to say the principal is being too generous. This has all the makings of an educational disaster.Feature image via Christian Post screengrab",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ammon Bundy’s Own ‘Safety’ Committee Tells Him And His Militia Terrorists To Go Home (VIDEO),"If anything should tell the militia terrorists occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon that it is time for them to give this ridiculous  occupation  up, it should be the fact that a committee that Ammon Bundy himself helped create is telling them to leave.On Friday night, the Harney County Committee of Safety, which Ammon Bundy helped form, held a townhall event in which the occupiers were told to leave. A letter from the committee told them, essentially: you made your point, now it s time for you to go home. First, spokesperson Melodi Holt seemed to try to butter the clowns up when she began speaking, telling the militia people that they did a good job by: shining a light on the Hammond case here in Harney County.Your actions have created a national focus on the Hammonds and other issues here and across the West that have created mutual distrust, anger and unrest between the people of the land and the federal government,  Molt read.  We thank you for stirring us to action. However, that was the end of the good things Holt and the committee had to say about the Bundy militia. She went on to slam the occupiers  tactics, saying that the committee and its supporters: were very upset that you chose to take the aggressive action of occupying the refuge and did it without our knowledge or any local approval, and in a fashion that has created huge distrust and loss of credibility of and for us as a group and as residents within the community. We approved of most of your message but disapprove of your unilateral methods of occupation. We ask that you organize your people, explain that your point has been made and leave in a peaceful and honorable fashion. No comment has come from the militia occupiers, and they declined to show up to the event that was essentially held to blast what they are doing.Mr. Bundy & Co., when your own people think you are doing the wrong thing, it really is time to hang it up. Go home. The local communities and residents, along with the federal government, have been more than lenient and patient with you. The committee is right. The point has been made. Leave.Watch video of Holt s remarks below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bundy’s Anti-Government Militia Costing Taxpayers $100,000 A WEEK During ‘Indefinite’ Standoff","We already know that the citizens of Harney County do not want the Bundy militia around, but neither should the rest of us. Their stupidity is costing us a fortune.While it may seem that occupying an empty, powerless wildlife refuge during the harsh Oregon winter would be an exercise in harmless stupidity, a fuller picture is emerging that reveals the Bundys and their fellow anti-government extremists are costing America hundreds of thousands of dollars a week in tax money.The occupation of the refuge is still centered around a single building, the amount of extremists with guns marching around and threatening to shoot cops has meant nearby buildings have also had to be evacuated. The employees have been placed on paid leave for their own safety. This means that while protesting the government, the militia has caused a costly shutdown of operations that actually wastes more money than it saves.Government Executive did some digging and found that the total amount of money being paid out to employees that can no longer do their job without risk being caught in the crossfire of this ill conceived insurrection is staggering.Nearly 120 permanent and seasonal employees report to BLM s district office in Burns, Ore., nearly all of whom are now on paid administrative leave.The salaries of those workers total approximately $117,000 per week, according to a BLM spokesman. The office has already been closed for more than one week. About 50 more employees work at the refuge center or the Forest Service s Emigrant Creek Ranger District office, many of whom are also on paid leave.An official at the Harney County, Ore., joint information center   which is handling inquiries on the situation   who refused to be identified due to  security threats,  said federal officials  don t have a cost estimate yet  on the other two facility closures, noting they are dealing with a  fluid situation. In other words, the expenses are only getting worse as the siege continues and the tension mounts.Hundreds of thousands of dollars have already been lost and the militia is only growing more emboldened. On January 8, the Harney County Sheriff s Department announced that negotiations have all but fallen apart and the militia appears to have dug in for the long haul.Statement from Sheriff Ward: pic.twitter.com/6fz0OenM4d  Harney Cty. Sheriff (@HarneyCoSheriff) January 8, 2016While the militia has been dismissed by some as clowns (and they are), they are still dangerous. But even  fiscal conservatives  should have a problem with this approach. They are expensive dangerous clowns. Every day they stay in Oregon and continue to make threats, the total damage caused by their actions continues to tick upwards.Feature image via YouTube screengrab",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Racist Moron Gets Fired For This 20 Second Video Of Him Shouting ‘Wetback’… At An Arabic Person (VIDEO),"It s not often that the stupidity of a racist has layers. Typically a slur is aimed at a minority that is easily recognizable, disgusting and crass followed by a video being released and the internet calling the bigot in question out for it. Occasionally, the imbecile will be found and karma will collect their job, or in the very least, they re forced to quit the internet.In this case, the story has one added hilarious twist: The dumbass shouts the slur, loses his job and gets called out   and he couldn t even get it right. During his hand-clapping chorus of  Beaner! Beaner! Wetback! Wetback!  the poster child for more education funding ignores one fun fact: The woman he is shouting at for being Latino tells him repeatedly that she is, in fact, of Arabic descent.That in and of itself shows just what a doofus the a-hole is. In the obvious circles he has to run in, being Arabic is far worse than being Hispanic. Hispanics are just drug dealers and rapists while Arabic people are all packing suicide vests. Maybe he felt if he called her something as clever as  towel head  she would detonate.Or perhaps he really is just that stupid.The man, an Oregonian identified as an employee of a small company, Wolcott Plumbing, now has bigger fish to fry. He ll be waiting in line Monday at the unemployment office. After local station KGB got hold of the video and reported on it, a company official wrote: First of all, this is a very upsetting situation. Under no circumstances do I personally nor do we as a company condone the use of abusive language of any kind to anyone. Upon further investigation today, I learned and confirmed it was one of my employees in the video. This employee was immediately terminated.

 Cruz Dedicates Empty Seat At State Of The Union To ‘50 Million Unborn Children’ Instead Of Gun Violence Victims (TWEET),"Yesterday, President Barack Obama made a touching tribute to the victims of gun violence. Just days after his executive action on gun control, Obama announced that he would be leaving an open seat at his future State of the Union address to represent every life that has been lost in senseless gun-related deaths   a sentiment that anyone who been affected by gun violence could appreciate.This move from our president isn t surprising  the Obamas have hosted family members of gun violence victims in State of the Union addresses before. Obama s empty state at the State of the Union will be in the First Lady s guest box.On a conference call with Organizing for Action, Obama explained the reason behind his gesture: We want them to be seen and understood; that their absence means something to this country. We want to tell their stories, we want to honor their memory and we want to support Americans whose lives have been forever changed by gun violence and remind every single one of our representatives that it s their responsibility to do something. Obama also reminded his supporters that  these kinds of important gestures only matter if it translates into action. Like clockwork, it didn t take long for a Republican to swoop in and ruin the moment. This time, it was Texas senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz, who decided to take the president s emotional, heartfelt remarks and turn it into a GOP talking point on abortion. Pro-birth Cruz, who has been known for his abortion and sex-related rants, tweeted this awful thing in response to Obama s tribute:Ted Cruz twitterHow sensitive. Like many of his conservative peers, Cruz has been resisting Obama s executive action hard, and making sure to add his unwanted opinion wherever and whenever possible. Currently, there is a fundraising appeal on Cruz s campaign website that claims that Obama  wants your guns  (even though Obama has repeatedly said that he believes in the Second Amendment and that legal guns will not be confiscated).Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" This Pill Is 25,000% More Expensive In America Than In India – And You Can Blame The U.S. Government For It","In 2013, Gilead Sciences Inc. filed an application with the FDA for a new drug that they claimed could cure hepatitis C. The drug was nothing short of a miracle.The new wonder drug was named Sovaldi. Where previous hep C treatments had a minimal success  rate and involved 6-12 months of grueling treatment that involved a slew of harsh side effects, Sovaldi cured people at a 94%+ rate in one 12-week treatment. It was so good, that Gilead received the FDA s Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which is given to drugs that show a tremendous advance over existing options and treatments.After an astonishingly fast review process and approval by the FDA, Gilead filed a patent for Harvoni which is Sovaldi combined with an NS5A inhibitor. Demand for Harvoni skyrocketed globally because currently there are approximately 130 million to 150 million people living with hepatitis C around the world.To call this a medical advance of historic proportions would be putting it mildly. The unfortunate fact is that the very thing that makes Harvoni so wonderful is what makes it absolutely terrible  if you happen to live in America.In the U.S., a 12-week course of Harvoni costs $84,000   $94,000. It works out to approximately $1000 per pill. If you lived in India, the cost per pill is $4.I get it. The cost to develop a drug can be staggering. Research and development work, plus the employees who perform it, are not free. Then there are trials and further tests. It all gets expensive. But here is the problem; Gilead didn t do any of these steps. It turns out, Sovaldi was already invented by a group called Doctors of the World at Cardiff University in 2007.DotW is claiming that Gilead merely copied their publicly funded research, rushed it through FDA approval and patenting, and then immediately jacked the price to reap an absolutely insane profit. It worked. In 2014, Gilead had a total revenue of $24.9 billion compared to $11.2 billion in 2013.Comparing this to India, you start to see the disgusting truth of it all. The Indian government denied Gilead a patent in their country, on the grounds that they couldn t prove that the drug was more effective at treating hep C than what was invented at Cardiff University in 2007. This has forced Gilead to actually compete in a free market.Due to not having a government-sanctioned monopoly in India, Gilead was forced to sell their pill at $4. This results in a total cost to save your life of about $340.For the cost of the same treatment with the same pill in America, where we have  the most amazing healthcare system in the world,  you could literally move to India, live there for about 2 years, take the drug for a few weeks during that time, get cured, then move back and still come out saving money.How freaking ridiculously insane is this?!A lawsuit was filed by Doctors of the World against Gilead as well, on the basis that the drug molecule was not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent. Seeing as India s regulatory agencies and patent office has already concurred with the opinion in this lawsuit, things do not look to be going well for Gilead in the future. I personally wouldn t be buying their stock.This brings us to the heart of the problem. Gilead essentially ripped off publicly funded work, copied a drug, then  innovated  by mixing it with a secondary drug to call it unique. This justified the technicalities required for a patent, but it violated the spirit for which patents are intended. If the FDA and U.S. patent office did some due diligence and used India as a precedent, denying Gilead their vulture capitalism cash cow, this would not be an issue.The FDA has a problem with revolving door crony capitalism. One example is FDA member Milton Packer, who chairs the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee. Packer reviews applications for drugs submitted to the FDA for regulatory approval. He is also financed by Novartis and has spoken on their behalf to the advisory board he himself chairs. He has also gone to bat in his own committee for GlaxoSmithKline in 2003, Spoke for Sanofi in 2009, and consulted for Pfizer in 2010.Packer s activities, while part of a government board meant to impartially regulate pharmaceuticals on behalf of the nation, scream conflict of interest. And he is only one person among many who participate in this sort of nonsense.Government involvement in a market, especially one like pharmaceuticals, is desperately needed. However, when that government involvement ends up being corrupted to where it serves the needs of corporations over people, it becomes a government-sanctioned monopoly that is enforcible by law.Real progressive regulatory and patent reform is so desperately needed in America, and any presidential candidate who is serious about helping the middle class should make it a primary focus of their campaign.Featured image via drugs.com",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BUSTED: Guess What The Bundy Militia Was Doing While They Were Not In Gunfights With The FBI,"Oregon Public Broadcasting just busted the Bundy militia using government computer systems and accessing federal employee data within the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.In a rather serendipitous occurrence, the blue tarp man himself   LaVoy Finicum   was leading OPB reporter John Sepulvado through the building on a tour, explaining what their plans were for the building. That s when Finicum led him right into something none of the militia wanted anyone to see.Finicum led Sepulvado into a computer room that was part of the wildlife refuge compound. He explained to Sepulvado that the militia planned to convert it into a  media room  to house reporters who they expected to come to the site.That s when it all went wrong for the militia.Sepulvado observed militants interacting with government computers in the compound that can only be accessed with employee badges. Employee badges were also strewn about the room, laying out in plain sight, along with papers that had names and Social Security numbers on them.Finicum immediately realized how badly he screwed the pooch by allowing the OPB reporter to see what they were doing, and for good reason. Their activities likely will fall under the Computer Fraud And Abuse Act which carries some serious penalties (fines and up to 10 years in prison) for what they were doing.Finicum made a mad dash to pick up all the papers full of personal information and ID cards and hid them away. Shortly after that, Ryan Bundy entered the room.Bundy emphatically denied that anything had been touched since they began their occupation of the compound: No, we haven t touched a single personal item. We haven t touched any of the computers, we haven t tried to log on   we haven t done anything. We re not here to hurt people. Not even the people who work here. This is where I call BULLSH*T. I ll bet any amount of cash that federal employees do not make a habit of having reams of papers, covered in very sensitive and personal information just laying about on their desks as a normal part of their workday. I will also bet that if they were to do something like this, it would be once in a blue moon and they would put it away before the left for the day. The same goes with the ID cards. If they were the key to using a computer, there is no doubt that any activities would be tied to the card used to access a terminal, and any misuse would fall on the individual who was assigned the card. There s no way employees would leave them laying around like that.The stupidity of the militia, bringing a reporter into what is essentially an ongoing crime scene, would almost be comical, except for one really serious detail.Law enforcement officials informed OPB that prior to the occupation, federal employees and family members of local law enforcement had received anonymous threats. Harney County Sheriff David Ward said that his own deputies and family members had been followed home by unknown individuals, photographed, and had property damaged in recent months.There are 17 employees that work at the refuge. All of these people could have had their personal information, home addresses, phone numbers, emergency family contacts, and God knows what else stolen and disseminated by a group of militants with too many bullets and too few brains. Up till this point, things were a good laugh. Now  not so much.Featured image via OPB",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Muslim Woman Kicked Out Of Trump Rally Speaks Out: They Asked, ‘Do You Have A Bomb?’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s rally are a hotbed of bigotry, and that was proven at his latest event in Rock Hill, South Carolina. A Muslim woman, Rose Hamid, 56, attended, and she says she had some predictably horrific encounters before Trump s goons finally threw her out for no reason other than the fact that she is Muslim. Speaking to CNN s Don Lemon, Hamid said: One guy was saying,  Get out   do you have a bomb? Do you have a bomb?  I said,  No. Do you have a bomb?  They were saying ugly, ugly things. One guy was saying,  God is great.  I said,  Yeah, God is great. Though Hamid wore a shirt that expressed peaceful intentions, she and another man were escorted from the event by a police officer. To make matters worse, Trump himself seized the opportunity to stoke the fires of hate and bigotry in his ignorant base, saying as they were removed by a cop: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable. It s their hatred, it s not our hatred. Hamid summed the experience up perfectly when she told Don Lemon that Trump s repeated Islamophobia and hate speech is a vivid example of what happens when you start using this hateful rhetoric and how it can incite a crowd. Lemon asked Hamid what most folks would ask a person who goes into a lion s den of hate deliberately: Some people would say,  Why even put yourself in that position, Rose? To be around those people. Hamid s response was one of wisdom and bravery: Because I don t want to think of them as  those people. I think that s what the problem is, that we look at people and we categorize them as  those people  who are bad people and  these people  are the good people. I believe that people in all camps are decent people as we get to know them. Well, she has more faith in humanity   and especially in Donald Trump supporters   than I do. Hopefully, on some level, Rose Hamid is right and I am wrong.Watch video of the interview below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch What Happens When a Muslim Woman Shows Up At A Donald Trump Rally (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has managed to attract the most racist and Islamophobic of American voters. That was all on display in Rock Hill, South Carolina, at a Friday night campaign rally when a Muslim woman, 56-year-old Rose Hamid, was thrown out by Trump security.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK0Otof0wow]Rose, dressed in traditional Islamic dress and a t-shirt that read  I come in Peace,  was sitting in the stands directly behind Trump when Trump supporters, at the urging of his campaign staff, began to chant Trump s name after Rose stood up when Trump suggested that Syrian refugees were affiliated with ISIS. Rose simply stood up and stayed silent when she began to be heckled, which eventually led to her removal by Trump s security.Hamid later said that she  came to the rally to let Trump supporters see what a Muslim looks like so I figured that I d give them the opportunity to meet one. She said that many were shouting  epithets  at her. She said that one man yelled,  You have a bomb, you have a bomb. Trump made an ironic comment at her, making the victim of the night the victimizer. Trump said: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable. It s their hatred, it s not our hatred. Major Steven Thompson of the Rock Hill Police Department said that Hamid was removed  from the rally because the campaign advised him before the event that  anybody who made any kind of disturbance  should be immediately ejected.However, it s clear from the video that Hamid was not making a disturbance. It s become commonplace for Trump supporters to remove and sometimes beat individuals who challenge his stance on racist and anti-Islamic dogma which has attracted followers from across the country.This is Trump s America, and as can clearly be seen from the video, if this person gets to power, we are all in trouble.Featured image via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Rips Into Jeb Bush For Taking ‘Disgusting’ Money (IMAGES),"Elizabeth Warren may not be in the spotlight as often as she used to be, but we assure you she s still there, fighting away. Anytime she sees something that doesn t quite look right; you can bet she s the last person in a room afraid to speak up about   especially when big banks are involved.On Friday, Senator Warren was reading a story like the rest of us mere Earthlings, and was so outraged by it that she took to her Facebook page for a viral call out. Her target? Jeb Bush, his super PAC, and Former AIG Chairman Hank Greenberg.The billionaire Republican donor just gave $10 million to the Right to Rise group to keep Jeb from falling out of the race. It s basically keeping him alive to duel it out just before the nation s first primaries begin. But   that s not the reason for her dissatisfaction. It turns out; Warren still has a bitter taste in her mouth stemming from the economic collapse of 2008, which saw his company receive a  huge bailout from the Bush administration  after doing a disservice to the American people. She doesn t forget these things it seems.Her full post is featured below, but this part of it is the most headline-worthy, without a doubt: I m not sure what s more disgusting: That Jeb Bush is pinning his Presidential hopes on his brother s bailout money, or that bailed-out CEOs are trying to buy elections. Pic via Facebook.The Wall Street Journal first reported the contribution on Thursday, although he refused to talk about it in an interview with them. We wonder why. You feel strongly enough about the man to give him $10 million, but don t want to talk about it? Strange.Senator Rand Paul also saw the irony in it, as well. He tweeted out almost a full day before Senator Warren how odd it was for Bush to be accepting money to  bail out his campaign,  especially when that money came from  his brother s bailout money. Pic via Twitter.Why does anyone seem surprised? This is just politics as usual. You scratch my back; I ll scratch yours. It s worked this way forever. Heck, it s even legal. Bush used to work as an  advisor  getting paid millions from investment banks just shortly after he left the Governor s office in 2007. It s not like he s expected to do any special favors for all these generous contributions he s receiving from these big banks. People need to lighten up.**If you didn t catch the sarcasm in that last part, we promise to do a better job next time.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Governor Of Texas Unveils Detailed Plan To OVERTHROW The Federal Government,"There s something stirring in the Deep South that is reminiscent of when the South decided they were going to throw a hissy fit and secede from the union for not being allowed to own people as property. Some states feel that they shouldn t have to follow federal law and believe states  rights supersede the laws of the federal government.Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R), knowing in his heart of hearts that while he doesn t like that the federal government holds supremacy over the states, due to this little thing called Article 6 Section 2 of the United States Constitution, has decided to release a plan to change the Constitution. This is in an effort to change the rule of law in the United States and prohibit Congress, the Supreme Court and the president from regulating states. He seems to be calling forth for their to be an overthrow of the government by the states who don t agree with the Constitution as it is written so that they can have their own set of rules and laws.Abbott, in a bit of word play claims to have unveiled constitutional amendments to  restore the rule of law.  However, it seems he would rather not have federal law at all. Honestly? The next step after this would be secession. It looks like Abbott may be on the verge of wanting to start another Civil War.Abbott, with his own interpretation of the Constitution put out a press release that stated:Governor Greg Abbott today delivered the keynote address at the Texas Public Policy Foundation s Annual Policy Orientation where he unveiled his Texas Plan to restore the Rule of Law and return the Constitution to its intended purpose. In his plan, Governor Abbott offers nine constitutional amendments to rein in the federal government and restore the balance of power between the States and the United States. The Governor proposes achieving the constitutional amendments through a Convention Of States. The increasingly frequent departures from Constitutional principles are destroying the Rule of Law foundation on which this country was built,  said Governor Abbott.  We are succumbing to the caprice of man that our Founders fought to escape. The cure to these problems will not come from Washington D.C. Instead, the states must lead the way. To do that I am adding another item to the agenda next session. I want legislation authorizing Texas to join other states in calling for a Convention of States to fix the cracks in our Constitution. Governor Abbott went on to explain that dysfunction in Washington, D.C. stems largely from the federal government s refusal to follow the Constitution. Congress routinely violates its enumerated powers, while taxing and spending its way from one financial crisis to another. The President exceeds his executive powers to impose heavy-handed regulations. And the Supreme Court imposes its policy views under the guise of judicial interpretation. Governor Abbott urged action by Texas   and other states   to restore the Rule of Law in America.Governor Abbott offered the following constitutional amendments:Prohibit Congress from regulating activity that occurs wholly within one State.Require Congress to balance its budget.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from creating federal law.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from preempting state law.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a U.S. Supreme Court decision.Require a seven-justice super-majority vote for U.S. Supreme Court decisions that invalidate a democratically enacted law.Restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments by limiting the former to the powers expressly delegated to it in the Constitution.Give state officials the power to sue in federal court when federal officials overstep their bounds.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a federal law or regulation.The full plan can be found here.The one who seems to not want to follow the Constitution is Gov. Abbott himself. If he did he wouldn t want to amend the Constitution as it is written. He s trying to overthrow the government by stripping federal authority away from every aspect of our government as it stands today. He wants to be able to throw out decisions made by all three branches of our federal government. If this isn t treason, I don t know what is.What Abbott doesn t seem to realize is that in a nation where everyone gets a vote to elect in who they want as lawmakers, THAT is how we can change federal laws. We don t throw a hissy fit over certain laws that don t fit with the criteria of what you want for your specific state. That s what the South did before the Civil War when they wanted to own humans as property, and that what he seems to want now to overthrow any gun regulation or marriage equality. What he is proposing is going against the very fabric that makes us the United States of America. The South lost then, and he will lose now.It looks as though Abbott is trying to be the next Jefferson Davis and lead a new brand of Confederate States.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Weird: Ted Cruz Fantasizes About Spanking Hillary Clinton (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz again showed that his campaign is weirder than previous conservative Republican efforts by publicly fantasizing about spanking former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Cruz revealed his spanking fantasy while rehashing the favored conservative conspiracy theory about Clinton doing something nefarious with her emails. In this iteration, Cruz echoed earlier conservative claims that Clinton was involved in a wide-ranging cover-up of the Benghazi terrorist attack in Libya.In response, Cruz said, Clinton deserved  spanking  for supposedly covering up what happened on the fateful night of the attack.A woman in the audience had asked:  For three and a half years people in Washington have been skirting around Benghazi and no one has been held accountable. I want to know what you would do. Someone needs to pay. Ma am you are exactly right. What happened in Benghazi is a national disgrace. Four Americans were murdered. We lost the first ambassador in the line of duty since the Carter administration,  Cruz said.  The immediate response of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the entire administration was to engage in deception, obstruction and cover up. They began by falsely blaming it on some ridiculous internet video, but even before that was the question that everyone should ask is why was security not there in the first place when the ambassador said over and over again, keep us safe. Cruz  added:  We do know Hillary told her daughter Chelsea, well gosh, I knew it was a terrorist attack, while we were out telling the American people it wasn t. You know I ll tell you, in my house, if my daughter Catherine, the five-year-old, says something she knows to be false, she gets a spanking. In addition to lying about the Obama administration response to the attack   President Obama referred to it as an  act of terror  almost immediately after the event   Cruz s conspiracy echoes other sexist belittling of Clinton that has become mainstream on the right.She has often been compared to Lady Macbeth and other infamous women who have orchestrated events as conservatives have often been flummoxed in their quest to attack her and tie her in to one conspiracy or another.Cruz is doing well in Iowa, and could consolidate enough of the fundamentalist right-wing  Christian  vote their to achieve a victory, but his har right persona is almost guaranteed to face electoral failure everywhere outside the solid red enclaves of the south. Indulging in a public fantasy about spanking Clinton will not help that cause.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You’ll Never Guess Which Conservative Blowhard Compared Trump To Hitler (VIDEO),"As you re probably aware already, Donald Trump released an Instagram video this past week in which he attacks Bill Clinton s embattled sex life while tarring Hillary Clinton as being a women s rights hypocrite for remaining married to Bill.Insane.It only gets more insane when the video shows Hillary and Bill flanked by another Bill   Bill Cosby.On Thursday night s edition of The O Reilly Factor, yet another Bill   Bill O Reilly   along with former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, reviewed the video. At the tail end of the segment, O Reilly said something that ought to shock everyone.O Reilly said to Perino,  [B]y making Hillary Clinton the focus, and this ad that we re going to show you features Cosby, Monica Lewinsky.  O Reilly continued,  You know, I don t know if Hitler made it, but you know, he might have. It s crazy. So, yes, Bill O Reilly just compared Donald Trump to Hitler. Frankly, I don t quite know how to feel about this. On one had, O Reilly violated Godwin s Law by invoking Hitler during a political discussion.On the other hand, O Reilly isn t totally wrong. Obviously, there s only one Hitler, and I ve resisted the urge to go there, but the ad is classic propaganda, the likes of which the Nazi regime perfected during its terrible reign. Maybe the compromise is Joseph Goebbels, Hitler s minister of propaganda. But we re still in Godwin s territory.Then again, if a prominent conservative wants to give the Democrats a big chunk of excellent video for a future commercial, I m all for it. If the Democrats haven t archived this clip for a series of ads, and perhaps sent a letter to O Reilly, thanking him for the easy win, they re insane. This ought to play in pro-Hillary or pro-Bernie ads from now until November. Thanks, O Reilly.Via Media Matters: Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Captain ‘Murica: Civil War – Theft, Fraud, Booze And Brawling Are Wrecking The Bundy Revolution","The next American Revolution ended before it ever started, by the hands of the very  patriots  that claimed they were ready to die for the freedom poachers and arsonists.Ammon Bundy s occupation of misfit militiamen is already starting to fracture apart because they just can t seem to get along with each other. Brawling, fraud, theft, booze and paranoia are quickly turning the situation in Oregon into the fastest failure of a publicly funded reality TV show ever.Blaine Cooper, whose real name is Stanley Blaine Hicks, was accused by another militia member of assaulting him with a sucker punch. The victim of the assault, Jeff Kagan, quickly called upon the government he hates when he dialed 911 after the assault. No reason was given for the assault, other than the fact Kagan walked from his camp across the street, towards the main militia gathering area. When he approached the area, Cooper attacked both Kagan and one other individual. Cooper also attacked one of a 3-member group of people who came to help remove a suicidal veteran who suffered from PTSD. Allegations were made that Cooper planned on using the veteran literally as a target to provoke a violent confrontation with federal authorities, by exploiting his PTSD and suicidal tendencies. While Cooper appears to still be there, he has prevented others from joining to grow their numbers. Count him as about 3 to 4 lost members.Self-titled  Captain  Joe O Shaughnessy stole crowdfunded money from the group s  war chest  to fuel a drinking binge at a local motel. This caused him to be branded a  deserter and a coward  by fellow militia members, such as John Ritzheimer. After all the booze money was gone, the  captain  left the standoff and claimed all statements made about him by the militia members are a smear campaign.Brian  Booda  Cavalier, who goes by the name Fluffy Unicorn (yes he really does) has also been forced out of the militia as well. This happened after he was caught lying about being a former marine when the US Marines confirmed with the press that he has never served a day in his life. Cavalier was the personal bodyguard of Ammon Bundy for a time.The infamous  blue tarp man  LaVoy Finicum, is also leaving the gathering, despite his allegations that the FBI will arrest him if he does. I need to get home. I got cows that are scattered and lost,  Finicum was quoted as saying. Clearly he should have brought his cows with him so he could take care of them.Initial reports that indicated the militia were numbering around 150 individuals appear to have been exaggerated as well. The group was actually 15 people and now it is down to 12 without a federal officer firing a single shot due to bad behavior and directionally challenged cows.Perhaps the first Bundy standoff was more  successful  and avoided mockery because it was relatively new. Who really knows? With luck, these people will make being in a militia as uncool as your dad wearing socks with sandals while chaperoning the school dance.Featured image via WMUR",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Presidential Candidate Reveals Their New Plan To Starve The Poor,"Jeb Bush just unveiled a key component of his welfare reform package. The Republican presidential candidate wants to completely scrap the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. It should be noted that  Right to Rise  is the name of Bush s Super PAC.Bush wants to replace those programs with one that gives states  Right to Rise  grants, to support state-run programs aimed at alleviating poverty. Bush refers to the current programs in place as  failed programs  of the war on poverty, on account of there being 47 million people who are still poor in the United States. In the place of these failed programs, states will be given Right to Rise Grants. These grants will allow states to meet the needs of poor families, in the way that makes most sense in each state. As governor of Florida, I saw first-hand how states could be the laboratories of democracy. I know that giving states more flexibility will open the door for transformative ideas to eliminate poverty and increase opportunity,  Bush wrote on his campaign website, on Friday.Bush does not have any interest in reforming welfare to help fight the war on poverty. He wants to further the Republicans war against the poor. This proposal is just an attempt to dismantle the welfare system in the United States, in order to create a less efficient government.If Bush cared at all about the poor, he would support raising the federal minimum wage to a point where working people no longer need to go on assistance programs. Bush doesn t want to raise the minimum wage. In fact, he has publicly stated that opposes the very concept of the minimum wage. As with welfare, Bush thinks that the minimum wage is a matter for the states to work on, not the federal government. There is disagreement between economists on what effect raising the minimum wage might have on job creation, yet almost every economist agrees that raising the minimum wage would lift many people out of poverty. Now, if a candidate, Republican or otherwise, seriously wanted to reform welfare in a way that acts as scheme to lift people out of poverty, they should be looking at what Finland is doing.Featured Image Credit: USDA via Flickr",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘American Sniper’ Widow Gets Set Straight After Telling POTUS ‘We Can’t Outlaw Murder’ (VIDEO),"Taya Kyle, the widow of infamous  American Sniper  Chris Kyle, attended CNN s  Guns in America  town hall Thursday, where she grilled President Obama on his executive actions regarding gun control and safety. Mrs Kyle, who received the  thank you  right-wingers said would never come from the president for her husband s service, took to the moment like a champ, managing to squeeze every conservative talking point possible into a few short minutes.A somewhat bizarre moment came when she told the president we  can t outlaw murder.  She presumably meant that there s no way to stop all murders from happening, so why bother trying if it will inconvenience someone with a 10-minute background check: The thing is that the laws that we create don t stop these horrific things from happening, right and that s a very tough pill to swallow. We want to think we can make a law and people will follow it, but by the very nature of their crimes they are not following it. By the very nature of looking at the people who hurt our loved ones here, I don t know any of them would have been stopped by the background check and yet, I crave that desire for hope, too. Part of it is we have to recognize that we cannot outlaw murder, because the people who are murdering, right, are   they are breaking the law but they also don t have a moral code that we have, so they could do the same amount of damage with a pipe bomb. Mrs. Kyle and those who think like her probably thought her point was some form of a slam-dunk   that the president wouldn t be able to answer. That turned out to not be the case, as her argument is based in NRA myths and lies and not in the reality that we all live every day.She does make some interesting points about the direction the country has been traveling when it comes to violent crime but stops short of reasonable when she says we should be celebrating the dropping murder rates in our country. The president agreed that we don t put enough emphasis on the good that we ve done, but that s because there s still so much horror happening every day.He s right. We can t simply say,  hooray for us, we kill fewer people than we did in 1985, let s stop worrying about it!  We have to remain vigilant and continue to institute policies that will bring the violent crime rates even lower over the NEXT 2 decades as well. The president s actions are a part of that plan and a part of his ongoing commitment to make America safer.Watch the entire exchange between President Obama and  American Sniper  widow Taya Kyle below:Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ted Cruz Performed A Totally Awkward JFK Impression, Proving Why Conservatives Aren’t Funny (VIDEO)","Someone, at some point in time, made the mistake of telling Ted Cruz that he s a funny impressionist. If you recall, Cruz previously regaled us with a totally not-funny re-enactment of the Miracle Max scene from The Princess Bride. Correction: Cruz nearly ruined that scene for all time. There s something especially repulsive about a squishy-faced right-wing zealot hamfistedly performing a scene from one of the most beloved comedies of our time.And now, he s trying to sully the memory of one of the most beloved presidents in modern history by doing another one of his   let s face it   really, really awkward, flopsweat inducing impressions.The second place contender for the Republican nomination appeared at a diner in Iowa the other day and unexpectedly broke into his impression of John F. Kennedy.And it sucked. Sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked.Not only that, but he insisted,  JFK would be tarred and feathered and thrown out of the modern Democratic Party.  Um, no. There s no justification for that, whatsoever. Once again, Ted Cruz is totally lying. In many ways, JFK is more liberal than our current Democratic president, and he s absolutely more liberal than the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton.Cruz continued,  You know, JFK said [in JFK voice],  Some men see things as they ahhh, and ask why. I see things that nevah wuhhh, and ask  Why not? STOP! For the love of all that is holy, can someone please tell Mr. Cruz to never, ever do that again? Ever? Along those lines, stop trying to be funny, conservatives. You can t do it without sounding like Lt. Hauk from Good Morning, Vietnam.The whole thing was made worse by the fact that Cruz was flanked by one of the most extreme Republicans in Congress, Steve King. Together, they form a Voltron of awfulness   both of whom routinely exploit the proud ignorance of their supporters. I can t even imagine the seismic disaster that would ve occurred if King had launched into a Reagan impression at the same time. Suddenly the fabric of space and time would ve collapsed and formed a singularity of unfunny that not even light could escape.Again, stop it, senator. Before you kill the universe.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj5KczUOAvA]Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NRA Gets Blasted For Live-Tweeting Obama’s Town Hall Meeting Instead Of Actually Attending (TWEETS),"On Thursday night, CNN s Guns In America  town hall meeting on gun violence attracted the attendance of several gun legislation opponents, but strangely enough the most outspoken pro-gun group wasn t there to counter President Barack Obama on his executive action. Host Anderson Cooper said that the National Rifle Association (NRA) had definitely been invited, but chose not to attend. Proving that it was all talk and no action, the gun advocacy group had declined the opportunity to participate in the live Q&A session with the President, and basically forfeited their right to complain about the issues going forward. NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the reason the association declined was because the meeting was just a  public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House. However, that didn t stop the NRA from whining and giving their opinion during the town hall meeting anyway. As the organization watched Obama talk about tightening background checks and closing loopholes for gun sales, the NRA decided to live-tweet the event   a choice it would immediately regret.NRA TwitterNRA TwitterNRA TwitterAs Guns In America went on, the NRA made up for its lack of physical presence by filling its Twitter feed with criticisms of Obama and shared several equally ridiculous posts from gun rights advocates. Thankfully, not everyone on Twitter is as thick-headed and came to Obama s rescue to set the NRA straight:TwitterTwitterSome even chose to remind the association to shut the f*ck up since it couldn t be bothered to confront Obama in person.TwitterObama also took some time out of the town hall to blast the NRA for backing out of the discussion and expressed his disappointment in an organization that has been so vocal against gun legislation. He said: Part of the reason I welcomed this opportunity by CNN to have a good discussion debate about it is because our position is consistently mischaracterized.   There s a reason why the NRA is not here. They re just down the street. And, since this is the main reason they exist, you d think they d be prepared to have a debate with   the president.I m happy to meet with them. I m happy to talk to them, but, the conversation has to be based on facts and truth, and what we re actually proposing, not some   you know, imaginary fiction in which Obama s trying to take away your guns.

 Heavily-Armed Man Claiming To Be Jesus Arrested After Plotting To Kidnap Obama’s Dog,"A North Dakota man was arrested Wednesday after having driven to Washington, DC with one goal in mind   getting himself a new dog. But the crazed ammosexual didn t want just any dog   he wanted Bo, the First Dog of the United States. Responding to a tip from the Secret Service, police tracked the would-be dog-napper down at a Hampton Inn near the Washington Convention Center.Scott D. Stockert, 49, of Dickinson, N.D., told police that he was armed, directing them to his pickup truck where he kept a 12-gauge pump shotgun and a bolt-action .22-caliber rifle. In addition, police found a billy club, a machete with a 12-inch blade, and 350 rounds of ammunition. He was arrested and charged with carrying a rifle or shotgun outside his home or business, which is illegal in the District of Columbia.After his arrest, Stockert told police that he was Jesus Christ, that he was the son of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, and expressed displeasure with the Affordable Care Act. Stockert   or Jesus, depending on whether or not you believe him   says that he was in town to a.) kidnap Bo and b.) to announce his planned run for President and a $99 per month insurance plan. You picked the wrong person to mess with,  he told agents as he was arrested.  I will f*ck your world up. On Friday at Jesus  preliminary hearing, a judge ordered him released into a high-intensity supervision program pending a court date to be set later. Stockert is not permitted to possess any weapons   real or imitation   or to go near the White House or Capitol.Court documents don t specify why he wanted to kidnap the dog, but one thing is for certain   Bo is safe for another day. As for Stockert s presidential campaign  Well, he s already had more ideas than the entire Republican field combined. Maybe he can be the man to oust Trump as the frontrunner. After all, has The Donald tried to kidnap Obama s dog? Think about it, Trump fans.Featured image via JustJared ",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Was Right About Gun Owners: Here’s What The NRA Doesn’t Want You To Know (IMAGE),"The NRA has an army of puritanical, loyalist supporters who will oppose any and all attempts at gun control. Almost anyone who owns a gun or supports the Second Amendment is a member of this legion that will rise up in fury if anyone attempts to do something as bold as study gun violence in the United States.That s the common narrative that the NRA wants people to believe. In reality, the NRA s membership is huge, somewhere between 3 million and 4.5 million people, but it is a paltry number compared to the number of gun owners in the United States. Approximately 37% of the United s States reports that either they or someone in their household owns a gun, making gun owners a minority in the United States. The exact number of people who own a gun in the United States is unclear, but that number has to be much larger than those who are a member of the NRA.When President Obama announced his plan to enact new gun control laws by using his executive powers, he claimed that gun owners would support the new gun control laws. A CNN/ORC poll reveals that he was right. The Washington Post/Wonkblog compiled the results of the poll into a chart, found below. The poll results show that a majority of people, even gun owning households and Republicans, support the new gun laws. The poll even mentioned President Obama s name during the poll, which can skew polling results, as Wonkblog pointed out. I think it is fair to say that Republicans have a tendency to have negative view of President Obama. YouGov did an experiment that showed that a mere 16 percent of Republicans supported universal healthcare when they said that President Obama supported it. When pollsters said that Donald Trump supported universal healthcare, 44% of Republicans said that they support it, too.Chart Courtesy of WaPo/WonkblogSo, if these new gun law regulations are favorably viewed by the majority and are minimal in their scope, as even the NRA admits, why couldn t they be passed through Congress? That s where the real power of the NRA starts to be seen. They just buy candidates. That s the reality of money in politics, the majority s opinion does not matter. Congressional representatives appeal to the well-funded minority, ideas of democratic rule by the majority be damned. The executive orders that President Obama plans to make law are not the actions of some despot trying to seize guns away from law abiding citizens as the NRA wants their supporters to believe. His hand is being forced to take these actions by the gun lobby who have made effective government unconscionable in the age of rule by corporate oligarchy.Featured Image Credit via The White House [Public domain], Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Daily Show Slams Trump And Cruz In Hilarious Double Take-Down (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah and The Daily Show had a field day with the feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in one of the funniest segments of 2016 thus far.Birtherism has come back to haunt the Tea Party in a big way as their favored candidate is now dealing with the fact that unlike President Obama, he really wasn t born in the United States. Donald Trump has been happy to point that out as Ted Cruz begins to gain in the polls. And this is comedy gold as far as Noah is concerned. The son of an American mother and a foreign father who graduated from Harvard Law School and dreamed of being president, even though   let s face it, people   he wasn t born in America. That s right, we re talking about Ted Cruz   the Canadian-born Texas senator. This even took Noah by surprise because he  didn t know that this shit could happen to Republicans, as well. Like I thought Republicans were the ones who do this, not the ones who get it done to them. This for me is like hearing that someone roofied Bill Cosby. Noah pointed out the way Trump worked the scandal into conversations and how he is particularly fond of using Twitter to launch attacks. But Noah did not let this be a one-sided scandal. In what could be fodder for Ted Cruz to use in a counterattack, Noah reminded the audience that Donald Trump wants to bang his daughter, which is true because he said he saw it on TV.Indeed, Noah did a segment last year chronicling all of the instances in which Trump has creepily talked about his daughter over the years. You can read all about it here.To conclude, Noah urged everyone to start using the hashtag #DonaldTrumpWantsToBangHisDaughter.Here s the video via Comedy Central.And the 2016 race just keeps getting more entertaining.Featured Image via Screenshot",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cleveland School Officer Placed On Leave After HORRIBLE Message About Tamir Rice’s Mom (IMAGES/VIDEO),"An officer at a Cleveland school has come under fire after he posted a status on Facebook that called the mother of slain Tamir Rice a  stupid b*tch  and made vile, insensitive remarks about young police brutality victims.Rice, a 12-year-old from Cleveland, was shot and killed last year by police officer Timothy Loehmann, who saw him playing with a toy gun and shot the boy dead before investigating the situation fully. Last week, Loehmann was let off the hook and cleared of the charges filed against him. Two days after this announcement, Cleveland Metropolitan School District officer Matt Cicero decided to voice his opinion on Rice s case over social media. The page is no longer available, but fortunately the screenshots are. He wrote: Tamir rices momma just want money. Lets make the proper changes raise your kids not to play with fake guns stupid bitch. All this media because the are notgetting what they want  Again pleeeeze anyone who does not like what I post ..unfriendly me or block me your not worth my time. Matt CiceroThis disturbing meme was also found on his Facebook page:Matt CiceroMany people came to the innocent victim s defense, saying that Rice hadn t deserved to die just because he was playing with a toy. Cicero couldn t be reasoned out of his ignorant mindset. He responded to his critics: You pull out a gun you get shot. I don t have time to ask questions and coddle kids that wave guns around. Matt CiceroIn the past, Cicero had patrolled the school district where Rice went to school, and it s horrifying to think that someone with this attitude would be trusted enough to protect children. Cicero has been placed on administrative leave since this incident has gotten attention, however many   including Cleveland City Councilman Jeff Johnson   think Cicero should be flat-out fired. Addressing Cicero s comments, Johnson said: It s disrespectful to women, it s disrespectful to African-Americans. The fact that he s so insensitive and he s placing the blame of Tamir s death on Tamir, for me that s enough for him to be not working with children in the Cleveland school system. Cleveland Metropolitan School District spokeswoman Roseann Canfora called Cicero s comments insensitive at best. In a statement, she wrote: While we respect every employee s right to freedom of speech, with those rights comes a responsibility to do so in ways that are appropriate and sensitive to others, particularly to the people we serve.

 The White House Has Issued An Official Response To ‘Making A Murderer’ Petition For Release,"After the release of Making a Murderer by Netflix, people have been utterly mortified by the giant spotlight that s been shown on our criminal justice system. In this particular case, the criminal justice system in Wisconsin.After Steven Avery was cleared of any wrong-doing after a conviction of rape in 1985, he attempted to file a lawsuit against those who wrongfully accused him and purposefully put him into prison. However, the tables were turned once again when instead of getting the justice he deserved, he, alongside young Brendan Dassey, were accused and convicted for their alleged involvement in the murder of Teresa Halbach. The documentary series on Netflix is horrifying to watch, because it shows how vindictive the officers and lawyers involved in the case were to make sure Avery was put back into prison.A  We the People  petition was created on the White House website to ask the Obama administration to pardon Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. The petition read:Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey should be given a full pardon by President Obama for their wrongful conviction in the connection to the murder of Teresa Halbach.Based on the evidence in the Netflix documentary series  Making a Murderer , the justice system embarrassingly failed both men, completely ruining their entire lives.There is clear evidence that the Manitowoc County sheriff s department used improper methods to convict both Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey.This is a black mark on the justice system as a whole, and should be recognized as such, while also giving these men the ability to live as normal a life as possible.And because of the clear outpouring of support in favor of this petition, an official response has been given by the White House:Thank you for signing a We the People petition on the Teresa Halbach murder case, currently featured on the  Making a Murderer  documentary series. We appreciate your interest in this case.To best respond to your petition, we should go over what exactly presidential pardoning power entails.The U.S. Constitution grants the power of clemency to the President: The President   shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States. This clemency authority empowers the President to exercise leniency towards persons who have committed federal crimes. Under the Constitution, only federal criminal convictions, such as those adjudicated in the United States District Courts, may be pardoned by the President. In addition, the President s pardon power extends to convictions adjudicated in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and military court-martial proceedings. However, the President cannot pardon a state criminal offense.Since Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey are both state prisoners, the President cannot pardon them. A pardon in this case would need to be issued at the state level by the appropriate authorities.While this case is out of the Administration s purview, President Obama is committed to restoring the sense of fairness at the heart of our justice system. That s why he has granted 184 commutations total   more than the last five presidents combined   and has issued 66 pardons over his time in office. They also exhibited how many sentences have been commuted by President Obama   far more than any president in recent history. They added:This Administration has taken a number of important actions to reduce the federal prison population in keeping with the President s continuing efforts to enhance the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system at all phases and to better address the vicious cycle of poverty, criminality and incarceration that traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities. These include:In 2014, President Obama also issued an Executive Order creating a Task Force on 21st Century Policing that produced a concrete blueprint for cities and towns seeking to put in place new strategies to build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve while enhancing public safety. (The Task Force s Final Report is available here.)And he has met with Americans across the country who are working to improve the criminal justice system, from law enforcement officials working to lower crime and incarceration rates, to former prisoners who are earning their second chance. Last summer, he became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. And he continues to work with Congress to pass meaningful criminal justice reform that makes the system more cost-effective, fairer, and smarter, while enhancing the ability of law enforcement to keep our communities safe.Thanks again for raising your voices. We hope you ll continue to participate on the platform.It s unfortunate that because Avery and Dassey are state prisoners they cannot be pardoned by the president. It s also unfortunate that they are in Wisconsin with the equally as corrupt Gov. Scott Walker who refuses to pardon the men. Walker s press secretary issued the cop-out response, stating:Those who feel they have been wrongly convicted can seek to have their convictions overturned by a higher court.It s not looking likely for justice to be served for Avery and Dassey, but one can still hold out hope that their convictions for their alleged involvement will be overturned.Featured image via Netflix",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Watch Maine Governor’s Racist Rant For Yourself, Then See If You Buy His Excuse (VIDEO)","Maine s Republican Governor Paul LePage became a statewide embarrassment yet again this week when he decided to blame the problem of drugs on black drug dealers from out of state.On the very same day state lawmakers were debating whether to file impeachment proceedings for LePage s previous offenses (and there are many), the Tea Party conservative was attending a town hall meeting where he decided to go WAY off script and float an outrageous theory about black people targeting Maine s white women. These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty  these types of guys  they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. The comments were so unbelievable that several news outlets quite literally refused to believe it had even happened  that is until Maine s public access channel aired the video.Universally loathed   LePage has the distinction of being hated by both Democrats and Republicans who know him   and already facing a strong possibility that he will be kicked out of office for a series of offenses that span everything from calling Obama a racist to verbally threatening a Democratic colleague during a legislative meeting, LePage s seasoned team of spindoctors got to work trying to frame this as anything other than what it actually is. More so than ever before, the need to lie about what happened was dire. LePage s job is on the line.His team offered up this nonsensical word salad: The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,  Steele said.  What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state. Then LePage, getting truly desperate, went ahead and implied that he was not racist, just really, really stupid. I was going impromptu and my brain didn t catch up with my mouth,  Gov. Paul LePage said. He said he meant to say  Maine  girls and not  white  girls when he made the  slip-up. It was not intended to be race,  he added.  It was intended to be Maine. Are you buying it? Don t.For one thing, the video makes it clear that saying  young white girls  was no slip of the tongue. Watch it again. He didn t stumble over his words. He didn t misspeak. When he got on the topic of drugs, he immediately jumped to the poor  white girls. If LePage is guilty of any mistake it s that he accidentally said out loud what he clearly believes but knows better than to admit to. For a guy like LePage, who has spent his time in office viciously attacking the poor and making ugly racial comments, the idea that black drug dealers would be coming to impregnate his state s white women is a racist trope that fits right in to his worldview.Even members of his own party seem to recognize that this isn t a mere  slip-up,  but represents the acknowledgment of long simmering racist views that he uses to base his conservative policies on. One Republican critic, Lance Dutson, didn t mince words:  This is one of the most blatantly racist statements he s ever made. The scariest part?

 Obama Can’t Stop Winning As New Jobs Report Shows U.S. Economy Still Kicking Ass,"Today, I would hate to be a Republican strategist. Why? Because with the election only 10 months away, I have to tell my candidate that the economy is still growing robustly and shows no signs of weakness. If anything, it still has room for explosive growth even after adding another 292,000 jobs in December:The jobless rate, which has declined since topping the 10 percent mark in October 2009, is now hovering just above what economists consider full employment   the point where further declines could start to push up inflation.The average monthly gain in jobs last year were closer to the 2013 average of 199,000 a month, but short of the 260,000 figure reached in 2014. The remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years,  said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody s Analytics.  We re getting at least 200,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis. That s quite an achievement. The only downside to this report is that there was no growth to average hourly wages. That s been the  slow  part of this slow recovery. On the plus side, once we reach the  full  employment mentioned above, wages will grow and grow rapidly. Companies will be competing for employees and the way to do that is by offering higher pay. This, by the way, is one of the reasons Corporate America has not been all that gung-ho about heating up the economy. High unemployment means low wages, the second favorite phrase next to  Golden Parachute  for CEOs.But, once wages start going up, people will have more money to spend and that increases demand. Increased demand, of course, requires more people to fill that demand and that means more jobs which means more people have money to spend and so the cycle goes. Slowing or reversing this cycle was the express purpose of the Republican s austerity mania in which they insisted pulling money out of the economy would  help  it. A crippled economy is good for Republican political ambitions.Fortunately, Obama fended off most of their bullshit cuts and instead implemented policies to avoid inflating the economy on a fragile bubble. It may have been slow but the Obama Recovery is incredibly stable (did you even know the rest of the world s economy is a mess?) and so far resistant to shocks. If we keep up this pace, Obama will be handing his (Democratic) successor a solid foundation from which to build a bridge to the future.Maybe they can find jobs for all the Republicans that will be out of work come election day?Featured image via Black Water Dog/Pete Souza",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Pissed As Hell’ Oregon Rancher FURIOUS At Bundy Militia: ‘This Is My Home!’ (VIDEO),"Georgia Marshall has had just about enough of the white privilege performance art masquerading as a patriotic revolt against the tyranny of something something EVIL GUB MINT! Ever since the Bundy terrorists seized a wildlife refuge in Harney County, the entire county has been seriously pissed off at the presumption of these idiots that they speak for the residents. Unlike the Bundy cosplayers, the residents of Harney are grown ups who have worked very hard to build a working relationship with their government: The progress we ve made in this community compared with the sh*t we went through years ago when you could not stand in talk to a manager,  she told the crowd.  Granted, it s not a lot of progress but it s coming. Marshall pointed out that an organization called the High Desert Partnership was already working  damn hard  for the residents of Harney County. We are the poster child of the ranching community, of the environmental community, of the government community!  she exclaimed.  Have we ever had anybody put together a refuge plan in this god damn nation? Hell, no, we haven t! But it happened here and it happened in Harney County. This is how grownups behave. If you don t like how the local government works, you push and you compromise and you talk and you keep pushing until things start to get better. On the other hand, when you re an entitled, self-important little shit like Ammon Bundy, you pull out your gun, holler about  freedumb!  and demand your every whim be catered to. Especially getting snacks.Here s the awesome video of Georgia taking the Bundy morons behind the woodshed for a shellacking:Now, if it seems odd that a group of anti-government jackasses would show up in Oregon and make demands for a community they don t belong to, you re not crazy. When the Bundy boys originally rolled into town, they were all about the Hammond family not serving the full sentence for their crimes. But, the Hammonds said  Holy crap! These yahoos aren t with us! Please let us serve our time in peace  and the Bundy boneheads suddenly found themselves without a cause. So, as wealthy entitled white people, they defaulted to  Waaaaahhhh! The government is oppressing us!  and demanded they be given more free stuff because in right-wing  Murika, rich white people get everything and screw everyone else.I hope Georgia and the other residents of Harney get their wish for a Bundy-free county so they can live their lives the way they want, not the way a group of wannabe martyrs and cheap knockoff revolutionaries say they should.Featured image via screencap.",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama To Critics Of His Tearful Address On Gun Violence: I Give Precisely Zero F*cks (VIDEO),"President Obama held a CNN televised Town Hall Meeting on Guns in America on Thursday night, during which he took a moment to remind those criticizing him for showing emotion that he gives precisely zero f*cks about their opinions. He is focused entirely on saving lives, and bringing the plague of gun violence under control.CNN host Anderson Cooper first replayed the President s emotional address for the audience. This is captured in the video below. Obama doesn t work up some watery eyes. He has tears literally running down his cheeks as he recounts the 26 people gunned down at Sandy Hook elementary school, 20 of them first-graders, and the devastation of the loved ones left to grieve the loss. His growing frustration at the intransigence of conservative lawmakers to give so much as an inch in the face of such catastrophic and preventable tragedies has been clear in each new post-shooting statement he has had to deliver to the nation.However, conservatives have concocted all sorts of bizarre conspiracy theories about what those tears really meant. One Fox host even went so far as to argue Obama was using a raw onion to produce the tears.So, when asked about the reaction, Obama took a moment to revisit his encounter with the parents of the children slain at Newtown. What becomes clear is that any human being with a functional level of empathy should be breaking down in tears in the face of such horror. I visited Newtown two days after what happened. So, it was still very raw. It s the only time I ve ever seen Secret Service cry, on duty.It wasn t just the parents. You had siblings, you know? 10-year-olds, 8-year-olds, 3-year-olds, who in some cases didn t even understand that their brother or sister wasn t going to be coming home.And I ve said this before. It continues to haunt me. It was one of the worst days of my Presidency. To those who argued he was crying about the wrong thing, the President had a straightforward reply: I want to emphasize that there are a lot of tragedies that happen out there as a consequence to the victims of crime, you know, there are police officers who are out there laying down their lives to protect us every single day, you know, and tears are appropriate for them, as well. And I visit with those families, as well, victims of terrorism. Soldiers coming home. You know, there s a lot of heartache out there and I don t suggest that this is the only kind of heartache we should be working on. You know, I ve spent a lot of time and a lot of hours, in fact, a lot more hours than I spend on this, trying to prevent terrorist attacks. It s a tough job, being the President of the United States. A role where decisions that are literally life and death have to be made every day of the week. America, and the world, need someone in the White House with the humanity to make those decisions with care and consideration. That s something to remember come November 2016.Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Reveals The First Thing He’d Do If America Puts Him In The White House (IMAGES),"Republican front runner Donald Trump has revealed a truly insidious  First Day in the White House.  His number 1 priority? Removing  Gun-Free Zones  from schools.To much of the world, schools being gun-free is standard. The entire developed world has achieved consensus on the simple logic that deadly weapons and children don t mix. It seems only the Republican Party of the United States and their followers reject this logic. As a result, the U.S. leads the developed world in deaths by gun per capita and school shootings, by a distance which is as horrifying as it is embarrassing.As we can see from the data compiled by Quartz, the United States suffered almost the same number of mass killings in schools between 2000 and 2010 than 36 other nations combined. This figure becomes yet more astonishing when they point out the fact that:In 2010, the US was home to a population of approximately 309 million. The populations of these other countries totaled 3.8 billion.Yet, speaking to an audience in Burlington, Vermont on Thursday night  Trump announced: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools  you have to   and on military bases on my first day. It gets signed my first day, You know what a gun-free zone is to a sicko?  he asked.  That s bait. Trump timed the announcement to coincide with the President s Town Hall meeting on gun violence, which was airing on CNN. President Obama, having been consistently thwarted in his efforts at bipartisan cooperation on gun control, will now use executive powers to implement a raft of measures to protect American citizens from out-of-control gun violence.Donald Trump and the Republican Party just failed a very big test. Given the choice to operate with political courage in the interests of the American people, or with political opportunism in the interests of themselves and their donors, Trump and the GOP picked the latter. In doing so, they put American lives in peril, and proved themselves unworthy of a place in the White House.Featured Image via Flickr",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Tells Security To Throw Bernie Sanders Supporter Out Into The Cold Without His Coats (VIDEO),"It seems Donald Trump s cruelty knows no bounds, especially after his latest campaign rally.During a rally in the middle of a very cold winter night in Vermont, Trump ordered security to throw a Bernie Sanders supporter out of the building without his coat.Several Sanders supporters gained entrance into the Burlington rally at the Flynn Center throughout the evening in order to heckle and interrupt the Republican presidential wannabe.Of course, the Sanders fans managed to annoy Trump to the point where his campaign team actually began to screen people to make sure they were Trump fans. Considering how Trump has treated protesters and hecklers during previous rallies, it was only a matter of time before he treated them heartlessly.At one point in particular, Trump directed attention toward one man and ordered security to escort him out. This normally would not be unusual since hecklers and protesters are escorted out of rallies all the time, but in this instance, Trump noted the extremely cold temperature outside and told security to throw the man out into the freezing air without his coat. I thought I heard a little voice over there. Get him outta there! Don t give him his coat. Keep his coat. Confiscate his coat. You know it s about ten degrees below zero outside. No, you can keep his coat. Tell him we ll send it to him in a couple of weeks. And Trump s supporters cheered the cruelty as the man was parted from his coat and forced to go without it during a freezing night in Vermont.Here s the video via YouTube.Trump went on to acknowledge that he expected some Sanders supporters to interrupt his rally since he was in Vermont, Sanders  home state.Sanders and Trump have engaged each other recently through media and social media, the most notable of which occurred when Sanders criticized Trump for not supporting wage increases for workers during an interview on CBS. The very next day, Trump flip-flopped on the minimum wage, posting on Twitter that it s bad that workers haven t received much of a raise in years.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Seth Meyers Dubs Oregon Militia Terrorist #Tarpman In Most Hilarious Mockery Yet (VIDEO),"The domestic terrorists who are holed up in the federal building of an Oregon wildlife refuge get more ridiculous by the day. Perhaps the most bizarre scene from this insanity yet has been a guy who is sitting in the middle of a vacant lot underneath a blue tarp with nothing but his penis extension rifle for comfort. Of course, despite the absolutely serious nature of this armed occupation, the ridiculousness of it all definitely gives plenty of material to late night comics, and comedian Seth Meyers has taken full advantage of that.On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Meyers dubbed this particular militia idiot  Tarpman,  and proceed to mock him relentlessly. Luckily, MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell was kind enough to share the hilarity with us.First, the clip showed the local sheriff trying to be sensible and get these yahoos to leave. Then, it panned to  Tarpman  hiding with his gun. After that, we see Seth Meyers relentlessly mocking this insanity. He even called  Tarpman  a  guess in a game of militia Clue. Watch the clip below, via MSNBC:Well, it seems that this particular terrorist, Levoy Finicum, has gotten his fifteen minutes of fame, and they re not about to be over.Congratulations, Mr. Finicum. You are currently on short list of extremely stupid people, even by the standards of anti-government terrorists.Featured image via video screen capture from MSNBC",News,"January 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" So, About That ‘Stand Down’ Order In Benghazi From Hillary– IT NEVER HAPPENED (VIDEO)","That dreadful night in Benghazi, Libya in September of 2012 when the lives of four Americans were lost will be one that we shall never forget. We shall never forget it for two reasons: because of the tragedy that occurred and the loss of life, and because Republicans and Fox News insist that there was some sort of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in her reaction to events that took place.Clarifying one of the longest held myths by Fox News and conservatives, Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta spoke to MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell. Not only did he debunk the myth of a  stand down  order so many on the right like to claim was said in an effort to prove Hillary as uncaring and incompetent, but he also explained how everything that could have been done, was done.Mitchell first asks Panetta about some existing circulating theories about that dreadful night in Benghazi:Now you re here in Washington because you re going to be testifying to the Benghazi Select Committee tomorrow. You have already testified to other committees, but to this committee, and there s a new movie coming out, 13 Hours, and it s about to be released. It is accusing the CIA operatives on the ground of being ordered to stand down and not go to the rescue in time. And the suggestion is that, if not for that order to stand down, that Chris Stevens and the others might have been saved. First of all, you were at the Pentagon at the time, I believe. Was there any order to stand down that you know of?Panetta responds:Absolutely not. You know, I m sure there are going to be movies and books and there will be all kinds of theories that will be presented, but from my experience, and from the role that I played as secretary of defense, there was never any order to stand down. On the contrary, the whole effort was to do everything possible to try to save lives.Delving further into if there were any sort of Hillary Clinton misstep, Mitchell asks if there were any sort of  stand down  order:There s also a report, several reports, that the Pentagon made an offer of a rescue effort, military effort to the State Department, and that someone, the suggestion is Hillary Clinton, said,  no thanks, we don t need the help or stand down or stand back.  Was there any effort by the Pentagon to intervene that the State Department rejected and would she have even been in the role?Panetta offers an answer that many right-wingers are not going to like whatsoever, the truth:I m not aware of any such effort at all. As a matter of fact, after meeting with the president, I immediately went back and we made decisions to deploy forces, to put them in place to be able to go in and provide help to those involved, and we in fact put forces in place. The problem was that [the] attack ended quickly and because of time and distance we never had a chance to get there. This is a tragic event. It s tragic in a number of ways. But most importantly, it s tragic because it s now become a political football that unfortunately, I think, doesn t do service to all of those that were committed to trying to protect lives.Panetta is exactly right. This tragedy has become even more tragic by how it has been wrongfully perpetuated by conservatives to try to score political points against Hillary Clinton. We need to learn from what happened in Benghazi and make sure it never happens again. We also need to, once and for all, put the myth to bed that Hillary was incompetent. She, of all people, is quite aware of the loss that happened that day. She s also one of the best qualified to make sure it never happens again.

 Numbskull Ben Carson Just Managed To P*ss Off Every Decent Parent In America,"Ben Carson may be the dumbest person ever to perform brain surgery. He has proven time and time again that he has no clue on matters of simple science issue,s and has demonstrated a lack of critical thinking skills that have landed in the  pants on fire  category of fact checkers on numerous occasions.His stories about growing up some street-wary tough guy who liked to beat and stab people turned out to be fabrications. His tales of being held at gunpoint couldn t be verified by anyone. The only thing Carson has ever said that seems even remotely true is that he often felt like the  dumb kid  in class. He likes to follow it up with how he persevered and became a brain surgeon.Whatever it was that pushed Ben Carson through medical school and into a fellowship at one of the world s most prestigious hospitals was definitely not his ability to think on the fly. Left unscripted and with a microphone, Carson is his own worst enemy. That was never more obvious than it was at a recent campaign stop to talk to 5th-graders in Des Moines at the Isaac Newton Christian school.Apparently Carson was again trying to build on that old favorite  dumb kid  card when he turned into by far the dumbest person in the room. Without considering that he was dealing with 10-year-olds, Carson actually asked the class to point to the worst student among them. A Des Moines Register reporter tweeted that at least half a dozen kids in the class singled out one student:W/ crowd of 500 @RealBenCarson just called out to 5th grade class: who's dumbest kid in class? At least half dozen kids point to 1 student.  Timothy Meinch (@timeinch) January 7, 2016If you re a parent and that didn t absolutely infuriate you, you should have your idiot filter cleaned. In what universe is it OK to EVER degrade a child to make a political statement? The student said he wasn t upset by being singled out, which may make Carson feel better, but certainly not the kid s parents.Carson s numbers have been dwindling and it appears his campaign is nearing the end. Hopefully he drops his aspirations to de-throne George W Bush as the least qualified buffoon ever to occupy the Oval Office sooner than later before he causes any more damage.Featured image by Gage Skidmore",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Family Values’ Republicans Introduce A Bill That Would Make Sex With Lobbyists A ‘Gift’,"You have to love the Republican party. They call themselves the party of  family values.  They hold themselves to a  higher moral standard.  They think they are spiritually superior because they statistically go to church more often than Democrats. All of those things, however, are underscored by the one thing that defines Republicans more than anything else: Hypocrisy.The GOP-controlled Missouri state legislature is considering a bill from Rep Bart Korman that would require the  gift  of sex with a lobbyist to be disclosed, but not with a monetary value. Take your time and read it again; your eyes aren t deceiving you. The actual wording of the bill states: the term  gift  shall include sexual relations between a registered lobbyist and a member of the general assembly or his or her staff. Relations between married persons or between persons who entered into a relationship prior to the registration of the lobbyist, the election of the member to the general assembly, or the employment of the staff person shall not be reportable under this subdivision. The reporting of sexual relations for purposes of this subdivision shall not require a dollar valuation. So .yeah. If you re married to a lobbyist or are in an actual relationship with a lobbyist you re good, but if you re boinking one for political gain you have to report it without attaching a dollar value. That little stipulation would presumably keep parties involved from being charged with solicitation.There is some speculation that the bill has its origins in a political quagmire of corruption that Korman himself is at the center of. According to our friends at Freak Out Nation:What we have here is a classic kindergarten game of  if I can t have it, neither can you  that dates back to a kerfuffle related to a fancypants dinner  meeting  held in January 2015.  The House Telecommunications Committee, which is led by none other than Rep. Korman, held a  meeting  at the Jefferson City Country Club, where the men dined on fancy steaks and other high priced entrees.  Oh, and this dinner was fully paid for by a lobbying group that the Committee oversees.The press got wind of it and the public was so incensed that Speaker John Diehl ordered all future meetings be held at the Capital. Rep. Korman tried to justify the Committee s actions by saying that meeting at the club for dinner was the only time the group could congregate.So here we are, one year later, and Rep. Korman proposes this quite bizarre Bill that requires sex be listed as a  gift.  What does that mean, though? Is he insinuating that lobbyists are engaging in sexual activity with lawmakers on a regular basis? Is this directed specifically at Speaker Diehl or another member of the House? So many questions and no answers yet.Political shenanigans need to be called out on this one for sure, but alas Missouri is Missouri. Republicans in red states seldom feel the need to explain themselves. Should the public become concerned with issues they don t want to deal with they can simply introduce a bill limiting abortion, taking food stamps from children or removing any and all gun restrictions on the books.Shiny object politics at its finest.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Obama Goes BEAST MODE On CNN Anchor For Pushing Gun Grab Conspiracy (VIDEO),"President Obama got real and raw with CNN s Anderson Cooper during a televised town hall meeting on gun violence..@POTUS addresses the ""conspiracy"" that ""we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns"" https://t.co/AFzFmmsvGC https://t.co/p611SWIrgk  CNN (@CNN) January 8, 2016Obama was speaking about the right-wing conspiracy that he is in favor of mass confiscation of guns when Cooper interrupted him and asked,  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy? A lot of people believe this deeply. That stopped the President in his tracks, and he angrily turned to the anchor. I m sorry Cooper, yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy. What are you saying? Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody s guns away so that we can impose martial law is not a conspiracy? Yes, that is a conspiracy. I would hope that you would agree with that. For years President Obama has had to keep his emotion in check, knowing that flashes of anger and outbursts would instantly give his political opponents fodder for tired, old lines of attack about the  angry black man. But Cooper s indulgence of the right wing myth of gun confiscation came at the wrong time in Obama s presidency. He has a year left in office, with no more elections left to fight without the need to soothe the egos of those spinning wild yarns without any connection to reality.While Anderson Cooper isn t a right-winger like the figures littering the airwaves on Fox News, his invocation of a  both sides  talking point was almost as bad. Obama s actual actions and proposals on guns bear no resemblance to the right s ongoing characterization of them as a  gun grab,  and even less so the idea that Obama supports  gun confiscation. The people promoting that idea   the NRA, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and other figures on the right are simply pushing a conspiracy theory on par with the idea that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job or that the government is covering up alien abductions. It is patently absurd for Cooper to give credence to this wild-eyed assertions, and Obama understandably was put off by Cooper giving it credibility on-air.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Paul Ryan Attacks President Obama For Being ‘Distracted’ By Murdered Children,"On Monday, President Obama announced that he was expanding background checks to close the  gun show loophole  and ordering federal authorities to more aggressively enforce the current gun laws. Republicans, predictably, went insane and started screaming  tyranny  and  unconstitutional.  In the world of the GOP gun nut the president   or any lawmaker for that matter   should not ever, EVER try to make this country a safer place because .FREEDOM!One day after announcing his executive action on gun laws, President Obama held a press conference to explain why he felt it was important that he take action. The president was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and when Obama spoke of the twenty children who died that day he broke down and cried in front of the nation. Callous Republicans immediately accused him of  faking  his tears for political gain   new Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was one of those people.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spoke to Yahoo News s Katie Couric, on Thursday, where he was asked if he was moved by the president s tears on Tuesday. The Republican responded: I was affected by it, but I thought we should ve had the same kind of reaction when James Foley was beheaded, when San Bernardino and Paris occurred. That s the kind of reaction I had when those occurred. Really? He can t understand why the news of twenty FIRST-GRADERS being murdered in their classrooms was a little bit more emotional? These children, six-and-seven years old, were itty bitty and each of their bodies had between three and eleven bullets in them; they were literally riddled with bullets. All of the mass shootings we have experienced over the last decade and a half have been horrifying, but this one was especially hard because the majority of the victims were so small. But Paul Ryan can t understand why this particular one makes the president cry. Okay.Ryan wasn t done yet, he went on to say that the president was using gun control as a  distraction : What I think he s trying to do is distract from basically his failed policies I think the president should put as much effort into going after homegrown jihadists and going after terrorist infiltration of our refugee network and going after defeating ISIS as he is in trying to frustrate the law-abiding citizens  Second Amendment rights. This scumbag actually believes that trying to prevent more gun massacres is the president trying to distract from  real  problems. As if keeping our kids alive isn t a big deal. He thinks our time would be better spent going after the mythical ISIS fighters who are hiding among refugees or  homegrown jihadists ? Why? Because going after  law-abiding  citizens like Dylann Roof, Adam Lanza and the hundreds of other white American terrorists we have in this country is tyranny. Seems legit.Ryan opened his mouth and proved to us, once again, why it is so damn important that we get off of our sofas and vote next November. If we sit at home, we are just giving the Gun Nuts of America  license to kill more of our kids and loved ones. We are one of the most powerful countries in the world and we can t even send our children to school and know that they will come back to us. The United States has become a war zone and the weapons of choice are as easy to buy as toilet paper. How scary is that?

 Maine’s Tea Party Governor Just Went On A Racist Rant So Offensive It Could Get Him Impeached,"Worst governor in the United States Paul LePage (R-Of Course) has said and done some truly reprehensible things during his time in office, but the latest bit of toxic sludge spewed from his mouth might finally be his downfall.On Wednesday night, during a town hall meeting, Maine s governor went so deeply racist that even members of his own party acknowledged it was  one of the most offensive statements  ever to come out of LePage s mouth   and that s saying something.While discussing Maine s drug problem, LePage floated the idea that it was out of state black people who were getting (white) Mainers hooked on heroin. It got worse from there. These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty   these types of guys   they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home,  LePage told a large crowd.  Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty In a shameless attempt to spin it as not overtly racist, LePage s long-suffering communication director, Peter Steele, said that this wasn t about race. He then gave the following word salad defense. The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,  Steele said.  What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state. There are, might I say, just a few questions left unanswered here. Why did he use names like  D-Money  to refer to the  types of guys  who come into the state from Connecticut and New York? Doesn t that sound a lot like the kind of  gangsta  name a white conservative from Maine might come up with if they were brainstorming the backstory of a black drug dealer? Why did he specifically mention  young, white girls  when describing the kind of girls D-Money  likes to  impregnate?  Does he have any proof that  half the time  out of state drug dealers of any race impregnate Maine s young women?But the biggest question is Does he really think the entire state of Maine is too stupid to notice this for what it is? An ugly racist rant that is meant to stoke old racial fears of black men stealing white women?Democrats have long complained about LePage, but even Republicans are finding it increasingly hard to ignore his egregious behavior. Some have even created a website called  Get Right Maine,  which is an attempt to get LePage booted out of office and give the Republican Party a chance to save their image from the damage LePage has done.For LePage, his racist rant couldn t come at a more vulnerable time politically. Just days before he decided to introduce his imaginary black stereotype D-Money to voters, Maine s state lawmakers were discussing whether they should kick LePage from office or just censure him.House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said LePage created this situation with his own actions. We join other Mainers around the state and share their anger and frustration,  said McCabe.  Democrats are focused on the most pressing issues before us. We are committed to addressing the drug crisis, growing access to broadband as well as helping our struggling mills.   The governor has isolated himself and we are not playing his games. He just handed his haters   which is, roughly, just about everyone he works with   a ton of ammunition. Ever his own worst enemy, LePage countered by throwing a massive tantrum, accusing his own party of conspiring against him and vowed to never work with Democrats again.The sooner LePage gets booted from office, the better.Feature image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Dem Presidential Candidate Asks: What If Right-Wing Domestic Terrorists Were Black, Muslim?","Democratic presidential Martin O Malley just got real about the response to the right-wing domestic terrorists who are occupying federal land in Oregon.Speaking to an Iowa radio station, O Malley, the former governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore, was blunt about the ongoing situation. This is not the way we act as Americans and I dare say that the federal government s exercising a lot of restraint here,  said O Malley.  It s hard to fathom or it s hard to imagine if the people taking over buildings by armed force were Muslim or black, as some commentators have said, it would be the same reaction. So hopefully this will get resolved peacefully. They are not militia, they re acting in criminal ways, this is criminal behavior. Since the militia members   led by the son of rogue rancher Cliven Bundy   illegally took over the federal facility, the mainstream media has fumbled over what precisely to call the men. First they were called  peaceful protesters, and  then they were called  armed protesters  in dispatches from ABC News and the Associated Press.Even after one of the men, who are white, made a public statement that he would be willing to die while occupying the government land, the bulk of the mainstream media has been unwilling to apply the label of  terrorism  to their activities.The kid gloves treatment being afforded to the gang   recently federal law enforcement said they could come and go as they please   has led people to compare the treatment to situations like 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Rice, who was black, had the police called on him while he played with a toy gun. Instead of being  talked down  and negotiated with, he was shot and killed in the street and led by the prosecutor a grand jury declined to indict the police officer who did the deed.In addition to the disparity in treatment, Republican presidential candidates have condemned the specific gun-wielding tactics of the occupiers while also heaping praise on the  principles  behind their gripes, which are complaints about the federal government collecting money for the use of land owned by the government.These men and other militia affiliated groups have tried to argue that the government cannot own the land in question, and that they should be allowed to raise profit-making livestock on it without paying anyone.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Warnings Issued After NRA Fans Plan To Open Carry Guns Near President Obama,"Once again pro-gun forces in America are trying to intimidate anyone trying to reduce gun violence   even the President himself.Ahead of President Obama s town hall about his executive action to reduce gun violence, warnings were issued about the likelihood of gun fans parading around outside the event brandishing their weapons.President Obama s town hall event on gun violence at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. on Thursday night is likely to provoke strong emotions. And the school s police chief is warning students and faculty that protesters could be carrying weapons on campus   legally. Please be advised that it is lawful to carry firearms in Virginia, and this includes at public outdoor spaces on our campus,  Thomas Longo, GMU s interim chief of police said in an email to the school s internal listserv. Though students are on winter break, the chief wrote that the University Police  will have officers present to ensure that all protesters remain law-abiding. Over the last few years the so-called  open carry  movement has paraded around with weapons in public as a way for gun extremists to show off to everyone how supposedly macho they are.In some cases, these protesters have taken their weapons into restaurants, supermarkets, and major chain stores like Target. Understandably, most parents don t want to have guns swinging around while they re trying to buy their weekly groceries and some stores have begun to ban the open carry crowd.The NRA   who chickened out when CNN invited them to this town hall   has pushed the president as the gun confiscator-in-chief, when in reality at best Obama has pushed for expanded background checks and limits on gun magazines. Now those who have been teed off by this organization   who pays its executives handsomely from their annual dues   have been driven to brandish guns outside an event under heavy secret service protection.It isn t smart, it s dangerous, and at best it will continue to make the pro-gun side of the debate come across as unhinged extremists.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Donald Trump Claims Paris Is In Germany, But We Assure You It Is Not","If you ve attended a basic geography class, you probably know that France and Germany are separate countries. You probably also know that Paris is the capital of France. But if you re Donald Trump, the man with the  world s greatest memory, you might be a bit confused on that point. See, not only can Trump remember thousands of Muslims cheering 9/11 in New Jersey (a feat even major news networks can not accomplish), but he knows that Paris is in Germany. Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level,  Trump tweeted Thursday.  Germany is a total mess-big crime.  Ironically, he ended the tweet with  GET SMART! Now, since Trump said it, it s likely that conservatives will believe it until they see with their own eyes that it isn t true   so we re going to do a public service and help them out.Now, it might seem scary with all the pictures and colors, but it shows the entire world. No, stop trying to eat it. Don t make me get the water bottle!OK, now that that s sorted out, this map has a thing on it called  words.  Words are those funny little combinations of letters people who don t grunt to communicate throw together to let people know what they want to say. Now, if you look at a place called Europe, you ll notice that France and Germany are right next to one another.Yes, Donald, France and Germany are right next to one another. In fact, one of them (France, where Paris is located) recently played host to a terrorist attack that Republicans often use to justify their horrific calls to round Muslims up into camps and prevent them from entering the United States (sound familiar, Donald?).

 Local Citizens To Bundy Terrorists: ‘Get The H*ll Out!’ (VIDEO),"Harney County resident Jarvis Kennedy has a message for the out-of-state terrorists who have taken over Oregon s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.  Get the hell out of here. Mr. Kennedy, who is a Burns Paiute Tribal Councilman, spoke at a meeting of the council on Wednesday, saying the armed militants occupying the wildlife refuge are unwelcome and unwanted. His comments were met with a round of thundering applause from those in attendance. We as Harney County citizens don t need some clown to come in here and stand up for us,  Kennedy said.  They just need to get the hell out of here. Councilman Kennedy began his remarks by comparing the government s treatment of  Natives  to those of the terrorist organization occupying Malheur. I got a question for the world,  he said.  What if it was a bunch of Natives that went out there and overtook that   or any federal land? What would the outcome be? Think about that. What would happen? Would they let us come into town and get supplies and re-up? For those unfamiliar with the history, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was settled by the Paiute and other Native American tribes some 11,000 years before it was declared a  sanctuary  for native bird species by president Theodore Roosevelt, in 1908.Mr. Kennedy s ancestors were removed from the land by the federal government.The hypocrisy of those who support the YallQaeda terrorists knows no bounds. These are people who deny that the federal government has  authority  to remove people from their land. Clearly, if that is the case, the land belongs to the local tribes that had lived there for thousands of years before the federal government removed them, not ignorant militiamen from Nevada, Florida, Arizona or any other state of the non-Oregon variety. We don t need them to back us up,  Councilman Kennedy told the crowd.  We didn t ask them here. We don t want them here. Mr. Kennedy made it clear that, in spite of right wing propaganda to the contrary, the armed men occupying the wildlife refuge are terrorists. They say they don t want to bother the community,  he said angrily.  But you know what? Our little kids are sitting at home right now, when they should be at school. They re jeopardizing and they re scaring everyone. Watch Councilman Kennedy s speech published by KGW in Portland via YouTube: Local tribal members are not the only Harney County residents enraged over the out-of-state terrorist occupation of Malheur.A long list of organizations have denounced the Bundy terrorists, including groups that represent Harney County farmers and ranchers, such as the Oregon Cattleman s Association and the Rural Organizing Project.The group Oregon Wild sternly denounced the Bundy s and their supporters as domestic terrorists, holding a community hostage for their own political gain. The dictionary definition of the word terrorism is  the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.  This word should not be used lightly, but it is exactly what the extremist group currently occupying Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is attempting to do,  said Oregon Wild Executive Director Sean Stevens.Even the Hammonds, the two men these terrorists are supposed to be defending, have made it clear that they do not agree with or support the actions of the men who are terrorizing Harney County.As Portland, Oregon s KGW reports here, Groups representing businesses, wildlife and residents in Harney County have released statements about the protest. None supported the armed occupation at the wildlife refuge. The men holed up in Malheur National Wildlife Refuge have deluded themselves into believing that they are heroes, fighting for people  not strong enough  to fight for themselves.Harney county residents make it clear that these armed lunatics are living in a fantasy world. They neither want or need  help  from the delusional nut jobs that have descended on their community. The citizens see these men for exactly what they are, domestic terrorists attempting to exploit the Hammonds conviction for poaching and arson, in order to further their own political agenda.As Harney County Sheriff David Ward points out here, the Bundys and their followers are not there to  help  anyone but themselves and their anti-government agenda. These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to over throw the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States.

 Mike Huckabee Throws Evangelicals Under A Speeding Bus For Not Supporting His Campaign (AUDIO),"Mike Huckabee is fed up with evangelical  Christians  and threw a temper tantrum because they won t support his run for president.The Republican presidential wannabe aired his grievances with conservative  Christians  during an interview with Fox host Todd Starnes, throwing them under the bus in the process.Huckabee s poll numbers stand at a meager 1.3 percent, which makes him particularly angry at evangelicals as they flock to Ted Cruz. This, of course, sent the former preacher into a jealous rage as he accused evangelicals of caring more about getting rich off social issues than changing the law. A lot of them, quite frankly, I think they re scared to death that if a guy like me got elected, I would actually do what I said I would do, and that is I would focus on the personhood of every individual, we would abolish abortion based on the Fifth and 14th Amendment, we would ignore the Supreme Court s same-sex marriage decision. As we all know, Huckabee has repeatedly said he intends to ignore the Supreme Court and abolish a woman s right to choose and same-sex marriage should he become president. But he says evangelicals are not really into doing either of those things because it would bring their money-making operation to an end. A lot of these organizations wouldn t have the ability to do urgent fundraising because if we slay the dragon, what dragon do they continue to fight? And so, for many of them, it could be a real detriment to their organization s abilities to gin up their supporters and raise the contributions, and I know that sounds cynical but, Todd, it is what it is. Huckabee then accused conservative  Christians  of running on  secular standards  instead of on biblical principles and told Starnes that these organizations should come out and admit to donors that they really don t believe in biblical principles, they just want to dupe Christians into making them rich. Look, we re a club, we re an organization,  Huckabee suggested they say.  We talk about prayer, but we don t necessarily believe that it will change things. There comes a time in our lives where we either believe in a great God who does great things and uses sometimes the weak to get it done, or else we don t believe in that and we just get human might and we gather all the human resources and we live or die by the human sword. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.This little hissy fit by Huckabee is incredibly revealing. Not only did Huckabee decimate any chance he had of getting their support, he basically blew the whistle on how these conservative  Christian  organizations operate and what they actually believe. Huckabee just came out and blasted these organizations of fleecing donors for money by pretending to believe in God and prayer and not really caring about enacting a social conservative agenda because they wouldn t be able to make any more money once it goes into effect.This might actually be the first time Huckabee has been truthful throughout his entire political career, and you can bet that conservatives are going to blow a gasket over it.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Trump Fans Attack Peaceful Protesters Holding ‘America’s Already Great’ Sign (VIDEO),"Two completely peaceful protesters were attacked and forcefully escorted from a Donald Trump rally on Monday after loyal supporters realized their signs were pro-Obama and anti-Trump.The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts was packed, and the footage captured shows two men wearing glasses sitting amongst the supporters. The men aren t doing anything to attract attention to themselves other than holding bright yellow signs, one that reads  America is already great  and another that says  God bless President Obama.  Eventually, Trump s fans find out that they re on the opposite side of the voting spectrum.Upon this discovery, a few of Trump s loyal and aggressive minions attempt to start a verbal altercation with the protesters. One man behind the protesters is seen telling them,  Shut your mouth!  while a man in front of them motions to the signs and says, You re at a Trump rally? Ditch those! Ditch  em! When that didn t have the desired effect, the Trump lovers took it a step further. The supporters grabbed the signs out of the non-confrontational protesters  hands and ripped them to pieces as many other nearby supporters began to scream and chant Trump s name. It wasn t long before security surrounded the two men and escorted them out of the rally. Trump can be heard talking over the noise and saying  Friend or foe, I don t know  as he notices the commotion.You can watch a video of the incident below, which was posted by YouTube user Harrison Walsh:Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Campaign Chairman Goes Rogue, Is Caught Joining YallQaeda","It appears that the Bundy militia has finally managed to radicalize a highly impressionable American into joining their cause   and it just so happens to be one of Donald Trump s campaign officials.In a shining example of the kind of people who gravitate towards the Republican front-runners campaign, Jerry DeLemus, an anti-government fanatic, dropped what he was doing as the co-chairman of  Veterans for Trump  in New Hampshire to join up with the Bundy family members in Oregon to attempt to kickstart a revolution to overthrow the federal government.According to his Facebook, DeLemus (who is married to a New Hampshire Republican state congresswoman) arrived in Burns, Oregon along with a  videographer  to wage a  psyops war  on the mainstream media that are spreading  lies  about the Bundy brothers. screengrab via Raw StoryDeLemus is no stranger to walking right up to the line of insurrection. He has been adamant that the government is ruled by tyranny and may need to be overthrown. The Bundy brothers are just the kind of fanatics that he would latch on to. As the Daily Beast recently reported, DeLemus spent much of 2013 trying to raise an right-wing army in Rochester. He s begging for a fight. I believe that we have another financial collapse coming soon and it will be worse than the one in 2008,  Delemus warned.  There are stark differences we must realize that we have nearly a 0% interest rate and our debt is nearly double. Not to mention our credit rating has been dropped. On top of this we have a government that has no respect or regard for the rule of law as provided in our Constitution.If we do not stand against this insanity we can be sure we will fully slip into tyranny. We are in a similar position our Founding Fathers found themselves in and their decision to stand was equally difficult. During the 2014 standoff at Bundy Ranch in Nevada, he was right there with the other  patriots,  marching with guns and facing off against the federal government.Apparently, nobody let him know that Trump was not on the same page. Trump may be a racist, xenophobic narcissist, but he s not  let s overthrow the government  crazy. At the same time DeLemus was grabbing his camping gear and buying a plane ticket to Oregon, Trump was disavowing the militia. Trump, like many of his Republican challengers, felt the militia was too extreme, even for conservatives.When asked his feelings on the group, he called them lawless.  You have to maintain law and order, no matter what. It s a bit awkward that one of his staffers is now joining their ranks.So why would a guy like DeLemus support  law and order  Trump? That s easy. They share an affinity for hating Muslims.Inspired by the bigotry in Texas, DeLemus recently tried to organize a  Draw Muhammad  rally in New Hampshire in the hopes of inciting violence between right-wing bigots and Muslim residents. The event fell apart and DeLemus claimed he  won  against Muslims anyway by  spreading awareness. If DeLemus s rush to join an anti-government militia illegally occupying a wildlife refuge shows us anything, it s that Trump s base is teeming with right-wing extremists held together by little more than hatred. It s hard to imagine a single other candidate losing a campaign staffer to an insurrection and maintaining his or her massive lead in the polls, but Trump doesn t rely on anything but his own big mouth to keep himself in the lead.Feature image via YouTube",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ted Cruz Reveals Paranoid Fantasy Involving Obama, A Chisel, And Arlington Cemetery (TWEETS)","Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz stunned audiences on the campaign trail this week with a piece of paranoid fantasy that would make Alex Jones blush. On Wednesday, Cruz reportedly told crowds:Cruz: ""We're just steps away from the chisels at Arlington coming out to remove crosses and stars of David from tombstones.""  daveweigel (@daveweigel) January 6, 2016For most rational human beings, this statement would occur as a flight of fear-mongering fancy so far beyond the bounds of reality that it was laughable. But, he is appealing to Republican voters after all   a majority of whom believe the Earth was created 5000 years ago, by an omnipotent God.But even for a GOP candidate, this is out there. So, what on earth prompted this moment of insanity?Context of that Cruz nightmare of crosses being chiseled off soldiers' tombstones: It could happen if 5 liberals dominate SCOTUS  daveweigel (@daveweigel) January 6, 2016Seriously, that s it. Apparently Senator Cruz believes that the only thing restraining Obama from sneaking into Arlington with a chisel and removing religious symbols from the gravestones, is the presence of conservatives on the Supreme Court of the United States.Could it be that the GOP hopeful s rant had less to do with Arlington, and more to do with the fact that the birther conspiracy has blown up in his face?Cruz, born in Canada to a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban father, is now facing the Birther conspiracy that he so enjoyed inflicting upon President Obama. The three requirements to be President of the United States are:The definition of  Natural Born Citizen  is still unsettled in U.S. law, meaning that Cruz is far more open to genuine challenge by the Birther movement than Hawaii native Barack Obama.This sounds like the desperate rant of a candidate in trouble. As Driftglass points out expertly:Ted Cruz knows the rotting, raving heart of the GOP perfectly well. From his dentist s drill voice to the transparently concocted, treacly fascism of his style, he has spent his adult life meticulously constructing a public persona to fit the madness of his party hand-in-glove.And he is not going to let some interloping radioactive Chia-publican sweep in and steal his brownshirt chumps.Awkward.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cher Does NOT Hold Back On Twitter As She Calls For Death Of Michigan Governor (TWEETS),"When it comes to the safety of our drinking water that comes out of our taps, we are left to trust those who are elected to keep us safe and work in our best interests. However, what s been happening in Flint, Michigan over the past few years is criminal. Flint s city manager was held accountable to Gov. Rick Snyder (R) alone. They, alongside other officials denied that there was lead contamination in the Flint s water.As Rachel Maddow reported: For more than 18 months, state and local government officials ignored irrefutable evidence that the water pumped from the Flint River exposed [residents] to extreme toxicity,  the complaint reads.  The deliberately false denials about the safety of the Flint River water was as deadly as it was arrogant. Calling officials  conduct  so egregious and so outrageous that it shocks the conscience,  the complaint cites the specific experiences of a few plaintiffs and their families, all of whom allege they have been challenged by similar health ailments since high levels of lead and copper entered their bloodstreams.These conditions include skin lesions, hair loss, chemical-induced hypertension, vision loss and depression. Of the four families described in the complaint, two had ceased to drink Flint water after a certain point   and used it only for washing and cooking   but still said they were exposed to many of the same ill effects. Finally admitting to the toxicity in Flint, Snyder declared a state of emergency and apologized, but for many it is too late. The U.S. Justice Department has now opened an investigation into how things could have gone so devastatingly wrong for so long. This is following an EPA investigation that began last November.Needless to say, people are utterly outraged, and justifiably so.Taking to Twitter, legendary artist Cher called Snyder out by name and asked that he be jailed. Then going a step further, called for the death penalty. She said: Gov. of Michigan is a murderer. HE made the decision to give people poison water, and now must sign disaster bill. Children will  never  recover. #jailforRick WTF is going on with power. Mad, greed driven, killer. Incompetent politicians? They are criminals! Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan. #firingsquadworksforme GOV.Of MICHIGAN IS A MURDERER?HE Made Decision 2GAVE ppl POISON WATER,&NOW MUST SIGN DISASTER BILL.CHILDREN WILL""NEVER""RECOVER? #JAILFORRICK  Cher (@cher) January 6, 2016WTF IS GOING ON W/POWER MAD,GREED DRIVEN,KILLER, INCOMPETENT,POLITICIANS?THEY R CRIMNALS  GOV.RICK SNYDER OF MICH. #FIRINGSQUADWORKSFORME  Cher (@cher) January 6, 2016And while asking for a firing squad could seem a bit over the line, the passion behind her tweets is palpable. People are upset, and have every right to be outraged. Citizens were poisoned. CHILDREN were poisoned, and people need to be held accountable. It will be interesting to see if Snyder himself will resign and face trial. This criminal behavior needs to be accounted for.Featured image: YouTube/Flickr/Twitter",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Daily Show Puts Vile Fox Host In Her Place For Accusing President Obama Of Faking Tears (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah has been criticized for not taking on Fox News as much as Jon Stewart used to do, but on Wednesday, the new Daily Show host proved he can be just as tough on them.On Tuesday, President Obama delivered a speech announcing new executive actions to combat the epidemic of gun violence in this country. As he referenced the 20 children murdered at Sandy Hook, Obama could no longer hold in his emotions and began to shed tears. Clearly, the deaths of these children and all the children who have been killed by guns affects him deeply.But the heartless hosts of Fox News quickly accused President Obama of faking crying. Andrea Tantaros of Outnumbered stirred much outrage after suggesting that Obama kept an onion in the podium. I would check that podium for like a raw onion or some No More Tears,  Tantaros said in agreement with her colleagues.  It s not really believable. And the award goes to  we are in awards season. Trevor Noah, on the other hand, had a completely different reaction. He praised President Obama and declared that it is about time that something was finally done to combat gun violence. Noah even appreciated President Obama s raw emotion. See that thing you re feeling right now, that pain in your chest that comes from watching someone weep on national television, because he knows that society can do better than to file the shooting of children under  shit happens?  That feeling is how you know that you re human. No matter how opposed to Obama s policies people may be or how cynical their politics they have to at least acknowledge and respect the raw authenticity of that emotion. Or so you would think. After playing a clip of Tantaros accusing Obama of crying fake tears, Noah expressed his disgust and lamented that she shares the title of human being with everyone else. Are you fucking kidding me?! Shedding tears when you think of murdered children is not really believable? You know what? There is something here that is not really believable, the fact that the rest of us have to share the title of human being with you. Here s the video via Comedy Central.The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video ArchiveAndrea Tantaros is a vile sorry excuse for a human being for accusing President Obama of pretending to cry over children whose lives were cut unfairly short by guns.

" Native American Tribal Leader Shuts Down Oregon’s Cry-Baby White Militia, And It’s Glorious (IMAGE/VIDEO)","It has been almost a week since over 20 armed gunmen occupied a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, demanding the land be returned to its  rightful owners . The Chair of the areas Native American tribe had something to say about that, and it s a mic drop.When chair of Burns Paiute tribe heard protestors would return land to its rightful owners, she joked she started writing acceptance letter  Salvador Hernandez (@SalHernandez) January 6, 2016One of the armed gunmen, Ryan Payne, spoke to the New York Times on Tuesday, claiming that: the federal government unconstitutionally laid claim to land within the United States,  and people who use and love the land   ranchers, miners, and loggers, among others   deserve to have it back.The 5.2 million Native American and Alaska Native s identified by the 2010 U.S. Census might be a little more familiar with this problem that the ammosexual occupiers of the Oregon reserve.An interactive map put together by the science and humanities magazine Aeon shows details the land grab of 1776 to 1887, during which the United States seized over 1.5 billion acres from America s indigenous people by treaty and executive order.The short video below shows the near total transfer of land from Native American tribes to the United States over that time frame.  On Wednesday of this week, the Burns Paiute Tribe, who s reservation is close to the armed occupation, called on the militia-men to leave. The Chairwoman of the Burns Paiute Tribe, Charlotte Rodrique, told Reuters that the occupation was  desecrating one of our sacred sites, I don t give much credence to their cause, she continued. We never gave up our aboriginal rights to the territory, so we as a tribe actually view this as our land, no matter who is living on it,  she said.  We were here first and just want to set the facts straight. Her dignified message somewhat underscores the wanton belligerence of the Bundy militia, who the FBI confirm will face federal charges when their standoff comes to an end.

 Marco Rubio Panders To Israel By Insulting President Obama In New Campaign Ad (VIDEO),"Ladies and gentleman, the pandering for lobby money is officially on the airwaves. In a new ad, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio says that President Barack Obama spies on Israel.

Why would Marco Rubio spend millions of dollars on an ad to mention a foreign country thousands of miles away?[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMMwWXWCCn8]The answer lies in the money Rubio stands to receive from pro-Israel lobby groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an organization that can make or break a political campaign with its enormous organization and wealth.

 NRA ‘Good Guy With a Gun’ Angry About Obama’s Executive Orders Shoots Up Apartment Building (VIDEO),"Gun enthusiasts across the country have been expressing their rage over President Obama s common sense attempts to close the  gun show loophole  and make America safer by keeping firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them   like those who would start shooting up a building because they are displeased with the idea of keeping children safe from violent criminals.Ever since Obama announced his planned executive action on guns, conservatives have been preparing for  war on the President s policies. We ve been hearing from the right that President Obama is making a gun grab   that he s coming to round-up law-abiding gun owners and something, something Dark Side. And, of course, as we saw with Robert Dear and the extreme anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric, one brave ammosexual decided to do what he viewed as his duty and offer up an armed opposition to Obama s policies.At around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, police in Redding, California responded to a report of shots fired at an apartment building. According to a statement from the Shasta County Sheriff s Department, what law enforcement found was sort of expected. A white man in his 50s had fired 6-8 shots into neighboring apartments because he was mad at Obama for attempting to reform gun laws. If that s not bad enough, he also had a letter from the NRA taped to his window. Once police arrived, he began shooting at them: Officers made verbal contact with the subject, described as a white adult male in his 50 s via a patrol car PA system. The suspect would open the door to the apartment briefly and yell at the officers.  Witnesses on scene later advised detectives that the suspect was upset about the recent legislation regarding gun laws issued by President Obama. The suspect was not compliant with officers who directed the suspect to exit his apartment with his hands up. During this time, officers attempted to subdue the suspect by utilizing less lethal bean bag rounds which had no effect on the suspect s compliance.  An attempt to utilize a police K-9 to subdue the suspect was also unsuccessful. After further commands by officers for the suspect to surrender, the suspect exited the apartment holding a handgun in his right hand, leveling it at officers who were tactically positioned outside his apartment, in the parking lot near parked vehicles and nearby trees,  the release notes.  Nine officers engaged the suspect with handguns and rifles subsequently striking the suspect multiple times.  The suspect was declared deceased on scene. We heard the five shots   everyone was screaming,  resident David Rice recalled.  He came out screaming  Obama! Obama! Obama!  (Police) told him to come out with (his) hands up, and he kept telling them  No, no, no. One woman recounted being briefly taken hostage by the anti-Obama shooter, who grabbed her and pulled her into his apartment: As soon as he shut the door, he hugged me and he kissed me on the forehead. He was aiming at a guy, and then he just got sloppy   he was shooting everywhere. The shooter, whose name has not been released, had a documented history of mental issues and was a felon, but was somehow able to get a gun   in other words, he was exactly the sort of person the President s plan aims to keep from being weapons.Fortunately, no one was hurt (aside from the shooter) this time.Watch a video of the shooter below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));EXCLUSIVE: Cell phone video captures exactly what happened at a deadly officer involved shooting Tuesday night in Posted by Madison Wade on Wednesday, January 6, 2016You can also view a report on the shooting here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0-aOi2nkHk?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘This Is A Nightmare’: AL City’s Black Residents Live In Fear Under ‘Confederate Commander’ Police Chief,"The black residents of Dothan, Alabama are, quite literally, living in fear   and with good reason. Their police chief, Steven Parrish, is an open member of a neo- Confederate organization by the name of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Even worse is the fact that officials in Dothan are fully behind Parrish keeping his job as police chief, despite his ties to a clearly racist organization.During a Tuesday government meeting, Dothan Mayor Schmitz allowed just one person in support of Parrish and one against him to speak. Paul Carroll, one of Dothan s black residents, said to the meeting: This would never happen to the Jewish community. You would never see someone who s a neo-Nazi being made chief of police, but somehow we as the black community are supposed to accept that we have a neo-Confederate? Carroll also said to local paper the Dothan Eagle: We are supposed to accept that we are supposed to put our trust and our faith in someone who has those connections? I don t (feel safe). Sometimes when you have had a life of white privilege it is very difficult for you to understand what it is like to be a minority. And Carroll has good reason to feel that way, as Parrish openly says he is a Sons of Confederate Veterans  Commander.  So, it s not good enough to just be a regular member of a seriously racist organization, but he has to be a commander. It is also believed (but not proven) that Parrish was in cohoots with narcotics cops who deliberately planted drugs on black men in the area during his time on the force.Another of the city s black residents, Ruth Nelson, says of Parrish s reign as chief: This is a nightmare. And when we look at the real underlying problems that are causing this..they need to be addressed and they need to be addressed with equality and with truth. Resident Kevin Saffold alluded to the idea that the city of Dothan would soon be in an uproar if the Parrish situation weren t handled to their satisfaction: If you don t want this to be another Ferguson, if you don t want civil unrest, if you don t want people taking matters in their own hands and not being cooperative, then you should do something about that. I believe in the court system and I believe in justice   I don t see no reason why the board should not at least demote him to some other field. All of these residents are right, and they have every right to be outraged and afraid. After all, there will be no justice for minorities as long as the police department is headed up by this racist POS.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jeb Bush Blames Bad Parenting For Black Crime: Says His Own Kids’ Crimes ‘Not His Fault’ (VIDEO),"Earlier this year, Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush was asked a question regarding domestic protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, which were tied to predatory policing of African-Americans that led to murder-by-cop.Via Think Progress:During a Q & A with employees of the pharmaceutical company Nephron, his response to a question about teachers  unions veered into his thoughts on the origins of the mass protests in Ferguson and Baltimore. Kids in this country are aimlessly wandering around in their lives because they ve never been told they were capable of learning,  Bush said.  They ve never been challenged to achieve far better. They ve never really had the kind of mentoring and nurturing that gives them the sense their lives could be better. You see what happens in Baltimore and Ferguson. You see the tragedies play out. You see people becoming so despondent they take actions that are horrific. Jeb is   with a slightly softer wording than some   using the same old white privilege-ridden Republican response to criminal issues that are a part of the African-American community   blame the parents.Fast forward 7 months later:During an interview with CBS Miami, the topic of Jeb s daughter Noelle came up. Jeb was asked by the interviewer about his daughter s criminal past and multiple issues with drugs. The interviewer specifically asked if Jeb felt that during his time away from home campaigning and during his tenure as Governor,  if he didn t have enough time for his family   and if that made him feel personally responsible for his daughter s problems.Listen to Jeb s incredibly hypocritical response in the video below via CBS Miami:  I can t blame myself. That s not gonna solve any problems, and you just can t do that. Jeb can t blame himself for choosing not to be around for his family when his daughter was engaging in criminal drug activity. However, as you saw above, if you are black and live in a city that means it s YOUR family s fault if you engage in any immoral or illegal activity.Here is some history on Jeb s daughter. In 2002, Noelle was arrested when she tried to forge a Xanax prescription in Tallahassee. A judge sentenced her to rehab. In July 2002, she was jailed for three days for violating her probation by breaking the rules of her rehab program. In October 2002, Noelle was jailed again for 10 more days when she was found in possession of crack cocaine while in the rehab center. In 2003, she finally completed the program and has had a cushy job at one of daddy s companies ever since.These are 3 crimes that were drug related in less than one year. She spent less thantwo weeks in jail total for all of it.It s relevant to know that during Jeb s first year as Florida governor he signed a law increasing mandatory minimums for drug offenses and for minors, including a 3-year minimum for as little as 4 grams of heroin. He also blocked the implementation of  treatment instead of jail  for nonviolent drug offenses. Bush also opposed a ballot measure that would have allowed 10,000 drug offenders to leave jail and enroll in treatment programs. Somehow Jeb s daughter avoided this mandatory minimum sentencing minefield.One final bit of annoyance Jeb s son George P. Bush was also arrested for breaking and entering his ex-girlfriend s home while drunk when he was 18 years old. He walked when charges were not pressed.What an elitist Republican jerk   Jeb Bush really showed his capacity for hypocrisy and contempt for other people by excusing himself for his families problems, while laying ALL the problems African-American people encounter in life squarely on their parents  shoulders.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Stolen Valor: Men In Oregon ‘Militia’ Caught Red-Handed Falsely Posing As Marine Veterans,"Two of the men involved in the armed standoff in Oregon have been caught falsely claiming to have served in the Marines. An investigation shows the two have committed stolen valor. One of the men, Brian Cavalier, is the personal bodyguard to Ammon Bundy and has told reporters that he served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Here s the problem: the US Marine Corps has no record of his service. That s because he was never enlisted. The other man, Blaine Cooper, also claimed to be a Marine, but he was only in the  Delayed Entry Program.  He dropped out before actually going to boot camp.A more in-depth look reveals that Cavalier is just a tattoo artist, and not only that, but the only record he has is a rap sheet full of DUI s and theft   nothing even affiliated with the military. That s what police records show, anyhow. It appears he faked his military credentials so he would be more credible to serve in the Oregon gang and get more street cred.Here was the encounter Brian Cavalier had with reporters, who hilariously goes by the nickname  Raging Unicorn: I m a retired United States Marine, I can rage. He also tried to sound ex-military when one journalist asked to access the refuge building, stating boldly: No, that s logistical security issues that we can t have happen, head count can t be divulged for security purposes. When he was later confronted about his false claims, and that the US Marine Corps had confirmed that he was in fact never a Marine, he reportedly got very nervous, saying: That s unfortunate that someone would say that. I m not commenting on anything. I told you what it is. Pic via Latest.No service member who served would ever cower away like that. But, his reply wasn t needed. These guys are fakes   the evidence already proves that. While claiming to have served in the military isn t technically against the law, it s not respectful to the men and women who actually did risk their lives for their country. The 2013 Stolen Valor Act only makes it unlawful if someone falsely claims to have received an award or commendation to receive some form of compensation. Neither of these men violated that.With that said   we have a feeling stolen valor isn t going to be as much of an issue when the FBI presses federal charges against them when this is all over and done with. That much is guaranteed.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Most Conservative States Depend Far More On Federal Aid – This Proves It (IMAGE),"A new analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group devoted to educating taxpayers, shows that some of the most conservative states in the nation are the most dependent on the federal government. Really? How can this be, you say? Republicans hate the federal government, right? While some conservative states certainly do, the reddest states (most particularly the Bible Belt in the south) actually rely on Uncle Sam far more than the most liberal states in the nation. It s pretty hilarious, actually.Looking at the data, you ll see that five of the ten most conservative states in the country are considered to be in the top 10 (out of 50) that are most reliant on the federal government. The numbers are calculated as a share of government revenue coming from the Fed, as opposed to self-reliant sources within their own state. Each state is given a percentage (located on the map below). This can include Medicaid payments, education funding, infrastructure financing, grants, etc.Pic via GallopGo ahead and take a look. You will see that Mississippi is #1 in both categories; it s the most conservative and the neediest. That s just one example. We have a feeling that each state would turn blue real quick if Republicans got their way on most of their economic policies directed towards the poor. This proves that some of the most conservative states in the country would barely be able to get by without the federal government.Pic via Washington PostSee where California ranks? Not only is it the most populous (by far), but it s considered to be one of the top six most liberal states, you know, the sort that passes all kinds of progressive reforms conservatives claim to hate. Well, guess what? It s one of the LEAST dependent on Uncle Sam. That s right   the state s liberal politicians do a better job generating revenue by itself   i.e. creating jobs, making sure education is a priority, all those liberal ideas that actually make a difference in people s lives   without needing as much help.It s information like this that is sure to blow the mind of any Republican reading it   that is if they re open minded enough to digest objective facts. But, we know better than this. Conservatives don t care about facts. They just know they hate welfare   anyone else receiving welfare; just not the monies they personally get.Featured image via Wikipedia.",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Fox News Just Sided With President Obama On Gun Control- What Now, NRA? (VIDEO)","Hell just froze over, because Fox News is now on President Obama s side when it comes to his new gun safety executive order.Bill O Reilly said, during a segment on The O Reilly Factor, that the NRA and gun owners need to accept that background checks for buying guns are reasonable.I know how unbelievable that sounds, but here it is in a video:Could we possibly have hit a point where the Republican establishment has finally had it with the monster they created in 2008? Has the NRA and its head idiot, Wayne LaPierre, finally become caricatures of themselves that are too embarrassing even for people like Bill O Reilly and Fox News?Here is something that I never, ever thought I would say in my life: I agree with Bill O Reilly, especially on the part about being paranoid. However, there is one part where Bill just had to veer back into the realm of stupidity so he could throw his audience a bone   likely to prevent them from throwing a beer can through their TV screen at home. Bill openly addressed President Obama while saying a firearm registry will not solve America s gun problem.The sudden burst of common sense from Bill couldn t last forever. It is a well documented, checked fact that President Obama does not want to create a gun registry. This was proven when the last universal background check bill completely outlawed the creation of one.Obama s openly accused the NRA of lying about this, from a Rose Garden press conference: They claimed that it would create some sort of  big brother  gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn t matter. The latest Quinnipiac poll, from December 23, 2015, shows background checks have an absolutely MASSIVE amount of support across the board.Photo: QuinnipiacIt has had this kind of support since after the Sandy Hook massacre, give or take a relatively negligible variance in points, so to act like all of a sudden it is  reasonable  is strange at best.Regardless of the details, the simple fact that Fox News   and Bill O Reilly in particular   are siding with President Obama on gun control is nothing short of a noteworthy event in American history. The internal Republican fallout will be amazing to watch.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John McCain Goes Full-On Birther — Tries To Get Ted Cruz Disqualified From Race,"It s no secret that Senator John McCain hates Ted Cruz. Although he has tried to hide it by repeatedly calling the Republican presidential candidate a  friend,  it s hard to look past the time he called him a  wacko bird. He has also been very vocal about his disdain for Cruz s government shutdown tactics and in 2015 he said that he basically disagrees with the candidate s entire platform. With all of this in mind, it was really no surprise when McCain added his opinion to the Ted Cruz citizenship controversy.By now, you have probably all heard about Donald Trump questioning whether or not Ted Cruz was qualified to be president because he was born in Canada. The Constitution says that only a  natural-born  citizen can sit behind the desk in the Oval Office, and the GOP front-runner implied that he didn t know if Cruz was a legal candidate.During an interview on Wednesday on Phoenix radio station 550 KFYI s Chris Merill Show, John McCain said  he didn t know  if Ted Cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in Canada: I know that came up in my race because I was born in Panama, but I was born in the Canal Zone which is a territory. Barry Goldwater was born in Arizona when it was territory when he ran in 1964. .Asked if the Supreme Court might have to weigh in on the  natural born citizen  issue, McCain said,  It may be, that may be the case. It is likely that John McCain doesn t really question whether or not Cruz is eligible to be president; instead it seems as though he was trolling the senator a little bit. But if he does actually question his right to run, he may be trying to get the party to disqualify the Tea Party maniac.Although McCain has made some pretty stupid political decisions in the past (cough..Sarah Palin cough), he is basically a moderate Republican and not as loony as the Teabillies who have hijacked his party. That means he knows that even though the Constitution does not specifically define  natural born citizen,  the consensus is that if a person is born to American parents, even in a foreign country, they are  natural born. What s really funny about this whole non-scandal is that we are seeing the Republican Party target their own candidate in the same way many attacked President Obama   and he was actually born in the United States.Oh the irony Featured image via Salon",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Huge Progressive Group Demands Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Immediately Resign As DNC Chair,"Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been under a tremendous amount of fire lately for what some Democrats perceive as a vendetta against Senator Bernie Sanders. Liberals have accused the DNC chair of  fixing  the primary in Hillary Clinton s favor and there have been many calls for her to step aside. Now, a large progressive group is adding their voice to the fray after comments the chairwoman made in the New York Times Magazine about Roe v. Wade.CREDO Mobile, a phone company that uses their profits to fund liberal causes and has a network of more than 3.6 million people, started a petition calling for Wasserman-Schultz s resignation. The petition was prompted by an interview that was published Wednesday morning in which the chairwoman said there is  a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided. The comments garnered immediate backlash as women took to Twitter and lashed out at her using the hashtag #DearDebbie. She later clarified her remarks, saying: For many in my generation who lived the majority of our lives with the right to make our own health care choices, there wasn t a sense of urgency after Roe v. Wade settled our right to a safe and legal abortion. Since then, opponents worked aggressively to chip away at women s reproductive freedom and they have awakened a sleeping giant in the millennials leading the fight in defense of the progress we ve made. CREDO fired back at Wasserman-Schultz with the petition demanding she step down, claiming:Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz just accused young women of  complacency  in the fight for abortion rights.Young women, especially low income women and women of color, have been bearing the brunt of the right-wing s relentless assault on abortion rights and have been leading the charge to fight back. Wasserman Schultz s comment shows how out of touch she is with the progressive core values of the Democratic activist base, and is just the latest in a string of unacceptable actions that makes it clear it is time for her to resign as chair of the DNC.The group also accused her of rigging the primary to  suppress Democratic turnout,  putting her personal interests before the party, trying to sabotage the president s Iran deal, and siding  with anti-progressive special interests. Whether you agree with CREDO or not, the debacle on Wednesday and the others in the months leading up to it, show that there is a rift forming in the party that is not good for us. With the primaries right around the corner and the general election just months away, we need to unite for the good of our party. The infighting is unhealthy and the more divided we become, the better the chances are that we could see a Republican in the White House. Do you really want a President Donald Trump or President Ted Cruz?It is time to put our differences aside and focus on beating the GOP in November; we can handle everything else afterward.Featured image via Florida Politics",News,"January 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The White House Had WAY Too Much Fun Trolling Birthers Over Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"For seven years there s been several folks, let s call them birthers, who have questioned the validity of President Obama s United States citizenship. These people refuse to believe that the president was born in Hawaii, and refuse to believe that even if he wasn t (he was), that he was born to an American citizen, his mother. When it comes down to it, it s not that they question the validity of Obama so much as they question the validity of having a black president. After all, he doesn t look like any other former president, so he must not be from here, right? Wrong.Now, if birthers really wanted to go after someone vying for the Oval Office, they, quite literally, could go after Senator Ted Cruz. You see, Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen. However, just like Obama he was born to an American citizen, so he is, in fact, a natural-born citizen as the Constitution stipulates, but if you re going to go after anyone for being foreign-born, Cruz makes a much better target.Lately on the campaign trail, Captain Birther himself, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, has brought up the legitimacy of Ted Cruz s ability to run for president. He s even gone so far as to want Cruz to  go before a judge  to make a ruling on his citizenship.Getting a good giggle from all of this was none other than White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who, when asked about Cruz and this line of questioning regarding citizenship, answered: It would be quite ironic if after seven or eight years of drama around the President s birth certificate, if Republican primary voters were to choose Senator Cruz as their nominee. Somebody who actually wasn t born in the United States and only 18 months ago renounced his Canadian citizenship. Which is very true. If these Republican birthers, who were so angry at the make-believe possibility that Obama was not born in the nation actually vote for a man who, in all legitimacy, wasn t born in the country, it would not only be ironic, it would be hypocritical, and prove the entire birther movement is steeped in racism.It s impressive that Earnest was able to hold himself together as much as he did after that question was asked.

 Brokeback Bundy: Hilarious Hashtag Mocks What The Militia Is Getting Up To In The Woods,"The Bundy brothers and their militia continue to play patriots at an Oregon wildlife reserve, but the rest of the world hasn t joined in their revolution. In fact, people are getting really good at mocking them.As the FBI announced that it would be cutting off power to the building and supplies have already begun to run low (who knew you needed more than a few boxes of Ramen noodles to sustain you on an months-long occupation of a federal building?), things are looking pretty desperate for the anti-government fanatics hold up within. It s an open question of how long they will stubbornly insist on staying out in the cold to prove how macho they are.Other than a few baffling interviews, and one hilarious blue tarp, the Bundy s have been mostly quiet. The rest of the world is left to wonder what they are getting up to in there on these cold nights.Needless to say, Twitter began speculating  and the right-wing militia isn t going to like what they came up with.Under the hashtag #bundyeroticfanfic, people from around the country are describing   sometimes in lurid detail   the romantic encounters the Bundy s and their companions may be having while trying to keep warm. The results are oftentimes laugh out loud funny.He wanted snacks, but what he needed was for Cletus' calloused hands to explore every inch of his body #bundyeroticfanfic  L30 L005 (@LeoLoos13) January 6, 2016""Jason pressed Jed against a rack of ""Birds of Oregon"" books; his breath was sweet with jerky.

In interview after interview, Cliven Bundy s son, Ammon, spoke breathlessly about how noble and important the occupation of this wildlife refuge was for  freedom.  The reality was anything but awe-inspiring. Ammon has made repeated calls for others to join him and bring supplies, but few have heeded his call. The relentless mocking paired with the group s own embarrassing moments in front of the camera have made even sympathetic right-wing anti-government nut jobs like Sean Hannity recoil.When you ve lost Hannity, you ve lost your right-wing revolution.Ironically, it turns out that all the guns they brought along with them while they were dreaming of a showdown with the government didn t stand a chance against the relentless mockery they have received from the internet. Their cause was doomed to fail, but it s hard to imagine they anticipated it failing because people couldn t stop laughing at them.

 Micheal Moore Demands MI Republican Gov. Be Arrested For Poisoning Flint’s Water (IMAGE),"Michael Moore has joined others in calling for U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate Michigan s Republican Governor Rick Snyder for not preventing lead from contaminating the city of Flint s water system. Moore was born and raised in Flint, MI. His first documentary film, Roger & Me, chronicles the downfall of Flint and explains how its demise was orchestrated by big business and conservative policy.Moore posted a photo of himself on social media that shows him holding a pair of handcuffs. In his other hand, Moore is holding up a sign which reads, #ArrestGovSnyder. Activists have been using the hash tag to call attention to Flint s water crisis, and Snyder s culpability in the matter.https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/photos/a.10150288227701857.331023.24674986856/10153223367636857/?type=3&theaterAccompanying the photo, is a letter written by Moore condemning Snyder over the crisis. Moore Writes: Dear Governor Snyder:Thanks to you, sir, and the premeditated actions of your administrators, you have effectively poisoned, not just some, but apparently ALL of the children in my hometown of Flint, Michigan.And for that, you have to go to jail.To poison all the children in an historic American city is no small feat. Even international terrorist organizations haven t figured out yet how to do something on a magnitude like this.By taking away the city s clean drinking water in order to  cut costs,  and then switching the city s water supply to Flint River water, you have allowed massively unsafe levels of pollutants and lead into the water that travels in to everyone s home. Every Flint resident is trapped by this environmental nightmare which you, Governor, have created. Moore argues that Snyder is a criminal, and should be arrested for switching the city s water source to the Flint River, which caused the contamination. Moore argues: Like any real criminal, when you were confronted with the truth (by the EPA and other leading water experts across America), you denied what you did. Even worse, you decided to mock your accusers and their findings. As I said, I know you don t like to believe in a lot of science (after all, you used to run Gateway Computers, and that, really, is all anyone needs to know about you), but this time the science has caught up with you   and this time, I hope, it s going to convict you. Other celebrities have been quick to fire off on Snyder after the hashtag surfaced.

 FBI: Bundy and His Band Of Domestic Terrorists Will Face Federal Charges When Their Tantrum Ends,"Federal authorities have no intention of killing the Bundy brothers and their traitorous followers. They d rather arrest them and put them behind bars.Thus far, the federal government has been incredibly tolerant of the armed white rednecks currently occupying a federal wildlife refuge building in Oregon.The militants would like to engage federal law enforcement in a firefight to the death, but seeing as how authorities are planning to cut electricity to the building and the fact that the men had to beg for supplies because they failed to prepare for the long haul, it won t be long before the cold winter and hunger force them to surrender.The FBI and Sheriff s office are counting the felonies and misdemeanors each member of the group has committed since the beginning of their stunt, and according to Harney County Sheriff David Ward, the FBI intends to arrest them and make them pay the consequences for their actions. The bureau has assured me that those at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge will at some point face charges,  Ward told Oregon Public Broadcasting on Tuesday. He then warned the militant that things will only get worse for them the longer they refuse to surrender.  They have an opportunity right now to work towards a better solution, and not face further charges,  he said.Indeed, right now the group faces charges of sedition and treason against the United States. In addition, they also face charges for breaking and entering, carrying guns on federal property, and trespassing, just to name a few.If found guilty of a felony, they would also be departed from the ones they love the most their guns.So while the federal government isn t going in with guns blazing, they are taking steps to end the pathetic little rebellion and are waiting to place each domestic terrorist in shiny metal bracelets.To help speed up the process, Sheriff Ward also pleaded for people to stop sending supplies to the militants. I think if one person gives them a Snickers bar, they re going on national media and claiming that the community supports them. If you re giving them support, you re just prolonging the situation. Here s the audio via Oregon Public Broadcasting.It s been a rough week for Bundy and his buddies. Not only have they been roundly condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike, they can t even catch a break from Fox News and have been mercilessly mocked across the country, becoming a national punchline.For now, all we can do is wait for Bundy and crew tuck their tails between their legs and surrender to see if the FBI keeps their word that they will face charges for their crimes. Until then, let the mockery continue.Featured Image: Wise Geek",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Incredibly Powerful Statement From A Teen Survivor Of A School Shooting Can’t Be Missed,"When we think of school shootings, we often think of those directly involved   the dead, the wounded, the people who saw the gunman s face. Desiree Palmer was not in the room at Marysville-Pilchuk High School in Washington, when freshman Jaylen Fryberg stormed into the school cafeteria and shot five other students, killing four, before fatally shooting himself. But she, along with an entire community, felt the impact.Desiree s story was brought to my attention by none other than Montel Williams. Williams, a proud, gun-owning conservative, recently said that he watched President Obama outline his plan to ease the suffering in this country by taking executive action on firearms   not, of course, by stripping ownership from law-abiding citizens as the NRA and its acolytes fear, but through a series of common-sense reforms.While some cling to the idea that any reform is a sign that Obama is coming for their guns, Williams takes a more reasonable stance, as he explained via Facebook: I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams told his inevitable detractors.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. Truly responsible gun owners, Williams says, support common-sense reforms.The talk show legend told Addicting Info that Palmer s story helped him form his opinions, that reading her words sherpad him to the conclusion that something has to be done:We agree that Palmer s words need to be read by all. Though she was not in the cafeteria she felt the loss, lived through the terror, and still struggles to cope with the terror of that day. While it might be easy to assume that the suffering begins and ends with the victims and their families, when violence occurs it hurts everyone around.In it, you will see the strength of a young woman who knows a fear many (or most) do not  the fear that someone she knows, a loved one, a friend might pick up a gun. That friends will die far too young. That life will never be normal again.I think it is safe to say that I have always been a pretty fearful person. I am afraid of failure, displeasing people, not doing the right thing; but I have never been afraid of the actual world, until now. October 24th will be a day I always remember because it has challenged almost everything that I believe in. I wasn t in the cafeteria and I wasn t close to the ones we lost. Yet still, I am not okay. And I hate the response I have been getting by admitting that. People say,  well, you weren t even in there so why do you still let it bother you?  I seriously asked myself that question for the longest time until I realized that I am allowed to feel how I feel. I feel weird, abnormal, dysfunctional, incapable, unsocial, exhausted, broken, and weak. But I also feel nothing at all.I go to school and watch everyone pretend like things are normal.I go to school and pretend things are normal.And I am so sick of it.It has been 90 days since the shooting and it seems like things are almost worse than ever Behind closed doors, that is. I think all of us realize it, but think we are too crazy to actually believe that MAYBE it is acceptable for us to still be in pain. Teachers avoid the subject because it s uncomfortable and parents avoid it because they don t know what to say. Everyone avoids it because they think they are alone.I am asking this for myself and my peers at Marysville-Pilchuck: please, someone, say something.Say something besides  It s time to get back to work! We have tests in May! Say something besides  We have to move on  or  You ll get through it .We need to hear,  It s okay to not be okay right now , because a lot of us don t think it is.It is so frustrating to be in an environment that settles for the worst just because one horrible thing has happened. The most common thing I see in my community is the mindset that horrible things are going to happen and we just have to let them. Some days I am too tired to deal with the emotions, but most days, I m just pissed off. We all need to heal, but letting fear hinder our ability to create the good things again is not helping. We have had enough taken away from us.I have a dream at least once a week that involves me being the target of a shooting at my school. Often times, one of my peers is the one holding the gun I think that is what scares me the most. This time, it wasn t some  bad guy  or stranger, it was a friend to many and a family member. I can t help but think that my dreams represent my newly-born fear of trusting other people.I guess you just never really know these days.I have been trying to write this post for about 2   months. Every few weeks, I go back and read what I had said the last time I wrote. Each time, I try to finish it, but never do. When I started, it was November 22nd. I explained what I went through on that day from beginning to end. The second entry, was right before Christmas and at that point, I was just sad. It s scary to watch myself explain how I have reached acceptance of reality, and then a few short weeks later, describe how I am absolutely falling apart. I have never been so confused in my entire life.To be honest, I still don t really know what I am trying to accomplish by writing this. Maybe someone will read it and know they aren t the only one who feels like they re just going through the motions every day. My hope isn t that you understand me, it s that I start to.Today I am angry and fearful.Angry that the world is the way it is, and fearful of the same thing.Desiree PalmerMarysville-Pilchuck High School studentIt s easy to get lost in the debate over whether or not it is worth it to enact gun legislation. After all, we often hear that  criminals don t care about gun laws    or, from more callous individuals, that  your dead kids don t trump my Constitutional rights. Lives lost in school shootings are not the  price of freedom  as we often hear. They are future doctors, lawyers, musicians, artists, police, and more. They are our future, which we see stripped away with every bullet fired as a result of our lack of action. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  the President said of his planned reforms.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  Obama said   and he s right. If expanded background checks and other reasonable reforms can stop a single act of violence or save a single life, then they are worth it.

" Bristol Palin Being Sued For Custody And Child Support, Probably Wishes She Had Practiced Abstinence Now","Bristol Palin brought this upon herself. After all, she could have just practiced what she preached. Now, it s her turn to take responsibility.But she didn t, and now the daughter of America s village idiot has a second out-of-wedlock baby by a second dude, who now wants Bristol to pay him child support as well as give him joint physical custody of the little girl named Sailor Grace.Palin has already been embroiled in battles with her other baby daddy Levi Johnston over their 7-year-old son Tripp. And now she gets to battle Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer.According to legal documents obtained by Radar Online: The parties have reached a final custody and visitation agreement for residing in the same community and have executed, personally and through their attorneys, a confidential stipulation regarding custody. Therefore, the only pending issue to be addressed by the Court is the matter of past and future child support. And Bristol Palin isn t the struggling single mom she pretends to be. She has a lot of money to make child support payments.After getting knocked up and giving birth the first time around, Palin became a paid spokesperson for for an abstinence-only campaign, making $262,000 in 2009 alone. And then she got a $100,000 payday by selling her story to In Touch Weekly. And Palin owned a $400,000 modern lakefront home in Alaska, pictures of which you can see here.Combine all of that with the millions of dollars her mom has suckered from conservatives across the country via donations and book sales and it becomes quite clear that Bristol can afford to pay child support.One would think Bristol would learn her lesson by now. But apparently she s quite comfortable being paid to preach abstinence while having sex and babies with any guy she meets. The hypocrisy is stunning and makes it hard to feel sorry for her.For years now, she has criticized women and girls for being irresponsible when it comes to sex and birth control. Now it s time for her to take responsibility for her own actions, which means she should have to pay child support in a timely manner so that her child can have at least one parent who has some discipline and isn t a spoiled brat who whines all the time.Featured Image: Inquistr",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 All Talk NRA Refuses Chance To Debate Obama Over Gun Control On Live TV,"Apparently the only thing the National Rifle Association and the White House can agree on is that President Obama would smoke them in a debate on gun control.CNN extended an invitation to the NRA, the nation s most powerful gun lobby, to join Obama during a live town hall on Thursday evening in Virginia to discuss the issue of gun violence. They gracelessly declined.NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam seemed willing to assume the NRA would come out of the debate looking very badly. He claimed the White House would rig the event and turn it into a  public relations spectacle. In other words, the NRA believes it would lose and Arulanandam is desperate to think of a good excuse as to why that is.Undermining this excuse, however, is the fact that it is CNN, not Obama, that is organizing the event.A CNN spokesperson said that it was the network, not the White House, that proposed the idea of a town hall on guns, and noted the audience would be evenly divided between organizations that support the Second Amendment including NRA members as well as groups that back gun regulation.The only ones too afraid to show up to this mixed crowd are NRA representatives.And while it s laughable that the NRA already threw in the towel before the debate even began, they are justified in being worried about what they would face if they were brave enough to show up. As Obama proved numerous times during his two presidential elections, he s a formidable debate opponent. It is also clear that the issue of gun control is an area that Obama is fired up about. For years, Republicans in Washington and their pro-gun benefactors have stymied any and all attempts to address mass shootings. Entering his last year in office, Obama is done playing games. Earlier this week, he gave an emotional and powerful speech about the need for better gun control   and what he plans to do about it. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  Obama said.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  he added.The NRA seems content to fight against any conceivable campaign to stop needless gun violence. This includes floating reckless lies that Obama is a tyrant seizing people s guns. On social media, the lobbying group regularly promotes misinformation to its gullible followers.

 College Moves to Fire Christian Professor For Saying Christians And Muslims Worship Same God (VIDEO),"Professor Larycia Alaine Hawkins upset administrators at Wheaton College when she donned a headscarf last month to show solidarity with the Muslim community in the wake of anti-Islamic sentiment across the country. Wheaton College, which touts itself as a Christian school, also had a problem with Hawkins when she said that Muslims and Christians worship the same God, quoting Pope Francis.  In a statement, Wheaton College initiated a termination-for-cause proceeding against Professor Larycia Hawkins on Tuesday, saying Hawkins wouldn t participate in  clarifying conversations  about theological issues.Here is the Facebook post that Wheaton found problematic://  I don t love my Muslim neighbor because s/he is American. I love my Muslim neighbor because s/he deserves love by virtue of her/his human dignity. I stand in human solidarity with my Muslim neighbor because we are formed of the same primordial clay, descendants of the same cradle of humankind a cave in Sterkfontein, South Africa that I had the privilege to descend into to plumb the depths of our common humanity in 2014. I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God. But as I tell my students, theoretical solidarity is not solidarity at all. Thus, beginning tonight, my solidarity has become embodied solidarity. As part of my Advent Worship, I will wear the hijab to work at Wheaton College, to play in Chi-town, in the airport and on the airplane to my home state that initiated one of the first anti-Sharia laws (read: unconstitutional and Islamophobic), and at church. I invite all women into the narrative that is embodied, hijab-wearing solidarity with our Muslim sisters for whatever reason. A large scale movement of Women in Solidarity with Hijabs is my Christmas  # wish  this year. Perhaps you are a Muslim who does not wear the veil normally. Perhaps you are an atheist or agnostic who finds religion silly or inexplicable. Perhaps you are a Catholic or Protestant Christian like me. Perhaps you already cover your head as part of your religious worship, but not a hijab. I would like to add that I have sought the advice and blessing of one of the preeminent Muslim organizations in the United States, the Council on American Islamic Relations,  # CAIR , where I have a friend and Board colleague on staff. I asked whether a non-Muslim wearing the hijab was haram (forbidden), patronizing, or otherwise offensive to Muslims. I was assured by my friends at CAIR-Chicago that they welcomed the gesture. So please do not fear joining this embodied narrative of actual as opposed to theoretical unity; human solidarity as opposed to mere nationalistic, sentiment. The statement above sends a message of love and tolerance and it s the college that exudes intolerance and Islamophobia by firing this courageous woman. Professors also have the right to academic freedom. One can only imagine the consequences of muzzling professors because they speak about important social issues. One of the most cherished aspects of the American way is the right to freedom of speech. Wheaton College has violated that right by moving to terminate the professor. A petition signed by tens of thousands has been circulating to reinstate the professor.Here is what Illinois Committee A on Academic Freedom had to say about Wheaton s actions: There can be no doubt that Wheaton s attempt to fire a professor for expressing support for Muslims is an attack on academic freedom. But what few have realized is that this bigotry also an attack on the Christian values of loving thy neighbor that Wheaton pretends to embrace. The administration at Wheaton is not just betraying the values of freedom that every true college must stand for, they are also betraying the values of Wheaton College itself. Here is Professor Hawkins  graceful response on the move to terminate her: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SRRq3SdcBo] Show your support for Professor Hawkins by signing and sharing this petition.Featured image: screegrab",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre Support Then Oppose Then Support Firearm Background Checks (VIDEO),"It s no secret that NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre is totally fricking nuts. Unfortunately for him, his newest online video won t ameliorate his reputation for being a well-financed escaped mental patient.Cutting to the chase, LaPierre s video goes something like this:1) Background checks should be expanded. 2) Background checks shouldn t be expanded. 3) The NRA helped create background checks!I m not exaggerating. LaPierre opens by discussing how the NRA has been actively pushing for the background check system to be augmented to include mental health records, which, LaPierre says, would ve prevented a long list of recent mass shootings. By the way, smart move, Wayne. Thanks for reminding us about some of the most tragic gun related killing sprees of our lifetime. I m not sure whether acknowledging the roster of homicidal killers is the best way to pitch the NRA s pro-gun position, but there it is.He continued by taking a sharp right-hand turn   criticizing the expansion of background checks to include gun shows and internet sales after having just seconds earlier supporting the idea. See, apparently expanding background checks to include mentally ill people is somehow better than expanding them to include gun shows.The video wraps with yet another whiplash-inducing pivot. LaPierre explains how the NRA was instrumental in establishing the National Instant Check System in the first place, an obvious admission that the NRA once supported a gun-regulation measure, the expansion of which is now inexplicably forbidden.Okeedokee.The bottom line: yes, the system could be heftier. The problem is that LaPierre and his flying monkeys spend millions of dollars intimidating or buying-off lawmakers who render ineffective any efforts to improve the system. In other words, any weaknesses in the system can almost entirely be blamed on the NRA. And if a bill that fortifies the system is introduced, the NRA will inevitably kill it. Why? Anything that makes it more difficult for consumers to buy guns will be opposed simply because the NRA is solely tasked with selling guns. LaPierre knows the Second Amendment is nothing more than a convenient marketing gimmick for selling deadly weapons to sociopaths.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLTMkg1RLW0]Featured image via video screen grab",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Alabama’s Chief Justice Just Spit On The Constitution: Reinstates Ban On Gay Marriage,"One would think that to hold a position like Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court you would have to know a thing or two about the law. Justice Roy Moore, the same guy who lost a battle and his job over the statue of the Ten Commandments in the Alabama State House, is looking to once again defy the Supreme Court of the United States and the Constitution he is sworn to uphold and protect.Moore sent word on Wednesday that the SCOTUS ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide doesn t apply to Alabama. Citing the fact that the case was ruled on for other states   not Alabama   and how right Kim Davis was to refuse to do her job, Moore laid down the gantlet to his next impeachment.Apparently Moore doesn t quite understand how the judicial branch of the federal government works, nor does he understand the 14th Amendment. The gay marriage ruling was specifically intended to extend the rights of couples in one state to all states in the union.Pesky little things like facts, procedure and protocol don t matter to Moore, whose Administrative Order reads: Until further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect, Moore and other opponents of equality have said there is confusion about the actual meaning of the Supreme Court s historic Obergefell v Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in every state in the union. Confusion and uncertainty exist among the probate judges of this state as to the effect of Obergefell on the  existing orders,'  he wrote.Those  existing orders,  essentially an archaic ban on a now-legal practice, were more than clarified when a federal judge ordered in July that the SCOTUS ruling was binding on all probate judges in Alabama. Judges from two counties have discontinued licensing for the time being, but could ultimately face the same fate as Kim Davis if they continue to violate a federal order.Roy Moore told CNN that the vendetta he has against same-sex marriage isn t a religious issue; it s about the law. Roy Moore is full of crap. He is and always has been nothing but a southern crusader for Christianity.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The FIVE Most Ridiculous Things Done So Far By These Make-Believe ‘Patriots’ In Oregon,"Last Saturday, a bunch of well-armed  militiamen  decided to protest the extended sentence of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, who started fires on federal land near their property. The federal law they broke has a minimum five-year sentence. And according to Rolling Stone: The first federal judge to handle the case concluded that the mandatory sentence was too stiff and gave the pair far lighter sentences, which they served. But the U.S. attorney in the case called foul; the federal government took the rare step of appealing the sentence. In October 2015, the Ninth Circuit imposed the mandatory minimum, ruling that:  given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.  The ranchers are due back in federal prison Monday to serve out their five years each. Well, not wanting to stay out of the limelight for too long, Ammon Bundy, son of the infamous anti-government imbecile Cliven Bundy who stood his ground with no penalty against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) not too long ago, decided he would involve himself in the fight against  tyranny  of government against these law-breaking ranchers. Bundy, and his band of merry morons, decided to take over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon. He posted a video to Facebook where he declared: We have basically taken over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. And this will become a base place for patriots from all over the country to come and be housed here and to live here. And we re planning on staying here for several years bring your arms. Maybe they don t need their legs?Well, needless to say, the government isn t being  tyrannical,  but rather following the laws as they are written. These  militiamen  may not like the laws, but that s what elections are for   you vote in the people who make the laws. You don t hold armed protests, or rather hissy fits, in an empty wildlife refuge.Nonetheless, in no particular order, here are the five stupidest things done by these make-believe  Patriots  in Oregon:If there s a protest by ultra-right-wing morons to be had somewhere, you know there are bound to be an abundance of signs that are misspelled. And not disappointing us in the slightest, the Bundy  Militia   made sure to offer some doozies. Looks like maybe they could have used some of that  tyranical goverment  [sic] to help them get a better education.via littlegreenfootballs.comOne of the  Patriots,  Jon Ritzenheimer, even made a goodbye video for his family. Occupying a bird refuge is dangerous, and you never know when a bald eagle may come to knock some sense into them.After this pathetic request for snacks and supplies because this group of  soldiers  apparently forgot the Boy Scout motto  be prepared // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;ATTENTION SHARE ATTENTION SHARE!!!!!!Anyone that wants to send any supplies can send them to: General Mail  Posted by Blaine Cooper on Thursday, December 31, 2015  several folks took to Twitter to mock the living hell out of the ill-prepared dimwits:Please send snacks b/c the USPS isn't at all part of the ""oppressive tyrannical government "" we hate. #YallQaeda pic.twitter.com/IUWtQPo2Fi  Princess Slay Ya (@dumbsainted) January 5, 2016Send Snacks Please pic.twitter.com/8pgxCK9Dcs  Not Being Governed (@ArtofNBG) January 6, 2016Send snacks for freedom, please. #YallQaeda #EatMorChikin pic.twitter.com/XDVu378VA8  Ronald Keith Gaddie (@GaddieWindage) January 5, 2016Pretty badass, right?

 Father Furious When TSA Agent Frisks 10-Year-Old Daughter In Two-Minute Pat Down (VIDEO/IMAGE),"A 10-year-old girl s awful experience with a TSA agent is now making national headlines after she was forced to undergo an inappropriately long and invasive pat down.Vendela Payne had been traveling back home to California with her family when she was stopped by a TSA agent at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina. Vendela had accidentally left a Capri Sun drink in her bag as she went through the security line and was flagged for further screening   which is when her travel experience changed drastically.Removed from her family, Vendela was forced to endure an uncomfortable pat down that lasted two uncomfortably long minutes. Her father, Kevin Payne, was on the other side of the glass and began recording the entire screening as he noticed  it was an uncomfortable situation. In the video footage below, you can see how lengthy, repetitive and invasive the pat down was, as Kevin repeatedly calls out the TSA s actions in the overlaying text:If you didn t observe how uncomfortable the pat-down made Vendela feel by her frozen, blank stare in the video, she spoke about the traumatizing experience in an interview with NBC. The young girl said she kept trying not to  throw a tantrum like a 1-year-old. : My dad was making funny faces silly faces in the mirror and I felt like screaming the whole time. I know it s to keep everybody on the plane safe, but she kept patting me down. Pat down, pat down. It was like, over and over. TSA agent pats down Vendela s chestWhile Kevin says that he supports airport security policies and safety procedures, he agrees with his daughter that the TSA agent was inappropriate during the pat down. He said: I m a very big proponent of security, and if they were patting me down no problem, but this was a 10-year-old girl. The whole system seems to not work the way it should be working. They gave her a very standard pat-down for an adult female. I don t think it was modified one bit. If you look at videos, most pat-downs on adults (take) about a minute. Start to finish, in real time, (Vendala s pat-down) was 1 minute and 47 seconds. It just didn t seem like it was an efficient pat-down. The TSA s website states that screenings are meant to determine if prohibited items are being hidden under clothing and that agents will use sufficient pressure to detect concealed items. However, the site also says that screening procedures for kids 12 and under have been modified so that children are not likely to undergo a pat down screening. In Vendela s case, her father believes that the agent chose the pat down screening without considering other options.",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump-Supporting Gun Nut Holds AR-15 Like A Baby During The Most Bizarre Interview Ever (VIDEO),"Gun nuts are a strange breed. They are paranoid, uneducated, and don t feel complete without a few penis extensions guns fully locked and loaded at all times. However, one ammosexual just took it a step further, by holding on to his beloved AR-15 during an interview on CNN.Who is this guy and why is he allowed anywhere near guns, you might ask? This guy actually is New Hampshire s own Mark Limoges, owner of Black Op Arms gun store. He s also a Donald Trump supporter, and he showed up to the interview with a perfect copy of the AR-15 that he lovingly presented to The Donald himself. Limoges told the show s hosts: This is an exact replica of the gun we gave Mr. Trump. It has our Black Ops Arms symbol on it with our Black Ops Arms symbol on the handrail. And the other side, we have the  Live Free or Die  with the American flag on the handrail. He did, however, admit that Trump s Secret Service detail was more than a little concerned about both the visit to the gun store and the gift of an assault rifle. Limoges goes on to explain how that was handled: We actually wanted Mr. Trump to come to our gun store, which the Secret Service was not real thrilled about. A Secret Service agent came to the store, took the gun. We removed the bolt out of it. They took possession of the weapon and then presented it to us before we went into the room to present it to Mr. Trump. Limoges also admitted that the weapon he give the GOP front runner would be illegal in Trump s home state of New York without modifications. Then, of course, he had to go and accuse President Obama of attempting to seize guns, saying: I think it s probably a first step towards it, yes. Host John Berman seemed surprised, and said,  Really?  in response.Berman s co-host Kate Bolduan challenged this assertion, reminding Limoges that President Obama explicitly says that he has no such plans: The president said yesterday in his speech that his actions are not a plot to take away everybody s guns. This statement led to Limoges accusing the president of being a liar on live television: Mr. Obama has also said other things that have not always been the truth. Berman went on to press Limoges: Look, he says he respects the Second Amendment. And if you just look at the actions he s taking, even the things he was proposing a few years ago which were steeper than this, even if you support universal background checks, that doesn t necessarily mean you want to take someone s guns away. Limoges  mind was not changed, though, and he concluded: Most of the people that come in [to the gun store] are real nervous about what Mr. Obama is going to do to limit their chances of getting weapons. Maybe that s why he insisted on keeping his AR-15 cradled so closely for the duration. Obama could come take it during the five minutes he was talking to those lovely CNN hosts.Get some help, Mr. Limoges. You clearly need it.Watch the entire bizarre exchange below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Joe Scarborough Defends President Obama’s Emotional Announcement On Gun Control (VIDEO),"While it s often difficult to notice, Joe Scarborough is one of the remaining few  reasonable  Republicans. Of course, this has a lot to do with his party s radical shift to its far-right flank, backed with the ascension of Donald Trump. Consequently, certain Republicans such as Scarborough, who at one time sounded radical, sound rational today. To his credit, Scarborough has often sidestepped partisanship to give credit where credit is due.Such was the case Wednesday morning when the host of MSNBC s Morning Joe vocally defended President Obama s executive order on gun control.Scarborough and co-host Mike Barnacle elaborated on the president s announcement, and agreed that expanding background checks for gun sales is an eminently reasonable action to take. Scarborough made sure to underscore for his unhinged conservative viewers that Obama didn t say anything about grabbing any guns. He also validated the president s genuine sadness and anger when mentioning Sandy Hook during his remarks.Via Media Matters:SCARBOROUGH: You see the frustration, don t you, in every press conference after every mass shooting, the president being frustrated by his inability to get anything done even when 90 percent of Americans support stronger background checks.BARNICLE: Absolutely, Joe. And living with the knowledge that you have to provide more information to become a Little League baseball coach than you do to a gun show.SCABOROUGH: Look at this. So if you re driving, a lot of people are listening to us as they drive into work. We re showing a Quinnipiac University poll that actually shows 89 percent of Americans support background checks for gun purchases at gun shows. Eighty-seven percent Republicans, 87 percent. And as other pollsters have told us, up to 80 percent of Republicans in early primary states, who vote in early primary states, support background checks. And, this is not a prediction. I m just going to tell you how it s going to be. There are going to continue to be mass shootings. Terrorists are going to continue to do it over the next decade. And the things that I ve been talking about on background checks and all of us have been talking about and the president has been talking about, Republicans, it s going to be the Republican position within the next two, three, four years. I say Jim VandeHei, one of the things that was most astounding yesterday was the reaction. The Pavlovian reaction from Republicans over a set of actions that really weren t far reaching. And even the White House will tell you, they were modest at best. He hopes he can do something to start the gun show loopholes so terrorist can t walk in and buy guns. But it wasn t even that, and I m not knocking him, it wasn t that sweeping. Nobody got any guns taken away yesterday.And, of course, Joe is correct. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, 95 percent of Democrats and 87 percent of Republicans support background checks. Back in 2014, 92 percent of gun owners supported expanding the regulation. Yet, when the Manchin-Toomey amendment was proposed back in 2013, the Senate GOP filibustered the legislation in defiance of nearly 90 percent of its voters. Why? Three words: National Rifle Association. The only constituency that matters to the congressional Republicans. It s an almost awe-inspiring dynamic   the NRA s extremist agenda is a higher legislative priority for the GOP than 87 percent of Republican voters.Furthermore, the president s order is, as Scarborough said, not that  far reaching.  Back in 2013, the president announced much more stringent and comprehensive regulations on gun ownership. The president, at the time, tried to resurrect the expired assault weapons ban and close all of the loopholes created by the NRA in 1994. There were bullet control  proposals: no more magazines larger than 10 rounds, and no more armor-piercing bullets. Today, however, the president s actions are limited to just the background checks and additional funding for the FBI and ATF. Nothing else. But that won t stop the relentless lies and fear-mongering by the GOP, telling its people that Obama s out to confiscate their guns. As much as I d like it to happen, it won t.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Watch Trump Mock His Moronic Supporters To Their Faces, And They’re Too Stupid To Notice (VIDEO)","If there s one thing Donald Trump knows how to do really well, even better than most, it s sell things. And in this case, that  thing  isn t real estate or a television show or a book, but rather just himself. With the phrase  Make America Great Again,  with no further explanation besides loving guns, hating Mexicans, and lowering taxes, he s gotten a rather large following to support him.Being the salesman that he is, he doesn t care who supports him as long as they do. He uses simplistic phrases on purpose, because he knows that most of his supporters likely don t have above a third grade reading level. He plays to the stupid vote, but calls them smart and the  most intelligent  because, after all, they are voting for him.However, at a recent campaign event in Claremont, New Hampshire, Trump seemed to let it slip that he knows his supporters are an army of loyal idiots. After reciting poll after poll after poll, which seems to be all these events are, self-congratulatory events for himself, he told the crowd that no one is ever leaving him. No matter what he says, or how awful he behaves, he knows he has the support of this moronic base.He said: Did you see? One of the things that came out in the one poll, nobody s ever leaving me. I could be the worst person in the world, they re not leaving. Continuing, he said: If I was up here and did some really inappropriate things, my people stay. I love you people. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love my people! They re the most loyal. And if that wasn t bad enough, he then comes out and says it: I m winning with the smart people, I m winning with the not-so-smart people, too. I m winning with everything. With all of this he got cheers and shouts of  I love you!  and  We love you!  from the crowd of unsuspecting nincompoops.Trump knows exactly what he s doing, which is actually what makes his run for the Oval Office so terrifying. He plays to the simplistic and imbecilic minded in the nation, and they lap it up with a spoon. Trump doesn t care that his voters are dumb. I mean, hell, George W. Bush won in 2004 after 9/11 and starting a war based on lies. There is definitely a base of voters in this nation who shouldn t be allowed to operate heavy machinery, including a voting machine.

 Stephen Colbert Mercilessly And Hilariously Mocks Unprepared Bundy Terrorists (VIDEO),"In a glorious segment on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert piled on the mockery of the anti-government loons who took over a federal wildlife refuge building without preparing for the long haul.When Ammon and Ryan Bundy seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, they were hoping to ignite a war against the federal government. Instead, the federal government ignored them and most of America laughed at them and the right-wing militia movement became an even bigger joke than it has ever been.The armed militants have been labeled  Y all qaeda  and  Vanilla ISIS  and drew even more ridicule after having to beg people to send them snacks through the US Postal Service because they somehow forgot to prepare for a long occupation. Ammon Bundy has even backed away from his brother s claim that the group came there to kill or be killed during an embarrassing interview with Megyn Kelly.Clearly, Bundy s pathetic rebellion has very little support. And Stephen Colbert only added more mockery on Tuesday night. I haven t seen this many angry, bearded men in Oregon since I referred to Blue Moon as a craft beer,  Colbert quipped. These confused, fragile, heavily armed creatures need someplace to live where civilization won t upset them. They re clearly endangered, although it s hard to know exactly how many there are because their camo is so good. Here s one standing between two bushes, I believe. Sadly, there s no hope of establishing a breeding program because, frankly, it s a bit of a sausage fest. Colbert also mocked the stand-off the armed traitors hoped for but didn t get. Probably not what the protesters had in mind. That s like taking over the Alamo and then not being surrounded by the Mexicans. To conclude, Colbert mocked Bundy and his friends for being less prepared than a troop of boy scouts. What heroic, go-it-alone mountain men have always needed   Go-Gurt, string cheese and Lunchables. I want you to hang in there, fellas, because help is on the way. The refuge should really be renamed the  Ammon Bundy Preserve for the Armed and Cranky,  Colbert suggested.Here s the video via YouTube.Yeah, hang in there, guys. Because the longer you carry on this farce, the more material you give to Stephen Colbert and the rest of the world with which to mock you. Congratulations, you all are officially a worldwide joke.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Roasts Donald Trump: ‘I Don’t Have To Spend Money’ To Make Him ‘Look Dumb’ (VIDEO),"On Tuesday s edition of  The Nightly Show, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders promised to steal the White House from Republican front runner Donald Trump if the two should ever face off in the presidential election.On the show, host Larry Wilmore asked Sanders what he thought about Trump s much-reported use of the word  schlong  to insult Hillary Clinton. Sanders, making a joke out of Trump s numerous nonsensical remarks, said: I don t know the answer to that. I have yet to recover from Trump s shock that women go to the bathroom. I m still recovering from that, so  schlonged,  I haven t figured out yet. Wilmore pressed on, asking Sanders if he would  schlong  The Donald if they went head to head for the presidency. Sanders replied,  Let me say, we will beat him badly. How s that? Wilmore also brought up the fact that someone had been writing anti-Trump messages in the sky last weekend, right above the Rose Bowl Parade. Wilmore asked Sanders if he d had anything to do with it, since there had coincidentally been a rally for Sanders at the same time. Sander responded with something we all know to be true: I don t have to spend money to make Donald Trump look dumb   he does it all by himself. You can watch Sanders roast The Donald below: The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore Get More: The Nightly Show Full Episodes,The Nightly Show on Facebook,The Nightly Show Video ArchiveIn later parts of the interview, Sanders took the opportunity to express his support for President Barack Obama s executive action on guns, blasting Republicans for trying to hold back an initiative that was so badly needed in America. We re not getting any cooperation from the Republicans, no matter how many horrific mass shootings we see. I think the most important thing we have to do now is to expand and improve the instant background check. What the president is trying to do now is deal with the so-called gun show loophole. Many of Sanders  constituents in Vermont are responsible gun owners, but Sanders said they accept the dangers that can come with firearms and don t argue that policies must be in place to avoid their misuse. People hunt and they do outdoor things   that s what we do. But the vast majority of the people understand, in my state, and I think around the country, that it s imperative that we do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Criminals (and) people who are mentally unstable should not own a gun. That s my view, and there is a broad consensus around that. Also touching on the Black Lives Matter movement, Sanders and Wilmore agreed that the media has blown controversial issues out of proportion. Sanders said, I think white people are as appalled as African-Americans and Latinos in seeing what we re seeing on television, and that is unarmed people being killed while they re in police custody. The Vermont senator, who has made criminal justice reform a crucial part of his campaign, also stressed that reducing police brutality would be one of his priorities as president: The first, and maybe most, important is to make sure that if a police officer breaks the law, that officer   like any other public official   must be held accountable. Other things that we have to do is demilitarize many of our local police departments. We have to make police departments look like the communities they serve, in terms of diversity. What appalls me is that we have more people in jail today than any other country on Earth   more than China, 2.2 million people   and that s why we need real criminal justice reform. We ve got to make sure that kids have jobs and education, rather than hanging out on street corners unemployed.

 @Ammon_Bundy’s Ridiculous Late Night Twitter Rant Has Everyone Talking (TWEETS),"Either Ammon Bundy himself or a clever imposter has taken Twitter   and the media   by storm. The head of the Oregon Moron Militia, Bundy is the textbook case of the modern  Murican  patriot.  He is either just being himself and having a Twitter-fest of spewing out right-wing talking points or someone has decided to channel him, guessing the Bundy-esque things he might say.The rant was late-night, when the cold of the Oregon forest may have demanded a little something to make a person forget what aches. More than a dozen tweets went out from the account, including a retweet of an interview Bundy did with a local blog. Here are a few examples:As Thomas Paine said, It is the duty of the patriot to protect its country from its government. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 5, 2016We are not about fear, we are not about force, we are not about intimidation. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016We came here in protest because of the force and the intimidation that we have seen in this county. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016With that being said, we will not be intimidated by the federal government for taking stand for something we strongly believe in.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016It even went so far as to compare the Moron Militia to Rosa Parks:We are doing the same thing as Rosa Parks did. We are standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016However, reporters now say the account is believed to be a fake. Tony Dokoupil of MSNBC tweeted this:People, Ammon Bundy is not operating a twitter account. I stood with him last night as tweets supposedly from him went out.  tonydokoupil (@tonydokoupil) January 6, 2016That seems to be compelling enough. A reporter who was there at the time says Bundy isn t on Twitter at all. That seemed like the case for sure when the account was suspended by Twitter, which has a process of verifying identities of celebrities and others in the news. Then USA Today reported that the account was suspended and that it was re-instated.Another theory may be that much like many people on Twitter who have become public figures, Ammon Bundy has someone  smarter  than he is running his account. With all the freedoming and interviews he s doing, Bundy probably doesn t have time for the social media onslaught for the movement, which has obviously been even less successful than the movement itself.Alas, the account is still alive and well and as of Wednesday at just after 11 AM EST tweeted this:The last thing we want is an armed confrontation. We want this to end peacefully without anyone being harmed.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016That s the first real evidence that the account may not be real unless Ammon Bundy s goal of remaining for years to give a bird preserve to loggers, miners and ranchers has changed. Or maybe he s just cold.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch How Absurd A Gun Nut Looks Defending U.S. Gun Violence On A UK TV Show (VIDEO),"Try to picture a place where gun control is real   where people can sit in a coffee shop without worrying that a lunatic is going to start indiscriminately shooting people. Imagine you didn t have to worry about the safety of your children when they got on that school bus. Conjure an image where things are peaceful enough that most of the police don t even carry guns, and when they do they wear big yellow letters that say  armed. Believe it or not, those places do exist. In a far away land called Europe and another called Australia, people have learned that guns don t have to be what defines them and that if a society is to evolve, it must do so peacefully. They ve moved on to bigger and better things while here at home, we dig the hole a little bit deeper.President Obama s executive orders on gun control have put America in the spotlight. People from all over the world want to know if the United States has finally learned its lesson and decided to take action. In the UK, where gun deaths for the year won t reach the number America has had in five days, talking to a Yank who loves guns has to be almost as comical as it is ridiculous.The talking points we listen to every day and have accepted as the right-wing response, sound even more absurd when you hear them spoken to a Brit. This particular ammosexual, Niel McCabe from Armed American Radio, tosses out that kicks and fists have killed more people than rifles, knowing full-well that  rifles  aren t the culprit in most murders and suicides, handguns are. He keeps tossing blurb after blurb of the same old rhetoric. If we can t have a law that will 100 percent solve the problem, we shouldn t have laws at all. It s really just so stupid.It s really just so stupid.BBC43 Host Jon Snow has some tough questions for the flat top-wearing poster boy who is for the  right  to keep killing each other.

 The Hidden Root Of White Rage,"Paul Krugman asks a simple question about why white (conservative) people who fly into a rage always seem to do so over really stupid things:Something that strikes me, however   and which I don t fully understand   is that when people like this turn to angry rhetoric, with at least a hint of violence, the trigger events tend to be trivial. There are plenty of real grievances that could be motivating working-class whites Now, I loves me some Krugman but he s missing the super obvious here: White conservatives are angry at a racially unjust economic system that has started to treat white people the same it s always treated black people. It was supposed to benefit them to the detriment of  those  people and it did, decade after decade. White people enjoyed a lifestyle unprecedented in history and managed to deny that life to millions of minorities. But the rich got so greedy that the system is breaking down and now everyone is suffering. Except for the rich, of course.The end result is that they can t attack the system they love without admitting how unjust it was in the first place. What are they going to say?  Hey! Where are all the white jobs?! On top of this frustration is the cold and horrible (for white people) realization that they no longer have total control over the government. With a black president in the White House, there is zero chance of getting through the kind of policies that used to transfer immense amounts of wealth to the white community while leaving the black community out in the cold. Those days are over and with the rapid  browning  of America, they aren t coming back.This leaves us with millions of angry white people betrayed by a system they believed in and supported their entire lives. But to admit that the system was unjust would be to admit that they, white people, benefited at the expense of black people in the first place. Most white people, including liberals, would rather gnaw their arm off to escape this trap. And so they find the most ridiculous and mundane targets for their rage, a rage that should be directed at the system but can t be. It really is that simple.Featured image via AI archives",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oregon Militia Terrorist: I’ll Die Before I Let The Feds Arrest Me (VIDEO),"The situation with the Bundy ranchers and their heavily armed right-wing militia s occupation of a federal building on a wildlife reserve in Oregon is escalating. The federal government is planning to take steps to end their ridiculous occupation, but at least one of them has said he ll lay down his very life before he allows the authorities to arrest him.The Harvey County Sheriff said of the handling of the militant takeover: There are things being done. It s not visible to the public. Authorities are reportedly taking steps to stop power service to the occupied federal building, as well as working with the FBI and other federal government authorities to have the militia members removed. Of course, the idiots calling themselves the Oath Keepers, had to comment. They told families to relocate their children: This is not a family event. The only people there should be the armed men who are willing to die there with Ammon Bundy and his brothers and a couple of embedded reporters. One of the militiamen spoke with MSNBC about his intentions for when the government closes in on their occupation. LaVoy Finicum, 55, says he knows that agents are coming for him and others occupying the building. However, he seems to believe he ll die first. He said to MSNBC: I have been raised in the country all my life. I love dearly to feel the wind on my face. To see the sun rise, to see the moon. I have no intention of spending any of my days in a concrete box. Well, sir, if you weren t breaking the law, you wouldn t have reason to fear spending time in prison. These idiots need to be arrested. They are nothing more than real life, bona fide terrorists.This guy is so dumb that he sincerely believes that the authorities won t find him because he is hiding under a huge blue tarp in the middle of a vacant parking lot with his penis extension gun. I ve got news for you, Mr. Finicum: They ll find you, and they ll arrest you. If you threaten them or put up a fight, they ll kill you.Take my advice: go home to your farm and your kids before any of that happens.Watch Finicum s statements below, via MSNBC:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Maddow Compares Trump To 1968 Racist Candidate George Wallace: The Similarity Is Shocking (VIDEO),"Some political pundits have been unable to describe how Donald Trump manages to maintain his popularity. With his escalating hateful rhetoric, personal insults, and generally obnoxious behavior, many have settled their confusion by pretending there is no way he can win the Republican primary. The problem with that is, all polls show he can.Rachel Maddow uncovered what seems to be the secret to Trump s success. It appears that he took his complete strategy for how to run a presidential campaign from 1968 s Racist Alabama Governor George Wallace. This explains a lot about how Trump s campaign of disgusting hate has been able to flourish so easily among regressive conservatives in America.If you use a little imagination and think Trump and Muslims, instead of Wallace and African-Americans, the parallels will suddenly become clear. Like Rachel said,  Close your eyes and just listen to the news reports from that election. It s almost like they re talking about Donald Trump. Watch Rachel s presentation comparing Trump and George Wallace below:What Rachel pointed out was incredibly significant. The comparisons are eerie and even if you were to take the direct comparisons of Trump and Wallace out of the picture, the supporters   who you couldn t possibly say were imitating each other intentionally   are virtually identical in the thoughts they convey about why they support their candidate.Rachel finished the segment by making a great point: Donald Trump has something that Republican voters like. They liked it the last time that he offered it to them for a short period of time,  she said.  And now they like it this time, as well   it s the same type of significant popularity. It just hasn t gone away this time around because he hasn t stopped running this time around like he did in 2012. She s right. Trump offered up the same fare in the 2012 presidential campaign and got a huge amount of support from it. If he had chosen to invest himself fully the last time around, he could have taken the nomination from Romney, who was universally panned by the Republican establishment right up until he was their only choice.The question now is: what will happen when Trump ends up on the ballot? A couple years after Wallace was officially in an election, he was shot. Could Trump s hate speech eventually become that kind of liability?Featured image via Youtube",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Are About To Bailout A Foreign Company That Screwed Over 500K American Consumers,"Do you remember the time that Republicans thought automotive companies should be allowed to go bankrupt? They seem to have forgotten all about that.House Republicans are set to give a big wet kiss to Volkswagen in the form of a bailout that will prevent them from being sued by over 500,00 American consumers, against whom they admitted committing fraud.Volkswagen has been caught up in a huge scandal after it admitted to cheating on air pollution standards. The context behind the scandal and ensuing lawsuits lies with  defeat devices  that VW had installed in approximately 580,000 of their diesel vehicles, in order to fool emissions testing in the U.S.Remember, these are the same Republicans that worked to block a VW plant from opening in Chattanooga, Tennessee because the plant was going to be unionized. This proves they don t really care about Volkswagen. They just really love hurting American citizens.The suit, filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the EPA could net Volkswagen up to $18 billion in fines. However, that s not all of their problems. The Justice Department also indicated that it could roll individual lawsuits into their litigation as well. The individual lawsuits come from owners that might win up to $6,000 each in compensation for paying more than a gas-powered model costs plus decline in resale value. Add on a potential 3 billion more from consolidated individual cases Whoa! That s a lot of money!What will Volkswagen do? Why, run to Republicans of course.Yes, these are the same Republicans that wanted GM to just go bankrupt when a bailout for them would save jobs. It s clearly a different story when government action helps regular people. For rich, faceless corporations no bailout is too large or too insane   and this bailout is truly insane.The bill, which doesn t actually offer monetary compensation to cover VW s lawsuit costs, will instead make it virtually impossible for a class action suit to be brought against the corporation.From The Fiscal Times:The simplicity of the VW Bailout Bill belies the chaos it would create. Proponents like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the bill s leading lobbyist, say they merely want to get rid of  non-injury  class-action cases, based on potential damages from defective consumer products or corporate actions that have yet to result in harm. Lawyers for class-action litigants argue that defective products deserve compensation even if the consumer hasn t yet been injured.But the bill goes much further, stating that courts may not certify class-action suits unless the plaintiff  affirmatively demonstrates that each proposed class member suffered the same type and scope of injury as the named class representative or representatives. This is devastating because it sets up all class-actions to fail,  says attorney Lori Andrus, who represents several Volkswagen plaintiffs. If every class member must have the same type and scope of injury, it forces extensive proofs for class certification   essentially a full-blown trial up front, where plaintiffs will have to prove that their injuries match with their fellow representatives.Source: The Fiscal TimesTo put it simply, this isn t only for Volkswagen. This is a good straw-man case that Republicans can use to do something they have wanted to do for decades:  shut the door to justice on American consumers that get screwed over by corporations. It would allow for rampant abuse of the system, resulting in sub-standard products being sold, with little to no recourse available to consumers ever. Additionally, it would overturn decades of judicial precedent where corporations were held accountable for fraud while circumventing federal rules that lay out class action standards.As an extra insult, Republicans are pairing the bill with the FACT Act, which would force public reporting of personal information of asbestos victims, in an effort to sabotage their compensation for poisoning. It s incredibly inappropriate for Congress to send the message that it s OK to hurt people by the millions,  said Rebecca Kaplan   a Volkswagen owner.  The more people you hurt, the more this law will protect you.

 Donald Trump Cracks Jokes After His Supporter Calls President Obama ‘A Muslim’ (VIDEO),"Here we go, again.Another supporter of Donald Trump openly shouted at a Trump rally held in New Hampshire on Tuesday that President Obama was a Muslim.  And, this time, the only difference we got from Trump was a sarcastic reply, which in essence all it did was show his supporters that it s funny to be a racist.Here s Trump pretending to go after one of his supporters for the hateful comment: Oh, I m supposed to reprimand the man. Who was the man that said that? I have to reprimand. How dare you. Okay, I reprimanded him. I reprimanded him, now the press can t be angry. Is anyone surprised? We re not. Trump has become such a joke that we re tired of even using the word  joke.  It s long played out   so is the media. Even when he shows a penchant for hateful rhetoric, all the media can do is laugh about it. The shock factor is over. And, the thing is, there was nothing funny about this.All CNN and crew could do when announcing this latest B.S. was to smile. Below is an actual pic taken in context showing what they thought of this latest incident. It s like we re all in some twisted, twilight zone waiting for the rapture. For more on this, visit HERE. See for yourself.Pic via CNN.The truth is hate sells. Trump takes care of the media, and they scratch his back in return. Trump didn t lie when he said he was good for business   cheap reality TV. and political theater, calling the president a Muslim, it s all good for shits and giggles. And, frankly, this writer is tired of it.The real truth is, Trump wouldn t go after his supporters for being racist even if he wanted to. That s because, the majority of his supporters are racist. He can t alienate his base. According to a major poll done, a full 66% of his supporters think Obama is a Muslim. That s pretty insane. Maybe that s why CNN is laughing. They still can t believe this is still actually happening, either.",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Montel Williams SHAMES The NRA: Responsible Gun Owners Support Background Checks,"Talk show legend Montel Williams is a conservative, one who has expressed very critical opinions of Barack Obama in the past. But Williams says there s an area where he can t disagree with  the President   Obama s plan to use his executive powers to help alleviate a problem most of his fellow conservatives won t touch.On Tuesday, the President broke into tears as he discussed the problem of gun violence in America today   specifically, the lives lost in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, which Obama calls the  worst day in [his] presidency.  Obama has pledged to close the  gun show loophole,  which has traditionally allowed pretty damn near everyone to circumvent the background check procedure and get themselves a shootin  stick with minimal hassle. In addition, the President will be removing legal barriers preventing a doctor from reporting when someone is too crazy to have a gun, strengthening licensing requirements for sellers, and making dealers responsible for reporting guns that go missing.While many conservatives, including the veritable Brady Bunch of ignorance that is the GOP 2016 presidential field, view these common sense steps as an attack on the freedom of every single man, woman, and child, Williams applauds the President s approach to the problem of gun violence today.  I PROUDLY own 14 guns RESPONSIBLY,  Williams wrote on Facebook.  Naturally, I listened closely to what President Obama said today on guns, and I ve read what was put out detailing his proposals. He explained that no truly responsible gun owner should oppose the President s plans to reform gun laws, nor should any of them develop the opinion that the President and his jack-booted thugs will be going door to door taking people s firearms from them. I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill,  he says.  That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams added in a comment.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. In an op-ed for HuffPo, Williams says that  as a proud, responsible, gun owner,  he  can t NOT support  the President s proposal: I realize this may not make me popular with some gun owners, and I realize there is deep distrust of President Obama and his use of executive action. Simply put, I ve always believed in being a responsible ambassador for the Second Amendment, a right that I hold dear; and, thus, I believe responsible gun owners MUST be the loudest voices for universal background checks and addressing the mental health crisis we face in this country, which form the crux of the president s proposals. Williams says that he has formed his views largely through his work with students  in the wake of school shootings over the years.  Williams challenges anyone who disagrees that it is important to enact common sense gun legislation to spend time with children who have survived school shootings: They all have the same, haunted look in their eyes, one that frequently keeps me up at night. I would challenge anyone to listen to their stories, experience their pain and then go back the next year and the next, and see how profoundly they are affected and then do it all over again for the next school   you ll feel the same way I do. Universal background checks should be a no-brainer. Guns should not change hands without a background check,  he says.  I cannot give my car to my children without filing a form with the DMV, and no one complains about that burden, nor do they suggest it s a veiled attempt to de-car America. Unfortunately, the NRA and its acolytes spread fear   Obama wants your guns   to all who will listen, and unfortunately too many listen. The NRA and its bought-and-paid-for politicians fight progress with regard to gun legislation every step of the way   including, of course, background checks. Giving up even that much, in their eyes, would be giving up their guns.Williams suggests that we dispense with the meaningless rhetoric, cross the aisle, and work together to solve the problem of gun violence in this country   the root of which, he  says, is that it s  dangerous allowing people to acquire guns without a background check. Williams says that both liberals and conservatives need to skip the divisiveness that plagues our country and focus on the fact that our children s lives are at stake. He asks his fellow gun owners not to buy into the extreme Right s propaganda that paints this as a gun-grabbing measure: This is common sense, and, ultimately, the best way to advance and protect the Second Amendment right we hold dear. Williams is right. No one is trying to take anyone s guns. In fact, President Obama is attempting to ensure that everyone who should be able to get a gun can get one. In the end, this would even accomplish some conservative goals: people would feel safer around armed individuals if they all passed a comprehensive background check and were mentally competent to handle the weapon, for instance. In that sense, the President s plan is a godsend for pro-Second Amendment people of all stripes. If conservatives want to end the stigma associated with gun ownership, the absolute best way is to support this opportunity to protect the integrity of the Second Amendment.Featured image via Facebook/screengrab ",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill O’Reilly Plays Stump The Trump On Foreign Policy And Makes Him Look Like A Fool (VIDEO),"Donald Trump appeared on Fox News on Monday night, only to be embarrassingly stumped by Bill O Reilly.O Reilly wanted to know if Trump plans on taking military action against Iran if he becomes president, and Trump totally demonstrated his lack of foreign policy knowledge by dodging the question and ranting about things he really doesn t understand. If you re elected president are you going to take military action against Iran?  O Reilly asked.  Are you going to do something to that country? Well, I would want to help Saudi Arabia,  Trump replied with what seems to be a reference to Iranians attacking the Saudi Arabian embassy in retaliation against a mass execution the Saudis recently committed on New Year s Day in which 47 were killed, including a Shiite cleric.  I would want to protect Saudi Arabia,  Trump claimed.  But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economically Trump suggested that he might attack Iran if Saudi Arabia offered the right price but remained largely unwilling to say one way or another whether he would get America involved in yet another costly and bloody war in the Middle East.O Reilly continued to press Trump for an answer, calling him out for dodging the question.Trump then went on a tirade against the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a disastrous deal that Iran has already supposedly broken before claiming that Iran will have a nuclear weapon  very soon. Clearly, Trump is not aware of the fact that Iran recently surrendered their entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians, which is definitive proof that the Iran nuclear deal is a success because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.The Iran nuclear deal stands as one of President Obama s greatest achievements, and should not be abandoned in favor of war when diplomacy is working. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is nothing more than ISIS posing as a legitimate nation. They use Sharia law and behead so many people every year that ISIS leaders must be envious. The only reason our government has failed to call the Saudis out for their horrible human rights record is because they control the second largest oil reserves in the world.This is why it is not only important for the United States to reject military action in the Middle East, we need to become energy independent so that we no longer have to rely on Saudi Arabia for our energy needs. Frankly, the United States government should grow a pair and strongly condemn Saudi Arabia right now for behaving like a terrorist organization.The bottom line, however, is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief. He not only wants to send American troops to die needlessly in Iran, he wants to make Saudi Arabia pay for it. Basically, Trump would turn America into a puppet for the Saudis. But more likely, he would damage relations with both nations and put America squarely in the middle of a potential conflict that could easily turn into World War III.America does not need more war. We need peace. And as O Reilly pointed out, voters have the right to know what Trump plans to do, even if Trump thinks they have no right to know at all.Here s the video via YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Goes Full Birther — On Ted Cruz,"Donald Trump has revived the birther conspiracy theory, but this time he has targeted a fellow Republican: Ted Cruz.Cruz has begun creeping up in some state polls, particularly in evangelical-heavy Iowa, so as he has done in the past Trump went on the attack.Donald Trump said in an interview that rival Ted Cruz s Canadian birthplace was a  very precarious  issue that could make the Texas senator vulnerable if he became the Republican presidential nominee. Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question:  Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?  That d be a big problem,  Trump said when asked about the topic.  It d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make decision. You don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head. Trump added,  I d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport. Trump is easily the most visible proponent of the birther conspiracy theory. Before the 2012 election, Trump made numerous national television appearances demanding that President Obama release his birth certificate. Trump even claimed that he had enlisted right-wing Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to send a  cold case posse  to Hawaii to investigate Obama s past.The reality TV star even made a bizarre video requesting Obama s college records in order for the Hawaiian-born president to prove his citizenship.Senator Cruz s mother was a U.S. citizen when she gave birth to him in Calgary, Canada, which easily fulfills the requirement for someone to be a  natural-born citizen  of the United States. While Cruz s ideas may be repellent to the majority of citizens, he is easily eligible to be President of the United States.After years of trying to de-legitimize President Obama through two terms, it is odd to see the tactic turned against the right s own candidates. Like so much of their rhetoric, it resembles Frankenstein building his monster then watching it turn on him instead of his enemies.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Ted Cruz Pushes Birther’s Bizarre Star Wars Video Supporting His Presidential Run,"Ted Cruz is promoting the work of a birther filmmaker who has created a bizarre YouTube video that casts the right-wing Texas senator as the hero of the Star Wars movies. Cruz s campaign pushed a link featuring the video in a blast email to supporters: In honor of the latest Star Wars movie, the team here at Cruz HQ wanted to share with you a YouTube video created by a fellow supporter that depicts Senator Cruz as a Jedi Warrior, fighting for the Constitution,  the Cruz campaign wrote in an email to supporters last night, linking to a fawning Breitbart article about the video.The video shows Cruz riding an elephant with a lightsaber made out of the U.S. Constitution moving from state to state, flipping them from Democratic blue to Republican red. The video ends with Cruz confronting President Obama flanked by a phalanx of RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) and restoring liberty.The film was created by birther filmmaker Joel Gilbert, who produced the anti-Obama propaganda film Dreams from My Real Father. In that film, Gilbert indulges in the conspiracy theory that Obama s father was Communist Frank Marshall Davis. The video also uses fake images to smear President Obama s mother, claiming that she posed for sexual photos.Gilbert also claims that Obama has had plastic surgery so that his nose no longer resembles Davis. Gilbert also alleges that the president is secretly a Muslim, despite the ample evidence that he is a practicing Christian, and claims that the 2012 presidential election was stolen. He writes columns for World Net Daily, a leading pro-birther conspiracy website affiliated with Donald Trump.Pushing the video is just the latest example of Cruz s significant habit of stroking his own ego, often indulging in hyperbolic speech to cast himself and his campaign as central figures in a hero/persecution myth.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Jennifer Lawrence: When You Attack Planned Parenthood, You’re Attacking All Women","Jennifer Lawrence has been speaking her mind lately. In an interview with GLAMOUR, the Academy Award-winning actress went no-holds-barred on a lot of issues, including the recent attacks on Planned Parenthood. She said: It s so awful. It isn t an attack on abortions; it s an attack on women. Because Planned Parenthood is so much more [than abortion]. My mom was really religious with me when I was young. She s not so much anymore. And I wouldn t have been able to get birth control if it weren t for [Planned Parenthood]. I wouldn t have been able to get condoms and birth control and all these things I needed as a normal teenager who was growing up in a Jesus house. Lawrence was referring to the November attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, when Robert Lewis Dear killed three people and wounded nine. Planned Parenthood, which delivers sex education and reproductive health care to women, has faced attacks before. There have been three attacks since September after an anti-abortion group accused Planned Parenthood of selling baby parts. The flames were fanned by Republicans, including presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who said: They were certainly caught on film, that there is no doubt that they were selling baby parts. That is unambiguous. The videos show senior Planned Parenthood officials selling the parts of unborn children, and it is a federal criminal offense. It s a felony to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That accusation has proven to be false, but the damage done when a public figure makes such statements is enormous, similar to Trump s verbal attacks on Islam, which has caused a spike in attacks on Muslims across the United States. Lawrence s feelings about the Republican party are already documented: I was raised a Republican, but I just can t imagine supporting a party that doesn t support women s basic rights. Lawrence believes that Planned Parenthood provides important services to women, and she was horrified by the recent attacks. She said: I am a successful woman who has not had a pregnancy . [Laughs] But seriously. What harm comes from supplying people with birth control, condoms, Pap smears, and cancer screenings? She s right. Planned Parenthood provides services to women that they wouldn t have access to otherwise. A recent study shows: For the millions of poor women who depend on Planned Parenthood clinics, this scenario would mean the loss of affordable and accessible contraceptive services and counseling, as well as breast and cervical cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Later in the interview, Lawrence was asked why she decided to take a stand on major issues. She said: I keep going back and forth on being opinionated  My business is based on everybody buying tickets and seeing my movie. It s not smart, business-wise, to be opinionated. But then what s the point in having a voice at all if I m not going to use it for what I truly believe in?

 FL Toddler Shoots Himself In The Face After ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Leaves Weapon In Truck (VIDEO),"A Florida two-year-old is in critical condition after he shot himself in the face Monday night while playing with his  responsible  gun-owning  grandfather s unattended gun. WFTV reports that the unnamed child was riding in his grandfather s pickup truck when grandpa parked and ran inside the family s home, leaving the little boy to his own devices. Grandpa, whose name has not been released, also left his gun behind   because what s the point in being irresponsible if you re not going to go all-out?The grandfather says he left the little boy playing with some tools in the back seat, but the child managed to climb into the front of the truck, where Granddaddy kept his .32-caliber Kel-Tec gun. The gun was  responsibly  kept in a holster, but the child removed it and shot himself in the cheek, near his eye. The boy was airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, where he remains in critical condition. They are talking to individuals that were at the residence, possibly in the residence and we have forensics out gathering some evidence,  said Twis Lizasuain, Osceola County Sheriff s Office media relations director, who noted that evidence thus far suggests the discharge was  accidental    a word we too often hear when one of the  good guys with guns  shoots a child or, through negligence, allows a child to shoot him or herself. We will always encourage you to secure a weapon, especially when children are present. Though the shooting will likely be called  accidental,  grandpa might not escape unscathed. He could still be charged under a law that allows an irresponsible person to be held accountable if a child gets ahold of a gun that was not properly stored out of reach.Watch a report on this latest example of why guns make it into far too many hands than needed, below:Featured image via NLM",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rush Limbaugh Squirms And Stammers As A Caller Debunks His LIES About Guns And Obama (VIDEO),"Just about every day, Rush Limbaugh s big fat lies are systematically exposed and debunked online by a variety of sources, and it never stops being awesome. But when it comes from one of his own dittoheads   and on his own show, no less   it s especially entertaining. Not only is it fun to hear callers stick it to him, it s even more fun to watch Limbaugh squirm and pluck his chest, desperately struggling to wiggle out of the call.Such was the case on Tuesday following President Obama s executive order to expand background checks and to provide additional funding for mental health treatment and new resources for the FBI and the ATF.During the January 5 edition of his radio show, Limbaugh was ranting about something he yanked out of his diseased bunghole, suggesting that Obama s executive order forces patients to tell their doctors where they re storing their firearms and ammo. Of course, this is total hooey, and Limbaugh would ve continued to elaborate on his lie if it hadn t been for an industrious and  pro-gun  caller who totally undermined Limbaugh s entire rant with the, you know, facts.Hashtag flop-sweat.The caller noted that there are, in fact, state-level statutes in place already that mandate doctors to ask mental health patients if they believe they re a danger to themselves, but there s nothing in either state law or Obamacare or in Obama s executive order demanding that doctors known where patients are hiding their weapons. Nothing. It doesn t exist. Limbaugh made it up.Via Media Matters:CALLER: [Y]ou re telling a half-truth, at least for my state   a half-truth for my state. You need to get the information from the pamphlets that were sent out to health professionals at that time for each state. And we weren t   it does not say you ask where the gun is. It asks sensible things like  are you going to hurt yourself?  If they are, of course, stupid enough to say yes, you re, you know   do you have access to ways   are you planning on hurting someone else? But nothing on that says that I have to ask him,  Where is your gun?  and so forth. I got that information and that was from my state, not from Obama. That was from my state, and I know federal trickles down to state, but I take a little issue with some of your blanket statements when most of it was common sense prior to that, but it is state statute in Illinois a long time ago that if, say grandma has dementia and she lives with you, that you have a certain way to store that, and that s just called gun responsibility.Limbaugh stammered and tried desperately to dodge the truth. The caller, meanwhile, kept hammering away, noting that it s perfectly acceptable to, for instance, call the police if we think someone in our household is a danger to him or herself. The caller refers to this action as a  civic responsibility. Needless to say, Limbaugh s call-screener will likely be spending the New Year looking for a new job.By the way, you have to listen to the audio of the call just to hear Limbaugh completely choking on the truth.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 40 Million Bad*ss Birders Just Declared War On Oregon Terrorists,"According to an open letter addressed to the  Oregon Terrorists,  there are some 40 million nature photographers and bird lovers in the United States, and they re pissed.The letter, written by a wildlife tracker and nature photographer named Kevin, warns the militants who are currently holed up in Oregon s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that  no small group of armed thugs is going to destroy the great wildlife and national park system that our great Republican President Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir put in place over a century ago. Writing under the name Norwegian Chief, the author states that the entire birding community is up-in-arms over what is going on in Oregon:We are watching your every move, and we have been watching you for a long time. And yes absolutely you are domestic terrorists of the worst kind, and the truth about your decades of constant poaching of protected wildlife around Malheur and other wildlife refuges, national parks, national forests and BLM lands has been well-documented. For years those of us who are wildlife photographers, birdwatchers and carers of wildlife, have been documenting the activities of you poachers and criminals around many of our nation s wildlife refuges.He goes on to remind the armed thugs that it is people like himself who have brought many criminals like them to justice over the years:With our powerful cameras, and ability to move unseen in the wilderness, we have found and documented your illegal hunts, your illegal traps and all sorts of illicit activities, and are constantly feeding that information to law enforcement, and we have finally got many of you poachers on the run and into jails.Just to make sure that the terrorists understand that these folks mean business, the author describes in glorious detail, exactly why they should:Those of us who are international wildlife and nature photographers regularly face charging elephants, attacking lions and grizzlies, hidden crocodiles, massive storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, the hottest, coldest and windiest conditions, and all kinds of poisonous snakes and bugs in our work, and we know the outdoors and wilderness from desert to jungle to sea to mountain to tundra from pole to equator better then any poacher or criminal or yeehaw yokel ever will, and we are not afraid to protect it. We have a just fear of nature from experience, but we don t fear you gun-toting thugs in the least.These are people who are likely to be far more familiar with the local terrain than the armed lunatics who seized the wildlife refuge. They re people who have spent countless hours hiking those trails, getting to know every nook and cranny of the wilderness. They re also people who have the kind of patience it takes to remain totally still for long periods of time, and to mask their presence so that not even a wild animal can detect it.Kevin writes:You will never see us, but we and our cameras will always see you. We will #takebackmalheur from you terrorists, and will not rest until every one of you thugs and poachers is behind bars where they belong.As Addicting Info reported here, the Harney County Migratory Bird Festival is a major source of revenue for local businesses.According to the letter, the birding network is watching every move made by these terrorists. They know who goes in and out, who is taking supplies and who is supporting this armed and illegal occupation. According to Kevin, someone from a nearby trailer park isn t going to like the consequences of their recent actions.We know the nearby trailer park, who is supplying you with food, and a tourist boycott of them is already in the works for all birders for this upcoming bird season. We know who everyone is coming in and out, and why, and every shred of information is going straight to law enforcement and across every birding network in America.He writes that he, and others like him are: sick to death of you welfare queens and cheats living off of BLM land, illegally gutting our wilderness and our wildlife. Malheur, Hart Mountain, Klamath Marsh, Yellowstone, Glacier, Yosemite etc etc, they all belong to us, we the American people. In closing, Kevin says this:We stand now and forever with wildlife, and you seditionists and terrorists are about to find out that s there is a natural law of karma that vindictive people, who go out and poach innocent animals, will never be able to outrun or hide from.We are watching you and our years of birding photography have made us endlessly patient and determined.I must admit, I never really thought of birders as being all that badass.I definitely do now.I have no doubt that if there was ever a head-to-head battle between these birders and the yokels who are currently occupying the Malheur wildlife refuge, these birders would kick YallQueda ass all the way back to the scum-filled swamp they crawled out of.Read the entire letter from Norwegian Chief here, via Daily Kos.*Featured image credit: Pixabay",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Goes FULL Right-Wing Lunatic Trying To Raise Support Off Obama’s Gun Actions (IMAGES),"As they say, desperate times call for desperate measures, and as all the right-wing lunatics of the Republican party seem to be drifting towards Donald Trump, Ted Cruz knew what he had to do   go full right-wing lunatic himself.After President Obama announced his common sense executive actions for gun reform and a safer America, many Republicans were outraged. After all, fewer guns in the hands of the mentally ill means fewer massacres, which in turns means people won t be as scared and in turn go out and buy stockpiles of unnecessary firearms. Republicans, bought and paid for by the gun lobby, want to make sure people stay scared and have as many guns as possible.Well, Senator Ted Cruz, doing all he can to fear-monger his base of voters too stupid to realize they re being manipulated, decided he would have some fun with photoshop and scare people into supporting him. He sent out this to entice people:via tedcruz.orgOr from a mobile device: via tedcruz.orgMind you, President Obama said nothing of taking guns from anyone, or wanting anyone s guns. He s done nothing to, in any way, go against the Second Amendment which calls for citizens to be well regulated. Obama is simply trying to make sure existing laws are followed and the wrong people don t have access to buy firearms.Now, unless these right-wingers are terrified that they are going to be labeled the ones who are mentally ill, none of this effects them whatsoever. In fact, it strengthens the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners.However, Cruz, knowing his supporters are paranoid idiots, is preying on this fear for support and sends them an image of a militarized President Obama with the very false and simplistic phrase,  OBAMA WANTS YOUR GUNS,  perfectly catering to the fear these simple-minded, myopic voters have.We could say,  shame on you  to Ted Cruz for doing this, but to his credit, this sort of fear-mongering, albeit utterly inaccurate and unethical, works for Republican politicians. They have perfectly wrapped up the terrified conspiracy theorist vote, and this imagery play perfectly into that narrative.That being said, shame on you, Cruz. This is just pathetic.Featured image: tedcruz.org/flickr",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox Host Claims Obama Used A ‘Raw Onion’ To Fake Cry Over Murdered School Children (VIDEO),"Anyone who watched Barack Obama break into tears as he spoke of the 20 children and six adults murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary can tell that the President is a man who truly feels for the victims of gun violence   anyone, that is, who doesn t work for Fox News.After the President s announcement that he would be doing what Congress is unwilling to do   expanding background check and gun safety regulations, including closing the  gun show loophole  (all sensible measures)   the hosts of Outnumbered pounced on the President s plan, arguing that he was violating the separation of powers doctrine. What really bothered them, however, was the idea that a human being is capable of showing emotion that is not fake. And so begins Onionghazi, brought to you by our friends at Fox News. What was really upsetting was the tears that he wiped away again and again,  Melissa Francis said.  You want that for   I mean, we feel frightened about what s going on with ISIS. And he can t pull that kind of passion for anything about this.  She added that she feels  bad about those kids  in Newtown, but claimed it s  only about this that he gets so upset about. After a commercial break, Andrea  Tantaros jumped into the fray, arguing that President Obama s tears must be fake because  he would have spoken out a long time ago  if he really cared   especially in favorite conservative talking point, Chicago: This is how many years? Almost eight years, he s almost at the end of his term, and you haven t heard him go to Chicago and really speak out about this issue. And he is uniquely poised to do so. But everything that he s doing will not solve the problem.So, I would check that podium for like a raw onion or some No More Tears. It s not really believable. And the award goes to  we are in awards season. It just didn t seem horribly authentic,  Meghan McCain agreed.  And maybe it is, I don t know him at all.  In any case, she thinks the President should go to Chicago instead of  talking about God-fearing Americans when ISIS is coming to their hometown and shooting up 14 people. They say he s just cool, that s the way he is, that he doesn t get emotional,  Francis chimed in.  We haven t seen this in a very long time and it s about something that feels political, that feels somewhat insincere, that feels like it s not going to make a huge difference. It s like bad political theater,  McCain opined.It s something that was to be expected: President Obama showed compassion for murdered children, so the Right has assumed what they feel is a duty to for some reason attempt to convince people that he is not sincere   an act that is shameful at best.Watch it below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIvAgKrq4tc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Cops Take Care Of ‘Chronic Problem’–Kill Unarmed, Disabled Black Man (VIDEO)","Kevin Matthews, a 35-year-old Black man from Detroit, Michigan, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Even so, Matthews had never committed a felony offense in his life.On December 23, a Dearborn police officer shot Matthews multiple times, ending his life. Two days later, the coroner ruled his death a homicide.Since the shooting, police have made every attempt to make it appear that Matthews was a hardened criminal. During an interview with the press, Detroit Police Chief James Craig claimed that Matthews had  a crime problem. During an interview with WXYZ, Police Chief Craig also called him a  chronic problem in this area. In case we need more proof that cops believe they have a right to act as judge, jury and executioner, police have repeatedly stated that Matthews committed larceny earlier in the day. Note that the words  accused of larceny  or  suspected of larceny  aren t used in association with this officer-involved shooting. Instead, with their words, Detroit and Dearborn police make it clear that they ve assumed the role of the courts; trying, convicting and sentencing Matthews all on their own, without the aid of a bothersome justice system.Police have not provided any evidence that a larceny took place, or that Matthews was implicated as the suspect.Police state that Matthews was wanted on a misdemeanor probation violation, and that the officer recognized him from the earlier larceny.Voice of Detroit did a thorough records search and found that no such warrant exists.The search showed that the 35-year-old man had one misdemeanor conviction in 2013, and no other convictions.Dearborn police chief Ronald Haddad wants the public to know that he stands by the officer who shot Matthews. And in the very same sentence he said there will be a  full investigation  into the shooting. I stand behind the officer, and we re going to have a full investigation with Detroit police. It should go without saying that an impartial investigation cannot begin with a biased premise.Many details about what happened that day are not available. It appears that an unidentified Dearborn police officer spotted Matthews walking on the sidewalk at the border of Detroit and Dearborn. The Dearborn officer placed a call to dispatch stating that he was  approaching one on foot. Three minutes later the officer placed a  shots fired  call.It is clear that the officer crossed the boundary between Detroit and Dearborn to  approach  Matthews.They claim that Matthews fled on foot into a nearby backyard. Police also claim that a struggle ensued and that Matthews reached for the officers gun. This is why he was shot at least six times.According to family members, Matthews was disabled. Aside from being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, a recent car accident had left one of his arms virtually unusable. Voice of Detroit reports that a cast had just been removed from his arm, and that his fingers  remained clenched up. The officer, who is described as a white male with five years on the force, pursued Matthews out of his own jurisdiction, and away from the area where his vehicle s dashcam would record what took place. Police have not stated whether there is any video or audio evidence in this case.Social justice advocates are calling for an independent investigation into the shooting.Detroit police commissioner, Ricardo Moore, also called for an independent investigation into the shooting. Moore expressed concern about Police Chief Craig s statements to the press, criticizing him for  escalating tensions in the community,  rather than increasing public trust. Because of   Craig s biased statement against the deceased suspect, this situation would warrant an independent investigation from the Michigan State Police, solely. Craig should be trying to give the public trust in this investigation, as opposed to creating tension between the community and the police. Both Craig and Dearborn police chief Haddad have worked hard to demonize Matthews in the press. Although he has no felony criminal record, both the Detroit and Dearborn police chiefs want the public to believe that Matthews had a  crime problem. According to Reverend Charles Williams II, chair of the National Action Network (NAN) Matthews was both well-loved and well-respected in the community, in spite of the challenges he faced. He was one of those folks in the community who was definitely a respected person. Not only did they know him well, they knew his challenges well. Police officers on the Detroit side knew him also. When they saw him wandering, they would give him a ride to his mother s house. It is concerning to me that the officer claimed he felt threatened. Not only did Kevin have a broken arm, but he was a very small guy.

 Hero Activist Corners ‘Full Of Sh*t’ Ben Carson For Saying Homosexuality Is A Choice (VIDEO),"Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson was confronted by an LGBT activist on Monday evening about the retired neurosurgeon s previous remarks that gay people have made the choice to be gay   and luckily the awkward encounter was recorded on camera and posted by ABC News.Carson had been meeting with supporters at a town hall meeting in Staten Island. As he posed for pictures, a woman wearing a Pride Center of Staten Island t-shirt approached him and said she wanted to ask him a question. She said: I have a quick question. Do you think I chose to be gay? Carson was taken completely off guard and repeated her question back to her, avoiding a clear answer as many others looked on. He replied, Did you choose to be gay? That s a long conversation. Fully aware that the answer really wasn t that complicated, the activist walked away   but not before telling Carson, I think you re full of sh*t. You can watch the Carson squirm in the footage below:WATCH: @realBenCarson confronted at Staten Island town hall:  Do you think I chose to be gay?  https://t.co/gL3N7TXpO1  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 5, 2016Like many of his fellow Republicans, Carson s rhetoric is plagued by anti-gay remarks. Carson clearly expressed his stance on whether or not he felt homosexuality was a choice when he spoke to CNN s Chris Cuomo in March. Cuomo had asked Carson what his opinion was on the matter and Carson s unwavering response was: Absolutely. Because a lot of people who go into prison, go into prison straight, and when they come out they re gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question. Carson has said plenty of other equally ridiculous things about the LGBT community as well. In the past, he s likened homosexuals to pedophiles and those who engage in bestiality, and claimed that God thinks being gay is an  abomination.  And despite all his anti-LGBT comments and attempts to make sure that the LGBT community doesn t get the same rights as heterosexuals, Carson still has the nerve to say gay people are more protected than Christians.Featured image video screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Insane GOP Congressman WANTS The Mentally Ill To Have Guns (TWEET),"For years now, sane-minded individuals in Congress alongside President Obama have tried to enact common sense gun reform. And now, where those in Congress have failed to act, the president is doing what he can to tighten up existing gun laws and make sure those who shouldn t have guns don t get them.With Obama s bold actions to curb the epidemic of gun violence comes very open dissent from several members of Congress. They ve chosen to side with insanity and the gun lobby over common sense.One member of Congress, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) decided to opt so far away from common sense, that he tweeted this regarding President Obama s actions: Under Obama s executive gun-control action, your doctor may report you to the FBI. Under Obama's executive gun-control action, your doctor may report you to the FBI. https://t.co/MOEAmQdgDa  John Fleming (@RepFleming) January 5, 2016Now, any human being with even the slightest bit of common sense would agree that doctors better damn well be reporting mentally ill patients to the FBI.Furthermore, the disclosure to the FBI from doctors restricts any form of revealing what a diagnosis would be, so privacy is still protected while safety concerns still reached. Starting next month, no legal repercussions can effect the doctors doing their due diligence. The new rule states: The disclosure is restricted to limited demographic and certain other information needed for NICS purposes. Chief executive of the mental health rights advocate Mental Health America, Paul Gionfriddo, even stated: That could be a barn door opened quite wide if an administration really wanted to open it, and they didn t. The administration has taken great pain to try to clarify that there is very limited information that would be reported only within a very limited group. All of this begs the question, who would be against such measures? And clearly Rep. Fleming raised his hand in enthusiastic agreement that doctors should keep their mouths shut and the mentally ill should have easy access to firearms.This goes directly against the NRA and right-wing aphorism that it s not the gun, it s the person. However, if you re against keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, then you aren t following through with that logic, and now Rep. Fleming can forevermore be labeled a dangerous hypocrite.Thank goodness President Obama is in power and is taking action when Congress refuses to do their job. It is the job of those who represent us to act in our best interest. However, so many choose to act in the best interest of those lining their pockets with lobbying dollars, and in this case, it s the gun lobby.Shame on you, Rep. Fleming.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NRA Thugs Threaten Lawmakers With Bullets For Sponsoring Bill Limiting Purchase Of Ammo (IMAGE),"As President Obama rolls out executive orders to strengthen background checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, two New York lawmakers are being threatened by the NRA for introducing legislation to restrict the sale of ammunition.The bill would limit the amount of ammo a person can purchase over a 90-day stretch and would ban gun dealers from selling ammunition to people who are prohibited from buying guns.The NRA, of course, is not happy about the legislation sponsored by state Senator Roxanne Persaud and Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon.But rather than simply protest, the thugs over at the National Rifle Association decided to pull a Sarah Palin and make targets of the pair of Democrats.In a Twitter post by NRA publication  America s 1st Freedom,  pictures of both lawmakers are taped to a board as if someone is preparing to use their images for target practice. To make it even more threatening, bullets are scattered next to the pictures in what appears to be an attempt to incite gun violence against them. Underneath the image, the NRA whines that the measure is a  ridiculous anti-gun scheme. Here s a screenshot of the tweet.The image comes nearly five years to the day a congresswoman was forced to leave office after being attacked by a deranged shooter.As you ll recall, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was nearly assassinated by a gunman after Sarah Palin posted a map on Facebook with crosshair symbols denoting which lawmakers conservatives should target because of their support of gun control. The map, which still exists on Palin s Facebook page, served as a  hit list  and caused national outrage. Giffords survived despite being shot in the head, but the NRA seems to be hoping for a repeat.Persaud and Simon blasted the image as an attempt to intimidate and threaten them into bowing down to gun nuts. I think it is irresponsible in the times that we are living in to place a target around someone,  Persaud told the Daily News.  By placing someone s picture with bullets next to them, you are playing on the fears of people. The New York Daily News reports:Persaud said the picture has  the potential to cause harm  because you don t know if a psycho who is upset about the proposal will react to something like that.Simon slammed the tweet for inciting gun nuts, who have been sending threats to both lawmakers since they proposed the legislation last month. They are clearly trying to be intimidating and it is not working,  she said.The Daily News also reports that NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams condemned the tweet as well.Once again, the NRA is acting like the terrorist organization it has become over the years. Even a veiled threat against lawmakers is outrageous and should not be tolerated in this country. If a gun nut does end up taking a shot at Persaud or Simon, the blame should be placed squarely on the NRA.Featured Image: Raw Story",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Brought To Tears In Emotional Speech About Needing Smarter Gun Laws (VIDEO),"President Obama could not hold back the tears while discussing the excessive amount of lives lost over the years at the hands of guns during his press conference on Tuesday. In what is perhaps one of his most emotional speeches in recent memory, President Obama asked the nation to start having a  sense of urgency  to finally get rid of gun violence, once and for all.Now, every time the president speaks, the nation notices. This time, however, the president practically cried on live TV. It wasn t the type of crying a baby would do, but rather the sort of emotional embrace you would expect a strong leader to show talking about an issue as critical as this one.With that said, actions speak louder than words   and even tears. That is why the president not only gave a great speech but announced what his new executive actions on gun control would entail. The gun lobby might be holding Congress hostage right now but they cannot be holding America hostage. Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40%. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the internet with no background check, no questions asked. 1 in 30 people looking to buy guns from one website had a criminal record. This is not a plot to take away everybody s guns We can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. People are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do. No longer suffice. That s why we re here today.

 Restaurant Owner OBLITERATES Customer Who Said Woman’s Death Ruined Her New Year’s (IMAGES),"Working in the service industry can really be a test, as you will eventually and inevitably come in contact with an impossibly difficult, insensitive customer that makes you question your faith in humanity. And if you haven t worked in the service industry, this story about a customer named Holly Jones will give you a pretty good idea of what a complete nightmare of a customer looks like.For New Year s Eve, Jones visited Kilroy s Bar N Grill in Indianapolis, Indiana   an experience that left her less than satisfied. Jones said that she and her party s experience was  ruined  due to the fact that she had to witness a dead person be wheeled out from an overdose.  And of course, because of this  dead person,  her table didn t get the attention she felt entitled to. Jones was so upset, that she took to Kilroy s Facebook page to blast the restaurant for making her holiday celebration so awful. She wrote: I will never go back to this location for New Year s Eve!!! After the way we were treated when we spent 700+ and having our meal ruined by watching a dead person being wheeled out from an overdose my night has been ruined!!! Every year we have come to Kilroys to enjoy New Years Eve and tonight we were screamed at and had the manager walk away from use while (we) were trying to figure out our bill being messed up.The manager also told us someone dying was more important than us being there making us feel like our business didn t matter, but I guess allowing a Junkie in the building to overdose on your property is more important than paying customers who are spending a lot of money!! Our waitress when we were trying to ask about our bill being messed up also said  what do you want me to do (expletive) pay your bill for you?  What a great way to talk to a paying customer! I get that working on New Years Eve (is) stressful but being a complete (expletive) to us all night knowing you get an automatic gratuity is not right!!! Kilroy sJones  bad review is awful enough, but it was Kilroy s response that made this incident gain widespread media attention. Kilroy manager Chris Burton replied to Jones and kindly informed her that the  dead person  who was  wheeled out from an overdose  was actually a 70-year-old woman who had suffered a heart attack while she was also celebrating NYE with her family. For Jones  insensitive remarks, Chris offered some harsh words of his own in return. First of all, the  overdosing junkie  that you speak of was a 70-year-old woman who had a heart attack. Thankfully she was revived at the hospital and survived. It sounds like you were very concerned about her so I thought you should know. This poor lady, who was celebrating New Year s Eve with her husband and son, had to be placed on the floor of a completely packed bar and have her shirt removed in front of everyone so the paramedics could work on her. You can read Burton s full post in the screenshots below, as he closed his post with I m glad to hear you won t be coming back to Kilroy s because we wouldn t want anyone as cold-hearted and nasty as you returning. Kilroy sKilroy sAfter Burton masterfully put Jones in her place, the incident went viral. In another post, Kilroy s reported that the victim who suffered a heart attack was stable, but still had a long way to recover. The bar set up a GoFundMe page, allowing supporters to donate in support of her recovery. The goal of the page was $5,000, but the donations have exceeded twice that amount. If there was one good thing that came out of Jones  nasty attitude and review, it was this   as one donor pointed out: I wonder if the lady who was upset realizes that her negativity has been a major blessing to this family .her anger and the subsequent comment from Kilroy s has lead to people learning about this gofundme and supporting this family. You are almost at the amount you requested in 17 hours. Without that woman, this incident could have happened all too quietly.

 The Pathetic List Of Supplies The Oregon ‘Patriots’ Brought With Them To Last The Winter,"To the modern conservative  revolutionary,  the men dubbing themselves the Citizens For Constitutional Freedom   aka the morons who have laid siege to an abandoned building in the middle of nowhere   may appear to be a well-organized militia worthy of the name. To normal people, they are a group of radicalized right-wing extremists who have taken up arms against their government in the commission of a felony on taxpayer-owned land.Nothing could possibly prove this point more effectively than the statement made by Ammon Bundy himself that his movement would be there for years if necessary coupled with the desperate plea for snacks we heard Monday after only 3 days in the woods.That s not even close to the best part. The Bundy militia allowed The Guardian to photograph their  storeroom,  which looks more like a pile of stuff ready to be tossed in the trunk for a weekend camping trip:Courtesy of The GuardianRemember that this stash is not just supposed to keep the 12-15 people there fed during the revolt, but also provided sustenance for anyone who shows up armed and ready to die for no good reason. The Guardian did an actual inventory of the items in the room:It included a cardboard box of apples and oranges, a few dozen pots of instant ramen, 24 cans of chicken noodle soup, a similar number of cans of sweetcorn, peas, beans and chili, and 20 boxes of macaroni and cheese.There were also three sacks of potatoes, one bag of flour, another of rolled oats, boxes of raisins, a single bag of pretzels and one granola bar.Not very impressive. Fish and Wildlife Services, the agency that runs the wild bird reserve the militia is intent on giving to ranchers, miners and loggers, is planning on shutting down the power to the building, which will leave the criminal trespassers in the cold of the Oregon forest.They say they re prepared, but shutting the power down is just the first step. The FBI is reportedly working on its own plan to shut off any and all access to the outside world to flush out the armed insurrectionists.Hopefully, when the federal government does show up, the imbeciles will throw down their weapons and surrender. It s not like they have a lot of food to survive on.Featured image via The Guardian",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Good ‘Christian’ Bristol Palin Responds To ‘Babygate’ Accusation With EXTREME Profanity And Guns (IMAGES),"In case you haven t heard, there s a theory going around that Bristol Palin s baby was actually born in November. but the family held out on the announcement until Christmas Eve. With a pile of circumstantial evidence that leads to the conclusion that Bristol was impregnated during a Vegas romp with a known Alaskan  adult industry worker  on or around Valentine s Day 2015, The blog Right Wing Crooks broke a very compelling story.Bristol, good  Christian  spokesperson that she is, responded to her critics in a less than Christly way. Using her Instagram screen name,  bsmp2,  she first offered a denial, worded strongly enough that people would take notice:OK, well that solves that then, right? Wrong. If there is no truth to the story the Palins could avoid the internet shitstorm headed their way and comply with one request:Well now we sound like Donald Trump and the birthers of 2008, don t we? Not really, since nobody really cares when Bristol Palin had her baby or who the father is. Things like this are the left s form of divine justice. Every so often karma swings at people like the Palins who preach how much better they are because they love God and America, building fake reputations off of some purity that doesn t exist.Where Bristol is concerned, it s almost too much to handle. While pregnant with her second child out of wedlock she was defending her position as an abstinence counselor. To find out she got knocked up during a one night stand in Vegas wouldn t change any elections, it wouldn t alter the course of human history, and the Palins would still manage to somehow stay relevant because people love stupidity. It would, however, be absolutely hilarious, especially if the whole thing comes tumbling down over a piece of tape.Bristol has already had enough, not bothering to indulge the question or deny it further. She simply abandons her own decency with this:Whoa. Pretty strong. Is Bristol sending a message that she won t engage in questions about it all, or is this all a part of the ruse? Making it seem ludicrous and blowing it off would be much easier than releasing a birth certificate or time-stamped images.Since the story was released Bristol has had little to say. She has been posting, however. Is this maybe another message to people who would question the abstinence princess and her 2 illegitimate children? Let s hope not:Guns, guns and more guns! It seems like someone may be using all of the grains of powder at her disposal to deal with some anger issues.This is the legacy of Bristol Palin. Teenage girl who should have just hidden behind her couch during her idiotic mother s run for the Vice Presidency turned 25-year-old woman whose only accomplishment is a high placement on Dancing With The Stars that she didn t deserve.Nobody really cares, Bristol. If you had your baby to cover up slutty behavior just admit it. If not, then well   good for you.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trevor Noah Compares Texans Excited About Open Carry Law To Gay Pride Parade Celebrators (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah compared the excitement of the people of Texas over the new open-carry law to men celebrating their homosexuality at a gay pride parade. Texans already could carry hand guns but had to conceal their weapons. Now they could simply be open about it.He said: You see, gun lovers in Texas they just want to stop hiding who they really are. Although it is a little odd how as soon as people got this right they immediately went out into the streets. They were just running like yah! Ooh now I m gonna bring my gun everywhere! We re in the streets! Let s go shopping and at the laundry-mat and hey I m late at my shift at the coffee shop! He then went on to compare the excitement of gun owners over the new law to a gay pride parade: You know what, a little exuberance is fine but what made this weird for me is this is almost a little bit like when gay people first realized that society was starting to accept them for being openly gay and they immediately went out and started dancing on trucks dressed as giant penises, which on the one hand, is great. But after a certain point, we get it: you love giant penises. Texas expanded its open-carry laws to include handguns. Military rifles and other long guns have been legally openly carried for years.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives Invent Conspiracy Theory To Blame White Oregon Militia On A Black Guy (VIDEO),"Even the crankiest section of America s right wing is starting to sense that the armed take over of the Oregon refuge is creating some bad press for their movement. But instead of questioning the values that led them there, right-wing nut jobs have created a conspiracy theory that lays the blame at the feet of just one, liberal black man. President Obama.Leading conspiracy nut Alex Jones issued a YouTube rant on Monday, outlining his theory for who is really behind the Oregon attacks. According to Jones, federal plants funded by billionaire liberal George Soros and the Southern Poverty Law Center are manipulating events in Oregon in order to steal our guns. Ladies and gentlemen, don t let Obama be successful when it comes to starting civil unrest and riots in this country,  Jones said.  They will use that as a civil emergency to bring in a type of soft martial law. But Jones is not alone.Right Wing Watch reports that Mike Vanderboegh, the leader of the Three Percenters militia group, issued a blog post over the weekend which laid out a similar conspiracy theory to Jones. He argued that the militia group responsible for the armed takeover of a federal building in Oregon consists of federal provocateurs, sociopaths and idiots with a John Brown complex.   Vanderbough foresees an even darker end to the stand off than Jones though, claiming the militants have  written a check that they expect the rest of us to cash in our own blood in a ghastly civil war. However, despite his criticisms of the group, Vanderboegh states that he and his militia would have no choice but to join a civil war against the federal government and all agencies and individuals acting on its behalf.In short, a group of armed white men take launch a terror attack on U.S. soil, and blame any future fall out on a liberal black guy who favors more effective gun control.And every step of the way, the craven mainstream media is helping the militia group along. It is utterly breathtaking that African American s affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement have been branded  domestic terrorists for non-violent protests over police brutality, yet these white militia-men can seize a federal building, call any enforcement of law an act of civil war   and they are called  protesters. It is little wonder that these gun-wielding lunatics have such a sense of entitlement. They are able to flout the law and threaten extreme violence, while facing zero consequences. While 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot dead 2.5 seconds after cops found him playing with a toy gun, these men have been able to seize a building with the force of real arms and none suffered so much as a bruised ego. Something is wrong with this picture America.Feature image via CubsInsider",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Did You Spot The ‘Pants On Fire’ Moment In Trump’s First Campaign TV Ad? Politifact Did (VIDEO),"The Trump campaign is busy attempting to clean up the mess after Politifact exposed an incident of gross misrepresentation in its first TV ad.During the 30-second ad which was released Monday, a scene shows supposed migrants rushing through a national border while the voiceover states: He ll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for. The clear implication is that the viewer is watching Mexican migrants running across the U.S. border with zero controls or checks.  But  as PolitiFact discovered,  it s not   it s 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco. The fact checkers uncovered that the footage was first shown on Italian station RepubblikaTV on May 3 2014, and rather than showing Mexican migrants entering the U.S., actually shows: migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain. Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. The footage has been shared multiple times across various social media since that time. For example, one YouTube user posted the video in July this year. Again, no mention is made of the U.S. border. Trump scored himself a  pants on fire  rating for putting this nonsense on the air and attempting to mislead the American people as to the state of border security.However, Trump appeared unrepentant when he was called on to Bill O Reilly s show to explain his actions. He told the Fox host on Monday night: I think it s irrelevant. It s really merely a display of what a dumping ground is going to look like. And that s what our country is becoming very rapidly. Proving once again that he has all the personal integrity of a toddler with a cookie jar, the GOP front runner simply steps over his lie and moves on.Featured Image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Seth Meyers’ Hilarious And Convincing Argument About Trump’s Chances In The Primaries (VIDEO),"With the Republican primaries less then a month away, Donald Trump has started to spend millions on his campaign. While the billionaire can throw plenty of money at Trump-style racist and crazy television ads, he s already received lots of free media attention and leads in most polls. However, late night talk show host Seth Meyers isn t convinced. Myers said: But here s the thing about those polls: There s reason to think they might not really mean anything. One reason is that people hate talking to pollsters   the response rate has fallen from 90 percent to a dismal 8 percent, according to one study, which is a lower response rate than student-loan collector and mother-in-law. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zmnGlWjFWM]Meyers said that there s a correlation with Trump saying  outrageous and offensive things  and the media coverage he receives. The enormous attention he s getting  in combination with these polls makes it seems like Trump is the winning horse. But Meyers isn t buying it. Rudolph Giuliani had a three point lead for the Republican nomination and Howard Dean had a whopping 15 point lead and both went on to fade. For all of us very concerned folks out there that Trump has a shot at the presidency, here are more examples that give us hope that Trump will also fade.In 2007, Hillary Clinton was the clear front runner, polling ahead of John Kerry and John Edwards and she had a huge advantage over Barack Obama by 15 points from January all the way through June. In 2003, Joe Lieberman led in most polls of the Democratic primary but he lost to John Kerry.So, it all comes down to the people who go out and vote and not the polls that precede an election. In one of his speeches that Meyers broadcasts, Trump says,  If I don t win, I will consider this, and I mean it, a total and complete waste of time.  As Meyers said and as I m sure most of the readers out there also think, Trump,  you are not alone.

 Here’s Exactly What Would Happen To The Bundy Militia If They Were Black,"In 1972, a group called the  Christian Movement For Life  was founded by John Africa. Africa and his followers advocated a radical form of green politics, calling for a return to a more natural hunter-gatherer type existence while being opposed to things like scientific advancement and technology. Is this starting to sound similar to certain modern right-wing groups yet?Africa and his followers, who were almost exclusively African-American, eventually renamed their group to MOVE. The members established a commune in a house in West Philadelphia. They participated in demonstrations against institutions they opposed by using bullhorns and shouting out their opinions at all hours of the day or night.MOVE s activities drew the scrutiny of law enforcement over time. This culminated first in 1978 when a nearly year-long standoff with police who were ordering MOVE to leave their collective home ended in violence. MOVE members would not vacate so police decided to break into their home and force them to leave. When this happened, shooting started and a policeman was killed. MOVE claimed none of its own members shot the officer, as he was shot in the back of the head and was facing towards the house at the time. Seven other officers, five firefighters, three MOVE members, and three bystanders were injured also. As a result of the shooting, nine MOVE members were all sentenced to a maximum of 100 years in prison for third-degree murder over the officer s death.After the shooting and arrests, remaining MOVE members continued on and in 1981, they re-established their commune in a row house in West Philadelphia. After they settled in, they began the same bullhorn-aided protests they gained notoriety for previously. As before, they got onto local law enforcement s watch list.Neighbors began complaining about the protests and filed health complaints about piles of compost that the group kept on their property. Further pressure from police resulted in indictments of MOVE members for crimes like parole violation, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terrorist threats. Is this starting to sound even more like certain right-wing groups yet?Eventually, then-Mayor Wilson Goode classified MOVE as a terrorist organization.On May 13th, 1985 all hell broke loose. City manager Leo Brooks arrived with a sizeable police contingent in order to force the eviction of all MOVE members from their home, and arrest of indicted MOVE members. This quickly turned into an armed standoff with police, who began firing tear gas into the rowhomes. Gunfire began, with police returning fire with automatic weapons.This is the most insane part. Police Commissioner Sambor then ordered that the compound was to  be bombed while the MOVE members were still inside. A police helicopter dropped bombs on the roof of the house. Explosions and fires ensued that destroyed sixty-five nearby homes. Firefighters that were on scene stood idle and allowed the fire to continue burning the homes. The same firefighters were just earlier trying to flood the members out of the homes with their hoses.Below is a picture of the aftermath of the MOVE bombing and ensuing fires:MOVE bombing Photo: Phillymag One of the survivors, Ramona Africa, said that police were firing at those who were trying to escape the burning buildings. The firefighters were given orders by the police to allow the fire to continue burning. This allowed the fire to spread to adjacent homes and left two hundred and fifty people homeless. Eleven people (six adults, and five children) burned to death in the fire. Ramona Africa managed to escape the gunfire and flames by crawling out through a broken basement window, even though she suffered severe burns.A commission was quickly formed to investigate the police response, which denounced the actions of the city government, but did not press any criminal charges against anyone involved.Let s compare this, to the response of police and federal law enforcement to the Bundy Militia s armed seizure of a federal public building.Literally not one person from law enforcement is on the scene, as per Oregon Live:During Saturday s rally, not a police officer was visible. And so far law enforcement agencies have not approached the refuge or blocked access to the territory. The FBI is in charge because the refuge is federal property. The Harney County Sheriff s Office and the Oregon State Police are engaged as well.Source: Oregon LiveMOVE was living in their own private home, or homes at the time. Each time, the Bundys were occupying property that did not belong to them.MOVE was classified a terrorist organization. The Bundy militia has yet to receive this distinction after the same amount of incidents as MOVE had occurred.MOVE was ready to shoot, but cops went in anyway. The Bundys are ready to shoot, and the cops are afraid to move in because they didn t want to cause a scene.MOVE ended up in a standoff with cops twice, and violence and death were the results both times. The Bundys have been in a standoff with cops twice, and each time authorities are afraid to act against people literally pointing guns at them because of how it will look if they do.Let s face it. MOVE was mostly black. The Bundys are mostly   if not all   white. Militias seem to be the new pinnacle of the white privilege pyramid in America. How shameful for us all.Featured image via Phillymag",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Host Megyn Kelly Completely Embarrasses Traitorous Bundy Terrorist (VIDEO),"In an amazing take down of Cliven Bundy s terrorist spawn, Fox News host Megyn Kelly explained how the law works and gave the right-wing loon just enough rope to hang himself with on live television.During the Monday night edition of The Kelly File, Ammon Bundy appeared on the show to defend the armed takeover of a federal wildlife building in Oregon in protest of a pair of ranchers being sent to prison for setting fire to federal land.Bundy made an oft-repeated claim that the federal government has no legal authority under the Constitution to own land. As usual, Bundy is just another right-wing extremist who is totally wrong about the law.According to the Property Clause of the Constitution: The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. Politifact has also rated this claim as  pants on fire  in the past. As their final verdict states:The underlying legal argument rests on a tenuous interpretation of constitutional language and the rejection of about 125 years of Supreme Court decisions. The legal scholars we reached, regardless of any political leanings they might have, agreed that the Constitution clearly grants Washington the power to own land and that arguments to the contrary are baseless.Despite this, poor Megyn Kelly had to sit and listen as an ignorant fool tried to explain his argument to her. Keep in mind that Kelly is a trained attorney.Prior to letting Bundy embarrass himself, Kelly destroyed the idea that the prosecution of Dwight and Steven Hammond was illegal. The Hammonds set fire to federal land and a court of law found them guilty and they were sentenced to five years in prison. The United States Attorney General charged them for burning 139 acres of federal public land that the Hammonds had leased for grazing in order to cover up the illegal killing of several deer.The Hammonds appealed their case all the way to the Supreme Court and lost and surrendered themselves to authorities after denouncing Bundy s group of armed domestic terrorists. You know the argument on the other side,  Kelly said. These ranchers   who you support but are not directly involved [with]   had their day in court. They were found guilty, and it went all the way up to the US Supreme Court, which denied their appeal. Isn t that the way it s supposed to work in our country when it comes to the rule of law? Bundy dodged the question by trying to ask Kelly a question, which she refused to answer because she asks the questions on her show. And that led to Bundy bumbling his way through arguing that the federal government can t own land.Kelly then changed the topic to Bundy s brother Ryan and remarks he made to the Oregonian newspaper that he was prepared to  kill and be killed  for the cause. Well, Ammon Bundy walked that back in quite a hurry, suggesting that his band of gun-toting rednecks are just putting on an act. Well, I have a family. I have six children, a beautiful wife. I have a wonderful home. I have a business, several employees. I m not here to die. I m here to defend my freedoms and my liberties, and will I? Yes. But it s not going to come to that. Here s the video via Raw Story.In short, it appears the right-wing gun nuts are all talk and no walk. They were just hoping the federal government would react but the group has received nothing but ridicule from all sides. Even Ted Cruz is urging them to end the pathetic standoff. And after this on-air schooling by Megyn Kelly, it looks like the ridicule is only going to make these ammosexuals an even bigger punchline.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Tom Cotton Accepted $1 Million From Israel To Sabotage Iran Nuclear Deal,"How much money does it take for a foreign nation to buy a United States Senator? Just ask Republican Tom Cotton.For a lousy $1 million paycheck, Israel hired Cotton to lead an effort to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama Administration toiled for months to achieve.Bill Kristol s Emergency Committee for Israel donated to Cotton s senatorial campaign and not long after taking office, Cotton penned a letter signed by 47 of his colleagues to Iranian leaders in an attempt to get them to abandon the negotiations by warning that a Republican president will not honor any deal struck.His effort to sabotage important diplomatic negotiations even drew criticism from a former Army General who expressed disappointment because as a former veteran himself, Cotton should know better than to undermine the Commander-in-Chief.In July, Cotton continued his effort by comparing Secretary of State John Kerry and the Iran Deal to Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion of Jesus.Then Cotton openly made an oath to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a trip to Israel in which he pledged his allegiance to Israel and vowed to sabotage the Iran deal. Today s meeting only reaffirms my opposition to this deal,  Cotton announced.  I will stand with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel and work with my colleagues in Congress to stop this deal and to ensure that Israel has the means to defend itself against Iran and its terrorist surrogates. And this perfectly illustrates how Israel got Republicans to turn against their own country, and is fitting since a recent NSA leak has revealed that Israel did, indeed, bribe GOP members of Congress to rail against the Iran deal.As Addicting Info reported last week,A U.S. intelligence official who was involved in managing the NSA intercepts said Israel s communications with Republicans included such questions as:  How can we get your vote? What s it going to take?  What further denial of treason can be made by either Republicans or Israel at this point?Clearly, Israel successfully bought their new puppets considering Republicans crusaded against the deal for months. And the fact that America s broken campaign finance laws gave Israel the secret opportunity to donate to campaigns like Cotton s only makes Republican and Israeli treachery all the more credible.Cotton got a million dollars for his campaign from an Israel Super PAC and then went to work for his Israeli overlords to sabotage American foreign policy.Sometimes, it really is that simple.Featured Image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Worst Environmental Disaster Since The BP Oil Spill Is Happening And The Media Is IGNORING It,"One of the largest environmental disasters in American history is happening right now, and there is a great chance that you never heard of it thanks to corporate-owned media.There is a colossal leak of methane gas currently pouring out of the ground in Aliso Canyon, California, at an astonishing rate of 110,000 pounds per hour. The fallout is intense. 1700 homes in the area have been evacuated so far, prompting many lawsuits to be filed against the corporation that owns the faciliy.Southern California Gas Company is the entity that s responsible for the disaster, which began in October of 2015. A statement by SCGC in December said that stopping the leak would take at least 2 more months.Below you can see video footage of just how bad the leak is:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exfJ8VPQDTY&w=420&h=315]The severity of this can t understated. This single leak is accounting for 25 percent of the entire state s methane emissions, and has been classified as the worst environmental disaster since the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas as well, marking this as a signicant ecological threat.Anne Silva, spokesperson for SCGC, made the following statement: Our efforts to stop the flow of gas by pumping fluids directly down the well have not yet been successful, so we have shifted our focus to stopping the leak through a relief well.The relief well process is on schedule to be completed by late February or late March. Source: MotherboardThe part that is making it so difficult to deal with, is the fact that the well is 8,000 feet deep. This is preventing the normal disaster recovery method of plugging the leak with fluids from working, due to too much pressure coming up from underground. The hope is that the relief well will drain off some pressure from the main well, allowing the fluid plug to work as intended.If you thought this was the only methane leak in California, you were wrong. The reality is far worse.In Pasadena, 35 miles from the Aliso Canyon leak, investigators found a cluster of leaks at 4 miles or less from each other. Below is a map of them, courtesy of Earth Defense Fund:Image credit: EDFWhere the hell is the accountability for this? The map above should be a criminal offense.The story of Southern California Gas Company is a pretty damning one. EDF has found that more than 38 percent of the methane pipes that SCGC manages are more than 50 years old, and 16 percent are made from sub standard materials prone to leaks and corrosion. Over 150 million pounds of methane have been released by the leak so far, and that isn t counting the huge cluster of leaks shown above.Lets put this into perspective. If 1700 families had to evacuate a California town because of volcano suddenly springing up, it would be everywhere in the media. There would be a nightly obsession over it on cable news. Politicians on every level would be pledging to help, and doing everything they can to hasten relief efforts.If we had a terrorist act that caused 1700 people to have to evacuate an American town, we would already be invading multiple middle eastern countries that had nothing to do with it.Instead, we have 1700 people displaced by an ecological disaster caused by a corporation, and the media response is  What disaster?

 Obama Details 4 Actions He’s Doing NOW To Fight Gun Violence: NRA Rage Incoming (TWEETS),"President Obama isn t lying down and playing dead as the NRA and their congressional lackeys allow guns to proliferate across America at an alarming pace. In the first month of his last full year in office, President Obama is launching a new series of executive actions squarely aimed at cutting down the amount of victims of gun violence we see from coast to coast.The White House released a fact sheet detailing 4 immediate steps the President would be taking to try to break the back of the gun lobby.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will demand that businesses selling guns   at a store, a gun show, online, or out of the trunk of a car   get a license and conduct background checks before selling a weapon. The ATF will also work on a rule requiring background checks for sales of dangerous weapons through trusts, corporations or other legal entities.The FBI will also overhaul the background check system and hire 230 additional examiners and other staff to process applications.The 2017 budget will include funds for 200 new ATF investigators and agents to fight gun crime, while the ATF has established an investigation center to track guns sold over the internet used for crimes. A new ATF rule will push gun dealers to notify law enforcement officials if their guns are lost and stolen while in transit   something many probably assumed was a law already.After each mass shooting, Republicans often blame  mental health  treatment for the shooting   but then do nothing legislative to help families dealing with mental health issues. President Obama will propose $500 million in funding for increased access to mental health care.Additionally, the Social Security Administration and Department of Health and Human Services will issue new rules adding information about mental health conditions to background checks and removing barriers to states receiving information about the mental health problems for those trying to buy guns.President will direct the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology, including the availability of smart gun technology. That tech would help to prevent the  accidental  firing of weapons, seemingly no-brainer technology that many gun owners support, but which is opposed by the NRA.President Obama issued a series of tweets kicking off the administration s rollout of these executive actions.Each year, more than 30,000 American lives are cut short by guns   two-thirds coming from suicides. Too many Americans have lost loved ones.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016Guns now kill as many people as cars in almost half of the U.S. We can't stop every act of violence, but we can save lives if we act.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016Tomorrow, I'm taking action to reduce gun violence and save lives   protecting the Second Amendment and our kids. pic.twitter.com/vNqXEhaC9M  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016We will keep guns out of the wrong hands, enforce our guns laws, and ensure those with serious mental illnesses get treatment.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016What's often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners agree with commonsense steps to save lives.

 You Have To See Ammon Bundy’s Ridiculous Press Conference In Oregon (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy, the son of the secessionist rancher Cliven Bundy, held a rambling, incoherent press conference on Monday at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The 40-year-old Bundy rancher defended convicted ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond, even though the Hammonds don t really want help from the Bundy brothers. Hammond attorney W. Alan Schroeder told reporters,  Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond family. But off he went anyway: We have allowed our federal government to step outside the bounds of the Constitution. They have come down upon on the people,  Ammon Bundy said in a press conference Monday.  They are coming down into the state and taking over the land and the resources, putting the people into duress. Among other things, Bundy announced the name of his group: Citizens For Constitutional Freedom.Bundy also presented a  redress of grievances,  read by another member of his group. The grievances were endorsed by other militia groups, such as (we re not making these up) Oregon Bearded Bastards, the Oregon Oath Keepers and the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard. I know, I know. The  Oregon Bearded Bastards  sound like they could totally annihilate the U.S. government and its pawns in the military. Look out, Marines! (Meanwhile, the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard smartly used the word  guard  instead of the original suggestion,  Central Oregon Constitutional Klan  or  C.O.C.K.  The acronym would ve been problematic. #Joke)The big takeaway from the press conference is this: the Bundys are clearly milking their 15 minutes by piggybacking their ridiculous agenda onto the Hammond agenda. Together, it s one big dumb agenda, fueled by fantasies of 1776   as if there s any realistic chance that an armed conflict with the government wouldn t end with these posers in body bags.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Anti-Government Oregon Terrorist Took Thousands In Government Money,"One of the ringleaders of the terror-minded militia group who are illegally occupying a National Park service building got a six figure loan from the government   the same government that they accuse of being a despotic, criminal enterprise.Ammon Bundy, the son of rogue Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, heads the group and has been their front man in communication with the press. He already tasted the national standoff when his father refused to pay his bill to the Bureau of Land Management, even after using the government land for his personal enrichment.It turns out that despite the Bundy rhetoric about government and its supposed encroachment into their personal liberty, they were not above putting their hands out for some green.Ammon Bundy runs a Phoenix-based company called Valet Fleet Services LLC, which specializes in repairing and maintaining fleets of semitrucks throughout Arizona. On April 15, 2010 Tax Day, as it happens Bundy s business borrowed $530,000 through a Small Business Administration loan guarantee program. The available public record does not indicate what the loan was used for or whether it was repaid. The SBA website notes that this loan guarantee was issued under a program  to aid small businesses which are unable to obtain financing in the private credit marketplace.  The government estimated that this subsidy could cost taxpayers $22,419. Bundy did not respond to an email request for comment about the SBA loan.This is the same sort of mindset we ve seen for years and years on the mainstream right. Out of one side of the mouth comes words condemning the government, often attacking those who have sought help from the government   particularly ethnic minorities who dare to receive government support, even temporarily. From the other side of the mouth they are more than willing to build their personal fortunes on top of government help and assistance. Help for me, not for thee. They may as well be part of the Tea Party crowd demanding that the government take its hands off Medicare.Featured image via YouTube",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Anti-Government Terrorists Forgot Snacks, Want You To Send Via U.S. Mail","On Thursday Blaine Cooper, one of the anti-government terrorists who is participating in the armed takeover of a bird sanctuary in Oregon, put out a call for snacks on social media.According to the terrorist group, now known as Ya llQueda, the armed militants decided to seize the more than 100 year old wildlife refuge because it is a symbol of everything that is wrong in America, such as not being able to set fire to public lands, turn your freeloading cattle loose to feed off American taxpayers, or even ride your ATV through ancient archaeological sites, the way, according to Ammon Bundy  we used to could do. The Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1908. ATV s came on the market in the U.S. in the 1960 s. The stupidity of right wing extremism is timeless.In case you needed more proof that this is the dumbest armed takeover of a bird sanctuary EVER, the anti-government terrorists who told America that they plan to stay holed up inside the visitor s building of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge  for as long as it takes,  even  for years,  are asking people to send snacks.During a secretive press conference held on the second day of Ya llQueda s armed occupation of the federal wildlife refuge, Bundy told the press, We do have a plan and that plan is going to take several months to accomplish. What kind of idiotic plan involves living in the visitor s building of a wildlife sanctuary for  months,  even  years if necessary,  but does not also include packing snacks?Image credit: screen capture, Blaine Cooper, via Independent UKNot only is Ya llQueda already begging for snacks, but these admitted haters of the federal government would like you to send them snacks via the U.S. mail.You just cannot get any dumber than these people.(You might recognize self-proclaimed militia leader Blaine Cooper from this video, or even from the Bundy ranch fiasco, last year.)During the press conference on Saturday, Bundy referred to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, with its 320 bird species, as a  tool of tyranny. According to the official website, the Harney County Migratory Bird Festival is a major tourist attraction and a staple of the local economy. The festival draws visitors from all over the world, and reservations for bird-viewing tours fill up almost as soon as they become available.In Bundy s delusional mind he s a hero and a patriot setting an oppressed people free from bird tyranny. In the minds of the residents of Harney County, he s a lunatic.More than 50 percent of the residents of Harney County work for the government. As OPB reports here, the town has always had a collaborative, rather than an antagonistic relationship with the federal government. Signs posted throughout the town, reading  Go home militia,  make it clear enough that Bundy and his followers aren t wanted there.Bundy claims he s  giving the land back to the people.  Never mind that it s PUBLIC land, or that it already belongs to the people. Need we mention that Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was accessible to everyone right up until the day these assholes took it over, causing the government to have to close it down for public safety reasons?What these dipshits have a problem with is being asked to respect public land, and to help protect it for future generations. They want to be able to let their cows graze on it at the expense of other taxpayers. They want to be able to ride their ATV s through it and drive their pickup trucks over it (in other words exploit and destroy it) and who the hell cares about nesting birds anyways? They also want to be able to poach wildlife and burn down the forest if they feel like it, just like the two criminals they re trying so hard to turn into martyrs for their utterly stupid cause.If the government is smart, they ll send these idiots a dozen boxes of Ding Dong s laced with some hard core tranquilizers. Knock their dumb-asses out. Take away their guns. Let them wake up in jail where they belong. No-one gets hurt. The public gets its land back from these delusional lunatics. Bundy and the rest of the #Yeehawdists with him all get prison time and felony records, meaning they ll never be allowed to own guns or terrorize their fellow citizens again.Sounds like a good plan to me.Watch: Ryan Bundy, one of the leaders behind the terrorist takeover in Oregon, explains the Constitution and stuff on youtube.*Featured image credit: video screen capture, via Southern Nevada Watchdogs on youtube",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Clinton Reminds People Of Hillary’s LONG History Of Getting Things Done (VIDEO),"If there s one couple that Republicans love to attack, it s the Clintons. For decades, they have been under constant dubious scrutiny, more so than almost any other politician. Why? Because they have an incredible history of getting stuff done. Stuff their critics would rather not see be getting passed, and work they would rather not see being accomplished. If Republicans can successfully make a scandal of the Clintons to try to discredit all their accomplishments, that will help Republicans beat Hillary in 2016. It s political theater at its best and worst.Appearing on the campaign trail for this first time this election cycle in Nashua, New Hampshire, was former President Bill Clinton. If anyone can explain the exemplary work Hillary has done throughout her long career, it s Bill. And while many like to say Hillary changes her support with the wind of any popular idea, or copies other candidates, they clearly don t know the work she s done, and how she often set the precedent for not only knowing how to get the job done, but getting it done. This pattern of accomplishment began long before she even remotely thought about running for any sort of elected office.The former president explained that his wife was a minority as a woman among law students at Yale, and while she really could have done anything with her career, she decided to help children and the poor through her work with the Children s Defense Fund. He said: There she was at Yale Law School. She could have written her ticket to go anywhere she wanted all she was really interested in was providing legal services to poor people  She hadn t been elected to anything, but everything she touched became better. As TIME so perfectly summed up Clinton s remarks: He remembered that Hillary had helped found an early education program for immigrant children in Arkansas and that she has investigated the placement of African-American children in adult prisons in South Carolina.In another anecdote, Bill said that Hillary as First Lady worked on a bill to reform foster care policy in the late 1990s with Tom DeLay, then a leading Republican in the House of Representatives. This is all in addition to her later political work, like in helping get the Iran Deal passed, or her part in capturing and killing Osama bin Laden, or her countless hours mending relationships around the globe, all while keeping her cool under the most brutal fallacious condemnation.Clinton stated: I do not believe in my lifetime, anybody has run for this job at a moment of greater importance who was better qualified by knowledge, experience and temperament to do what needs to be done now. Her experience speaks volumes. Her calm under pressure is unmatched, and her ability to get people to come together to get the tough jobs done can be seen in the work she s accomplished.It s clear Bill is in this to win it for Hillary, and is focusing on what his wife has done instead of attacking opposition.It will be interesting to see what the rest of this fast approaching primary season will offer.

 Guns In Schools Advocate Slammed By BBC Host (AUDIO),"During an interview with a BBC Live Host, a Texas gun advocate defended his state s new gun law policies by saying that the only way to stop gun violence is to arm more people. C.J. Grisham, president of the gun advocacy group Open Carry Texas and a candidate for the state senate believes that law-abiding citizens should be able to access guns easily in order to counter those who have them illegally. He said: You can pass all the background checks you want, but a criminal gang member in Chicago isn t going to run a background check on another gang member. The host then interrupted Grisham and asked:  Sorry. How many of the mass college shootings were carried out by criminal gang members? Grisham responds,  Well they were all carried out by criminals, not licensed carriers. The host then asks,  So how did those people manage to access the weaponry that led to all of those deaths then? Illegally. That s what I m saying,  said Grisham.The host continues to drill Grisham by asking,  How do you tighten that up then?  Grisham s response is ridiculous: Well, you can t stop all crime. You tighten it up by getting rid of gun-free zones and allowing people to defend themselves no matter where they walk, no matter where they go, no matter where they study. So, just to be clear, C.J.  asked the host,  The solution is actually having more guns in circulation in America. Therefore, when a Columbine happens, a teacher can open fire in a classroom against the assailant. So, guns in classrooms? You advocate that? Well, there s already guns in classrooms. It s just that they re in the hands of criminals and the good guys can t defend themselves,  said Grisham.The guns used in the Columbine shooting were bought from an unlicensed private seller.  The guns: Were all purchased for them by Dylan Klebold s girlfriend, 18-year-old Columbine student Robyn Anderson, who accompanied the two 17-year-olds to the Tanner Gun Show outside Denver, shopping with their cash. She was what is called a straw purchaser, but it would not have been necessary, since youths were allowed to buy rifles and shotguns in Colorado and no background checks are necessary when guns are sold by individuals rather than federally-licensed gun dealers. President Obama is currently proposing laws that would crack down on that type of easy access.Grisham s logic is very flawed. His idea is that if a person is in possession of a gun, then that person is likely to be safer in an unsafe situation. However,  a gun is more likely to discharge accidentally in the home or be used by a family member against another family member rather than against an intruder. The reality is that the more guns are around, the more likely the gun will not be used  for self-defense against a criminal.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQKpAmC3ASk]Feature Image Via YouTube",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch These Students SHUT DOWN Fox Host For Mocking ‘Rape Hysteria’ And ‘Repeated Consent’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that conservatives believe with all of their hearts that serious, life-threatening issues that plague women every day of their lives aren t very important. So when Fox Business host John Stossel made a mockery of policies that have been put in place prevent rapes on college campuses over the weekend, he was shocked to find out that many people don t agree with his misogynistic jokes.The weekend segment was called  Campus Rape Hysteria,  and Stossel repeatedly argued throughout the program that there wasn t an epidemic and that any evidence related to sexual assault on campuses was debatable. Stossel also laughed at campus  initiatives that require men to have consent from a woman before and throughout a sexual experience. Stossel said: Colleges passed rules and some states passed laws that are supposed to protect women by defining the consent that s needed before a couple can have sex. California s law says  consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity. That means, I guess, a woman must repeatedly say,  Yes, please proceed.  I doubt many college students do that  but it is the law! To get his point across and show just  how crazy this could get, Stossel and his friends at Fox created a check-list-type form that mocked the consent process   except it wasn t received as well as he thought it would be.Fox News screenshotWhen Stossel showed his form to college students, most of them actually took the subject seriously   leaving the Fox host visibly disappointed that America s youth actually had morals and respect for women. He said: The kids must laugh at it. I can t believe anybody having sex gets repeated consent. Yet many students voiced the exact opposite. One male student said on the show, Something needs to be done. I m not sure this is the right way, but I think women need more protection.

 The Three Things The Oregon ‘Patriots’ REALLY Want That Nobody Is Talking About (VIDEO),"As soon as the news spread that there was some kind of a  takeover  of federal land combined with the name  Bundy,  ears across America perked up. However, this isn t Cliven Bundy himself but rather his son Ammon, who is just as stubborn   and since everyone seems to have missed it   extremely greedy.Greedy like his Daddy. In 2014, Cliven decided his cattle should get to graze for free and that the more than million dollars in fees he owed the US taxpayer was  tyranny.  Armed freaks from across the country showed up when BLM agents seized Bundy s cattle and pointed assault rifles at them until the cattle were returned and Bundy was left alone.The federal government allowed the cattle to be returned, but Bundy is far from out of the woods.Now son Ammon has started his very own revolution, breaking into a federal building located on a wildlife refuge in Oregon, a federally protected plot of land with the strictest of rules as far as fires, hunting, alcohol and stupidity go, four things the  patriots  who have moved in will certainly partake in.The episode started when a local rancher and his son were sentenced to federal prison for setting over 100 acres of public land on fire to cover up their poaching. After a protest of their incarceration, Bundy and company took the piece of forest and released a video recruiting more  Murikans, promising them food and a place to stay. Just bring your guns.At the beginning of that video, Bundy lays out three goals for the area, highlighting the kind of person he actually is. Bundy clearly says he s going to  protect  the people and bring back the ranchers, miners and loggers:When you cast aside all of the  I love my country  BS and the  we re here for the people  garbage, you ll see that Bundy and pals targeted a wildlife management area because the things they think they re going to start doing there are strictly forbidden.Ranchers aren t welcome to graze their thousands of head of cattle, because the land has been designated as a natural resource. It s a place where a natural ecosystem can actually survive without being decimated by cattle. Bundy would, of course, change that and with his intention to be there  for years  if necessary, you know he s thinking setting up a cattle operation might be a good idea.Miners aren t allowed to strip or tunnel, because it s been determined that the risk to the environment of that area is too great from the pollution mining inherently brings to streams and groundwater. You d think the ranchers would care about the heavy metal poisoning of their cattle, but for some reason they don t.Loggers aren t allowed to chop down the forest in an area like this for obvious reasons. Things live in trees, and in this area, this tiny protected little world of plants, animals, streams and ponds, living things are essential.The Bundy stance is about greed. It s about the mentality that just because you ve lived in a place a long time you have the right to destroy it. For private property that may be true; you may destroy your own property at will, but that land next door owned by the taxpayer? We have laws and such about that land. It isn t yours. These people have been mooching for free for so long off of the U.S. government   and therefore the taxpayer   that they would have no idea how to live on their own.Yes, these are the same people who call people getting food benefits  lazy.

 Tennessee GOP Lawmaker Offers To Fund Bundy Terrorists’ Armed Insurgency (SCREENSHOTS),"Most Republican lawmakers have remained silent with regard to the armed right-wing terrorist takeover of a federal building in Oregon   but not Tennessee state Rep. Andy Holt.Despite that this group of Yee-Hawdists made tear-filled  goodbye  videos in case they died in a shootout with the Army,  occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (or, as ABC said with plenty of sugarcoating, engaged in an  action  after a peaceful protest), and revealed that they are willing to die for their cause, all in pursuit of a political purpose through intimidation (protecting two convicted arsonists who don t want their help from prison and permanent occupation of the land)   the very definition of terrorism   we don t even see 1/100 of the police presence surrounding the staging area as we do at any peaceful protest against police brutality.Holt tweeted   and deleted   what appears to be an offer to provide material assistance to Vanilla ISIS.Holt compared the armed militia, which has promised a prolonged occupation and has vowed to  kill or be killed  with arsons that occurred at the same times as protests in Ferguson or Baltimore: While Holt takes a strong stance at any arson that occurs in the vicinity of an area in which African-Americans are standing up for their rights, he is perfectly willing to tolerate and even encourage an armed mob of white seditionists attempting to establish an inbred nation-state by force.The Tenth Amendment, of course, does not authorize a mob of right-wing terrorists to occupy anything, by force or not   nor does it give them permission to attempt to extort the federal government. However, as one Democrat, Chattanooga City Councilman Chris Anderson,  pointed out, Holt s offer to help the Bundy terrorists may constitute Treason.While Holt may think he understands the 10th Amendment, he doesn t quite grasp Article III of the Constitution, which states:Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.In fact, U.S.C.S 2383 covers insurrection quite nicely, as well:Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.Anderson has asked the Justice Department to investigate. Holt, of course, dismissed Anderson s concerns with the tried-and-true  Yeah, well you re gay  response:He says that he deleted his treasonous offer  so liberal loons will quit responding  but whines that  More liberal loons have responded since his offer to aid and abet terrorists began to circulate.  Get off Twitter & read the Constitution, kids,  he said, ironically.Perhaps Anderson is right that Holt   who offered to provide material assistance to a terrorist cell that has declared war on the federal government   should be investigated for treason.Featured image via screengrab/YouTube",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Celebrity Gun Nut Threatens To Shoot His Girlfriend, Gets Arrested With His Pants Down – Literally","A man known primarily for posting videos of himself making the sounds of different types of guns   yeah, apparently there is a market for that   was arrested after he threatened to shoot his underage girlfriend and then kill cops in a rampage. Just another day in gun crazy America!Bryan Silva, 25, has over two million followers on Facebook and Vine, where he thrills fellow gun lovers with short videos of his obsession with firearms.However he went from  good guy with a gun  to violent nutcase in a hurry. On January 4, Charlottesville, Virginia, police received a call from a distraught 17-year-old girl who said she had just escaped Silva s home after he held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her. She also told police that Silva was planning on killing cops.Police responded to a domestic dispute call around 6 a.m. Sunday at the home where the barricade situation occurred.According to police, the call was made by a neighbor. It was a domestic disturbance,  said Longo.  A female caller said that she was threatened with a firearm, we responded and began an investigation. Apparently, a 17-year-old girl had been at the residence when a dispute occurred. She then left go to the neighbor s house.The girl told police she had been held against her will by her boyfriend and that he had also threatened her with a handgun. She also told officers that he had threatened to shoot the police.Virginia is one of several Republican states that recently pushed to make it easier for people to have and carry guns. It seems to be working out well.The police surrounded Silva s house, and Silva took advantage of his infamy by   what else?   posting to his social media accounts about his siege with police and chatting with friends.But while Silva would have loved to posture himself as a gun-toting badass, things didn t work out that way. He eventually surrendered   and was promptly arrested with his pants falling to his ankles. In the ultimate bit of karma, the Vine  star  was immortalized in this hilarious Vine.I can't believe this vine of Bryan Silva being arrested with his pants down #Gratata https://t.co/iSwWXfWvg0  Ryan Broderick (@broderick) January 4, 2016It turns out that Silva was not legally allowed to have all those guns he was bragging about daily on social media. Silva was already a convicted felon. On top of the new charges of abduction, he was slapped with another felony, illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.His legions of gun nut fans will probably be disappointed, but the streets are probably much safer with Bryan Silva off of Vine and the streets.Feature image via Newsplex",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mark Zuckerberg’s PERFECT Facebook Comment To Grandmother Proves He’s A Badass Feminist,"There are seldom people in life that you can honestly say are solidly good people, but Mark Zuckerberg is one of those few that could fall into that category. Not because of his creation of Facebook, which in and of itself is extraordinary, but because of what he says and does. His actions, throughout his career, have spoken louder than words.From his $100 million donation to Newark, New Jersey schools, to giving $25 million in the fight against Ebola, to most recently saying this in a Facebook post to his new daughter:Now, in yet another Facebook post, Zuckerberg offered his New Years resolution which included reading two books a month, creating a Jarvis from  Iron Man  artificial butler for his own personal use, and exploring the future advancement of technology.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Every year, I take on a personal challenge to learn new things and grow outside my work at Facebook.

" Patriot Can’t Wait To Go Fight Gubmint With Oregon Militia, Just Needs Welfare Check First","You know that feeling when you want to overthrow the oppressive federal government, but you can t afford it until that same oppressive federal government sends you your disability check? This right-wing patriot sure does!Among the thousands (upon thousands) of delusional anti-government comments the Bundy Ranch Facebook page has gotten in support of their violent takeover of a Oregon wildlife refuge to protest the punishment of convicted arsonists comes this gem from a bona fide right-wing nut job, who is chomping at the bit to grab his gun and join the cause   if only he could afford it.You read that right, Daniel Brewer here can t spend the $300 he estimates he ll need to get to Oregon because the government hasn t sent him his disability check yet. Instead, he sends his  prayers  to the Oregon militia and instructs them to go down shooting in a firefight with law enforcement.First identified by blogger Jim Wright of Stonekettle.com, the comment perfectly illustrates the absurd delusional fantasy the anti-government extremists manage to live in. It may be fun to pretend you and your warm gun can take on the big bad government, but you like the benefits that same government gives you   in this case, a literal check every month so you can get by.This isn t the first time we ve seen right-wingers confused about just what exactly it is they hate about the government. During the ugly healthcare debate, one of the most embarrassing rallying cries coming from those who opposed Obamacare was that the government should  keep its hands out of medicare.  Medicare, you may remember, is a government healthcare plan. President Obama himself mocked the sheer idiocy of these anti-government government users. He recounted a baffling letter he had received from one concerned woman   no doubt told by Fox News that the government would ruin her health insurance   who pleaded with him to not pass the ACA: I got a letter the other day from a woman. She said,  I don t want government-run health care. I don t want socialized medicine. And don t touch my Medicare.' Yikes.Our hapless anti-government militia sympathizer is, unsurprisingly, a conspiracy enthusiast as well. Scattered among pictures of his family, Brewer s Facebook page features dozens of right-wing memes and articles suggesting Muslims are imposing Sharia Law in America (they re not) and calls for Obama to resign (he isn t).The conclusion we can draw from this is clear: Many of the people who say they hate the government wouldn t know what to do without it. They don t want to pay taxes (who does?) and they don t like being told they can t do everything they want, but they sure do love the services  gubmint  gives them.Feature image via SBNation",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Megyn Kelly Reveals The Creepy Way Donald Trump Tried To ‘Woo’ Her (IMAGE),"Donald Trump has singled out many people during his campaign, but none have remained a target in Trump s eyes and Twitter feed quite like Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.Trump s issue with Kelly exploded after the first Republican debate, when Kelly understandably called Trump out on his long-winded history of sexist, misogynistic comments toward women. Trump, being the abrasive a**hole that he is, blew the incident way out of proportion and continued to slam Kelly both on and off Twitter for weeks after the debate. Now Kelly is speaking out against Trump, claiming that the business mogul had actually tried to  woo  her in some incredibly creepy ways   which may have influenced why he was so bitter when she called him out.Vanity FairThis month Kelly graces the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, in which the 45-year-old journalist spoke about her interactions with The Donald at length. Kelly said that Trump used to send her press clippings that were signed  Donald Trump , and called her numerous times to tell her how much he enjoyed certain segments of her show (ironically, after the debate Trump criticized Kelly s show extensively). Kelly didn t think much of this at first, but when Trump announced he was going to run for president, Kelly said  it became more clear. But, Kelly said that Trump s efforts were completely futile. She said: I can t be wooed. I was never going to love him, and I was never going to hate him. I would have crawled over a pile of hot coals to make it to that debate. No one was going to be sitting in for me, reading my questions. And I can say with confidence that neither Bret nor Chris wanted to read my questions   for many reasons! Kelly revealed that her decision to focus on Trump s sexist remarks was because she knew Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton would zero in on them if they faced each other in the general election. Part of what Kelly said to Trump was: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about womens  looks. You once told a contestant on celebrity apprentice that it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton   who is likely to be the Democratic nominee   that you are a part of the war on women? It was one of the most reported moments from the debate, and Kelly received attacks from both Trump AND his loyal followers for holding him accountable. Trump lovers sent her death threats, called her a c t  and a  hag  on social media   even Trump s top deputy retweeted  gut her. Trump was especially immature about the situation, and he took his disdain for being confronted to new heights when he told CNN s Don Lemon that Kelly had  blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her   wherever.  Then, the Republican frontrunner threatened to boycott Fox and continued to diss Kelly for weeks after the debate   only further proving her point about Trump s misogyny.Featured image via Vanity Fair",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Wow: Did The Palins Lie About When Bristol’s Baby Was Born To Cover Up The Truth? (IMAGES),"Conspiracy theories aren t something I take seriously very often. The type of people who engage in conspiracy theories spend their time on Alex Jones  site talking about false flags and how mass shootings are a hoax. Fourteen years later, and they just can t admit that steel does in fact bend and melt and buildings fall down when you crash big planes into them.To be grouped with the crazies is inconceivable, but every so often something comes along that seems far-fetched   until you look closely. This particular theory is brought to you by the Blogspot Right Wing Crooks, who seem to have figured out how and why Bristol Palin s baby was born in November and not December like she claims.The entire story goes into great detail about individual Instagram, Facebook and Twitter posts, friends of the family and the supposed father and former fiance brought in to make it all neat and clean. In a nutshell, the theory is that Bristol Palin was impregnated in or around the time she was in Las Vegas last year complaining about  the night that ruined her life  a month before a Medal of Honor winner mysteriously appears to sweep her off her feet, propose and become an immediate fixture in all aspects of her public, private and online life.The timeline begins on Palin s Instagram on Valentines Day.  A selfie of her and an Alaskan prostitute adult industry worker dressed to impress for a night on the town appears with the caption  The night before the worst mistake of my life.  The picture is still there, but the caption, as reported by Right Wing Crooks, has been changed to #Vegas.If that was the night Bristol Palin was impregnated, a typical gestation period would bring her into early to mid-November for a due date. The fist picture of Bristol with her new daughter, Sailor, appeared on Christmas Eve:The Palins are notorious attention seekers. Up to this point, there was no mention of babies or deliveries or hospitals. All of a sudden, bam. There s Bristol, looking content with her daughter.Sarah hadn t posted at all either, but when she did there was a bit of a problem. When you post to Facebook your location is logged. Sarah Palin was somehow holding and loving on her brand new granddaughter in a Hospital in Parker, Alaska but posting to Facebook from New Orleans. Here is the actual post:https://www.facebook.com/sarahpalin/posts/10153836923483588Things got really fishy when a picture of Bristol and her little girl showed a piece of tape with an IV date on it. After enhancing, both Right Wing Crooks and Winning Democrats are convinced that the date most likely reads 11/4/15. November 4th, which by the Vegas pregnancy theory puts Sailor at exactly where she s supposed to be gestation-wise.Here are the pictures with enhancements:Right Wing CrooksThe theory is simple. To keep Bristol from looking like she got knocked up during a one night stand, a plan was formulated to move the birth. Bristol took pictures along the way, posting them a month or two in advance. If yopu check out her Instagram account, you ll see that at 32 weeks (according to her) pregnant she looked pretty along:32 weeks with my babe girl ?   A photo posted by Bristol Palin (@bsmp2) on Oct 29, 2015 at 10:36pm PDTThat from October 29th to this on Thanksgiving, an entire month later? And what s with the Christmas tree? It s almost like the whole thing is just staged:Happy Thanksgiving ? .. thankful for my babies  A photo posted by Bristol Palin (@bsmp2) on Nov 26, 2015 at 12:03pm PSTHow far-fetched is it really? You would simply have to consider what Sarah and the Palins would do to keep Bristol safe from the career (doing whatever it is she does) ending publicity of a one-night stand Vegas baby. Already her position as an abstinence counselor makes absolutely no sense, so that s kind of a wash, but with the Duggaresque hypocrisy of Bristol being a faith blogger on Patheos and possibly a future  where are they now  Dancing With The Stars special guest, the concept of changing a couple of months for a clean(er) slate may have been just that appealing.Did she fake the birth of her daughter nearly two months after it happened? According to Right Wing Crooks there are a slew of other tidbits that add to their theory:That is all admittedly very compelling stuff. It is also very circumstantial. If it turns out to be true it will go down as a not-so-well-planned scandal from America s first family of fools. If it s not true, well shame on the Palins for having an existence that makes it seem plausible.Featured image via Instagram",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Scalia Admits He’s Never Read The Constitution, Says Government Can Endorse Religion","It s clear as day in the First Amendment, but Justice Antonin Scalia apparently has never read it or he is blatantly ignoring it. Either way, such idiocy does not belong on the Supreme Court.The Establishment Clause of the Constitution states: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof This means that the government cannot support one religion over another , and nor can government promote religion over non-religion.But conservative Justice Scalia declared otherwise during a speech at a Catholic high school in Louisiana.According to the Associated Press,  Scalia said Saturday the idea of religious neutrality is not grounded in the country s constitutional traditions and that God has been good to the U.S. exactly because Americans honor him. To tell you the truth there is no place for that in our constitutional tradition,  Scalia claimed.  Where did that come from?  he asked.  To be sure, you can t favor one denomination over another but can t favor religion over non-religion? Scalia went on to claim that America has been successful because of God and argued that the government should honor the Christian deity, telling the students to not let anyone tell them otherwise. God has been very good to us. That we won the revolution was extraordinary. The Battle of Midway was extraordinary. I think one of the reasons God has been good to us is that we have done him honor. Unlike the other countries of the world that do not even invoke his name we do him honor. In presidential addresses, in Thanksgiving proclamations and in many other ways. There is nothing wrong with that and do not let anybody tell you that there is anything wrong with that. The Hill reports that Scalia also had words for Americans who support secularism. Don t cram it down the throats of an American people that has always honored God on the pretext that the Constitution requires it. This is a man who sits on the Supreme Court of the United States, yet he has a profound ignorance of one of the most important parts of the Constitution. The Founding Fathers added the Establishment Clause precisely because they did not want the government supporting religion in any way.Apparently, Scalia thinks he knows more about the Constitution than Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, both of whom wrote that the Establishment Clause erected a wall of separation between church and state. I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state.  ~Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, 1802 Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person s life, freedom of religion affects every individual. State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion. Erecting the  wall of separation between church and state,  therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society. We have solved   the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries.  ~Founding Father Thomas Jefferson: in a speech to the Virginia Baptists, 1808 The civil government functions with complete success by the total separation of the Church from the State.  ~Founding Father James Madison, 1819, Writings, 8:432, quoted from Gene Garman,  Essays In Addition to America s Real Religion Every new and successful example of a perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters is of importance.  ~Founding Father James Madison, letter, 1822Scalia is an embarrassment who should resign from the bench in disgrace. For someone who calls himself an originalist on the Court when it comes to interpreting the Constitution, it sure sounds like he has no idea what the Establishment Clause means even though it s pretty clearly worded and has been clearly explained by two Founding Fathers. If Scalia had his way, the United States would be declared a Christian state and Christianity would be forced down our throats every day despite the fact that such a thing is forbidden by the Constitution.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Happy 2016! Republicans Already Promise To Be F*cking Useless This Year,"Well that didn t take long at all did it? 2016 is only a few days old and already Republicans have vowed to do everything in their power to continue screwing America. Why? Because they re absolutely spineless and don t want to make the Tea Party mad. Seriously, that s the entire reason. One of the two major parties of the United States of America is so afraid of a tiny group of racist morons that they re willing to do or say ANYTHING to keep them happy.Speaker of the Mouse House Paul Ryan has already promised that Republicans are going to vote on repealing Obamacare again:Now it appears that Ryan earned the faint support of Congressional Republicans by promising to get back to the business of negation and legislative navel-gazing. This was evident in Ryan s statement about his plans for Congress in January: When we return in January, the House will put an ObamaCare repeal bill on the floor and pass it and put it on the president s desk We are going to keep working to give families relief from this law while we work to dismantle and replace it altogether. Yes, because millions of families that have never had health insurance before need relief from the burden of having health insurance. And someone please let me know when Republicans figure out exactly what the  replace  part of their big plan is.Salon s Sean Illing summed up the GOP s actions quite nicely when he pointed out that,  each of these votes, like the recent Benghazi hearing, was a masturbatory exercise in political theater.  In other words, Republicans are wasting the taxpayer s time and money for the sole purpose of creating anti-government Tea Party porn.Senate Republicans will be just as useless as Mitch McConnell has promised to keep persecuting refugees. Refugees, if you ll recall, are the Greatest Threat To America Of All Time  because 1 of them might someday do something bad. Meanwhile, a group of armed white Christian extremists have seized a federal building and are threatening to shoot government officials. But, you know, McConnell is worried about those wascally refugees fleeing war and violence.

 John Oliver Has Brilliant Advice For Breaking That New Year’s Resolution You Won’t Keep Anyway (VIDEO),"It s a new year. For many of us, that means that we probably made a few resolutions. You know   quit smoking, eat better, drink less, get more sleep   all good things that could improve life. There s just one problem, though: most people don t keep those resolutions. They go right out the window before the first month of the new year is even over for most people. Well, John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight has some advice in that arena: You re going to break these resolutions anyway, so quit being so hard on yourself.Oliver said: Every December, for some reason, we decide that next year will be the one that everything turns around and we ll finally quit drinking, or learn how to pronounce the name of these berries.  He then continued: But let s be honest, we re a few days into the new year now, and if you haven t broken your New Year s resolutions yet, statistically you are about to. That can be depressing. But don t panic, all hope is not lost. Because the key thing with resolutions is not how to keep them   it s how to revise them once you ve failed. The main problem with New Year s resolutions is that we set our expectations way too high. For instance, lots of people say they want to exercise more   but that s hard. Exercise is like reading for your muscles. Except you can t watch a movie of someone else exercising and basically get the gist of it. He s right. Humans are set in our ways. Small changes are better than big ones, because they are easier to stick to. You re not going to change your whole life just because a new year rolls in, and that really is okay.Watch Oliver s hilarious  yet completely accurate   thoughts on New Year s resolutions below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" FBI FINALLY Does Its Job, Starts Monitoring Oregon Militia Terrorists","Some of America s pretend patriots have taken over the federal building of a wildlife reserve in Oregon. Over the weekend as the internet and news organizations were abuzz with news of this outrageous and illegal activity, one entity was suspiciously and conspicuously missing from the equation: The federal government. Yes, you read that right. At first, the government had absolutely no plans to take action against these people. Why? Because they are white Christians. That really is it. Look at how, in stark contrast, they treat Black Lives Matter protesters, or think of how this situation would have played out if these people had been brown Muslims instead.Well, finally, the government has decided to do its job. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now monitoring the situation with the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation by self proclaimed militia members and supposed defenders of the Constitution, which they have clearly not read and understood. If they had, they would not be doing this at all.The occupation is taking place in Harney County, where the sheriff there, David. M. Ward, has told his law abiding citizens to avoid the situation. While the militia members claim to be there defending local ranchers, Ward says that the group s intent is something much more sinister: These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives, to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States. As per usual with such people, known anti-government extremist Jon Ritzheimer has warned authorities that the group is armed: Yes, there are some people that are armed. We need to defend our rights. That s what the Second Amendment is there for, people. Senator Ron Wyden (D- Oregon), who has been in touch with the local authorities on this ongoing situation, says that the FBI is definitely monitoring things: The FBI is on this every minute. But based on comments from what we ve heard in the community and what s been reported, we may be in just the early stages of this. Indeed. These are right-wing nuts, some of whom have already said that they are prepared to die here. They won t give up easily.This is nothing more than bona fide domestic terrorism. Arrest them. All of them. They really need to be made to realize that they are not above the law.Americans seem to be so worried about terrorism. Well, we re growing it right here at home   and we aren t doing anything about it. And that s the problem.Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Paul Krugman: Obama Rolled Back RONALD REAGAN’S Tax Cuts For The Rich,"Paul Krugman, by his own admission, has been drooling over the release of the IRS s 2013 tax tables. If you re still awake after reading that sentence, congratulations! You have the stamina of a bull! But seriously, while tax codes and forms and statistics and charts and zzzzzzzz .. may be boring as all hell to you and me, they re still useful. Specifically, they re useful in determining the impact of Obama s Nazi Socialist Commie Homosexual Muslim Agenda  on America.And no matter how  disappointed  you are that Obama did not turn the United States into Utopia, he still managed to do something amazing:According to the new tables, the average income tax rate for 99 percent of Americans barely changed from 2012 to 2013, but the tax rate for the top 1 percent rose by more than four percentage points. The tax rise was even bigger for very high incomes: 6.5 percentage points for the top 0.01 percent.And what does that mean? It means Obama, that terrible, terrible disappointment that supposedly only serves his corporate masters took a large bite out of Reganomics:But the available numbers are consistent with Congressional Budget Office projections of the effects of the 2013 tax increases   projections which said that the effective federal tax rate on the 1 percent would rise roughly back to its pre-Reagan level. No, really: for top incomes, Mr. Obama has effectively rolled back not just the Bush tax cuts but Ronald Reagan s as well.Any economist not working for a billionaire s think tank will tell you in no uncertain terms that Reagan s (and Bush s) claims were total bullshit. Giving more money to the rich does not improve the economy, it only makes the rich richer and hurts everyone else. Since the 80s, we ve handed billions every year to the rich and they took that money and invested it in buying politicians and factories in other countries. Now we have definitive proof, in the form of the strongest job growth since the Dot Com bubble of the 90s, that taking those tax cuts away will not hurt the economy in any way whatsoever.Thanks, Obama!Featured image via Business Insider",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 A Chick-Fil-A Got Shut Down In NYC Over Flies In Food – Conservatives Claim Religious Persecution,"NYC s only Chick-Fil-A restaurant got shut down on Dec 30th after appalling sanitary and food safety violations were discovered in not one   but two back-to-back health inspections. Rather than thanking God for sending an inspector, preventing them from contracting various fun diseases, conservatives are flipping out over not getting enough fly waste and food=borne illness in their daily diet.Below are some images provided by one twitter user regarding the closure. The list in red is the specific violations and total violation points.No line outside Chick-fil-A in NYC. Sign says closed for maintenance. Some violations online, no reason for closure pic.twitter.com/1lnuOonvXG  Candice Choi (@candicechoi) January 3, 2016There were literally flies in and around the food to a point where a health inspector said the place had to stop serving food immediately. Gross, right?The flies must be a false flag for the liberal war on Christian anti-gay chicken sandwiches. Rather than adopting the  personal responsibility  attitude that conservatives love, and blaming the restaurant for not being more vigilant in the cleanliness of their facility, they started firing off accusations of it being a liberal plot and anti-religion operation.@TwitchyTeam  war on religion  Dave Rowan (@DaveRowan07) January 3, 2016@crispayumo @TwitchyTeam @ChickfilA BULLSHIT I WAS JUST THERE 2 days ago THE MAYOR HATES THE PLACE VERY CLEAN APPEARANC CORPORATE SHOW PLACE  Chuck W Self (@MustacheChuck) January 3, 2016@TwitchyTeam sounds like the liberals will go to any length to close down a Christian co.

" Donald Trump’s First Campaign TV Ad Is Here, And It’s Worse Than We Imagined (VIDEO)","While an armed militia group of domestic terrorists seize and occupy a federal building by force, GOP Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has released his first campaign TV ad. It s worse than we imagined.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. In this small catchphrase lay a few assumptions. Firstly, that America is not great now. Secondly, that it ever was great. Thirdly, all the assumptions around what exactly is wrong, and what would restore the nation to greatness.Let s pretend for a moment that the first and the second assumptions are true. It is certainly ground that liberals and conservatives might share. That is what is so enticing about the statement, but when progressives list the greatest issues facing America, they often come up with things like:But if you were hoping optimistically that any of these issue were going to be addressed in Trump s campaign ad   you ll be bitterly disappointed. What three things will Donald Trump do to make America great again?The eagle-eyed amongst you will note, none of these three things in any way relates to the major issues facing America in the coming decade and century.Where are our next great engineers, inventors and scientists going to come from when we have the worst education system in the developed world? If we aren t growing them at home, and we can t import them due to immigration bans, how on earth is America going to be great in these fields?It is not only that Trump and the GOP do not have the answers to the biggest questions of our age, it s that they aren t even asking those questions. Trump doesn t want to make America great again, he wants to make America white again. He is speaking only to the frightened, white folks of the land who genuinely believe anybody other than rich white people (lawmakers, business leaders and presidents past) are responsible for the decline of the nation.As Hillary Clinton put it in New Hampshire this week: You can t make America great again if you insult and demean the people of America.

 Nobody In Oregon Seems To Want The Bundy Militia There,"After going to all the trouble of leaving their bunkers that are stocked with toilet paper and bullets, the Bundy militia arrived in Oregon just to be told to go the hell home by the locals.Both the Hammond family who are at the center of this ruckus and local residents alike are critical of the Bundys  idiot militia being in their town. A lawyer for the Hammond family released a statement on the situation saying,  Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond Family. Koin.com reports that even though some locals did march with the protesters, many others felt the out-of-towners should just leave them to deal with their own problems without interfering:While some locals did march with the protesters, others felt it was too much. Some posted signs to protest the protesters. I want them to go home,  resident Bee Bee Sitz said.  We take care of ourselves. Another resident, Kainan Jordan, said,  I don t think all of these outsiders coming here is necessary. I think they intimidate the local people. Source: koin.comOne protest organizer, Pete Santilli, is a right-wing internet radio hack and current resident on the terrorist watch list. Santilli doesn t even appear to be a resident of the state of Oregon. His website shows that he broadcasts his internet radio show from Ohio. The Bundy boys are not residents of Oregon, either. This entire operation seems to be an uninvited patriot telethon requesting  donations  so the masterminds of this fiasco can play soldier instead of getting a real job.People can t even send their children to school because they are closed all week due to the militia presence.

Les Zaitz (@LesZaitz) January 3, 2016The irony of the situation is that the militia has become the very thing they claim the federal government to be   an outside non-authoritative entity trying to force their own rules onto how the local people deal with their land.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH The Hilarious ‘Goodbye’ Video Posted By One Of Oregon’s Militia Terrorists (VIDEO),"Thus far, the Oregon militia members who have occupied the federal building of a wildlife reserve are facing absolutely no threat of action being taken against them by government officials. Nonetheless, at least one of them has admitted that  he actually went to join these domestic terrorists with the intention of dying in a standoff, and subsequent statements and actions have shown that the others are likely thinking along those same lines. For instance, at least one of the militiamen has actually taken the time to film and upload a goodbye video to his family and other loved ones. While the videos are serious and tearful to the right-wing loons, they are nothing short of hilarious to those of us who aren t completely insane. Here is the one from known domestic terrorist and Muslim hater Jon Ritzheimer: Honestly, if this loon cared about his children that much, he d realize that missing the entire holiday season for this nonsense is doing them a tremendous disservice. All in the name of  what? Wanting to be above the law? Wanting to die as some kind of  free man?  I don t think that means what he thinks it means.Take your meds and go home, Mr. Ritzheimer. Even if you don t die there, you ll likely spend a lengthy stretch of time in federal prison for these ridiculous antics. Either way, your children need you home, not out terrorizing and occupying government facilities. If you knew anything about being a good father, you d know that. Then again, those kids would be better off not being raised by such a loon anyway. Good luck to them, they ll need it.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Why The NRA Could Be In Big Trouble For Breaking Federal Law,"The National Rifle Association may be in violation of federal law, according to documents the NRA itself filed with the Internal Revenue Service.While the NRA often refers to itself as a membership organization with millions of members that contribute to its operations, they said something completely different on their tax forms.The NRA, which was founded in New York in 1871 and claims to have millions of members, even told the IRS it didn t receive membership dues, thus enabling it to avoid disclosing more about its activities. Last year, it spent $345 million.At the same time as this deceptive practice reportedly occurred the NRA also conveniently disappeared the existence of its political slush fund, the Political Victory Fund, the PAC the organization uses to target any and all politicians attempting to reduce gun violence, including President Obama.The forms the NRA signed omitting the existence of its PAC and membership status state that they must be truthfully signed under  penalties of perjury.  The NRA also ignored the box requiring that it disclose whether it engaged in lobbying   despite the NRA often flooding congressional offices with lobbyists seeking to flood neighborhoods with guns and ammunition. How that form wasn t intended to mislead the IRS, I don t know. I don t know how you come to any other conclusion,  said lawyer Marcus Owens, a former IRS official and leading expert on non-profit tax law.Unbelievably, the NRA told the IRS it hadn t spent any money on lobbying between 2008 and 2014. But the Manchin-Toomey gun bill, which the NRA opposed, came up in the U.S. Senate in 2013 in the months after the Sandy Hook gun massacre.Then when news organizations began pointing out these possibly illegal discrepancies, the NRA suddenly began adding information about its donation and lobbying efforts on its 2014 returns.According to the New York Post, NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman s office hasn t commented on whether the NRA is being investigated for its incomplete filings with the federal government. Schneiderman received widespread coverage for going after fantasy football providers Draft Kings and Fanduel, if he began criminally looking into the NRA it would create huge shockwaves across the world of politics.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oregon Right-Wing Terrorist Makes CHILLING Confession: ‘I Came Here To Die’ (SCREENSHOTS),"If anyone questions whether or not the Bundy-led right-wing terrorists who violently took over  a federal building in Oregon are actually violent terrorists, they need only ask Capt. Moroni,  one of the reported more than 100 armed men who seized control of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge over the weekend. Bundy s people demand nothing short of  complete surrender  of the land to the conservative terrorist cell, a move they allegedly made in support of two felons and arsonists who don t want their brand of  help. While some   like ABC and CNN   seek to downplay this  action,  the rest of us see it for what it is: the Stupid Part of America has finally mobilized its  militia  and is willing to  kill or be killed  to achieve their goals. Though early estimates have said 100 to 150 men were holding down the newly-established terrorist base, OPB s Amanda Peacher says that only a few dozen men are occupying the federal building. According to Peacher, federal employees were warned to steer clear of the wildlife refuge in a memo that reads: Our top concern is employee safety. All employees are accounted for, and the Refuge will be closed until further notice. Employees of all land management agencies in the area will operate from alternate worksites, telework, or administrative leave. No matter how many people are there, one man to whom Peacher spoke revealed that not only are the insurrectionists willing to use violence to accomplish their goals   but they are ready and willing to die in the process. A man who would identify himself only as  Capt. Moroni  told Peacher I didn t come here to shoot, I came here to die.  A series of tweets from Peacher detailed not only the chilling admission, but showed that the Bundy Army is already establishing supply lines to fuel their mini-revolution:          Since an unarmed demonstration by African-American protesters over the unjust killing of one or more black men attracts a heavily-armed force, surely law enforcement is responding heavily to this very real terrorist threat. There were no law enforcement agents visible in the area around the refuge. A man with a goatee beard and wraparound sunglasses stood guard, armed with an AR-15-style rifle, and refused entry to the federally owned facility,  writes The Guardian s Jason Wilson. One of the occupiers, who  declined to give his name or affiliation, citing  operational security,  confirmed that the heavily-armed men  would be camping on the site  because it s  public land  and they view themselves to be  The People. It s time we stop coddling right-wing extremists. If they want a war, let s give them one. It will be short-lived.Featured image via Twitter ",News,"January 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Shuts Down GOP Lawmaker Rudely Heckling Her At Town Hall Event (VIDEO),"A Republican lawmaker in New Hampshire showed up to one of Hillary Clinton s town hall events in the state on Sunday and apparently thought it would be smart to heckle Mrs. Clinton. Bad idea. Not only did it not work out as planned, but the former Secretary of State called out the state representative in front of everyone. You are very rude, and I m not ever going to call on you. Thank you. The comment earned Mrs. Clinton an enormous round of applause, as the heckler just stood there continuing to point her finger at Hillary while waving her hands like a crazy person. It s these kinds of tactics that don t go over so well. Perhaps there s a better way to get your message across?So, what exactly was Katherine Prudhomme O Brien, the GOP state representative from Rockingham, trying to say? She followed up with a reporter after the event and was mad that Hillary didn t want to talk about Bill Clinton s past marital infidelities from decades ago. Really? That s what was so important? I asked her how in the world she can say that Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Wiley are lying when she has no idea who Juanita Broderick is. She told me this summer she doesn t know who she is and doesn t want to know who she is. How can she access that they are lying, which she told someone last month? Expect for more below-the-belt tactics like these now that Bill Clinton is set to make his first appearance on the campaign trail starting on Monday. Republicans are looking for any and every chance to use Bill s past indiscretions against Hillary. It s the kind of dirty campaign tactics that people claim cause them to hate politics, yet somehow they still get the most attention.With that said, Bernie Sanders, unlike Republicans, doesn t intend on bringing up Bill Clinton s sexual past anytime soon: No, I think we ve got more important things to worry about in this country than Bill Clinton s sex life.

 Texas Governor Directs Violent Threat At President Obama On Twitter (TWEET),"The lack of respect for the office of the President of the United States from Republicans is utterly appalling. No matter who the president is, or how much you disagree with their policy proposals or how they conduct business, you respect the office. You don t have the respect the person, but you respect the role they play as the leader of the nation. However, Republicans seem to have forgotten this unwritten rule, especially under the presidency of Barack Obama. Their utter disrespect borders on utter impudence.For the last seven years we ve even had members of the right-wing say that President Obama wasn t born in the United States. It s as if they don t consider him valid as a president, so they don t need to offer him the respect and dignity the office of the presidency so rightly deserves.Yet another example of this insolence can be found in a recent tweet by the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott.Abbott, upset that President Obama wants to curb the epidemic of gun violence after mass shootings have become all too common in occurrence, decided that he would directly threaten the president.What did the president say that got Abbott s Underoos in a bunch? A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I ll meet with our attorney general, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options Because I get too many letters from parents, and teachers, and kids to sit around and do nothing. I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen; who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms; and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale. You know, because God forbid we, as a nation, care enough to curb the epidemic of gun violence.However, Abbott takes it personally, and pandering to his base of voters and the right-wing lunatics who feel they should be able to own their personal arsenal to cater to their paranoia, he tweets this at President Obama:Obama wants to impose more gun control. My response.#? COME & TAKE IT @NRA #tcot #PJNET https://t.co/RUPbcev5jY pic.twitter.com/8VNwisj966  Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) January 1, 2016And, of course, this tween is also directed at the NRA, because Abbott feels the need to whine like the immature child that he presents himself to be, and needs them to help him fight his selfish battles.What Abbott, and all the other right-wing loons need to realize is, when you say,  COME AND TAKE IT  to the president of the United States with a picture of a gun or cannon, as the case may be, you are threatening the President of the United States.  Come and take it  implies you are willing to kill to have your way. You take your argument of clear dissent to that of a direct threat of violence against the president for wanting to impose policy you disagree with.Abbott also needs to realize that Texas is only a state, not its own nation, and they are to abide by the laws of the United States, and any action taken by President Obama. Otherwise, they are in clear violation of the U.S. Constitution.These words from Abbott need to be called what they are   a threat, and Abbott needs to held accountable. As the governor of one of the largest states in the U.S. he should have a little more maturity than this, act like an adult, and apologize. You don t have to agree with the president, but you need to respect the office.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"January 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Why Is The ‘Y’all Qaeda’ Militia Being Mostly Ignored By Law Enforcement?,"They re calling them  Y all Qaeda.  It s all at once appropriate and ridiculous. The fact that a group of armed traitors are occupying a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge shouldn t be treated as a cute internet meme, but there it is.Rather, this is serious business made more serious by the infuriating reality that local law enforcement appears to be allowing it to happen without much interference.According to The Oregonian, police officers were nowhere to be found during the Saturday rally at the site which led to several members seizing the headquarters at the refuge. Furthermore, law enforcement hasn t revealed its plans   if any   to repel the militia from the government land. And now that Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada secessionist ranched Cliven Bundy, has taken over as the leader of the occupation, the militiamen are sure to be joined by more attention-seeking seditionists.But going back to the lack of law enforcement presence. Do we really need to underscore the lopsided injustice here? Do we really need to emphasize the fact that if this had been Black Lives Matter activists or, hell, Islamic terrorists, how the facility would ve been surrounded and the situation greeted with law enforcement gunfire. If just one African-American gunman has stepped foot into the building, recent history and more than enough video footage has proved that the black gunman would ve been decimated in an onslaught of police gunfire. Full stop.Instead, a group of secessionist weekend warriors with enough disposable income to play military dress-em-up are being allowed to seize government property   taxpayer-owned land and facilities   in an effort to exert their independence from the rest of the nation, law enforcement appears to be completely blas  about it. Why? The answer should be obvious.So, what next? If these bastards want a fight, and if they want to die for their stupid cause, give it to them. They ve seized our land. Mine. Yours. It s time to stop dicking around and show them they re not above the law just because of their white privilege.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Analyst: White Militia Are Not A Threat Because They Are Not ‘Looting Anything’ (VIDEO),"People have been quick to point out that there is a clear double standard in the media and people s attitudes regarding the armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge headquarters in Oregon. CNN law enforcement analyst Art Roderick gave a blatant example of this double standard when he appeared on a broadcast of CNN s, in this case, dubiously titled Reliable Sources, on Sunday.During the segment, Roderick made the case that the militia members occupying the federal building are not  looting anything  which makes them way less of a threat to people s safety than say, Black Lives Matters protestors. The last thing we need is some type of large confrontation because that s when stuff goes bad,  Roderick explained.  And I think in this particular instance, if we just wait them out, see what they ve got to say, then eventually, they re all going to go home. CNN host Brian Stelter was quick to point out that some have said that if,  [These were] Black Lives Matter protesters, or if these were peaceful Muslim Americans, they would be treated very differently by law enforcement. This is a very rural area,  Roderick responds.  It is out in the middle of nowhere. What are they actually doing? They re not destroying property; they re not looting anything. It s important to remember that in the United States,  rural  means white, and  urban  means black. I mean, there s a whole separate situation going on as to exactly why they re there and that will be worked out through the legal process,  he continued.  But I think now that they ve taken over this location out at the fish and wildlife, this brings in the federal side. And I know the federal government has learned over the years how to deal with these types of incidences. Let s face it, we all know if a Black Lives Matter group of protesters, or any group that isn t legitimized by the white supremacist narrative of the right wing, was to do the same thing as these wannabe revolutionary cowboys are doing, they would have been demonized in the press and probably killed outright by federal authorities. No one was calling for  calmer heads  when police beat the hell out of BLM protesters.You can watch the segment below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas Lt. Governor Uses Fake Statistics To Defend New Open Carry Law (VIDEO),"The Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, appeared on Meet The Press with Chuck Todd on Sunday to discuss his state s new open carry law. Now, while we must say Mr. Patrick did a pretty good job at making it seem like he defended the merits of the law, in reality, all he did was provide outdated, heavily debunked statistics.Here s what Dan Patrick had to say about the relation of guns to crime data: Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less. There s a study showing that where states have open carry, or concealed carry, but particulary open carry, crime is down 25%, murders are down (even). Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing. In fact, Chuck, every one of the mass-shootings except two in America since 1950 have been gun-free zones. Where people have guns, bad guys don t go. Lt. Governor Patrick doesn t cite his source in the interview, but given how he just said open carry causes crime to go down 25%, we re going to assume he s referring to Florida State Rep. Matt Gaetz s (R-Fort Walton Beach) research. Matt Gaetz is the guy who came up with all this from when he sponsored a bill in October to allow open carry in his state.During a press conference, he claimed to show research that proved violent crime was  23 percent lower in states that allowed open carry, and the murder rate was 5 percent lower.  There are just a few problems with this. Politifact decided to fact-check this and determined that it was very misleading. For one, Gaetz only used data for one full year (not very historical by any means) and compiled it in such a manner that would make it impossible to draw a reasonable conclusion from. It noted that no policy makers should rely on it. Yes, anyone can come up with stats, but that doesn t make them applicable. If a policy maker were to try then and use these stats to make the claim that this proves open carry laws make people safer, then that deserves the title of fake.Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck doesn t think you can use just one statistic to back up a claim when several other studies are proving otherwise. Plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding having no net effect on crime rates, including violent crime rates, one way or the other. And, not only that but the opposite appears to be true. The Washington Post published an article entitled: More gun, more crime: New research debunks central thesis of the gun rights movement. In it, it points out how Stanford law professor John Donohue has advanced decades of analysis showing that guns do in fact equal more crime. So much for the Texas Lt. Governor s argument that we need more guns to be safe. I guess this is what you get when you pick and choose your facts, heavily debunked ones at that.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chris Christie Calls Obama A ‘Petulant Child’ For Executive Orders On Guns (VIDEO),"President Barack Obama has recently announced that he will be issuing executive orders on guns after a series of horrific attacks involving firearms. Predictably, the NRA and Republicans are absolutely freaking out over this, and one of the outspoken GOPers whining about this just happens to be Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.During an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Christie criticized Obama for trying to improve gun control laws, calling him a  boy  for trying to keep the American people safe from terrorism and violence within the home.When Fox moderator Chris Wallace asked Christie what he thought about Obama s intention to expand background checks and prevent guns from getting into the hands of accused domestic abusers and terrorists, Christie went off on a rant: This President is a petulant child. Whenever he can t get what he wants, because frankly, the American people have rejected his agenda by turning over the House and the Senate to republicans, going from 21 Republican governors when he came into office, now 31, now he wants to act as a king. The fact is if he wants to make changes to these laws, go to congress and convince congress they re necessary, but this is going to be another illegal executive action which I m sure will be rejected by the courts. When I become president, they will be stricken from executive action by executive action I will take. You can watch Christie go off on Obama below: Christie had no issue criticizing Obama, even though he is unaware of what Obama will actually do, or the potential legality of those actions. The crazy thing is, Christie later said that he is FOR the restriction on guns to terror watch suspects, but isn t comfortable with Obama taking immediate, responsible action! Wallace pointed out that Christie had previously been supportive of gun control measures, and asked him if he d changed his stance. Christie said: I haven t changed my tune. I signed the bill that banned guns for people on the terror watch list. As president, I would make sure that terror watch list was actually accurate. Interestingly enough, Republicans are fine when Obama takes executive action for things like bombing Syria   however when it comes to protecting women from their abusers or stopping terrorists from getting guns, they ve proven time after time that it s just not a priority.Tomorrow, Obama will see Attorney General Loretta Lynch to finalize his proposal. A town hall will be held on Thursday, and the new executive actions on background checks are expected in the next few days.

 Bernie Sanders Calls Out Trump Over His Obsession With Bill Clinton’s Sex Life (VIDEO),"During a segment on ABC s This Week, Bernie Sanders hammered Donald Trump for talking about Bill Clinton s sex life rather than the real issues that the United States should be focusing on.The show s host, Martha Raddatz, brought the subject up, asking Sanders if he thought that Bill Clinton s sex life should be considered  fair game  during the election.: Donald Trump and Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus think Bill Clinton s sexual history is fair game. Do you? No, I don t,  Sanders replied, and then continued: I think, you know, we have enormous problems facing this country and I think we got more things to worry about than Bill Clinton s sexual life. I think   interestingly enough, maybe Donald Trump might want to focus attention on climate change, understand that climate change is not a hoax, as he believes that it is, that maybe Donald Trump should understand that we should raise the minimum wage in this country, which he opposes, and maybe we should not be giving huge tax breaks to fellow billionaires like Donald Trump. So I think maybe he should focus on those things,  Sanders concluded.Sanders made a similar critique of Trump last week. Sanders claimed that he could win over Trump supporters. That claim must have scared the hell out of Trump. In less than 24 hours, Trump responded to Bernie Sanders, saying that he is in support of raising wages. That s a complete flip from Trump s earlier claims that wages in the United States are too high. Of course, Trump called him a liar and acted like a complete douche bag about the whole thing. Trump still insists that he doesn t think that the minimum wage should be raised, but statements he made in Politico show that he is playing defense on the issue.Bernie Sanders got the Republican presidential primary runner to flip his script and adopt a more progressive message on a major issue. So who knows, maybe sometime this week Trump will go all in on the importance of fighting climate change? Sanders has become a force to be reckoned with because of his unrelenting commitment to his platform. A platform that even the Republican primary front runner is beginning to co-opt.You can watch the segment below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCkSFlxJFMYFeatured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",News,"January 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
