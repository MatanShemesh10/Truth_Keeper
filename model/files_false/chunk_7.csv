 Dramatic Increase In Violence Against BLM Employees Thanks To Bundy Terrorists,"According to the most recent statistics, attacks against federal range and forest workers have increased dramatically over the past year.According to PEER, an organization which keeps track of incidents of violence and threats of violence against environmental stewards, violence against employees of the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) increased sharply between 2014 and 2015.According to a press release dated May 31, 2016:Reported incidents nearly doubled (87% increase) on rangelands overseen by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and increased by more than half (60%) on national forests.The organization has maintained a database to track incidents of violence against federal resource employees since the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.PEER tracks incidents targeting a wide range of agencies employees.According to the press release, threats and assaults against the U.S. Forest Service increased in 2015, with the number of reported incidents rising from 97 to 155.Incidents involving The National Park Service and the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration also rose last year.Executive Director Jeff Ruch warns that Security is a rising concern for scientists and other specialists working in the remote Western outposts. PEER notes that the greatest increase in violent incidents involved the BLM.The District Sentinel points out that the reporting period occurred between  two high-profile acts of aggression against federal land officers by domestic extremists: the Bundy Ranch standoff, in 2014, and the armed takeover of Oregon s Malheur Wildlife Refuge, at the beginning of 2016. In the press release Ruch warns that right-wing militia groups present a serious public safety threat,  especially on federal lands in the Sagebrush West. PEER s stated mission is to protect public employees who protect our lands.According to their website:The U.S. Justice Department no longer systematically tracks assaults on federal employees. A reporting requirement for such incidents enacted after the Oklahoma City bombing was repealed in 2002 after DOJ complained that collecting this data was cumbersome.Ruch says he hopes that  By studying the patterns of these events perhaps managers can begin to defuse or prevent confrontations over federal lands.

" NY Gov. Cuomo Directly Threatens Businesses: ‘If You Boycott Israel, New York Will Boycott You’","In an unprecedented and unconstitutional move, New York s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has issued an executive order creating a blacklist of businesses in the state that are involved in the BDS movement against Israel. BDS stands for boycott, divest and sanction, and is a major way of protesting Israel s illegal actions in Palestine.The order actually tells state officials to compile a list of businesses involved in the BDS movement so Cuomo can order the State of New York to boycott them. As Baher Azmy, of the Center for Constitutional Rights, put it, this is 21st century McCarthyism, and it s vile.Speaking at the exclusive Harvard Club, Cuomo had the gall to say: If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott you. If you divert revenues from Israel, New York will divert revenues from you. If you sanction Israel, New York will sanction you. Citizens United pretty much gave businesses First Amendment rights, and this violates those rights. Cuomo is using government power to coerce   even force   businesses into supporting Israel whether they want to or not. He called BDS an  economic attack on Israel  that must be stopped.While various states have bills in their legislatures that would likewise sanction businesses involved with the BDS movement, Cuomo s executive order gives him immediate power to take care of these businesses with a list that will be made public once it s finished. He even said that passing legislation can often be tedious, as though that s justification enough for issuing an order like this.Omar Barghouti, a founder of the BDS movement, said this isn t surprising and explained what Israel is busy doing: Having lost many battles for hearts and minds at the grass-roots level, Israel has adopted since 2014 a new strategy to criminalize support for B.D.S. from the top,  he said in an email, adding that such actions were meant to  shield Israel from accountability.' Israel will live by the sword for as long as it can; it will occupy all of the land for as long as it can, and it s afraid its time will draw to a close sooner rather than later if the U.S. officially condemns their actions in Palestine. As such, they re brainwashing us.Alphonso David, Cuomo s general counsel, said that this order specifies the BDS movement, but would target any boycott aimed at Israel. He also said it s meant to send a message about the BDS movement: Mr. David said in an interview that the executive action was meant to send a clear message that  the B.D.S. movement is deplorable.  He added that the governor s order was not meant to be interpreted as  opining on actions taken to empower Palestinians,  or meant to discourage debate over Israeli actions in the Middle East. Rather, it intends to stake a position on a movement that  the State of New York unequivocally rejects,  as the order puts it. The State of New York can reject whatever it wants. It can issue a statement to that effect. It should not be allowed to trample the 1st Amendment rights of anybody for any reason, especially to protect a country guilty of heinous atrocities.Constitutional rights are inalienable, unless you use them to protest Israel.Featured image by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" CA Cops Brutally Beat Man Accused Of Jaywalking, Charge Him With Assault (VIDEO)","Bystander footage shows a group of Bakersfield, California police officers brutally beating a man in the street.The video begins with the man, now identified as Robert Woodson, lying in the street with an unidentified officer standing over him. He can be heard screaming that he thinks his leg is broken.Two more officers arrive on the scene.The video shows the officers repeatedly striking Woodson with a police-issued baton.Throughout the brutal assault the officers can be heard shouting,  Stop resisting! Stop resisting. The person recording the incident responds by sayinm  He s not doing nothing,  and  He s not resisting. While it s clear that Woodson wasn t complying with police commands, at no time does the video show him trying to get up off the ground, making threatening moves or gestures toward police.In spite of this, the cops use a taser on him.His screams of pain can be heard throughout the encounter.According to KERO Woodson was eventually taken to a local hospital where he was treated for injuries sustained during the episode.The police watchdog organization Photography Is Not A Crime reports that the man suffered an injury to his arm which required a cast.Police charged Woodson with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.If that s not disturbing enough, during an interview with KERO, Bakersfield police sergeant Gary Carruesco stated that police  acted appropriately,  in part because they were concerned Woodson had  mental issues. The video, combined with the disturbing response from sergeant Carruesco, provides a bleak picture of how law enforcement officers respond to people with mental illness.While police assessed Woodson s behavior as willful noncompliance, it s unknown whether the man was physically or mentally capable of following officer s commands.In Woodson s case, officers expressed their  concern  for him with tasers and batons.Here s the video, courtesy of KERO.Featured image via ideo screen capture via KERO",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Obamas Gave A Heartbreaking Tribute To Muhammad Ali (VIDEO),"The last couple of years have been rampant with what seems like premature deaths. Would we have ever been able to prepare ourselves for the deaths of Robin Williams, David Bowie, Prince and so many, many more people? Unfortunately, we have another name to add to what seems like a particularly grim year: Muhammad Ali   and the Obamas, in a statement to America,  mourned the loss as deeply as any of us.To the Obamas, Ali   who was resoundingly loved and admired, and was actually (unlike President Obama) a black Muslim   was  The Greatest. Period. Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we re also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a while; for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time, Muhammad Ali was The Greatest. Period. If you just asked him, he d tell you. He d tell you he was the double greatest; that he d  handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail,  Obama wrote.  But what made The Champ the greatest   what truly separated him from everyone else   is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing. The President also tweeted, showing himself working with a picture of the Champ behind him.He shook up the world, and the world s better for it. Rest in peace, Champ. pic.twitter.com/z1yM3sSLH3  President Obama (@POTUS) June 4, 2016Obama also noted that he has a pair of Ali s boxing gloves in his private study.Obama continued,  I am America,  he once declared.  I am the part you won t recognize. But get used to me   black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.  That s the Ali I came to know as I came of age   not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was right. A man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela; stood up when it was hard; spoke out when others wouldn t. His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today. Muhammad Ali shook up the world,  Obama concluded in his tribute to Ali.  And the world is better for it. We are all better for it. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace. Source: Rolling StoneHere s a video:While Obama was born during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, he came of age watching Ali. To Obama, Martin Luther King and even Malcolm X were parts of history books, but Ali was brash, confident, smart, socially aware and a force to be reckoned with in the 60s and 70s. While so many Civil Rights leaders were working behind the scenes, or perhaps in front, but more quietly, Ali told the world that he could do anything, no matter his skin color. Perhaps there would have never been a President Barack Obama if it weren t for the example put forth by Muhammad Ali.Featured image via Kent Gavin at Getty Images.",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Caught Paying Women Working On His Campaign MUCH Less Than Men,"It s not surprising that Donald Trump would pay his female staffers less than his male staffers. He s sexist, so that s to be expected. What is surprising, though, is just how bad it is. On average, in the U.S., women are paid about $.79 for every dollar men are paid, even for the same work. Trump pays the women working on his campaign about $.65 for every dollar his male staffers make.Now, some will make the argument that we don t necessarily know what his female staffers are doing versus what his male staffers are doing. There s a possibility, those people would say, that the men are getting paid more because they all hold higher, more difficult positions, or they work more hours, or they do better work in general, or all of the above.That s still blatantly sexist.For April, the women on Trump s staff earned about $4,500, while the men earned about $6,100. That s a 35 percent difference, which is egregious, even for him. Supposedly, he believes in equal pay, but says it s too complicated an issue for legislation. Too much can go into whether men and women are really doing the same job or not, he says.So, what, we re supposed to assume that he s paying all his staffers exactly in accordance with the jobs they do, and how well they do them? Please.Whichever way we look at this, Trump s campaign is set up in a traditionally sexist manner, which is at odds with his assertions that he ll be so good for women (and black people, and Latinos, etc.) once he s elected. That, in and of itself, is laughable considering how badly he treats women, and some of the misogynistic comments he s made about women. For him to make that claim while allowing a pay gap that s much worse than even the national gender pay gap is ridiculous.Compare all of that to how Hillary Clinton is treating her staff, and the differences are stark. Of the 15 highest-paid staffers on her campaign, eight were men and seven were women in April. Men earned about $3,760, while women earned about $3,710. There s still a gap there, but it s extremely thin. When it comes to women s equality, Hillary knows she has to set an example with how she runs her campaign.Trump loves talking big. That s his whole game   talk big, do what he wants even if it makes him a huge hypocrite. But since he thinks letting women work is a bad idea anyway, then maybe he s not such a hypocrite. Just a disgusting, sexist prick.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" S.C. Pastor LOSES IT, Goes On Bizarre, Anti-Atheist Rant From Pulpit (VIDEO)","Phil Vander Ploeg says that he is a  Christian apologist.  Well, if that is so, then he needs to get down on his knees and apologize to the atheists of the world for telling lies about us from his pulpit at the First Baptist Spartanburg in South Carolina. Vander Ploeg says: Why doesn t God just walk into the room one day and say,  Hello, I m God, I m real,  and then leave? God has revealed himself far more than some people want to acknowledge. It s obvious.The only atheists in the world live in America and Europe. Everyone else knows there s a god. But we ve developed a worldview in the West that justifies our actions. That s why we don t believe in God. Well, no, sir, that isn t true at all. According to Gallup (which, by the way, is much more reliable than some nutty preacher), there are more atheists in China than anywhere in America or Europe. Last I checked, that s not the western world. Here is what Gallup International had to say about the concentration of atheists in China: China has the highest amount of atheists living in a single country with nearly 50 per cent of its population describing themselves as non-believers. Around 47 per cent of people living in China describe themselves as atheists compared to an average of 13 per cent across the world. Methinks Pastor Vander Ploeg has gotten his facts wrong. Further, he also says that people are only atheists because they want to live their lives their way, rather than God s way. Wrong again! People are atheists because they don t believe in a deity, pure and simple.Watch the insanity in action, below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 22-Year-Old Inmate Dies After Being Punished For ‘Faking Illness’ In FLA Jail (VIDEO),"Max Gracia, a 22-year-old resident of Orlando, Florida, was found dead in an Orange County jail cell on the morning of August 11, 2015. Autopsy results show that Gracia died of sepsis, after wounds from a police canine bite became infected.As WESH reports here, documents released following an internal police investigation show that Gracia was checked into the jail infirmary following his arrest. He was then discharged without ever being evaluated or treated.Records obtained by WESH show that on the night before his death Gracia was so sick that he could not get out of his bed.The documents show that:When jail officers told Gracia to get out of his bed, he  slowly went to the floor and lied on his back saying that he could not move anymore. Instead of offering medical attention, a jail nurse, who later resigned, wrote that the 22-year-old  was faking or exaggerating his medical condition and inability to get up. The nurse interpreted his illness as an  implicit refusal for medication. Gracia was then disciplined by jail officials, who charged him with refusal to follow orders and  feigning an illness. He died in his cell hours later.Here s more on this story from Fox 11:In 2013, the state of Florida privatized healthcare services for inmates. Since that time the number of inmate deaths has steadily increased.Up until May 31, 2016, Corizon, a private corporation which provides healthcare to inmates in a number of states, was responsible for inmate care in Florida.After thousands of inmate complaints and hundreds of unexplained inmate deaths, the company decided to terminate its $1.1 billion contract with the state two years early.As the Miami Herald reports here:Audits conducted by the state s Correctional Medical Authority found problems with inadequate medical care, nursing and staffing shortages, and hundreds of pending lawsuits against the state and the healthcare companies claiming inadequate care.An analysis published by the Miami Herald in November showed that in 2014 alone  346 inmates died in Florida prisons   176 of them listed with no immediate cause of death. It was the highest number on record. The increase in the number of inmate deaths occurred even as the number of inmates in Florida prisons declined.As of June 1, Centurion, another private corporation, will take over inmate care in the state.As the Miami Herald reports:The company s lead lobbyist is former House Speaker Dean Cannon, and its parent company, Centene Health, is a primary provider of managed Medicaid services in Florida   doing business as Sunshine Health   and one of the largest contributors to legislative political committees in the state. Centene gave $298,000 to legislative campaigns and political committees in 2015 alone.",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Dixie Chicks Kick Off First Tour In A Decade By Humiliating Donald Trump On Stage,"They haven t toured in ten years but the Dixie Chicks began their new world tour by making one hell of a political statement.The trio have never been shy about slamming Republicans in the past. Just ask Ted Cruz and George W. Bush, both of whom have been heavily mocked and criticized by the band.In 2003, radio stations across the country literally censored the Dixie Chicks by pulling their music off the air because Natalie Maines dared to slam Bush for dragging America into a costly war with Iraq.During a concert in London, Maines said she was  ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas. Just so you know, we re on the good side with y all,  Maines said.  We do not want this war, this violence, and we re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas. Not long after, Bush started a war based on lies that resulted in the deaths of over 4,000 American soldiers. That action forced America to fight on two fronts in the Middle East and caused the war in Afghanistan and the hunt for Osama bin Laden to take even longer as Bush took his eye off the ball to focus on Saddam Hussein instead of the terrorist who planned the 9/11 attacks.And Maines has taken shots at Ted Cruz and Donald Trump throughout the Republican primary on her Twitter account.Next time you re day dreaming, picture Donald Trump teaching his son Eric to throw a ball. Any ball. It s funny.

Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) January 24, 2016On Wednesday, however, the Dixie Chicks humiliated Trump while on stage in Cincinnati by depicting him as the devil on the big screen behind them while singing a tune about a husband who abuses his wife.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump is a vile racist who is so thin-skinned that it would be easy to provoke him into using the military to attack countries he doesn t like if he should actually be given command of our armed forces by the American people in November. He has even refused to rule out nuclear war against Europe and the Middle East which puts our military and the entire world population at serious risk. America does not need any more wars, but electing Donald Trump as president would just about guarantee perpetual war and it looks like the Dixie Chicks are prepared to wage political war against Trump to make sure that doesn t happen.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Senator Incapable Of Answering This Simple Question About Trump’s Border Wall (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s proposal to build a wall between the United States and Mexico is absolutely ridiculous. It s unnecessary, counter-productive, and an insult to our national neighbor. The fact that Trump thinks that Mexico should foot the bill for the mega-project serves as the cherry on top of the giant pile of bullsh*t that Trump has served to his supporters insisting that it is made of ice cream.The proposal is just one of many elephants in the room that the GOP is refusing to give any coherent opinion on. That s why when Republican Senator Bob Corker appeared on ABC s This Week, the show s host George Stephanopoulos pressed the Senator for some clarity on the matter.Here s a transcript of the exchange:GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator, let me go ahead, let s talk about his ideas. You are the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and you ve said his call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration is not a serious proposal. The former head of the CIA Michael Hayden said this morning it s a recruiting tool for ISIS. If Donald Trump as president, moved to impose that ban would you support it or try to stop it?SEN. BOB CORKER No, I would not support it and I ve already issued statements to that effect and what I understand is he has stepped away from those statements.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he has said he still supports those statements. He s also said in every speech that he talks about building a wall on our border and getting Mexico to pay for it. Is that realistic and what would it do to our relations with Mexico?CORKER: You know, obviously we do need to have good relations with Mexico and Canada. We do. That s one of the things that makes our country in such a stable environment having two friends on our borders unlike many countries around the world. There is a security issue. I authored an amendment during the immigration debate that actually makes building a wall look like Ned in the first reader meaning it was even more difficult and by the way, I mean, a tougher security border measure   by the way, every Democrat in the Senate voted for that measure. So there s no question that we have agreement in our country that we need greater security. It s strongly bipartisan and I hope that we will implement that because it is a security threat.STEPHANOPOULOS: But is it realistic to expect Mexico to pay for the wall?CORKER: Again, I think people agree with that   what s that?STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it realistic for people to expect Mexico to pay for that wall?CORKER: Well, again, I don t want to get into a debate about the nuances of that. I mean it s a statement that he has made. I thought this interview was going to be more about the foreign policy arena. I think he has a tremendous opportunity there.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, our relations with Mexico is foreign policy.CORKER: Okay. Well, look, as to how the wall is paid for, that s something that Congress certainly will debate. My guess is there will be additional debates regarding how the actual security measures will be put in place but securing our border has been something that people on both sides of the aisle have supported for years and we need to do that and it s understandable that it s become an issue because it s lingered for so long. We had an opportunity to deal with this years ago. It wasn t dealt with. Needs to be dealt with now. And hopefully we ll move beyond that very quickly.Surprise, surprise. No clear answers on one of the most important topics of the election cycle. If you can t answer a simple question about what may become part of your party s platform   it might be a good sign that it is time to jump off the ship.These days, it s looking more and more like top members of the Republican Party are embarrassed to be a member of that party. The Republican National Convention is coming up fast, sooner or later the GOP is going to have to decide if they are willing to go completely off the deep end and agree to support Trump s fascist proposals.You can watch the interview below.

" WATCH: Conservative Game Show Host Insults Minimum Wage Earners, Supports Punishing Liberals","Chuck Woolery wants America to return to the 1950s when liberals were punished for exercising free speech and the minimum wage was $1.00 an hour.During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Sunday the former Wheel of Fortune host whined about Matt Damon s commencement speech in which the actor addressed the need for a higher minimum wage and blasted Republican nominee Donald Trump.Woolery responded by accusing Damon of being a communist and suggested punishing liberals who express their support of anything deemed a communist idea by the right-wing. In the  50s in Hollywood if you spoke for communism, you were blackballed,  Woolery said.  In the  90s and 2000s in Hollywood if you speak for communism, you re rewarded for it. But if you speak against communism, you re blackballed. And that s blatantly not true since conservative actors like Gary Senise and Tom Selleck have both starred in movies and great television programs. Also, since when is free speech a communist thing?Woolery then attacked workers who make minimum wage by suggesting that those workers don t work hard and are just starting out and don t have families to support. Most people don t realize that it s not a good thing, it s a bad thing,  Woolery claimed about raising the minimum wage. I think it s the liberals  job to take the simple and make it as complex as possible. I think it s the conservatives  job   and we don t do a very good job of it   to take the complex and make it as simple as possible. The things that sound really good   this knee-jerk reaction to 15 bucks an hour   my son is 20 years old, he would love to make $15 an hour. You ve got to earn your way in this world, and if it costs them $15 a hour and you re a small business and it ruins the business, what good does it do?  he continued.  These are people who are starting off. They re not people who have families by and large. Here s the video via YouTube:Again, Woolery doesn t know what the hell he is talking about. Not only is raising the minimum wage good for the overall economy, it strengthens businesses and actually does help the families of these workers.According to the Center of Economic and Policy Research, the average age of a minimum wage worker is 35-years-old, far from someone who is just  starting off. Indeed, the Department of Labor says that women would especially benefit from a much needed minimum wage hike.More than half of those who would benefit are women   about a third of them have children. In fact, of the 2.8 million working single parents that would benefit, more than 80 percent are women. And research shows that raising the minimum wage reduces child poverty among female-headed households.Raising the minimum wage would immediately impact these families and the local economies they live in. The cost of living has gone up along with the bloated income of wealthy assholes like Chuck Woolery. Therefore, minimum wage workers should see an increase and that increase would definitely be over $10 an hour if the minimum wage had been tied to inflation since the 1960s. And if you re a woman, you only make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes, which makes things worse.Wage hikes also boost worker morale, which makes businesses stronger. A happy workforce that is taken care of by their employer means a healthier business and a healthier community.

 MD Special Needs Man Gunned Down Over A Basketball (VIDEO),"On Wednesday a 20-year-old special needs man was gunned down by an angry gun owner in Landover Hills, Maryland.According to WJLA, the shooting occurred as the victim, identified as Conrad Cole, was walking to a nearby park to play basketball with his two caretakers. Witnesses say that the 20-year-old group home resident lost control of his basketball. The ball brushed against a nearby car.The owner of the vehicle, who has since been identified as 28-year-old Roderick Town, aggressively confronted Cole.During an interview with WJLA, Prince George County Police Chief Hank Stawinski described what happened next: The special needs individual is not communicating clearly. The individual in the car retrieves a weapon and shoots the person a number of times. Stawinski called the shooting  a senseless murder. After killing the special needs man, Town fled the scene.He was arrested on Saturday. Town faces charges of first-degree and second-degree murder, as well as additional charges.Here s more on the story from WJLA.According to the Washington Post, Maryland has  some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. The state s supposedly strict gun laws do nothing to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, convicted felons or people on the FBI s terrorist watch list. Democrats have been trying to change that.Police have yet to release information on what type of gun was used in this senseless killing, nor have they disclosed whether Town was legally permitted to own a gun in MD.What we do know is that contrary to NRA myths, the presence of a gun does not reduce the odds of violent crime.Time and time again we see minor arguments escalate to this level of violence. As decades of research shows, the mere presence of a gun during a heated conflict contributes to higher levels of aggression and violence.Guns and anger are a deadly combination. Sadly, research also shows that the more angry and impulsive a person is, the more likely they are to own and carry a gun.As reported here: A June 2015 study found that  310 million firearms estimated to be in private hands in the United States are disproportionately owned by people who are prone to angry, impulsive behavior and have a potentially dangerous habit of keeping their guns close at hand. While no one has all the answers when it comes to preventing gun violence, we do know that putting even more guns into the hands of angry people is not the solution.Image credit: video screen capture via WJLA",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Gets GRILLED Over This Weird Claim He Keeps Making (VIDEO),"During an interview on CNN Sunday morning, Jake Tapper pressed Donald Trump hard asking for some shred of evidence that the presumptive Republican frontrunner s claims regarding the Iraq War are true.Trump attempted to position himself against Hillary Clinton s vote in favor of the Iraq War: I have a very strong temperament, but I have a temperament that s totally under control. And [Hillary Clinton] mentions that I ll bring us into war. She s the one that wanted to go into Iraq. She raised her hand. She didn t know what the hell she was doing. She raised her hand. I said, I don t want to go into Iraq. Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East, and I was 100 percent right,  Trump told Tapper.Now, this might actually be a legitimate talking point if this were a normal election and Trump wasn t Trump. However, that is not at all the case. That s why Tapper decided to call out Trump s statement that he was against the Iraq War before it started.Here is a transcript of the exchange:JAKE TAPPER: Can I just say one point on that, I have looked so long and hard for any evidence  TRUMP: I ll give it to you. 2004, they had newspaper articles.TAPPER: Right, but the war started in 2003.TRUMP: It did, but you know what, you look at   I did an interview with Howard [Stern], and that interview was the first time I was ever asked the question. Don t forget I was an entrepreneur. I m a real estate person.TAPPER: But didn t you say to Howard that you thought it was a good idea?TRUMP: This was before the war started, long before the war started and it was a very, like, I don t know. First, nobody ever asked me the question, when you re do what I did nobody was talking about a lot of the questions that you ask me today, and I was   I sort of like, well, I don t know, maybe, I don t know. By the time that started, I was totally against it, and from 2004 on, there s a lot of proof of that, because, as you know, there was articles in magazines, there was a lot of articles.TAPPER: Yeah. A year after the war started.TRUMP: No, no, but I was against it from before it started. And if you go back and look at that interview, and I ll get it for you if you want, but that interview was substantially before the war started. It was the first time I was ever asked the question. And even that, it wasn t like, oh yeah, we should go in. It was a very, like yeah, maybe.TAPPER: The only thing I would say, and then we don t have to belabor this point, is if there is evidence of you being against the war strongly before the war actually started, I would love to see that.TRUMP: OK, but I think there is evidence.TAPPER: I just haven t seen it.TRUMP: I think there is evidence. I haven t been asked that question before. Nobody said that to me before. I think there is evidence, I ll see if I can get it. But I will say, from the beginning of 2004, I mean I ve had articles, and I mean there are magazines  TAPPER: 2004 no question.TRUMP: I was against the war a long time ago and it destabilized the Middle East, and that s exactly what I said was going to happen.While the political theater of watching Trump try to back up one of his claims without there being any actual evidence to back his claims is always entertaining, Trump accidently exposed a huge weakness of his in the interview. No one cares what Trump has had to say about anything before this election cycle. His greatest achievement in the political realm until now was his fanning of the flames that was the birther conspiracy theory.No one cared in 2013 what Trump had to say about the Iraq War then. Trump has alleged that the reason that there isn t any evidence of his disapproval of the Iraq War was because no one asked him about it. Who would ask the Trump of 2003 his opinion on any matter of seriousness? He was reality television star. He didn t matter.That being said, if Trump did actually have such strong feelings against the Iraq War, why didn t he bring it up. Trump had the money and social capital to launch a campaign against the Iraq invasion that could have possibly have had an actual impact.Yet he didn t. That s because Trump is a selfish opportunist and taking a stand at the right time in history is not in his nature.You can watch the interview below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5dC2l8j6UUFeatured image from video screenshot",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Muhammad Ali Sent Trump A Powerful Message That The World Needs To Read,"The right wing loves to appropriate revolutionary icons. Muhammed Ali is very much one of those icons. Since his passing on Friday, the boxing champion and political agitator s legacy has been praised by those who have agendas that are antithetical to the The Champ s views on the world. This is probably best exemplified by the message that he sent to Donald Trump (though Trump was not named explicitly) and anyone else who wants to take Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States seriously.Trump recently sent out a tweet, where he praised Ali for being a truly great champion and a wonderful guy. Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2016That tweet stands out in stark contrast to the disgusting one that Trump sent out about Muslim athletes just a few months prior to Ali s passing.Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes. What sport is he talking about, and who? Is Obama profiling?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015People were quick to point out how vile and asinine the statement was.And dude, @realDonaldTrump, you've met @MuhammadAli multiple times. pic.twitter.com/tIiIBgY80b  Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) December 7, 2015While Trump and Ali had a friendly relationship prior to Trump s political campaign, Ali sent Trump a letter denouncing the idea that Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. I am a Muslim and there is nothing Islamic about killing innocent people in Paris, San Bernardino, or anywhere else in the world. True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion.We as Muslims have to stand up to those who use Islam to advance their own personal agenda. They have alienated many from learning about Islam. True Muslims know or should know that it goes against our religion to try and force Islam on anybody.Speaking as someone who has never been accused of political correctness, I believe that our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people s views on what Islam really is. As we all know, Trump has not heeded that message. Trump s entire campaign stands in opposition to what Ali preached.Like the great man himself, Ali s powerful message floats with the grace of a butterfly, yet should sting those who they are addressed to like a bee.Featured image from  Andrew H.

 Trump Adds Muslims To List Of Minorities He Thinks Shouldn’t Be Allowed To Be Judges (VIDEO),"After widespread, bipartisan outrage and several high profile calls by Republican colleagues to knock it off, Donald Trump decided instead to triple down on his racist comments about the judge presiding over his Trump University fraud case   and then start adding other minority groups that he also feels can t be trusted.During a sit down with CBS s John Dickerson on Face the Nation, Trump said it was  common sense  to keep minorities out of positions of authority or else they might be biased against people like Trump. When Dickerson pressed Trump to justify his overtly racist attitudes by using a hypothetical Muslim judge instead of a Hispanic one, the Republican nominee said he would similarly ask that a Muslim recuse himself under the assumption that given what he has said about Muslims, the judge would be unable to give him a fair trial.It led to this mind-blowing exchange: Isn t there sort of a tradition though in America that we don t judge people by who their parents were and where they came from?  Dickerson replied.And Trump countered again,  I m not talking about tradition   I m talking about common sense, OK? Trump has repeatedly insisted that he really does stand behind the accusations that the judge in his case, Indiana-born Gonzalo Curial, is a  Mexican  hater who wants to punish Trump for his promise to build a wall on the border. Now he has expanded it to Muslims as well. What group is next?Clearly a position that in more decent times would disqualify a candidate, instead Republicans have opted to tsk tsk Trump while at the same time pretend to believe that what he said isn t racist, just  brash.  It s unclear whether even they buy that particularly pathetic excuse.There is, of course, little need to debunk Trump s offensive approach to the justice system, but a UCLA law professor summed it up nicely: Trump s theory is, apparently, that anyone can get any judge disqualified for  conflict of interest  just by saying things that the judge finds offensive enough,  Volokh wrote.  Don t like the Jewish judge on your case? Say things that are critical of Jews, and now the judge presumably has to step aside because of a conflict of interest. Don t like the female judge? Say things that women tend to find offensive. Don t like the judge who was a Republican activist? Say nasty things about Republicans. In other words, the only person Trump thinks is qualified to judge Trump is Trump. Or perhaps, men who share his same skin color.Watch Trump s egregious comments below:Would a Muslim judge also be out of the question here? @realdonaldtrump:  It s possible, yes.  https://t.co/49qUfRCrLV  Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 5, 2016Featured image via CBS",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: GOP Leader Won’t Call Trump’s Attack On Latino Judge Racist,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s bizarre accusation that the judge overseeing the lawsuit about Trump University can t be impartial because of his  Mexican heritage  has been rebuked and slammed from multiple angles. But the most senior Republican in the United States Senate refuses to call the attack racist.Appearing on Meet the Press, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) would not be moved despite the mountain of evidence against his fellow Republican.Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Sunday criticized Donald Trump s recent attacks on a California judge but would not call the presumptive Republican presidential nominee s statements racist. I couldn t disagree more with a statement like that,  McConnell said on NBC s  Meet the Press  in an interview that aired Sunday morning, referring to Trump s comments. I couldn t disagree more with what he had to say,  he added, when pressed on whether Trump made a racist statement.Trump has refused to back down from his anti-Latino statement, perhaps sensing that the Republican base nominated him in the first place based on Latino-bashing.Other Republicans, even Newt Gingrich, who is apparently in the running to be the vice presidential nominee, have slammed the Trump argument. Current Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also voiced disagreement with Trump s attack, but did not rescind his endorsement of the nominee.Trump compounded the issue by singling out a black man at a rally as  my African-American,  and then retweeted a photo of what was supposedly a family of black supporters. In reality, the picture was stolen from a news report of a black family reunion from 2015. Reached for comment, the family in the story denied supporting Trump and described his use of their photo as  propaganda. The racial litmus test proposed by Trump for federal judges has also been rejected and denounced by Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and other prominent Democrats.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black And Brown People Accounted For 86.5 Percent Of NY Misdemeanor Arrests,"Black and brown people accounted for 86.5 percent of New York City s misdemeanor arrests, during the first three months of 2016.According to the most recent statistics from the Police Reform Organizing Project (PROP) between January 1 and March 31 of this year the NYPD arrested 46,600 citizens for misdemeanor crimes.Out of those 46,600 arrests, more than 43,300 were people of color.The population of New York City is at least 44 percent white, according to the most recent data from the 2010 Census. In spite of the population demographics, less than 14 percent of misdemeanor arrests have involved a white person.Those numbers are staggering.If that s not enough, it appears that the disproportionate rate of misdemeanor arrests involving people of color is getting worse.During the same three month time period in 2014, people of color made up 84.5 percent of NYPD misdemeanor arrests. In 2015 the percentage of minority arrests increased to 85.4 percent. In 2016 the number rose again, to where it now stands at 86.5 percent.During an interview with New York Daily News, Robert Gangi of PROP said  the statistics that stand out for us involve arrests for misdemeanor marijuana offenses. As New York Daily News reports here:On Nov. 11, 2014, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton announced that people caught with less than 25 grams of marijuana would no longer be arrested, effective immediately. Instead, they were to be issued a noncriminal violation in the form of a summons. Repeat offenders would get a fine. Anyone caught smoking on the street, however, would still wind up in jail.Initially the number of marijuana arrests declined throughout the city, following the announcement.As the most recent data shows, the number of people arrested for marijuana has been inching its way back up since the announced 2014 policy change.During the first three months of 2016, 4,225 people were arrested for pot possession. That s a big increase over the same period last year, when 2,960 people were arrested on the same charge.The disparity in the rate of misdemeanor arrests is only the tip of the iceberg.According to their website,  from June 3, 2014 through August 11, 2015, PROP recorded information on 1351 cases presented in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens criminal courts. During that time period the organization monitored 1351 cases. The group reports that of those cases 1247, or 92.3 percent, of defendants were people of color.As stated in the group s latest court monitoring report: Everyday New York s district attorneys aggressively prosecute cases against black and brown people for engaging in mainly innocent or innocuous activities. Everyday our city s courts devote considerable resources to the administration of injustice, applying sanctions in hundreds, if not thousands, of cases where the charges involves, at worst, petty infractions and where the defendants are almost always people of color, some of whom live on the margins of society.

 NC Students Pull Racist Prank On Their Classmates That’s Straight Out Of Trump’s Book,"Students at a North Carolina high school have let Donald Trump s influence get to them way too much. Last week, they built a wall of boxes that blocked off McDowell High School s common area, and then put the photo on Instagram, saying,  We built the wall first,  in apparent homage to Donald Trump and his border wall idea.Worse, they built this wall under the supervision of a teacher. Of all people, a teacher should have known what this symbolized and discouraged the students from doing this. Instead, these students got supervision for a racist prank that understandably upset their Latino classmates.They wanted to put a Trump sticker on it, too, but at least someone had the guts to tell them they couldn t do that. A picture of the wall was shared on Students4Trump s Instagram account, and is below:McDowell High School students get the award for best #studentsfortrump senior prank. THEY BUILT A WALL!! We are #students4trump #trump2016 #trump #maga #studentsfortrump #makeamericagreatagain #trump #trumptrainA photo posted by Students For Trump (@students4trump) on Jun 2, 2016 at 2:50pm PDTTrump has been chanting about a wall along the Mexican border nonstop since he announced his candidacy a year ago, and he s been extremely racist against Latinos in the U.S. In fact, he tweeted that the anti-Trump protesters that got violent at his San Jose rally were  mostly illegals:  Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2016One has to wonder how he knows that. Chances are, he doesn t, and just assumes that any Latinos who don t support him are here illegally.These kids took a page straight out of his book to do this, and they know it. Otherwise they wouldn t have wanted to put a Trump sticker on it. The students aren t going to face any disciplinary action over it, either, likely because it was just a  prank.  That tells them that racist behavior will be tolerated in our society and teaches them nothing of value.Trump would be so proud of these kids. That s sickening.Featured image by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Teens Post Video On What They Would Do To Black People As President (VIDEO),"In a video uploaded to Facebook earlier this week, a group of students from Grosse Pointe, Michigan can be heard talking about what they would do to Black people if they were president.As reported by New York Daily News the students recorded the video over Memorial Day weekend.In the video a male student can be heard talking about his hatred for Black people, calling them  f g stupid  and worthless.  The student goes on to say,  they need to leave our country, send  em back to Africa, or the slaves, one of the two options. Another student asks,  So what are you going to do in 2040,  referring to the year he ll become president of the United States.The first student replies,  Oh, segregate. They get Maine, North and South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming Another student asks, How are they going to be treated? Awful,  he responds, saying,  they re going to be owned by white people, and white people are going to be the dominants of the country. Another student says We re gonna burn them on stakes. No, no, no, no,  the first student replies.  We re gonna put like a pole with those little burning things at the end and stab  em so you can know who the owner is and you can sell those bitches. You can trade  em for like cock points and shit, bro. And you can get alcohol for that shit. After another student asks if there s anything else they re going to do, the first student adds,  We re not gonna put  em in coffins, we re gonna put  em in a river and let  em swim to the Atlantic Ocean. WXYZ in Detroit reports that the students attend Grosse Pointe s South High School. School officials sent a notice out to parents regarding the video. The notice mentions  possible suspensions. It appears that the video has since been removed from social media. New York Daily News published a partial transcript here.In March South High School officials suspended a different group of students over racist posts on social media.It s not hard to trace the inspiration for the hateful ideas expressed by these students.When Donald Trump is the republican party s current frontrunner in the presidential primary, it shouldn t come as a surprise to anyone to hear young people talking about the vile things they would do if they became president.Grosse Pointe, a suburb of Detroit, has never been lacking in racist role models for students to emulate, either. In 2013, more than a dozen videos were released showing Grosse Pointe police officers telling Black men to sing, dance and  walk like a chimp,  for the camera.These students have been influenced by republican politicians like L Brooks Patterson.In 2014, Patterson proposed building a fence around the city of Detroit to keep Black people in, saying: I made a prediction a long time ago and it s come to pass. I said what we re gonna do is turn Detroit into an Indian reservation, where we herd all the Indians into the city, build a fence around it and then throw in the blankets and the corn. When students look around and see politicians, police officers and even presidential candidates spewing this kind of vile hate speech, we should not be surprised when they do the same. These are the people impressionable young people are supposed to be able to look up to and emulate.We should gravely consider what the US will become tomorrow if we fail to hold the people in power accountable for their hateful words and actions today.Here s more on the story from Fox 2 in Detroit.Image credit: Video screen capture Fox 2",News,"June 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Arkansas Mayor To Use The 4th Of July To Force His Religion Down Everyone’s Throats,"Beebe, Arkansas mayor, Mike Robertson, loves Jesus. He loves Jesus so much that he s using public dollars to fund a gospel band for Beebe s 4th of July celebration, and he knows what he s doing, too. Otherwise, he wouldn t have said this in his letter urging residents to come out: I am pleased to announce that this year s live music will be provided by Grammy-Nominated, Multiple Award-Winning Gospel Artists, The Bowling Family The Bowling Family combines talent, sincerity and experience to create a memorable concert experience. Their goal for the evening is to usher in the presence of god and to celebrate the Christian message. They feel privileged and honored to enjoy the freedom to honor Christ with any and all of their abilities.  [emphasis mine]You can read the letter in its entirety here.It s ironic that he d knowingly pick a gospel band to help his town celebrate a day on which our founders declared their independence from the British Crown, and sought things like religious freedom for the colonies. It s sad, too; Robertson clearly practices the religious right s warped and twisted view of American history.David Niose, the legal director of the American Humanist Association, sent a stern letter of warning to Robertson s office, saying that a concerned citizen had contacted him about usurping our Independence Day, along with public dollars, to endorse a religion not everyone in Beebe practices. The American Humanist Association has successfully sued other government entities for promoting religion in the past, and Niose makes a point of mentioning that. He also said: You should not be surprised that some of your constituents object to your use of the apparatus of government, which of course is funded by citizens of various religious backgrounds, to endorse and promote your personal religion. Indeed, Beebe was also the center of controversy in 2014 when a family there opened a small, pagan temple in their garage. Robertson was initially behind that, thinking it was a little Christian church, but when he found out it was pagan, he changed his mind and claimed that zoning laws forbade a place of worship on that property.In fact, zoning laws actually allowed it. Robertson just doesn t like the idea that there are people in his town that practice a different religion than he does. Worse, he believes that public officials should be praying to his god  as the true leader of the nation.  This is Christian zealotry at its finest. Freedom for Christianity and Christians, but not for anyone else.Roberston told OneNewsNow that the city is acting fairly, and he s prepared to defend having this gospel group at their 4th of July event: We ve had all different types of entertainment. And we try each year to change it to do something for everybody s desire and liking, and so we chose a gospel group. He went on to say that people could just stay home if they don t like it. Wow. Just wow. Perhaps he s the one who should stay home, and let people who actually understand freedom of religion, along with the whole reason we even celebrate that day, plan this event.Featured image via Beebe, Ark. official website",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Veteran Loving’ Trump Fires Veterans Because Their Service Inconveniences Him,"Finally, the media is giving Donald Trump the critical eye they should. The stories about the Trump University lawsuits and his refusal to release his tax returns are proving to be troublesome to the GOP frontrunner s campaign, but one of the most damaging might be the missing money that was supposedly pegged for veterans.Things are about to get a whole lot worse on the veteran front. The Huffington Post reported that Trump actually discriminates against veterans because they spend too much time serving their country.In at least three cases, Trump s companies have either fired, or refused to hire, military reservists because of the time commitments demanded of them by their service in the armed forces. The veterans involved have sued Trump for violating the laws meant to protect them from precisely these types of penalties. And in all three cases, Trump and his companies have settled the suits.The Huffington Post already reported on the first two of these cases   one involving an Air Force senior master sergeant fired from the Trump Institute in 2007, and one an Army staff sergeant fired from her job at Trump University that same year.These two cases, however, have a predecessor. On May 27, 1988, United States Air Force Col. Charles Beattie submitted orders to his bosses at Eastern Airlines, where he worked as a pilot.For Trump, it seems, it s cheaper to pay fines for this clear violation of the law than to follow the law. Trump is an egomaniac. The fact that he doesn t like to employ people whose priority is our country should be all the proof we need that Trump has no desire to serve our country. He never has, beginning with the fact that Trump avoided the draft.It s doubtful that Trump actively dislikes veterans, but it s clear he doesn t care about them. He would happily and haphazardly send them into war zones, perhaps because a world leader hurt his feelings.The fact that he doesn t like vets working for him is only the tip of the iceberg. For a man who has planned on running for president for at least a few years, he s done little to beef up his image as a patriot. The Republican party is supposedly the party of veterans (of course, we wouldn t know it by how they vote, but they think they love the veterans), but Trump gave zero of his personal money to veterans groups, and his foundation donated a paltry $57,000. As Forbes Magazine notes, Trump once demanded that CNN give veterans $5 million for Trump to appear at a debate. They didn t, but that would be $494,000,000 than his foundation has given.As I said, the media is finally beginning to look critically at Trump, but it s time they start calling these things what they are: scandals. They might even qualify for a  gate.

 Here’s The Latest Reason Conservatives Are Calling Michelle Obama A N***** (SCREENSHOTS),"It s official: No one in the Obama family can do or say anything without the Stupid Part of America calling them n*ggers. As she gave her final, powerful commencement speech as First Lady, Michelle Obama dropped a harsh truth on the graduating class of CUNY   the White House was built largely using slave labor: It s the story that I witness every single day, when I wake up in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters two beautiful, black young women head off to school waving goodbye to their father, the President of the United States, the son of a man from Kenya who came here to American to America for the same reasons as many of you: To get an education and improve his prospects in life. Obama is correct. WhiteHousehistory.org notes that black people provided much of the labor that went into building the White House after the U.S. government failed to find qualified workers they could pay to do the work (slave masters were, of course, paid):The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American enslaved and free to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.Stonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government s quarry at Aquia, Virginia. Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the President s House. The slaves joined a work force that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations.The uneducated f*ckwits at Young Conservatives, naturally, complained that the First Lady  whined  about that little slavery issue that we should pretend never happened, calling her  ungrateful  and informing their readers that Obama is  ungrateful  because she correctly noted the history of her current home. You know, Michelle   if you don t like living there, move out,  writes blogger John. S. Roberts, who wonders why  some people  (read:  the blacks ) just  can t move beyond  the fact that their ancestors were owned by white people.Naturally, commenters agreed, calling the First Lady a  n*gger  because that s pretty much the extent of their intelligence. They, too, think she is  ungrateful  because white people did her a favor by shipping her ancestors over here and forcing them to work and endure brutal beatings, rapes, and murders:         Over at right-wing propaganda mill, Weazel Zippers, the sentiment was the same   and they didn t need to write a single word. They just pasted a screenshot of a tweet about the statement.              Conservatives are horrible   and, unfortunately, each and every single one of them will be headed to the polls in November to vote for Trump.

 Black Family BLASTS Trump For Using Photo As ‘Propaganda’: We DON’T Support Him,"The black family whose family reunion photo was used in a tweet by Donald Trump to prove the Republican nominee has support with black voters is pushing back strongly on the reality TV star. Buzzfeed contacted the Perry family after it was revealed that Trump retweeted a post using their family gathering to boost his campaign.BuzzFeed News can reveal the parents in the photograph, pictured at right, are Eddie and Vanessa Perry   and they are not endorsing or publicly supporting any political candidate during the 2016 election.[ ]On Saturday morning, however, a friend texted him a screenshot of Trump s tweet.  When I saw it, I immediately knew it was political propaganda,  he said.The Trump supporter who created the doctored image is apparently the same provocateur who pushed a photo comparison of Heidi Cruz and Melania Trump that attacked Cruz s looks and was promoted by Trump.Trump posted his most recent fraudulent creation after facing heavy criticism for several racial outbursts on Friday. During a rally, Trump referred to a black man in the crowd as  my African-American,  and earlier in the event and on CNN defended his race-based attack on the judge presiding over the court case alleging fraud by Trump University.Trump complained that due to the judge s  Mexican heritage  it is improper for him to judge Trump. In reality, the judge is a native-born American with a Latino heritage, much like Trump is a native-born American with a German heritage.The mainstream leadership of the Republican Party, including Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have endorsed Trump s campaign despite its ongoing use of racist and misogynist rhetoric. Trump has also called for a ban on Muslim migration to the United States, a move which has been slammed by some members of his own party and by prominent Democrats like President Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton.Featured image via WCPO",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Donald Trump: ‘My God, He’s So Stupid’","Paris  first female mayor and the one who brought the city together after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo and November s mass attack, recently made a blunt (and much needed) statement on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.In an interview in which she and London s newest mayor Sadiq Khan, a practicing Muslim, showed a sign of religious unity, Hidalgo plainly stated that Trump is  so stupid  and repeated it: Donald Trump is stupid. My God he s stupid. My God. There s no other way to frame it than that. Trump has not been on good terms with the French ever since their two attacks, which happened 11 months apart. He tweeted that Parisians would have survived the attacks if they were allowed access to open carry. He also blamed France s immigration policy and tolerance of Muslims as a culprit for the attacks.Hidalgo also told reporters that the people of France, of all religions   whether they be Christian or Muslim or even atheists   do not agree with Trump s policies.Not long after the comments were made, Hidalgo and the city of Paris announced that a refugee camp would be opened in the city s northern suburbs. Not only will the camp house migrants and refugees, but it will also lay groundwork for establishing permanent housing for those who come with nothing. Hidalgo blasted France and Europe for failing to  face up to the migrant crisis  that has claimed thousands of lives trying to escape persecution and violence.Hidalgo told reporters that France cannot sit by and continue to watch migrants suffer and die when more could be done to help them: I hear people say won t this act as a magnet. But I think of other countries, like Germany, where they have created conditions to welcome hundreds of thousands of migrants in dignified conditions. We must do the same by taking the full measure of this migrant flow that is flooding Europe. Paris will not sit idly by while the Mediterranean becomes a graveyard for refugees. Hidalgo says the camp will be opened within six weeks time.And like that, another world leader smacks down Donald Trump and shows him how it s really done in the civilized world.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Elizabeth Warren DESTROYS Trump In This Glorious Speech (VIDEO),"The war of words between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren just reached an epic new height. On Saturday, during the Democrats of Massachusetts state convention, Warren did the best thing that you can do to a bully like Trump   gave him a taste of his own medicine.Warren has blasted Trump multiple times over the past few months, yet nothing she has said compares to the no-holds barred verbal punches she threw out during her speech at the convention.Speaking about the giant predatory scheme that was Trump University, Warren likened the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to a sleazy car salesman: It was like a used car dealership except that s not fair to used car dealerships,  Warren told the audience.  His playbook said to look for people with problems; they make good targets. Trump even encouraged his sales force to go after elderly people who were trying to build a little financial security, Warren continued.  Now, Trump University failed and that s no surprise. Think Trump Airlines, Trump Steaks, Trump Magazines, Trump Vodka, Trump Casinos, Trump Mortgage, Trump Games, Trump Travel, Trump Ice, Trump Network, Trump Radio, and Trump New Media Company. These were ordinary folks who were targeted because they had problems and Trump saw they were vulnerable and he could make a buck. Here s a man who builds a business to profit off other peoples  pain. He wants to be Commander-in-Chief, but he s only qualified to be Fraudster-in-Chief. Warren s evisceration of Trump is both thorough and rooted in factual evidence. The speech is a glorious indictment of Trump s fraudulent schemes and should serve as a reminder of just how terrible a Trump administration would be for the United States. Trump s campaign, much like his business schemes, is nothing more the exploitation of those who are desperate enough to believe that a has been reality TV star has anything to offer in the way of being a true leader.You can watch the speech below.Featured image via  video screenshot",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher Explains Socialism To Republicans And It’s Hilarious (VIDEO),"Until recently,  socialism  has been one of the dirtiest words someone could say in the United States. On Friday, Bill Maher slammed the  free market is always right  crowd, saying that it is the time that people begin to recognize that capitalism is a shark that devours everything in its path. Since this year s election features both a socialist and a bonafide capitalist pig, someone needs to explain to the  free market solves everything  crowd that when it comes to socialism, you re soaking in it,  Maher says at the beginning of the segment. Someone needs to explain to the free-market crowd that when it comes to socialism, you re soaking in it. So many Americans hate the word  socialism  but love the concept: Medicare, unemployment, disability, farm subsidies. Forget the transgender debate. What America really needs is a separate bathroom for welfare queens. Maher then goes on to skewer Republicans who speak out against socialism, such as Marco Rubio. Who, as Maher quips, happens to be a representative from Florida, where everyone goes when they retire to live off from social security. It s eaten our democracy. It s eating our middle class. It s eaten our health care system, our prison system, our news media. It s even eaten our food systems so thoroughly that a lot of our food is no longer something that should be eaten. Maher then goes on to talk about capitalism s next big target national parks. Yes, not even our national parks are safe from capitalism s voracious appetite. Due to an 11-million-dollar hole in the budget, naming rights for national parks will now be sold.So get ready to load up the family for a vacation this summer to Hooters Grand Teton national park.You can watch the segment in full, below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Neil DeGrasse Tyson Just Called Trump Supporters Dumb, And It’s Priceless (VIDEO)","It s one thing to go after Donald Trump and how bigoted he is, but it s another to look at why he s gotten to where he is in this election cycle   his voters. If he didn t have a large amount of folks who think he s absolutely ideal for the presidency, well, then he wouldn t be the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.On HBO s Real Time, guest Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and one of the most brilliant people on the planet, told host Bill Maher why and how Trump is so popular, and what we need to do to fix it.He said: As an educator I care about the population and the electorate. And all this attention going to complain about Donald Trump. You re not really complaining about Donald Trump, there s a major portion of the electorate who likes him, and so they are your obvious object of your ire. Then shouldn t you be looking at the educational system that somehow allows people to not think about data, to not think about what is or is not true in this world? Basically calling Trump supporters dumb, because they haven t been properly educated in facts and reality. Thus, their support for a candidate who is pretty much only qualified to be the president of his own fan club, and not the President of the United States.DeGrasse Tyson added: You can knock Trump out of the contest and the population that supports him will just wait for the next one to rise up and you have to beat the next one over the head! And he s absolutely correct. If we don t fix our educational system and start giving people the proper knowledge to discern who should and shouldn t be president, then if it s not Trump, it s just going to be the next raging bigot with absolutely no policy experience.Watch here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rapist Gets Slap On The Wrist Sentence Because Prison Would Be Too ‘Severe’,"Brock Allen Turner, a 20-year-old former student at Stanford University, was sentenced to six months in jail for raping an unconscious woman on campus in January 2015.The prosecutor in the case recommended that Turner should receive a sentence of six years in prison. However, judge Aaron Persky sentenced Turner to six months in jail saying that  a prison sentence would have a severe impact on him   I think he will not be a danger to others.  Persky also cited Turner s lack of a criminal record and his young age as justifications for the short sentence.The victim in the case is a 23-year-old that had a blood-alcohol level that was twice the legal limit. She has no memory of the incident. Her testimony in the trial is public and is a powerful indictment of Turner s actions. The testimony begins with the 23-year-old woman saying  You don t know me, but you ve been inside me, and that s why we re here today.  She recounts the horror of having to find out that she was found with her clothes turn off from her behind a dumpster in public.During the testimony, she addressed Turner personally telling him that: You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt. She concluded her testimony, speaking to all women who have been victims of sexual assault: And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. As the author Anne Lamott once wrote,  Lighthouses don t go running all over an island looking for boats to save  they just stand there shining.  Although I can t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you. It seems that in this case that the punishment did not fit the crime that was committed. What Turner did is not something that can be undone. Once again, the United States criminal system has been exposed as a cruel joke. It s a system where criminals get away with a slap on the wrist and non-violent offenders can be locked away for life.Featured image from Stanford University",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Tweets FAKE Photo Of Black Supporters After Racist Meltdown,"The morning after getting pounded for several racial outbursts he made on Friday, Donald Trump retweeted an image of a black family with the caption  American Families for Trump. The problem is, the photo of the family is not from a pro-Trump event or gathering. The picture is actually from a news story about a black family reunion in 2015.The photo fakery was pointed out by Mark Czerniec.The episode is part of a pattern with Trump, who often retweets images created by his supporters that more often than not are either conspiracy theories, complete fakes, racist or some combination of the three. They reflect a lot of the values the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has mainstreamed in his short political career.Trump has expressed strong belief in the conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States, that climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese, and in the idea that immigrants are mostly criminals and rapists.Pushing the photo of fake black supporters comes after a day in which Trump pointed to a black man at a campaign rally in California and referred to him as  my African-American. In the same rally, Trump tripled-down on his racist assertion that the judge overseeing his Trump University case cannot be fair or impartial because he has  Mexican heritage  and at the same time Trump is  building a wall. In response to his racial outburst, Hillary Clinton noted,  It makes no sense to me. The judge was born in Indiana. Yes, he s of Mexican heritage. Donald Trump is apparently of German heritage. What does that mean? We are all Americans. The most senior Republican in the country, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, also condemned Trump s racist attack on the judge   but Trump has been making the allegation for months already, and Ryan endorsed Trump for the presidency.Featured image via Flickr",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren SMASHES Trump Over His $100 Million Ties To A Foreign Bank,"Donald Trump s many business ventures mean that he s got business relationships with many banks, including Wall Street banks. He could easily waltz into the White House owing at least $100 million to Deutsche Bank, which creates a massive conflict of interest that many have pointed out. Deutsche Bank has been heavily penalized by our government for repeated violations, and having business ties to Trump means they could whip him into letting them off the hook just to preserve his businesses, creating a massive conflict of interest.Now, anti-Wall Street crusader Elizabeth Warren has joined the chorus of voices decrying this, slamming Trump and his relationship with Deutsche Bank in a statement to Mother Jones: The job of the President is to enforce the law fairly. If a serial lawbreaker like Deutsche Bank is caught manipulating markets again, how would Trump hold it accountable knowing that the bank had the power to pull the plug on his own businesses? That s a question that should worry every American. These financial entanglements along with many of his other ongoing business concerns and arrangements present huge conflicts of interest. Deutsche Bank settled with U.S. regulators for things like fixing metals prices and rigging interest rates   that s what Warren means when she calls them a  serial lawbreaker,  but they re fighting us on other things and have been for years. They re among the banks that screwed the little guy that Trump claims to stand for in order to enrich themselves.Having Trump in the White House could easily allow them to put our regulators over a barrel, and he ll have to break his promises to the little guy.Two weeks ago, Warren attacked Trump for saying that he d made money off of the 2008 economic crash, which is something for which everyone should attack him because that s just sick for a presidential candidate to say. She said back then that Trump only cares about Trump, and those statements disqualify him from being president of the U.S.She also went after him for saying that Dodd-Frank put too many regulations on Wall Street bankers. She wanted to know whether he could even name three things that Dodd-Frank does, and said,  Seriously, someone ask him.  Chances are, he doesn t have a clue.What his businesses owe Deutsche Bank should disqualify him from the presidency because the President of the United States can t be in a position where foreign entities, whether they re governments or private organizations, can put him or her in a bind over regulation. Elizabeth Warren knows what s what here, and that s why her attacks are escalating. Trump can t be trusted in the White House.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WHOA! Republican Governor Just Compared Donald Trump To Mass Murderer Dylann Roof (VIDEO),"When you think of anti-Trump people, South Carolina s governor, Nikki Haley, is probably not the first person to come to mind. Haley is anti-government, anti-choice, anti-civil rights and anti-regulation. In other words, she is the perfect Republican, but she s no fan of Donald Trump.In the past, Haley has said that Trump  has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk.  Sure, that s not exactly an endorsement, but then, she certainly seemed to leave other options open.On Thursday, though, Haley minced no words whatsoever. She compared Trump to Dylann Roof, who is accused of killing nine black churchgoers in what was clearly a racist attack. These comments are possibly worse than any of his opponents have dared levy against him:South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Thursday she wishes Donald Trump communicated differently because bad things result from divisive rhetoric, as evidenced by last June s massacre in Charleston.The Republican governor said divisive speech motivated Dylann Roof to gun down nine black parishioners at historic Emanuel AME Church. Police have said the white 22-year-old charged with their killings wanted to start a race war.The Confederate flag that Roof was seen brandishing in photos had to be removed from the Statehouse grounds, she said, and she supports sending the rebel flag in The Citadel s chapel to a museum too. But she opposes renaming buildings or monuments associated with the state s racist past.Haley, who endorsed then-candidate Marco Rubio ahead of South Carolina s primary, said she has vocally criticized Trump because  I know what that rhetoric can do. I saw it happen. Source: Crooks and LiarsHere is the video:Haley is right. Since Trump began running for president, hate crimes against Muslims have escalated. He inspired at least one hate crime against a Latino man. Trump is certainly winning with the white supremacist voting bloc.None of this is exactly new and in fact, Trump may be more of a symptom than a cause. According to the Southern Policy Law Center, extremist groups have been growing, and that started before Trump announced his run for the presidency.The timing doesn t excuse Trump from blame, though. Like any good marketing person (and we have to admit that Trump is that, if nothing else), Trump saw the insidious trend and ran with it. It didn t hurt his cause that he was already very comfortable with racist, xenophobic rhetoric. It didn t hurt his cause that he s probably sincere in his hatred, but as the SPLC notes, it s the job of our leaders to act like adults. After seeing the bloodshed that defined 2015, our politicians should have worked to defuse this anger and bring us together as a nation,  Mark Potok, editor of the report, wrote.  Unfortunately, the carnage did little to dissuade some political figures from spouting incendiary rhetoric about minorities. In fact, they frequently exploited the anger and polarization across the country for political gain. Source: PS MagThat is the most dangerous kind of cynicism. It s clear that Trump doesn t care if a civil war breaks out. Hell, he d be cheering people on. Trump has one goal and only one goal, and that is to become Dictator in Chief. It doesn t matter who is killed along the way.Featured image via video screen capture.

" Report: Clinton May Pick Elizabeth Warren As Her V.P., Harry Reid Leading Effort","Speculation has been mounting recently that Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton will choose Senator Elizabeth Warren as her running mate.Some Democrats have been weary on the idea, seeing it as weakening the Democrat s chances of taking back the Senate in November (Massachusetts has a Republican governor).For a while, such a move was up in the air. But a recent report from the Boston Globe shows that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been reviewing the Massachusetts rules for filling a U.S. Senate vacancy:Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has been actively reviewing Massachusetts rules for filling a US Senate vacancy, another indication of the seriousness with which Democrats are gaming out the possibility of Elizabeth Warren joining likely presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s ticket.The upshot of Reid s review is that Senate Democrats may have found an avenue to block or at least narrow GOP Governor Charlie Baker s ability to name a temporary replacement and prevent the Senate from flipping to a Democratic majority if Warren were to leave the chamber. That suggests the issue is not as significant an obstacle as Reid previously feared.A source close with Reid told the Globe that he is researching all avenues to keep Warren s name alive and well in the hunt for a highly anticipated vice presidential slot that will come within the next several months. Reid s actions also come as a surprise to the Democratic circles, as he just recently went on the record saying he does not think the former Secretary should pick a candidate from a state with a Republican governor. As the Globe notes:In the event of a Senate or House vacancy, Massachusetts currently requires a special election to be held within 145 to 160 days. In the interim, the governor has the authority to appoint a successor. But Reid s team has identified a portion of the law that allows an officeholder to start the special election clock by filing a resignation letter, but also announcing an intention to vacate the seat at a later date.In theory, Warren could file such a letter 145 days before the Jan. 20, 2017 inauguration and successfully block Baker from picking any temporary replacement.But should she do that, run as a V.P. candidate with Clinton and lose, Warren would have to run for election in that vacant seat.Given her immense popularity in the state, such a feat wouldn t be too hard for the liberal firebrand. Not surprisingly, Warren s office has not commented on the vice presidential speculations.The best thing to happen to the Democratic Party would be to have Elizabeth Warren on the White House ticket. She s already proven she can get under Donald Trump s skin, and she has already proven that she knows the issues and how to solve America s problems. Who better to help take on the sexist fraud that is Donald Trump. The Democrats would be electrified like they were in 2008 with Warren on the ticket. Democrats shouldn t waste this opportunity (unless Warren is adamant she doesn t want the job).Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 May Jobs Report And Unemployment Rate Bleak – Guess Who’s To Blame? (Hint: It’s Not Obama),"After a shaky jobs report in April, May had a downright terrible showing, on which Republicans have already pounced as evidence of supposedly  failed  Democratic policy. They re busy going after both Obama and Hillary Clinton for this dismal report as hard as they can. In fact, GOP chairman Reince Priebus tweeted:Devastating jobs report showing weakest hiring in 5 yrs is sign we need to move away from failed Obama policies Clinton is promising to keep  Reince Priebus (@Reince) June 3, 2016Donald Trump, never one to pass up an opportunity to pretend he knows everything, pounced, too, tweeting: Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2016President Obama has been working hard to polish his image on the economy, and this report could very easily tarnish and dent it. That s especially true with the paradox of a falling unemployment rate paired with an abysmal jobs report. The falling unemployment rate is almost entirely due to more than 450,000 people dropping out of the labor force in May. That makes it a misleading statistic, and therefore, a black eye for Obama. Right?Wrong. There s evidence suggesting that someone else could be to blame for this, like Donald Trump and his supporters.Uneducated white people a.k.a the average Trump voter had ten times the impact on the unemployment rate that they should have, given the size of their demographic compared to the overall population. It s true that employment in this demographic has been destroyed by globalization and automation, which is why they support Trump. They like his protectionist mentality and his business credentials (if, indeed, they can be called that).While yes, exit polls during certain states  primaries showed that Trump s voters may actually be better off economically than their Democratic counterparts, some of that may be due to the fact that Republican voters tend to be wealthier than Democratic voters. They also tend to turn out for primaries far more than Democratic voters.Other analyses have found that Trump s main demographic is, in fact, the poor, white, uneducated, working-class male, despite what exit polls from state primaries said. Trump solidified his hold on the GOP s nomination in May, and his job-creation rhetoric resonates heavily with this group. Could his promises of bringing jobs back be making people drop out of the labor force?The jobs report showed serious declines in both construction and manufacturing, which are two of the main industries in which these people tend to work. Trump keeps promising he ll bring their jobs back from overseas, and he ll spur all kinds of economic activity here, and these voters eat it up like candy.Dropping out of the labor force and voting Republican implies that these voters think others should just pick themselves up by their bootstraps (finish high school, get a degree, learn a new trade, etc.) but they themselves shouldn t have to. They can sit and wait until Trump is elected, and then their jobs will come flowing back, they ll be working again, and all will be right with the world.There s no way to know for sure whether this is true right now, but Trump s outsized influence over these people could easily have convinced them to drop out of the labor force and just wait for him to get elected and solve their employment woes for them.Featured image by Clyde Robinson.

 Hispanic GOP Commentator Slams Trump For His Racist Comments And Fraudulent University,"Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist, commentator, and Hispanic woman, seems to despise her party s presidential candidate   and for good reason.While appearing on CNN s The Situation Room, Navarro went on a tangent against Donald Trump after his recent comments regarding Trump University judge Gonzalo Cruiel. Saying that Trump  changes more positions than yoga,  Navarro blasted the billionaire mogul for his racism and blatant disregard of the Constitution: I gotta  tell you, I m a lawyer, I am a Hispanic   it is offensive from a legal perspective, it is highly offensive as a Hispanic. What he is doing is wagging the dog. He is trying to distract from the fact he has got a problem with a case where there are allegations that his business is a scam and a fraud.  How dare he, how dare he question a judge s responsibility, a judge s adherence to the Constitution because he is of Mexican descent. Then Navarro got personal, and cut Donald Trump to the bone with some cold hard facts about Mexicans and people of Hispanic descent: This man was born in eastern Chicago. He s an American citizen. He is just as American as Donald Trump. Mexican Americans bleed just as any other American when they go to war. They bled, just as any other American on 9/11. They fight for America, they are America. And what he is doing is disgusting, I am livid about it. If this is his strategy to win over Hispanics, he s got a hell of a wake up call coming to him in November. Only Donald Trump could piss off two influential Hispanic Republican women   first Susana Martinez, and now Ana Navarro. What a great strategy Trump has, as Navarro sarcastically pointed out.Currently, only 14 percent of Hispanics have a favorable rating of Donald Trump. Among nonwhite women, which includes Hispanics and Latinas, the number is a record low 9 percent.And what is Trump doing to get their vote? Absolutely nothing. No wonder Navarro is pissed. Republicans had a chance to reach out to Hispanic and Latino voters after their 2012 autopsy and they chose the guy who would do the exact opposite.Navarro is right, he is wagging the dog. Trump honestly believes he can win with just the white male vote. And Navarro is right again   he is going to have one huge wake up call on election day.Watch Navarro s scathing take down of Trump:.@ananavarro takes on @realDonaldTrump for his comments about judge in Trump University case https://t.co/NZgH3zkuxC https://t.co/m9IMVpxzy1  The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) June 3, 2016Featured image via screen capture",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘My African-American’: Watch Donald Trump’s Racist Meltdown (VIDEO),"Donald Trump pointed out a black person in the crowd at a rally in Redding, CA, and said,  Look at my African-American. Trump s bizarre comment comes a day after Secretary Hillary Clinton eviscerated him in a foreign policy address and labeled him as  unfit  for the presidency. Clinton pressed her attack earlier the next day with a release pointing out that Trump  literally said all those things  after he claimed she had simply made up his strange positions on world affairs.The Clinton campaign noted,  Some of the comments she referenced are so ignorant, incoherent or outrageous, it could be hard to believe they actually came out of the mouth of the GOP s presidential nominee. But they literally did. It also follows a week in which he was criticized by President Obama, who while not using his name also ripped apart his divisive rhetoric and ideas while touting the economic recovery in Elkhart, Indiana. Obama said Trump s proposal to roll back regulations on Wall Street was  crazy,  and that his plan to deport 11 million immigrants was simply a  fantasy. Obama noted,  If that is what you are concerned about, the economy, the debate is not even close. On the same day, Trump doubled down on his criticism of federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case in which former students allege they were swindled out of their money. Trump repeatedly claimed, in an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper, that the judge could not be impartial because of his  Mexican heritage  even when he was told that the man is an American citizen born in Indiana.Hillary Clinton responded to Trump s smear of the judge s racial background, pointing out the is  a man born in Indiana, which last time I checked was part of America. Trump s remarks on the judge were rejected by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who endorsed Trump for president.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michelle Obama EVISCERATES Hateful Trump In Final Commencement Speech And It Is GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"Our beautiful First Lady Michelle Obama used her final commencement address to take aim at GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, and it was absolutely glorious. Taking to the stage at the City College of New York before the graduates, Mrs. Obama pulled no punches. There was no need to mention Trump by name, as there could be no doubt as to whom she was talking about. She began: Here in America, we don t give into our fears. We don t build up walls to keep people out, because we know that our greatness has always depended on contributions from people who were born elsewhere but sought out this country and made it their home. After that, Mrs. Obama continued to take aim at him: Some folks out there today seem to have a very different perspective. They seem to view our diversity as a threat to be contained rather than as a resource to be tapped. They tell us to be afraid of those who are different, to be suspicious of those with whom we disagree.They act as if name-calling is an acceptable substitute for thoughtful debate, as if anger and intolerance should be our default state, rather than the optimism and openness that have always been the engine of our progress.I have seen what happens when ideas like these take hold. I have seen how leaders who rule by intimidation, leaders who demonize and dehumanize entire groups of people, often do so because they have nothing else to offer. That is not who we are. It seems that no one, even our First Lady, can resist slamming Trump. Michelle Obama has largely been quiet on the 2016 race. She has endorsed no one, and she has slammed no one   until now. That really says something about how out of control Trump is, that she felt compelled to do so. This speech also makes a huge impact with its timing, because everyone is still talking about Thursday s brilliantly fiery speech from Hillary Clinton, in which the Democratic frontrunner laid into Trump like no one has ever done before.Of course, Mrs. Obama could not, as a sitting First Lady rather than a political candidate, use a commencement speech to go after Trump by name in the brutal fashion that Secretary Clinton did. However, that doesn t matter. Her message was loud, clear, and true: Trump s ideas are dangerous, and they have no place in America at all, much less in the White House.Watch a few clips of this incredible speech below, via The Hill: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Legal Scholars Worried Trump Would Break Laws, Be Worse Than Nixon","What happens when conservative lawyers from the Cato Institute, Georgetown University and the Hoover Institution get together?Well, besides their opposition to Obamacare, they all come to the conclusion that Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for President of the United States, is bad for the law.In a recent article from the New York Times, these lawyers, all politically conservative, lambasted the billionaire mogul for his attacks against the First Amendment, individuals, the separation of powers, and the rule of law all together.In other words, these lawyers, without saying it, contend that Trump would be more crooked, more criminal, and more disastrous than Richard Nixon.Pointing out that his promise to tighten libel laws undermines the First Amendment, and that his proposal to ban Muslims from coming into the U.S. violates the Constitution s guarantees of religious freedom, due process and equal protection, attorney Ilya Sharpiro   who works with the Cato Institute   said plainly,  Who knows what Donald Trump with a pen and phone would do. But it was Volokh Conspiracy (a conservative legal blog) writer and attorney David Post who had the harshest words for Trump. Saying his comments regarding Gonzalo P. Cruiel, the judge presiding over the Trump University case, resembled  authoritarianism,  Post argues that these outbursts disqualified him: This is how authoritarianism starts, with a president who does not respect the judiciary. You can criticize the judicial system, you can criticize individual cases, you can criticize individual judges. But the president has to be clear that the law is the law and that he enforces the law. That is his constitutional obligation. So not only does Trump hate the law, he has vowed to restore Trump University after the judge s decision. This blatant disregard for the rule of law should send chills down every American s spine. If Donald Trump, a now public, political figure and possibly future president, can openly disregard the law, who s to say the average American can t?Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown who was the architect behind the first major challenge to Obamacare, feels Trump doesn t know his limits: You would like a president with some idea about constitutional limits on presidential powers, on congressional powers, on federal powers, and I doubt he has any awareness of such limits. Richard Epstein, attorney with the Hoover Institution, was more blunt: I don t think he cares about separation of powers at all   I think Obama s been much worse on that issue [constitutional limits] pretty consistently, and his underlings have been even more so. But I think Trump doesn t even think there s an issue to worry about. He just simply says whatever I want to do I will do. I never thought the day would come when conservative lawyers would view Trump more dangerously than they do President Obama.Maybe Trump really does suck. Perhaps Republicans will begin to see the light when Hillary Clinton thrashes him on the debate stage.Featured image via Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Matt Damon SHREDS Trump And Wall Street Bankers During MIT Commencement (VIDEO),"While speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) commencement ceremony, Matt Damon took a moment to take a quick jab at Donald Trump. He suggested that maybe we re living in an alternate environment. One that is simulated and controlled by others, because how else could one explain Trump being the Republican presidential nominee.During his impassioned speech, Damon also told the audience of new graduates: There is more at stake today than in every story that has ever been told. He told the graduates that it is up to them and those like them to get out there and start tackling the world s many problems. However, he especially spoke of one problem, and that is what bankers did to millions of Americans during the housing crisis that took place nearly a decade ago.Damon said: Let me say this to the bankers   specifically the ones that brought you the biggest heist in history. Adding: It was theft, and you knew it. It was fraud, and you knew it. And you know what else? We know that you knew it. Also driving the point home that if we were to pass these bankers on the street, they need to know that we have absolutely no respect for them.Damon also added one very important point: I don t know if justice is coming for you in this life or the next. But if it does come in this life, her name will be Elizabeth Warren. Hell yeah it will be, and Warren, of course, being the U.S. Senator from the great state of Massachusetts where MIT resides.Damon, like many of us, is fed up with how there are rules for bankers, and then somehow different rules for the rest of us. And he also knows that there are those who are fighting for us, those like Senator Warren, who will try to make sure another financial crisis like the one a decade ago never happens again.Watch a clip from Damon s speech here: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Top Adviser Just Fantasized About Waterboarding Hillary Clinton On CNN (VIDEO),"When CNN held a discussion about the investigation surrounding Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server, Trump campaign senior adviser Barry Bennett stunned host Kate Bolduan and everyone watching by casually mentioning waterboarding.Bennett said: She has continued to lie about it. She told us the lawyers signed off on it. The Inspector General said that s not true. She said she would cooperate with all the investigations. She stonewalled the IG and now everyone s taken the fifth. You couldn t get the truth out of Hillary if you waterboarded her! Questioning Clinton s honesty is a strange thing coming from an advisor to Trump   there is an endless amount of evidence showing Trump lying through his teeth on just about any subject, whether it s denying he said something or fabricating facts. And physically punishing Clinton is the golden standard for the Trump campaign   the presumptive Republican nominee has repeatedly threatened to throw Clinton in jail over her emails.Once Bennett said the word  waterboard,  Bolduan was nearly speechless, and obviously could not believe what she d just witnessed. All she could manage to get out was,  What? Bennett shamelessly repeated it for her:  You couldn t get the truth out of her with a waterboard. In complete disbelief, Bolduan said,  And you brought in waterboarding! Hearing this from Bennett is no surprise. Throughout his entire campaign, Trump has mentioned waterboarding and shown a disturbing interest in torture techniques that are  worse than waterboarding . In March, right after the Brussels terror attacks, Trump said, I d go further. I d listen to the military people, but I d go further. And by the way, torture works. In April, the offensive candidate even said,  I love it, I think it s great  when he spoke about waterboarding. And the apple doesn t fall far from the tree   Trump s son Eric once said that waterboarding was  no different  than  what happens in frat houses every day.  It s really no wonder why Trump attracts such violent advisors, delegates and voters.You can watch this ridiculous interview below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Armed White Thugs Hunt Down Black Teen Until He Collapses And Dies,"A 16-year-old is dead after a group of white thugs threatened to gun him down and chased him until he collapsed and died from an asthma attack.Dayshen McKenzie and his friend Harry met up with the group behind a restaurant and an argument over a girl escalated into threats of violence and a chase that had McKenzie running for his life.According to Harry,  The guy said,  You got a problem?  And my (friend) said,  You got a problem?  and it went on. They left, and they came back three cars deep. The guy in the first car had a gun. The white thugs literally tried to hunt McKenzie down like a wild animal but he forgot his inhaler that day so when he needed it he didn t have it. But he wouldn t have had an asthma attack in the first place had he not been chased down by a bunch of gun-wielding racists.Former police officer Diane Fatigati came forward as a witness after trying to save McKenzie with the use of CPR. But she was unable to revive the teen. To me, it s murder,  she said.  They were chasing him   that s a crime. You re hunting them because they re black   You re calling them a n****r. To me, it s a hate crime. McKenzie s mother, Tisha Richardson is sad and angry over the senseless killing of her son. I want justice for him. Somebody should be held accountable,  she said.Needless to say, police are investigating McKenzie s death but yet another young black man is dead at the hands of racists in 21st century America.But we can likely expect even more of these killings if Donald Trump becomes president. After all, he encourages violence and intimidation of black people and has even promised to pay the legal bills for supporters who are arrested when they actually do what Trump tells them to do.In addition, Trump has made racist rhetoric more of a norm that is no longer shocking people like it once did in political campaigns of the past.You can bet white supremacists are salivating at the thought of Trump becoming president because they think they ll have a license to intimidate and kill black people whenever they want without consequences. Because right now, the only way they can do that is to get hired by the police.Featured Image: New York Daily News ",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Obama Just EMBARRASSED The NRA By Ripping Apart Every Single Pro-Gun Myth,"For the first four years of Barack Obama s presidency I chided him for being too nice to the Stupid Part of America. As they spread ridiculous conspiracy theories about him   that he s really from Kenya, that he once worked as a  gay prostitute  to support his cocaine habit, that he s secretly a shapeshifting lizard person, and, yes, that he is coming for every single gun any day now   the President opted to sit back and absorb the attacks as he focused on more important issues. Eventually, it seems, he realized that as long as he entertained such monumentally stupid notions without taking a few minutes of his time to obliterate them those who spend their lives spewing such nonsense will not give him the opportunity to focus on what is actually important.Lately, the claws have come out. The President is no longer willing to simply accept the lies spread by the NRA, Fox News, Republican politicians, and other right-wing groups without stepping in to correct the record. Gun shop owner Doug Rhude is a product of the misinformation throws around by the Right. During a Q+A session following PBS News Hour, we were treated to the perfect example of what happens when misinformation, lies, and bigotry are allowed to bounce around a bubble for the better part of a decade:Knowing that we apply common sense to other issues in our society, specifically like holding irresponsible people accountable for their actions when they drink and drive and kill somebody, and we do that without restricting control of cars and cells phones to the rest of us, the good guys, why then do you and Hillary want to control and restrict and limit gun manufacturers, gun owners and responsible use of guns and ammunition to the rest of us, the good guys, instead of holding the bad guys accountable for their actions?As is customary, Rhude used Chicago as his go-to example of something, demanding to know why  thugs  (the go-to conservative replacement word for  n*ggers ) in the city are hell-bent on murdering each other. After taking a moment to process the almost off-the-scale stupidity contained in Rhude s statement/question, Obama politely yet brutally hit him with a massive truth bomb:First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks  guns is just not true.And I don t care how many times the NRA says it. I m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I have been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country.And at no point have I ever, ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it s just not true. What I have said is precisely what you suggested, which is, why don t we treat this like every other thing that we use?  Obama continued, pointing to another favorite right-wing go-to topic: auto fatality rates. Previously, conservatives were able to mindlessly point out that  more people are killed by cars  than guns. Unfortunately for them and fortunately for the rest of us, regulations and laws have decreased the automobile fatality rate to beneath the level of gun violence. The auto fatality rate has actually dropped precipitously, drastically, since I was a kid,  Obama said, asking rhetorically what is the cause of that. The President informed Rhude that   thanks to numerous regulations, lots of studies, and a strong and continuing effort    we have been able to reduce the number of people who die in cars. No one took everyone s cars away   we simply arrived at the common sense decision to actually deal with the problem. We are not allowed  to do any of that when it comes to guns because if you propose anything, it is suggested that we re trying to take away gun rights and impose martial law,  Obama pointed out, adding that we can t so much as study gun violence because Republicans in Congress have actually passed laws preventing this public health issue from being researched. The notion is that by studying it the same way we do with traffic accidents somehow it s going to lead to everyone s guns being confiscated,  Obama pointed out. I just came from a meeting today in the Situation Room in which I got people who we know have been on ISIL Web sites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens, and we re allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun,  the President told Rhude.  This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer. And if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much   as many weapons and ammo as he can, nothing s prohibiting him from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is. Then he dropped the hammer:So, sir, I just have to say, respectfully, that there is a way for us to have commonsense gun laws. There is a way for us to make sure that lawful, responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use them for sporting, hunting, protecting yourself, but the only way we re going to do that is if we don t have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the Second Amendment. And that s how the issue too often gets framed.While it is unlikely that Rhude, or any other right-wingers who heard the President s words, learned a single thing, one thing is for certain: It s nice to see Barack Obama standing up for himself.Watch it yourself below: Featured image via video screen captures",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Morning Joe’s Mika DESTROY Paul Ryan For Endorsing Trump: ‘He Sold Out’ (VIDEO),"Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has been getting slammed ever since the moment he announced his endorsement of Donald Trump   and that s not going to stop anytime soon.On Friday morning, Morning Joe s Mika Brzezinski didn t hesitate to rip Ryan a new one for being  pathetic  and  weak  enough to cave in and support the disgraced presumptive Republican nominee. A visibly frustrated Brzezinski said,  Yet another Republican goes down, for no reason, with no actual information about what convinced him. Guest panelist Mark Halperin tried to defend Ryan against Brzezinski s wrath by saying that Ryan basically  had no choice,  but Brzezinski wasn t having any of it. She went right into a scathing rant about what a bad move it was. She said: To your line about Ryan had no choice, which is pathetic, because this election is unlike any other, the rule book has been thrown out. So that no choice thing? Put it back into the 80 s and 90 s and early 2000 s, because there are new rules.This is just so sad. Paul Ryan   the guy who I think is the Republican s great hope   is an honest, good, principled man of character. What is he   if he had a good reason, I m all for it.Brzezinski criticized Ryan for not being able to  live by his principles  and had a very special message for the House Speaker: Paul? He s not going to do anything for you because you did this. He s not going to pay you back. It s pathetic, he sold out. I m sorry, he did have a choice and he made one that was weak. You can watch Brzezinski tear Ryan a new one below:This is a definite change from Morning Joe s history of supporting Trump. Earlier this year, the hosts were humiliated and exposed when leaked audio was circulated of Brzezinki and co-host Joe Scarborough expressing their support and fawning all over Trump during commercial breaks when he was on their show. Perhaps that s changed now, unless this is just another facade   but judging from Trump s reaction, it might have been real.

 Hillary Responds To Trump On Twitter And HILARIOUSLY Fact Checks Him (TWEET),"To say Hillary Clinton wiped the floor with Donald Trump during her foreign policy speech is being far too polite. She demolished him. She hit him, and hit him repeatedly   hard. Going after him in regards to everything he s said over the past year and how utterly dangerous and reprehensible he would be as Commander-in-Chief.She hit him so hard, in fact, that Trump got very, very flustered. He responded in a speech clearly sweating and angrily shaking the podium. I mean, after all, how dare a woman call him out so astutely and with such bravado.Trump also took to Twitter the next day still not over it, and still not knowing how to spell teleprompter. Trump tweeted out: In Crooked Hillary s telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest! In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2016Noticing the tweet was the Hillary campaign, who quickly tweeted out not only that everything she said was true, but fact checked him line by line. It was pure poetry, saying: You literally said all those things. Then posted a link to everything that was said.You literally said all those things. https://t.co/6VX5AfR7gL https://t.co/U8LfWdPU7x  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 3, 2016For example, Hillary said during her speech: He says he doesn t have to listen to our generals or ambassadors, because he has   quote    a very good brain. She then lists exactly what Trump said:TRUMP:  I m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I ve said a lot of things my primary consultant is myself And there are far too many to list here, so go check out every line by line fact check HERE.Something tells me as the election heats up, and if Hillary is the Democratic nominee, we re going to be seeing a lot more of this, and it s going to be f*cking awesome.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt   Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Explains A Lot: Donald Trump’s Son Says He Gets His Political Views From A Michael Bay Movie,"Director Michael Bay is perhaps best known for his over-the-top, CGI-crazy  Transformers  movies. He regularly deals in the kind of popcorn action flicks that allows an audience to turn their brains off and just go along for a ride. Or, if your Eric Trump, son of Donald, Michael Bay can change your life.Over Memorial Day weekend, Eric came across Michael Bay s Republican-friendly take on the Benghazi  scandal  called  13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi . It blew his mind.Eric Trump and his wife, Lara, apparently spent part of the Memorial Day weekend watching the Benghazi flick, which Trump s son said made him  literally livid. I think in order to vote in this next election, you should have to watch that movie. I was livid,  Trump said.  She left these guys on a rooftop in the middle of Benghazi getting shot at, having mortars drop on their head because she wouldn t pick up a phone call in the middle of the night. Like father, like son. Donald Trump has routinely slammed Hillary Clinton s response to Benghazi by pushing the conspiracy theory that claimed she ignored her phone when the frantic embassy staff tried to get help. This is an idea that Michael Bay   whose own political views oscillate between ultra-conservative and slow-motion shots of American flags waving in the wind   reinforced in his movie by adding a feckless bureaucrat character whose sole purpose in the story was to get in the way of the light beer drinking patriots driving to save the embassy. In a scathing review of the film, critic Jason Bailey at Flavorwire aptly summed up the  cartoon bullshit  Bay tried to pass for political messaging. It s like catnip for conservatives.In fact, the film s real villains aren t the faceless, nameless Libyans attacking these outposts; it s the pencil-pushing, weaselly base chief (David Constabile), who insults and obstructs our heroes at every turn.  We have the best and brightest minds from Harvard and Yale,  he tells newbie Jack (John Krasinski), of the agents on their base, so  the best thing for you is to stay out of their way.  Fuckin  smart people, am I right? He also, of course, insists there s no danger to be found, and orders the team to stand down and wait after they get word of the attack on Ambassador Stevens   a detail refuted by a GOP-controlled congressional committee, as reported by Fox News, but there I go getting political.Of course, basing your political views on Michael Bay s portrayal of a contentious event means you are inevitably going to miss some stuff: Like many of the facts. Here s how Factcheck.org ruled on the accusation that Clinton was AWOL in the immediate aftermath of the attacks:Trump is entitled to his opinion about Clinton s response to the Benghazi attack, but the evidence shows Clinton was fully engaged in the immediate response. And subsequent congressional investigations concluded the government response to the attack   including Clinton s   was appropriate. Clinton testified that even after she went home that night, she remained awake all night, engaged and focused on the situation. Since there is no way to independently verify that, we ll let readers decide for themselves, but we would note Trump has not provided any evidence to contradict Clinton s account.Both Donald and Eric are wrong. And wrong in ways that only people who routinely get their news from tabloids and right-wing chain emails can be. Even a cursory look into the actual details of what went on during the Benghazi attacks would show a situation that was far more nuanced and tragic than the black-and-white nonsense they are describing. Ironically, it s this very ham-fisted attempt to lash out at Hillary Clinton that truly does a disservice to the three Americans that died at the embassy. Their deaths are being used by the Trump family to service Donald s agenda. There is nothing more despicable than that.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This HILARIOUS Cartoon Shows What Happened Just Before Paul Ryan Endorsed Trump,"Political cartoons are usually awesomely hilarious, and they also generally have more than a little truth to them. Case in point   a cartoon posted on the Washington Post s opinion blog today that needed no words when showing just what happened as House Speaker Paul Ryan finally lost what little spine he had and endorsed Donald Trump.You see, Speaker Ryan, for a very short time, actually strongly resisted Trump. He rightly called Trump s plans to ban all Muslims from traveling to the United States  Un-American,  and he also called Trump out for not immediately disavowing the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon David Duke and other white supremacist organizations. However, all of Paul Ryan s concerns about Trump have suddenly gone out the window, and the spineless Speaker of the House is now happily endorsing the brainless, bombastic, racist narcissist who is now the official 2016 GOP presidential nominee.The thing is, Ryan s infamous spinelessness is what is behind this endorsement. From his previous statements, he clearly knows how absolutely dangerous Trump is, but he doesn t care. He, like other GOPers who initially resisted Trump are content to put party before country   and hell, even before the safety of the world and the human race as we know it   and happily take it up the ass from Trump if it means keeping Democrats out of power.So, without further ado, here is just what happened as Paul Ryan jumped on the Trump Train:And there you have it. Keep kissing the dirtiest asshole in America, Speaker Ryan. Goodness knows it s what you deserve.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New Poll Has Clinton Beating Trump By Eleven Points – Her Largest Lead Yet,"While the media continues to push the narrative that Trump is catching up to Clinton, painting a  doomsday  scenario for Clinton s campaign, such a sentiment couldn t be further from the truth.A new poll from Reuters/Ipsos shows Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton leading the Republican candidate Donald Trump by eleven points (her largest lead yet), 46-35, while 19 percent weren t sure or responded with someone else. This newest poll shows even more good news for Clinton: just last week, the same poll had her up by only five points.Clinton also (not surprisingly) leads Donald Trump in favorability. A staggering 60 percent of respondents polled said they have an unfavorable rating, while 40 percent approved of the Republican blowhard. On top of that, President Obama s approval rating is at 52 percent, which is good news for Democrats. One of the deciding factors in presidential elections is the incumbent s approval rating.Clinton has been hitting Trump harder than ever this past week, highlighting his bad temperament, and the impending Trump University case that stands before him. Given Trump s open hostility to the judge in the case, Democrats should be feeling pretty good about how it s going to pan out.In total, over 1,600 people were polled, a sizable number.It s also worth noting that Reuters also had Trump beating Clinton just three weeks ago by less than a percentage. As Clinton steps up her attacks, voters begin to flock to her.That s what happens when qualified women take on a loud, racist, sexist bully. Come September, when those two square off on the debate stage, Clinton will tear him to shreds, and the poor sap won t have his Twitter account pulled up to  counter  her   and that s assuming he doesn t chicken out of a debate like he did with Sanders.As the months go forward, team Clinton is ready to take on Trump and his ilk. Expanding their ever growing staff   over 800   in comparison to Trump s 100, Clinton is laying the groundwork for a bare knuckle brawl that will go until every vote is counted on November 8th.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Makes New Racist Attack On Judge Exposing Trump University (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is very upset at the judge overseeing the ongoing lawsuit in which the allegation is being made that his Trump University was nothing more than a sophisticated scam designed to separate regular Americans from their hard earned money. Despite the Republican nominee s attempts to detract attention away from the case, new revelations keep coming out that show the reality TV star s involvement in unsavory business practices.So Trump has been lashing out at the judge, and in explicitly racist terms. Trump went there once again in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.Donald Trump is claiming that a judge with Mexican heritage who is overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University has an  inherent conflict of interest  given the presumptive GOP nominee s rhetoric on immigration.[ ] I m building a wall. It s an inherent conflict of interest,  Trump told the Journal.So what Trump is saying is that since he is  building a wall  between the United States and Mexico, he can t be subject to judicial oversight from an American citizen with Mexican heritage.CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin accurately debunked the insanity of Trump s allegation, noting that: The ethnicity of the judge is not in it of itself a grounds for recusal, ever. And that is a claim that Trump   under the First Amendment   is certainly allowed to make, but it is completely wrong under the law. Trump is angry because the documents exposed by the Trump University suit (and ongoing fraud case from the New York state attorney general) show that Trump University sales people were told to target vulnerable customers in order to pressure them to buy expensive and worthless real estate training. Trump University documents said that struggling parents should be targeted, as should people who clearly could not afford the training who were pressured to increase their lines of credit using high pressure boiler room tactics.In response to the Trump University revelations, Hillary Clinton called Trump a  fraud,  and now he continues to lash out in a highly racist way, which has been the cornerstone of his presidential campaign.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Responds To Devastating Clinton Attack By Slamming Her Looks,"After former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unloaded on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a major foreign policy speech on Thursday, the candidate responded not with substance or facts, but with a petulant tirade focused on how Clinton looks and sounds. That was a phony speech,  the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said at a rally in San Jose, Calif.  That was a Donald Trump hit job. His response to Mrs. Clinton s speech seemed to focus more on style than substance. She does not look presidential,  he said.  My temperament is so much tougher and so much better than her temperament. He crowned the Democratic front-runner with the insulting title he has long reserved for former rival Sen. Ted Cruz, whom he called  Lyin Ted. Lying, crooked Hillary,  he said at the rally.  She made up my foreign policy. In her speech, which many observers described as the best she has delivered in the campaign, Clinton picked apart Trump s extreme rhetoric point-by-point. She plainly explained that  like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job. She described his ideas as  bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies,  and said he is  not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes  because  it s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. Clinton went on to describe President Obama s decision to make the call to kill Osama bin Laden as  as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I ve ever seen  and contrasted that with  Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States.  She concluded,  making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake. Trump didn t respond to Clinton s speech on substance, nor did he address the points she made about the style of his decision making. Instead he went after how she looks and speaks. Thin skin, indeed.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Former Mexican President Challenges Trump To A Debate – In Mexico,"As Donald Trump continues to attack Mexicans, with his recent comments surrounding the Trump University lawsuit judge, Mexico s former president has one message for the GOP frontrunner: debate me.After chickening out of a debate with Bernie Sanders, Vicente Fox, who served as president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, challenged the frontrunner to a televised encounter in San Cristobal, Mexico (with a free lunch included). In an interview on Rita Crosby s radio program  Election Central,  Fox said: I m willing to come here, to come here, to the States, if it s for a debate. A direct personal debate with him. Yes, we can use national broadcasting, public broadcasting. With you, we can do that debate. Fox then went on to jab Trump over his $10 million request for a debate, and said that a debate would be focused on ideas and not the overly sensationalist: One condition   that it s done in Mexico   because I need him to see what Mexico is all about, to see what we Mexicans are all about. He will change his attitude toward Mexico    would expect that he would listen to my arguments, that he would put his arguments on the table, but we both are obliged to document, to sustain with facts and numbers what we re saying, and not just lying or cheating to people. So, let s see if Trump will take his first opportunity at being  presidential  and have a cordial, factual conversation with a foreign leader. When he s not busy praising Putin or Jong-un, maybe he can take the time to actually listen to a real leader (one that doesn t rule with an authoritarian fist).But seeing how Trump is a chicken, and doesn t like to engage in a mature manner, the debate with Fox will be as likely as the one with Sanders. And of course Trump wouldn t dare take the bait, because once Fox proves that his people aren t what Trump paints them out to be, there goes his best talking point to his racist supporters.Featured image via Flickr",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Right-Wing Restaurant Owner Who Hates Welfare Recipients Busted For Welfare Fraud,"If you ever needed any more proof that conservatives are hypocrites, this is it.Michael Tassone is an anti-Obama restaurant owner who turned his diner into the perfect place for racist conservatives to eat out.His  American Diner  in Liverpool, New York, which has been featured in a story on Fox News, even has a menu filled with items that make it clear how much he hates President Obama and the First Family.There s a meal called  Dictator Obama  that sells for $3.69 but comes with a $27 tax. And then there s the  Anti-Michelle Obama Don t Tell Me What To Eat Or Feed My Kids Burger,  which is probably loaded with the most calories and fatty foods than anything else on the menu.The decor includes Gadsden flags and signs and, of course, and Tassone is vehemently pro-gun and allows open carry of firearms in his establishment, probably because he thinks the government is coming for him.Here s a video about his restaurant.It s a paradise for hungry conservatives to convene and whine about how much they hate Mulsims, Hispanics, and welfare recipients.But as it turns out, Tassone is a hypocrite just like his fellow conservatives.Over the course of two years from 2009 to 2011, Tassone committed welfare fraud by getting Medicaid benefits he was not supposed to have, and ended up owing the Onondaga County Department of Social Services over $23,000.Senior Assistant District Attorney Michael Kasmarek told Syracuse.com that Tassone committed fraud. It was Medicaid fraud. They had failed to disclose income on their application. As a result they obtained Medicaid benefits they weren t entitled to, from May 1, 2009 to April 30, 2011,  he said.Tassone was arrested in 2011 and the judge told him to pay up if he didn t want his case to end up in front of a grand jury.In the end, Tassone paid up but thinks he was unfairly  targeted  because of his extreme conservative views. Guys like me are a target,  Tassone said.  Because I speak the truth. Funny, he didn t speak the truth when he lied about his income on an application for aid.But as usual, conservatives think only they are entitled to welfare and if they get busted committing a crime they claim they are being targeted because of their political views.Featured image via Syracuse.com",News,"June 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Twitter Is Merciless With Rush Limbaugh’s Thoughts On The Cincinnati Zoo’s Gorilla Controversy,"The controversy surrounding the Cincinnati Zoo s decision to kill Harambe, a 17-year old gorilla, in order to save a child has made its way into the one or two existing brain cells of people like Rush Limbaugh. We all know Limbaugh is an idiot, but what he thinks about Harambe is so stupid it s astonishing, even for him.On his Tuesday show, he went off on a tangent when discussing Harambe, saying: A lot of people think that all of us used to be apes. Don t doubt me on this. A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas. And they re looking for the missing link out there. The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. I ve always   if we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didn t become one of us? That s Limbaugh playing anti-science creationist right there. He never says he s a creationist, but it s pretty clear from this (and other shows) that he is. Only young-earth creationists totally reject evolution this way. Now all he has to do is agree out loud that either the Earth is young, or that man has been on the planet for billions of years (which is impossible), and he can come out as the Christian zealot he is.Twitter had a field day with this, as people are wont to do over there when someone takes the stupid farther than rational beings thought was possible:it s not everyday somebody shows their complete ignorance of basic science but dammit @rushlimbaugh you did it again.

MacLean (@KHMacLean) June 1, 2016It s his radio show, so he ll say what he wants no matter how ignorant it sounds, and the creationists will cheer because their mouthpiece is on the radio again speaking their gospel.

 Donald Trump Has Big Plans For Trump University After Lawsuit Is Over,"Despite all the problems plaguing Donald Trump over his failed Trump University, he says he plans to reopen it after the lawsuit is over. He believes that he ll win the case, or that it ll be dismissed or otherwise disposed of, despite overwhelming evidence that the whole scam was just that   a complete fraud. On Trump s warped planet, this whole thing just makes Trump U. a pile of gold.That s not all, though. Not only did he say he s planning to reopen it after the suit, he also plans to be president:After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016Trump U. closed in 2010 because they couldn t afford to stay open with so few students enrolling in its $35,000 Gold program. A former employee told CBS News that the program was run into the ground, but Trump says there s tons of interest in it now. Even if that s true, the man is an unethical profiteer who will likely do the same thing again.New York s attorney general has been investigating Trump U. for fraud for a long time, and he says that Trump knew it was a fraud. For instance, he claimed in video tapes that he handpicked instructors, but later testified under oath that he never met the instructors, meaning they weren t handpicked, nor were they experts.Internal documents also show how Trump U. pushed students through increasingly expensive courses without really teaching them any of the real estate mogul s secrets. Students were left with heavy debt and little hope of making their dreams of wealth come true.Trump fancies himself a master negotiator, and keeps saying that s why he ll be a great president. He s making people think he can negotiate us out of whatever rut conservatives think we re in. However, he wields lawsuits as one of his prime negotiating tools, which very likely wasn t taught in his courses. He and his organization just fleeced students for all they were worth (and, in many cases, more).Just how does he think Trump U. will fare if he loses the suit? Or at all? This reeks of the posturing that s so typical of Trump when someone makes him look bad. The lawsuit against Trump U. has definitely made him look terrible, and he s trying to make up for it now.Featured image by Thos Robinson/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Report Shows Trump’s Golf Course Is Paying Migrants Slave Wages,"It would make sense why Trump claimed wages are  too high  as is, and why he supports getting rid of minimum wages standards and hates foreigners.A report-turned-documentary on HBO s Vice shows that the Trump International Golf Club in Dubai has been recruiting migrants from countries like Pakistan, promising them $3 an hour, but instead paying them just half of that. If a migrant is lucky, they will make only $231 a month.Also documented was the inhumane treatment and near enslavement of these migrants, including the confiscation of their passports so they cannot leave, and packing 20 or more migrants at a time in a small room for hours on end. Their rooms, miles outside the city and sitting in the dark desert, are infested with rats, mold and mildew.Sharing one kitchen for 100 people, and forced to bathe in troughs, the migrants are forced to relieve themselves where they wash. The bathrooms, as described in the documentary, are not fit for human use.Promising them standard eight hour shifts with the possibility of two hours overtime and a decent salary, the migrants were interested. But as the documentary shows, non of the promises were delivered.And of course Donald Trump declined to be interviewed, and instead had his organization release a statement saying Trump himself has no idea what s going on and that he doesn t take direction action in supervising, hiring, or building of entities he  lends  his name and brand to.When asked if they preferred working in Dubai or living in Pakistan, they responded with the latter.With his workers being treated with such little dignity, it s no wonder Trump has no problem being a war-hungry, xenophobic, racist monster.How can he claim to value life when his organization enslaves hard working migrants who just want to have a decent salary?Here is a clip form the documentary detailing just a sliver of the conditions:Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Medical Examiner Finally Releases Report On Death Of Music Icon Prince,"The world reeled when beloved musical icon Prince Rogers Nelson   known simply as  Prince    suddenly died at the age of 57 on April 21 of this year. Music and pop culture lovers everywhere have mourned this iconic man s death and wondered how a seemingly healthy pop star could just drop dead at such a relatively young age, but we need wait no longer, as the medical examiner s report on the reason for his death has finally been released.Apparently, Prince was prescribed fentanyl, which is a an opioid painkiller that is even stronger than morphine. It is also said to be highly addictive. Prince s official cause of death is reported as  fentanyl toxicity,  and the medical examiner s report says that the overdose was accidental. The decedent self-administered fentanyl,  the report said.The Drug Enforcement Administration was a key part of the investigation into the superstar s death, as the prescription he was taking for pain was present when he was found unresponsive in an elevator at his Minnesota compound. It had also become known that Prince was addicted to the drug, and was reportedly working on seeking help from an addiction doctor. Unfortunately, that help did not come in time to save his life.This is the story of so many stars. They have the money and the connections to get almost anything they like for the right price, and it often ends in these kinds of tragedies. The same thing was true of Michael Jackson s untimely passing as well, and he was around the same age as Prince when we lost him as well.Prince apparently left no will to dictate who will receive his multimillion dollar estate, or who will receive the royalties from his incredibly large discography collection. A court will decide where all of his money, his properties, and other belongings will go.Rest in peace, Prince. Hopefully, your death will wake Hollywood doctors up and stop them from bowing to the wills of celebrities instead of doing what is safe and right.Featured image via Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Angrily Goes After Hillary’s Competency With Misspelled Tweet,"On Thursday afternoon, Hillary Clinton delivered an impassioned speech regarding foreign policy and how dangerous Donald Trump would be not only to the nation, but to the world. She delivered it well and made point after point driving home the fact that Trump simply cannot be our next president.Not taking too kindly to the fact that Clinton was going after him, Trump quickly took to his medium of choice   Twitter.Trump wrote: Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn t even look presidential! Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016If only he knew how to spell teleprompter.And does Trump consider name-calling, explanation points and spelling incorrectly presidential? Apparently so.Oh, and yes, Trump did use a teleprompter for his foreign policy speech as well, and it was about as awkward as a 13-year-old boy asking the prettiest girl in school to the middle school spring fling.Truth be told, Trump doesn t even have the maturity level of a 13-year-old boy, probably more along the lines of a five- or six-year old. It s gotten to the point where you re waiting for him to tell people Hillary has cooties. Maybe he already has. Who s to know, really?Trump can go after Clinton all he wants on foreign policy, but the facts are the facts, and she absolutely wipes the floor with him in regards to experience. For example, he has none, and she s a former Secretary of State who is more traveled than any other Secretary of State in the history of the republic. She s brokered peace deals, for goodness sake.At the end of the day, it comes down to who can actually lead and get the job done, and Trump most certainly is not that person. No matter who the nominee is for the Democrats, they need to win in November.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images   Twitter",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" No, Hillary Clinton And Donald Trump Are Not ‘Equally’ Hated – She Is Much More Loved","The media is reporting that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two of the most hated presidential candidates in U.S. election history. You have Fox News saying Clinton s bad numbers will destroy her, and you have MSNBC saying Trump s negative numbers will destroy him.Whereas the fact remains that, yes, they are both viewed unfavorably by America as a whole, there is way more than meets the eye.For starters, it should be plainly said that no, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are not  equally hated  by the American people.In fact, in 47 different categories representing a multitude of diverse Americans, Clinton is much more loved than the current Republican nominee.According to Gallup Polling:Basically anyone who isn t a white, Christian male overwhelmingly supports Clinton over Trump, and all of these demographics have a majority positive rating for the Democratic frontrunner.The only people who have a more positive view of Trump over Clinton are: highly religious, Protestant/other Christian, Mormon, male, non-Hispanic white, married men, white males, white-non college graduate, married, men over 50 and those who have some college experience. The only Christian group that backs Clinton are Catholics.According Gallup s analysis:At the risk of overgeneralization, we can say that the typical American who really likes Clinton and doesn t like Trump is a black, Hispanic or Asian female living outside the bounds of a traditional marriage and who is unreligious. The typical American who really likes Trump and doesn t like Clinton is a white male who is traditionally married, religious, and a Protestant or Mormon.In today s America, a candidate will need a diverse electorate in order to win, and Trump does not have a broad coalition to make that possible, but the media will continue to talk about Clinton s  unfavorable  rating to discredit her candidacy.So yes, Trump and Clinton are two most hated candidates in election history, but based on what information? Well, considering the majority of this country is mad up of either whites, Christians or men, it would seem that Clinton is  equal  to Trump when standard mainstream media polls are conducted.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Racist Prick Spits On Black Pair, Yells N****** B*tch While Starbucks Customers Silently Watch","Are we a post-racial nation? No, we re not, no matter what conservatives like to say, and what happened at a Seattle Starbucks is just further proof of that. Dr. Bob Hughes, an associate dean at Seattle University, was sitting with a colleague, just catching up, when an openly racist jerk decided it would be fun to be a completely racist jerk as he walked on past.Hughes felt something on his hand, and then the guy called his friend a  n***** b*tch  before walking out.  That s right, f**king n***** b*tch,  he called one more time as he walked out the door. The other customers in the Starbucks just kind of sat there, doing their own things in a deafening silence that demonstrates how post-racial we re not.These are two college administrators who were dressed professionally, and just talking inside a Starbucks. KUOW.org published an essay from Dr. Hughes, in which he said: As my colleague noted, as we waited to file a police report, we both know that we can t dress ourselves out of the perception of who were are in the dominant society. She and I were dressed in the kind of professional attire anyone would expect a college administrator to be wearing in the middle of a work day, are still targets for hate.But the young man didn t see educated college administrators sitting at the table. He saw two black people and, in his twisted sense of the rules of life, our socio-economic status, educational accomplishments or our age required no respect or deference. In fact, he seemed only to see a woman of color whom he could brazenly assault in an open space with others watching. He went on to explain that it took him back to his childhood in the 1950s and  60s, where he was a black kid growing up in an all-white community, and where this kind of racist, hateful behavior was normal because of that. Silence from onlookers was normal then, and it appears it s still normal today.One woman offered to be a witness, and the manager of the Starbucks helped them file a police report. In a truly post-racial world, as Hughes said, nobody would stand for this. Nobody would have just sat there quietly. And yet, we hear all the time from conservatives that black people, and everyone else who talks about racism, are the ones who are the problem because race doesn t matter anymore.This wouldn t have happened if race didn t matter anymore.The lack of immediate consequences for the young man who did this mean he will do it more and more, without shame and without remorse. Hughes says: My guess is that next time, this young man will be more violent. Unstopped, antisocial behavior like this escalates. And he lives in a world right now where he felt safe taking these actions. He ll feel even safer doing so if we end up with a President Trump. What Hughes and his colleague endured is disgusting in 2016.Featured image via Seattle University",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Paul Ryan Thought Nobody Would Notice His Trump Endorsement During Clinton’s Speech,"House Speaker Paul Ryan is nothing but a spineless weasel. Earlier in the GOP Primary season, he seemed to actually have a bit of common decency   not to mention common sense   when he called out Trump for refusing to disavow an endorsement from a white supremacist, and when he outright said that he was not comfortable endorsing Trump. However, as it became increasingly clear that Trump was not to be stopped, Ryan started preparing to back off his attacks on the billionaire mogul by having meetings with him   clearly a preparation for an endorsement. Now, that day has come, as Speaker Ryan has officially said that he is prepared to vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.Ryan s hometown newspaper, The Gazette, ran a column where the House Speaker announced his support for Trump. Ryan wrote in the column that he has been speaking with Trump, and is somehow now comfortable endorsing him, when such a short time ago he clearly was not. He wrote in the column: Through these conversations, I feel confident he (Trump) would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people s lives. That s why I ll be voting for him this fall. He went on to say: But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement. But of course, at the core of Ryan s reasoning for endorsing a dangerous, racist narcissist for the position of leader of the free world is the fact that the GOP is putting party before country, and ultimately if they stop Clinton, they re just fine with Trump in the White House. Ryan went on to warn of what would happen if Clinton beat Trump: A Clinton White House would mean four more years of liberal cronyism and a government more out for itself than the people it serves. Quite simply, she represents all that our agenda aims to fix. And that s really what it s all about. Paul Ryan is willing to let Donald Trump literally destroy America with his hateful ideas and dangerous policy proposals and willingness to sever ties with our most important allies in order to not have a truly qualified president because he disagrees with her politically.And to top off just how absolutely spineless this man is, he had his speech uploaded to The Gazette s website during Hillary Clinton s big, anti-Trump foreign policy speech   clearly in the hopes that nobody would notice what he has done.Shame on you, Speaker Ryan. Hopefully, this is the end of your political career. One can certainly hope.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Is Scamming The Hell Out Of America, And Hillary Just Proved It In Under 2 Minutes (VIDEO)","People believe what they want to believe. When someone tells you they can solve your financial woes with a simple plan, you want to believe them. Donald Trump knew this and took advantage of people when they were at their most vulnerable. He promised a way to be successful, all while just simply making himself wealthy in the mean time.Well, guess what? He s finally being called out on his fraudulent scheme of  Trump University  and is even going to court over it.Also calling Donald Trump out for the scam artist that he is, is Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.Hillary went for the jugular and with good merit, stating: Well today we are learning about another scam, the so-called Trump University. The New York Attorney General is suing Donald Trump for fraud. And his own employees testified, I want you to hear this, his own employees testified that Trump U, you can t make this up, that Trump U was a fraudulent scheme where Donald Trump enriched himself at the expense of hardworking people Also adding: Trump and his employees took advantage of vulnerable Americans encouraging them to max out their credit cards, empty their retirement savings, destroy their financial futures all while making promises they knew were false from the beginning. This is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud. He is trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U. Concluding: It is important that we recognize what he has done because that is usually a pretty good indicator of what he will do. And on issue after issue, we see someone who is unqualified and unfit to be President of the United States. He is absolutely unfit to be president. He has no policy experience, no diplomatic experience, no experience whatsoever except for being the true scam artist that he is. He should be condemned, not praised, and we need to make sure he is defeated this November.

 New RNC Hispanic Outreach Head’s Humiliating First Job Is To Delete All Of Her Anti-Trump Tweets,"Somebody alert Mike Rowe, the dirtiest job in America is being the Republican National Convention s Hispanic Media Director under presumptive nominee Donald Trump.Already tasked with building inroads with a group of people whom many of your fellow Republicans view as  less thans  or criminals, the job of appealing to Hispanics under the leadership of Donald Trump is a near impossibility. How demeaning is it to be a Hispanic woman working for Trump s Republican Party? The current and long-suffering Hispanic Media Director Ruth Guerra resigned. When some Republicans heard the news of Ruth Guerra had quit, they didn t feel betrayed. They felt relieved that her misery was over. I m so proud of her  for leaving, one Hispanic Republican said Wednesday night when told the news.  I don t know how she held on for this long. The woman tasked with taking her place has had the job for less than 24 hours and already had to take a humiliating first step: Purging her social media accounts of any criticisms of Trump (of which there were many).Hours before the announcement that Helen Aguirre Ferr  would be stepping into the role of working with Spanish-speaking media outlets and coordinating Hispanic outreach, she quietly deleted many of her tweets of the Trump bashing she used to regularly post. Unfortunately for her, the internet never forgets. Buzzfeed quickly found a cache of old, deleted tweets in which Ferr  seemed to have been a  Never Trump  Republican and had publicly sided with Trump rival Ted Cruz during the primaries. Ferr  now gets to be the party face of a man who actively hates both her ethnicity and gender. Trump may adore taco bowls, but his view towards Hispanic and Latinos is casually racist in a way that should be appalling to anyone living in the 21st century. Having launched his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending rapists and murderers across the border, Trump is also a big fan of using the word  Mexican  as an insult. Recently, he attempted to smear the judge presiding over his Trump University lawsuit as a biased  Mexican  incapable of doing his job. He similarly slammed New Mexico s Republican governor. (Her crime? She didn t endorse him.)Ferr  has to watch as her ethnicity is repeatedly disparaged, while actively working to get the man doing so elected. And worse, she was forced to cleanse her own misgivings from the public s view   even many that were and still are valid criticisms. Whether that s a sign of lack of personal integrity on Ferr s part or a sad statement about just how desperate Hispanic Republicans are to get any voice at all in the party is open to interpretation. Whatever the case, Ferr s job is very, very dirty.Featured image via Twitter",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 RNC’s Head Of Hispanic Outreach To Step Down Because….Trump,"In 2013, a year after Mitt Romney s stunning completely predictable defeat in the presidential election, the Republican National Committee decided they needed to revamp their image. RNC head Reince Priebus told his party that they would reinvent themselves and become a more inclusive GOP   he especially wanted to reach out to Hispanic voters. Latinos are one of the fastest growing voting blocs in the country and the Republican Party needs these voters in order to win future elections. So, in order to further the party s goal, the RNC hired Mexican-American Ruth Guerra to head up their Hispanic Outreach.Everything was going very well (as well as it could go in a party that really loathes the people they are trying to reach), but then a wrench was thrown into their plans: Donald Trump. The billionaire started his campaign by slamming Hispanics. He called Mexicans criminals and rapists, he promised to build the Great Wall of  Murica and make Mexico pay for it. His entire campaign has been built on how much he hates Latinos and other minorities. This has caused problems within the party and now, according to multiple sources, it is the reason Ruth Guerra is leaving her position in the RNC.The New York Times reported:Ms. Guerra told colleagues this year that she was uncomfortable working for Mr. Trump, according to two R.N.C. aides who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the difficulties surrounding the party s standard-bearer.When Guerra was questioned about her feelings about Trump, she deflected, saying, I ve had a great nearly two years at the RNC, and I m excited for the new opportunities that I will have at AAN [American Action Network super-PAC]. Of course, she isn t going to say anything about him, her career would be ruined if she spoke out against him. Trump has absolutely no qualms about destroying people; just look at what he tried to do to Megyn Kelly when she just asked him a question he didn t like during a debate. The moment Guerra said that she s leaving because she believes the presidential nominee of the party she works for is a xenophobic asshat, she d be blackballed. Her career would never survive his wrath and she knows it. That s the reality of Trump s rise to power.Featured image via Facebook",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Top Trump Delegate Calls For America’s Current Leaders To Be ‘Killed’,"Donald Trump has already proven to America that he attracts the energy that he puts out. This has been especially true for his loyal supporters, as his racism and xenophobia have attracted white supremacists, fascists and neo-Nazis from all over the country. However, his fear mongering tactics don t just appeal to his fans. It turns out, some of the presumptive Republican nominee s delegates are just as racist and hateful, and it s creating a movement that is becoming more of a threat to America s safety with every passing day.A recent example of just how deadly Trump s supporters are can be shown with the recent words of David Riden, a top delegate to Trump who will be attending the Republican National Convention. In an interview with Mother Jones, Riden had some terrifying words for how he would like to correct our government, which he claims is  way off away from the Constitution right now. His solution would be to slaughter America s current leaders (aka President Barack Obama) for not satisfying his highly inaccurate interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. And in case you felt that might have just been an exaggeration, Riden was kind enough to clarify what he meant so there s no room for interpretation. He said: The polite word is  eliminated.  The harsh word is  killed. Riden continued to say that these  certain  leaders should be killed  by American citizens with weapons. And if people have tanks, assault weapons, if they have bombs   they need to have the weaponry necessary to be able to overthrow the federal government. In Riden s perfect world, America looks like this: (P)eople have the right to assemble, bear arms, go to Washington, DC, or wherever necessary, and go into military battle against the government and replace those in government with individuals that will uphold the Constitution. It s no surprise that Riden is supporting Trump. Riden is a former nuclear engineer and is a member of the  sovereign citizen  movement, which believes that the government is conspiring to take away their guns, human rights and land. He was also an attendee of the Continental Congress of 2009, which is a huge gathering of white supremacist and right-wing hate groups. It s been noted that these groups have grown at a feverish pace during Obama s presidency, and Trump has expertly tapped into that racism and hate like no candidate before. When it comes to people like Riden, Trump just keeps adding fuel to the fire.Featured image via Elijah Nouvelage / Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rachel Maddow Just Exposed Trump’s Racism In A Way No One Else Has Before (VIDEO),"On Wednesday, Rachel Maddow made a comparison between the overt racism of Donald Trump s current campaign and the polite racism of Rick Santorum s campaign in 2012. During the segment, Maddow raises some interesting questions about Trump and the normalization of racism in the 2016 political cycle.Racist policies have been a major part of the GOP s platform since they adopted the southern strategy. Since it is no longer considered polite to be openly racist, the GOP had to come up with a racist agenda that is coded in the language of economic policy. On occasion, a Republican candidate slips up and the veil covering their racist attitudes falls away.Maddow points towards the time when Santorum infamously stated on the campaign trail that he doesn t  want to make black people s lives better by giving them somebody else s money.  Santorum quickly tried to backpedal on the gaffe, saying that he actually said  blah people.  Much like the rest of Santorum s political career, it was both very sad and hilarious.Things have changed since 2012. With black uprisings taking place all across the United States in 2014 and 2015, a movement was born that demanded that people finally recognize that black lives matter. Because the U.S. is extremely racist, that simple demand was meant with a huge backlash from ignorant and racist right-wingers. The same thing can be said in regards to Muslims, Mexicans, and just about every other racial group in the U.S. While racial minorities demand to be treated equally, the right fights harder and harder to maintain white supremacy.So with racial tensions running high and matters of racial justice becoming an ever more partisan subject, Trump entered the 2016 primary election fully exploiting that tension. His rallies have nearly turned into all out race battles, his racist rhetoric is up front and he is unapologetic about that. In the segment, Maddow points towards one of his recent statements involving the judge who ruled against him in a lawsuit over one of Trump s most horrendous scams, Trump University.While it is probably true that Trump is normalizing racist language, he is also exposing the racist foundations that modern GOP is built upon. That s causing deep fractures to form among Republicans. The GOP cannot continue being the party of racists, in a nation that is rapidly becoming more diverse. So while the normalization of racist rhetoric is terrible   it is important to keep in mind that we are witnessing the death throes of a dying political party.You can watch the segment below.

 NY Attorney General On Trump University: ‘This Is Straight Up Fraud’ (VIDEO),"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is trying really hard to ignore the controversy and lawsuit surrounding Trump University. Earlier this week he even attacked the media because they had the audacity to do their jobs and report on the lengths the university went to in their efforts to defraud people of their money. On Thursday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman appeared on MSNBC s Morning Joe to discuss Trump U and said the university was not legitimate and the GOP nominee knew it. This is straight up fraud. It s like selling people something you say is a Mercedes and it turns out to be a Volkswagen,  Schneiderman said.  And even if some people say,  Well actually, I kind of like the Volkswagen,  it s still fraud because it s not a Mercedes. This was not a university. Although Trump claims that he will be vindicated and Trump U was completely above-board, the details of the three lawsuits against him tell a different story. During an interview with Fox News in February, the billionaire claimed that he  handpicked the staff for the school and those people did a  good job.  AG Schneiderman told the hosts at Morning Joe that those statements were blatant lies: Trump s role was really as the pitchman. And we ve got his videotapes, and we ve got his sworn testimony which undercuts every statement in the videotapes. He said,  My hand-picked experts will teach you my personal secrets.  He and the president of the university have already testified under oath he never met the instructors, they weren t hand-picked. They weren t experts   some of them came out of fast food and retail. And he had nothing to do with the supposed secrets that were taught because he had nothing to do with the curriculum.The attorney general added that Trump scammed these people during one of the worst economic times in American history: So people were led to believe they were getting the personal secrets of Trump, during hard economic times, we re talking about 2008, 2009, 2010. People wanted to scramble to find a way to make money, he duped them in, thousands of people paid millions of dollars and we re out to get them their money back. Think about what all of this means for a minute. Before the housing market collapse, Trump said that he wanted the bubble to burst so that he could make money. That eventually happened and millions of Americans suffered greatly. People lost their homes, their jobs, their savings, it was horrific. So, after he prayed for their demise by wishing the crash would happen, he convinced people to go to Trump University so that they could get out of the holes they were in and become rich like him   but it was all a scam. Now this same person is running for president and he is one step away from the most powerful position in the world. How did he get there? By, once again, scamming people into believing that he will save them.Donald Trump is a horrible human being and we must come together and keep him out of the Oval Office. So, remember, vote blue   no matter who.Watch:NY @AGSchneiderman on Trump U: This is just straight up fraud https://t.co/OUjj1BEt81  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) June 2, 2016Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: President ‘No F*cks Left’ Obama Tears GOP Lies Apart Limb By Incredibly Stupid Limb,"Fox News, Donald Trump, and the rest of the half-witted douche-canoes in the Republican Party are an embarrassment to our nation, and the president knows it. On Wednesday, tyrannical dictator-for-life Barack Obama blasted Trump, his Republicans compatriots and frenemies, and right-wing media, for propagating numerous myths about the American economy.If you turn on the aforementioned propaganda outlet thinly veiled as a news network on any day that ends in  -day,  you will hear among their assortment of lies that Barack  HUSSEIN  Obama has killed all the jobs in the country, increased the deficit, that he has increased the number of jobless  leeches  on welfare by such an alarming amount that the country can not survive, and that America is bankrupt (both morally and financially).The president addressed the assortment of untruths coming from the right. The primary story that Republicans have been telling about the economy is not supported by the facts. It s just not,  Obama said, blowing the lid off the reason Republicans say and do the crazy things they do:Obama is right   Republicans voters, and especially Trump supporters, simply do not care about facts. Unfortunately for them, the president was there to fact-check the hell out of their ridiculous attempts to malign him, issue by asinine issue. Though he didn t mention Trump by name, explaining that the billionaire 2016 nominee can advertise himself, simply preys on the prejudices and fears of the Stupid Part of America (a tactic that is unfortunately successful). If people are feeling insecure and they are offered a simple reason for how they can feel more secure, people are going to be tempted by it,  Obama told the crowd of 2,000, adding that Trump s promises make no sense in the real world:There is nothing more awesome than watching the President destroying, one-by-one, the numerous lies regularly spouted by the Right.

 Fox News Host Makes Herself A Total Laughingstock In Attempted Dig At NASA (TWEETS),"Fox News host Greta Van Susteren saw an opportunity to use NASA to take a jab at  big government  that is equal parts confused and stupid. It did not go well.NASA recently released some incredibly stunning photographs of Pluto, captured by the New Horizons spacecraft during its once in a lifetime flyby of the (dwarf) planet in 2015. The tiny spacecraft took close to ten years to arrive to Pluto and now heads out even deeper into what is called the Kuiper Belt, a collection of  ancient icy mini-worlds  at the far reaches of what we would consider our solar system.Only the technical feat and stunning photographs weren t good enough for Van Susteren. She was upset that NASA took so long, and seized the opportunity to rail against NASA using American tax dollars while not delivering its photos into Greta s inbox faster than the speed of light.Why did they wait until NOW to release these? pics taken in 2015 and we pay their salaries in tax dollars https://t.co/hhXxrfsWEr  Greta Van Susteren (@greta) June 1, 2016It s clear that Van Susteren didn t bother to read the article she linked to, or she may have found her answer. It wasn t a vast government cover-up to hide images of Pluto from the taxpayers. It was the fact that Pluto is really, really far away and the data takes a very long time to trickle in.Though the encounter took place more than 10 months ago, New Horizons is still beaming flyby data home, and likely won t be done doing so until this coming fall, mission team members have said.Van Susteren s goal seemed to be to slam the Obama administration for cutting NASA s budget, a critique that is both laughably off-base and not the issue. As one Twitter user patiently explained to Van Susteren, demanding a low power spacecraft to send high-resolution images back faster is like getting 9 women pregnant in the hopes of making a baby in a month. That s not how any of this works. (In any case, the New Horizons spacecraft launched in 2006, three years before Obama sent Fox News into a rage frenzy about  responsible  government.)There s no question that NASA has been hamstrung by its dwindling budget, but its financial woes have nothing to do with Obama. Republicans in Congress, eager to kill anything that even smells like it could support climate change, have repeatedly tried to dismantle the space agency s budget over allegations that the data it collects is biased against climate deniers. This death by attrition has meant the shuttering of the manned space shuttle program, as well as cutbacks in cutting-edge research. Instead, Republicans have told NASA to focus more on space   a vague directive if there ever was one   and not on Earth. And like any good hostage taker, to show they were serious, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology (a misnomer considering how anti-science the committee is) went ahead and slashed an additional $320 million.Van Susteren s network has, of course, acted as the Republican Party s cheerleader through all of this. Routinely, Fox News will feature thinly veiled hit pieces on science and research in order to  prove  that spending government money on such endeavors is a waste. Much better, they argue, to waste that money on fighting a losing legal battle for the right to discriminate against transgender children. Or on fighter jets that don t work.However at this rate, getting a person like Greta Van Susteren to see the hypocrisy in her jabs at NASA and Obama might take longer than a trip to Pluto and back.Featured image via Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Got DESTROYED By One Of America’s Most Respected Journalists (VIDEO/IMAGE),"One of America s most legendary journalists, Dan Rather, used his gift with words for a very special purpose on Wednesday: to blast Donald Trump and rally the press against the dangerous candidate.In a brilliant Facebook post, Rather urged his fellow journalists to keep holding Trump accountable and cornering the presumptive Republican nominee on the tough issues. Rather had felt an obligation to write the post after watching The Donald attack the press during a news conference on Tuesday. Rather said that when he watched Trump resort to bullying reporters to avoid questions about controversial issues like his suspicious donations to veterans  organizations, he  felt a shudder down my spine. The legendary newsroom wrote: This is a dirty, nasty election. And it is only going to get worse. The reporters in the trenches need no lecture from me. They are walking through daily minefields, bracing themselves against winds of discontent whose effects no one can predict. Rather is speaking from firsthand experience. In 1968, during the Democratic Convention, Rather worked through chaos and riots so that he could continue to question delegates and politicians. His tireless dedication resulted in this famous clip, which captures Rather getting punched in the stomach on national television:Noting that today s reporters are up against the same accusations of press bias and hostility that has followed American politics over the years, Rather noted that this particular election is different thanks to the brash business mogul. Rather singled out Trump for his air of  violence  and intimidation tactics that cause many press members to stay silent. To those who might be afraid of getting caught in Trump s line of fire, Rather reminds today s journalists that the  pen is still mightier than the sword  and that they should not  back up, back down, back away or turn around .

 The NRA Is Busy Pursuing Their ‘More Guns’ Agenda In Florida By Completely Denying Science,"It doesn t seem to matter what it is, if the NRA is involved, you can bet it s because they want to see more guns. Such is the case in Florida, where the NRA is pushing that agenda on the environment by calling for a black bear hunt, because bears are nuisance animals and hunters with guns are a higher priority than figuring out a more proactive way of handling nuisance animals.Marion Hammer, a lobbyist on the side of the NRA, and one of the people pushing the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to approve the hunt, says: Bears continue to terrorize homeowners and prevent families from allowing children to play outside in some areas, and while FWC is working to educate people about securing trash and is trying to move dangerous bears out of residential areas, those programs are helpful but cannot succeed without hunts to reduce the population. Hunts don t necessarily do that, either, despite a large number of bears being killed last year. In last year s hunt, 304 bears were killed over the course of two days. The FWC was forced to end the season at that point, even though it was supposed to last a week. The NRA wants an even longer hunt this year, but the logic of pushing for a longer one is non-existent if there are fewer bears around due to last year s hunt.They re totally ignoring some key facts on the issue, too. These bears were on Florida s Endangered and Threatened Species list as recently as 2012. The FWC is supposed to have new population numbers sometime this year; however, without knowing how much the black bear populations have increased, these hunts are completely irresponsible. That is, sadly, typical of the NRA these days; virtually every part of their agenda is totally irresponsible.Why should the NRA care about any kind of responsibility, though? In 2006, the number of people in the U.S. who hunted was at its lowest point in recent history. Public support for hunting began to grow again in 2007, and now we have more hunters, which means we have more guns out there. Nothing makes the NRA happier than more guns, and more excuses for putting more guns out there.The FWC hasn t approved a hunt yet, and here s hoping they don t cave to the NRA this year. They re expected to receive a staff recommendation on the issue before their June 22 meeting.Featured image by John Gress/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH Veteran Rip Trump A New One: I Defended This Country Alongside The People You Hate,"It s not just white American men who fight and die for this country. Women, Muslims, and Hispanics have as well and this military veteran wants Donald Trump to know it.During a protest against the Republican nominee in New York, U.S. Army veteran Perry O Brien declared that he proudly put on the uniform and defended the nation against terrorists in Afghanistan alongside women, Muslim, and Hispanic soldiers who also wore the uniform donning the red, white, and blue American flag patch. When I served in Afghanistan I served with women, I served with Muslims, and I served with Latinos   all groups that Donald Trump has maligned or even threatened,  O Brien said.  All of those folks actually donned the uniform. They actually served the country. As far as we can see as veterans in the military community, Donald Trump only seems interested in serving himself. Indeed, Donald Trump has never fought for this country. In fact, he repeatedly dodged the draft during the Vietnam War through a series of deferments. And even though he was too cowardly to serve his country during wartime, Trump has repeatedly disrespected Vietnam War veterans ever since.In 1997, Trump infamously referred to his sleeping around with various women his  personal Vietnam  because he didn t get an STD. I ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world. It is a dangerous world out there. It s scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam-era,  Trump said.  It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier. And last year, Trump insulted Senator John McCain by questioning his war hero status because he was captured by the enemy and tortured relentlessly to the point where McCain can no longer lift his arms over his head.  He s not a war hero,  Trump claimed.  He s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren t captured, OK? Trump has also repeatedly insulted women, referred to Mexicans as rapists, and called for banning Muslims from the country from the first day of his campaign.So it s no wonder why veterans like Perry O Brien are pissed off about the possibility of Trump becoming commander-in-chief.O Brien even slammed Trump for not donating money to veterans organizations before running for president because it looks like he is only doing it to improve his image right now. I think we all believe in the veterans community that it would be fantastic if Trump had decided he was interested in donating any of his vast wealth   which he loves to talk about so much   to veterans organizations in any substantive way before he decided he wanted to be the next commander-in-chief. Here s the video via YouTube.A Trump presidency also makes it more likely that more American soldiers will come home as wounded vets or in flag-draped caskets since ole small hands himself has suggested the possibility of waging nuclear war along with waging wars against other nations that would definitely require ground troops.Donald Trump is not the presidential candidate our veterans deserve. They need a president who will do everything possible to avoid war and they need a president who will make sure they and their families are well taken care of if war is necessary.Featured image via screenshot",News,"June 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Richest Man In The World Puts Trump In His Place On Donating To Charity,"Bill Gates is the richest man in the world. Unlike Donald Trump, there has been independent verification of his net worth, which is currently estimated to be about $76 billion. Also unlike Trump, Gates made his money by selling actual products to people and not on the sort of smoke-and-mirrors flim flam that is currently being exposed at Trump University.At a recent event, the topic of Trump s claim that he donated to veteran s charities came up, and Gates   who heads one of the largest charities in the world   made a dig at the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.Gates took the jab at Trump during an interview alongside his wife, Melinda, at a panel discussion hosted by the news outlet ReCode. He hasn t been known for his philanthropy. He s been known for other things,  Gates said to laughter, when asked if the presumptive GOP presidential nominee had been approached to sign a pledge to give away at least half of his wealth to philanthropic causes.Trump was shown to only cut checks to veteran groups after the Washington Post asked him to back up his boasting about donating $6 million months ago on the same day he boycotted a Fox News debate, arguing that moderator Megyn Kelly had been mean to him.By comparison the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation already has $44 billion at its disposal, thanks to the couple parting with some of the money generated from Microsoft. It has made major investments around the world in education, health, and more.Gates and his wife Melinda are also part of a group of the super-rich who have signed  The Giving Pledge  in which they promise to give more than half of their wealth to charity during their lifetimes, or in their wills. Several real life billionaires have signed the pledge, including Warren Buffett, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison and others. But they haven t approached Trump yet.Melinda Gates, with a smirk, said the couple has not approached Trump, adding that they are still working their way down Fortune s list of billionaires. We don t have any immediate plans to approach him,  she said.  I think we should probably let this cycle play itself out before we do anything related to that. Gates may just be being polite. Previous reporting has indicated that Trump may not even be worth $1 billion, far less than the $10 billion he has been claiming. He has refused to release his tax returns, which some believe proves he is hiding that he is a millionaire and not a billionare.Featured image via Flickr",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Tony Perkins: Christians Are Living In ‘Spiritual Ghettos’ Under Left-Wing Rule (VIDEO),"The Family Research Council s hater-in-chief Tony Perkins is joining his fellow deranged right-wing Christians in insisting that left-wingers are slowly but surely about to outlaw Christianity. He appeared on D. James Kennedy Ministries  Truths That Transform show with the Ministry s president, Frank Wright, and ranted on about how the inability of Christians to force their crazy beliefs on the rest of us somehow means they are being persecuted. Perkins told Wright: We are not disqualified from engaging in the public square simple because we re Christian. And that s where we re at today, where people want us to check our Christian faith at the door of even public service; not just holding public office, but if you re a fireman, a policeman, a teacher, a football coach, you re supposed to leave your faith at home or within the confines of the church. [That is] totally contrary to what the founders envisioned and, I would argue, Frank, totally contrary to what God has called us to do. The thing is, though, the idea that you cannot bring your religious beliefs into doing jobs in public office and other parts of the public sector is NOT persecution, Mr. Perkins. It simply means that you cannot force your beliefs on others in the workplace or in the public sector. That s it. Nothing more or less. Further, it is quite ironic that this man is crying foul on this one, considering that his organization s entire purpose is to strip basic civil rights from anyone and everyone who isn t a right-wing Christian, particularly LGBT people. Hypocrite much?Wright, of course, being just as much of a loon as Perkins, took things a step further, suggesting that any day now, the government would be outlawing the practice of Christianity altogether. Of course, Perkins latched on to this one, and said: We see this administration, we see the left creating these spiritual ghettos where we are forced into, confined to these areas, trying to quarantine faith so it s more easily controllable. Get real, you morons. President Obama isn t trying to get rid of religion; he himself is a Christian. He s just smart enough to know that America was never meant to be a theocracy, that theocracies don t work, and that our Constitution forbids religion in lawmaking.Then again, when deluded individuals such as these two men speak on such matters, facts fly out the window and are replaced with utter lunacy.Get serious help, STAT, both of you.Watch the video of this insanity below, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Won’t Believe This Racist Alabama Math Test (VIDEO),"From the Civil War to Jim Crow to George Wallace, to the Confederate Flag that hung over the Statehouse until just last year, the state of Alabama has always been synonymous with racial struggle and with just plain ole racism.Things might be changing from an official level, but to many Alabamans, African-Americans are still second class citizens, and to some, just criminals. That seemed to be the idea behind an 8th grade test called the  LA Math Proficiency Test,  that portrayed black people and Latinos as prostitutes, drug dealers and drive-by shooters. Hardly appropriate for any eighth grader, even without the racism.The first question involves someone named Ram n, who performs drive-by shootings with an AK-47. Then, there s Leroy, who sells cocaine to Juan. The test goes on to talk about children who steal, all of whom have ethnic sounding names. There s even one about Tyrone, who  knocked up 4 girls in the gang,  out of 20. Students are asked to figure out the percentage. My son, he took a picture of it in class and he texted it to me. I couldn t believe it,  Erica Hall said.Hall said her son sent her a text photo of the quiz his eighth-grade language arts teacher passed out Friday. Hall said even the kids thought it was some kind of joke. They took it as a joke, and she told them that it wasn t it a joke, and they had to complete it, and turn it in,  Hall said.Source: Fox10Here s the video:FOX10 News | WALAIf you can t see the questions, here are some. All of the 10 questions follow this theme:Dwayne pimps 3 ho s (sic). If the price is $85 per trick, how many tricks per day must each ho turn to support Dwayne s $800 per day crack habit?Raul wants to cut the pound of cocaine he bought for $40,000 to make a 20% profit. How many one ounce bags will he need to make to obtain the 20% profit?LaShaunda is a lookout for the gang. Lacuna also has a Boa Constricter that eats 5 rats per week at the cost of $5 per rat. If LaShaunda makes $700 (sic) week as a lookout, how many weeks can she feed the Boa on one week s income?Some of the students thought the test was hilarious, but parents did not. Even racist parents likely objected to the very adult themes.The teacher, who appeared to lazily pull this test off the internet, has been suspended, although their name has not yet been released. This isn t the first school to give that test, though. Many across the country, mostly in Southern states, have given either this test or something similar.Featured image via video screen capture.

 Judge Recommends Joe Arpaio For Criminal Prosecution After He’s Found Guilty Of Perjury,"After being held in civil contempt for failing to follow a judge s order not to racially profile, Sherriff Joe Arpaio and others held in the contempt of court may now be facing criminal prosecution.Judge G. Murray Snow, who presided over the civil contempt case after finding evidence that Arpaio and other deputies intentionally violated order, referred the case to the criminal court system: The purpose of Tuesday s hearing was to discuss remedies for the civil contempt violations and the possibility of referring Arpaio and others to the U.S. Attorney s Office for Arizona for criminal contempt charges, which could carry prison sentences. The other individuals who may face criminal charges are Captain Steve Bailey, the former head of the MCSO s internal affairs; attorney for the Maricopa County Sherriff s Office Michele Iafrate; Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan.According to the Phoenix New Times:Bailey and Iafrate allegedly misled the court s monitor about the existence of more than 1,400 IDs improperly seized by the MCSO from individuals stopped or arrested, many of them Latinos. Misleading the monitor is potentially a federal offense, punishable by five years in prison. Snow directly addressed the attorney at one point, saying,  Ms. Iafrate, I think you should obtain counsel though he said he may refer the matter concerning her to State Bar of Arizona for possible disciplinary proceedings.A crooked Sheriff with a crooked attorney. When Snow made his original findings, the ACLU requested that all parties involved on MCSO s side be referred to the U.S. Attorney, and be charged with perjury, obstruction of justice, lying to the monitor and other crimes. Snow agreed, saying,  If the DOJ wants to pursue charges based on my findings, they can.  He also agreed with the ACLU s request that Arpaio be fined more than $300,000 for his offenses.Charges for Arpaio, if found guilty in criminal court of committing perjury, could carry up to five years in prison. The perjury charges stem from the civil trial, when Judge Snow asked if Arpaio s office had improperly investigated Snow and tied him to an anti-Eric Holder conspiracy. Arpaio repeatedly said no. That was found to have been a lie.Arpaio s criminal attorney pleaded with the judge to go lenient on the Sheriff, saying a criminal probe would be  devastating to the Sheriff s office and the sheriff himself,  and said that Arpaio has a  broken heart and contrite spirit.  He also complained that the fine of $100,000 Arpaio already has to pay is harsh enough, considering it s one year s worth of salary.Cry me a river. Thankfully, Judge Snow shot him down real quick.Let s hope Sheriff Joe finally goes to jail for his years of racial profiling, abuse of power, and wasting taxpayer money.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The PGA Just Gave Donald Trump A Big Middle Finger, And He’s P*ssed","Long before Donald Trump owned the Doral Golf Course   in 1962, to be exact   it became the home to the PGA World Golf Championships. Now, the tournament is moving to Mexico, one of the countries the presidential candidate rants the most about on the campaign trial, and the billionaire is not happy, not at all.Supposedly, it s not a political move. It is purely economic. The auto manufacturer, Cadillac, pulled out of sponsorship, so they have to leave Trump s resort and head to cheaper grounds.Fox News asked Trump about the move, and he didn t waiver from his antagonistic and xenophobic campaign rhetoric. Cadillac s been a great sponsor, but they re moving it to Mexico,  Trump said in a Tuesday night interview on Fox News.  They re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance. They re moving it to Mexico City,  he continued.  And I m saying, you know, what s going on here? It is so sad when you look at what s going on with our country. For Cadillac, it all boiled down to money. The cost to them for sponsorship is well above $10 million for a single tournament. Beyond that, people just don t care that much anymore. The tournament has lost its luster,  said Erik Compton, a PGA Tour player who lives in Miami.  The community just doesn t seem as involved. Source: ESPNWhile this isn t political, Trump obviously takes it very personally   as he should. While this wasn t intended to be a Donald Trump snub, almost any country would have been better for Trump than Mexico, the country against which Trump wants to build a giant wall. It s also a country Trump has accused of intentionally sending its criminals our way: The worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government. The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The Border Patrol knows this,  Trump wrote.  Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world. Source: Business InsiderPrivately, though, Trump has no problem outsourcing jobs to our neighbor to the south. His own line of clothing is made in Mexico.

 REPORT: Donald Trump Has Been Involved In Thousands Of Lawsuits – The Total Number Will Floor You,"If you ve been following Donald Trump at all, you re aware of how many times he s threatened to sue everyone on the planet. He s flat-out said he wants to loosen libel laws so that the press can t say anything bad about him. USA Today looked into his background of litigation, and what they found is absolutely appalling.An exhaustive investigation of Trump s background shows that he s been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in state and federal courts. They deal with everything from casino customers to multi-million dollar real estate battles, to his ongoing tax battles and more, over the past 30 years. After summarizing all of this, USA Today said: The sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. No candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of Trump s courtroom entanglements.  [emphasis mine]Even more interesting than that is how these actions break down:In addition to all of that, 70 new cases have been filed since Trump formally announced his candidacy.Trump loves litigation, and this analysis demonstrates that. During the GOP primary season, Trump threatened to sue Ted Cruz over his  natural-born  status, and the Republican National Committee over his loss in Louisiana. He recently threatened to sue The New York Times, and even threatened a copyright lawsuit over an artist s nude drawing of him.In other words, he threatens to sue at the drop of a hat, so it s not too terribly surprising that he s been the plaintiff in at least 1,900 different cases.This analysis isn t the first that USA Today has done on Trump s legal problems. In mid-May, they released a report that tied Trump to over 100 lawsuits involving his businesses and tax evasion. At the time, five of Trump s companies had warrants against them, just from the State of New York, for over $13,000 in unpaid and late taxes. All told, his businesses owed over $300,000 in back taxes at one point (which were eventually paid in full).He also sued the New York City Tax Commission 55 times over roughly 15 years for their property value assessments of properties his father once owned.Alan Garten, the general counsel for the Trump Organization, calls this  the cost of doing business,  and said that he believes they have less litigation than other companies of similar size. That s probably what Trump himself would say, too, however, USA Today compared Trump to five other big-name real estate developers and found that to be untrue. Trump has actually been involved in more legal actions than the other five combined.What does this mean for a potential presidency? The overwhelming amount of litigation that Trump has been involved in does provide clues as to how he ll lead the country. USA Today s assessment of that says: The legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief. He sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force. He doesn t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources, such as homeowners. He sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers, lawyers and other vendors.As he campaigns, Trump often touts his skills as a negotiator. The analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools. He turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the Trump brand to secure investments. There are all sorts of problems that a Trump presidency would bring, not the least of which involves starting wars with countries that piss him off. When China, Russia, Iran, or anybody else with whom we re on shaky terms, refuses to cooperate with him, what will he do? If lawsuits are a primary negotiating tool for him in the business world, what will play that role in the world of foreign policy? What will he do to Congress when they don t do as he tells them?The questions, and their possible answers, paint a terrifying picture that boggles the mind.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" EPIC: Obama RIPS Trump And The GOP To SHREDS In First Big Speech Of 2016 Election (VIDEO, TWEETS)","President Obama made what was billed as an economic speech in Elkhart, Indiana but in reality it was his first speech of the presidential campaign and was a preview of the sort of case he will make against Donald Trump this fall.Obama made it clear he was speaking about Trump, telling the crowd,  If we fall for a bunch of okeydoke just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative then we re not going to build on the progress that we started. Echoing the speaking style that led him to back-to-back presidential victories, Obama picked apart, step by step, many of the Republican complaints about his administration.Obama told the crowd he would do some  mythbusting,  to loud applause. He pointed out that Donald Trump s claim that other countries are  killing us on trade  and that immigrants are taking American jobs are just completely myths. He also explained that he wanted to  bust this myth of crazy liberal government spending  hurting economic growth.He pointed out that in nearly every measure of the economy, compared to how it was before he came into office, things are much improved.The White House released a series of tweets and graphs pointing out over and over how his leadership has transformed the economy for the better: Over the past six years, our businesses have created more than 14 million new jobs.""  @POTUS in Elkhart pic.twitter.com/BYknKBnaa0  The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 1, 2016 For the first time ever, more than ninety percent of the country has health insurance.   @POTUS on Elkhart pic.twitter.com/MsHaN1fnHh  The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 1, 2016 Our deficits haven t grown these past seven and a half years; we ve cut them by almost 75%.   @POTUS pic.twitter.com/k24EI0FGQ6  The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 1, 2016Obama also pointed out that Republicans have been wrapped up  this cult of small government,  when in reality the government has a role to play in helping to keep the economy going. The President pointed out as well that Trump s proposal to weaken regulations on Wall Street is  crazy. Discussing economic inequality and worker s rights, Obama explained that these issues were better addressed when more families belonged to unions, and that the move from 1 in 4 families being in unions to now it being 1 in 10 has hurt wage growth. Obama noted,  It s not a coincidence that as union membership shrank, inequality grew and wages stagnated .  He added,  America shouldn t be changing our laws to make it harder for workers to organize. Repeatedly during the speech, Obama encouraged journalists to fact check his claims, and told the audience if they doubted his statements they should  look it up. The election has begun, and President Obama is on the trail. Watch out, Trump.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Thanks To Dem Governor, Louisiana Starts Enrolling Over 375,000 People Onto Medicaid","Bobby Jindal s worst nightmare has come true: poor people are going to get the healthcare they deserve, and it s all thanks to a Democrat.Louisiana s Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards has delivered on his promise to expand Medicaid. As of June 1, the state s Department of Health and Hospitals will begin to enroll over 375,000 eligible citizens into Louisiana s expanded program. The state hopes to enroll half the individuals by July 1.Ruth Kennedy, who heads the DHH s Medicaid enrollment program, says the department will be implementing an  all hands on deck  approach, in an effort to get as many people into the program as possible: I am confident, and I am ready, and this is not my first rodeo. The governor, you ll remember, said at a press conference that people would have cards in their hands on July 1. That s a big difference from starting enrollment on July 1. Well, we won t have 375,000 cards in people s hands, but I m absolutely certain we ll be more than halfway there. Look at that, government that works efficiently to ensure everybody has access to healthcare. What a concept. And to make the operation run more smoothly, Louisiana will set up over 204 application sites all across the state with workers from the University Medical Center in New Orleans. In an effort to reduce headache, the DHH will  use the income data it has already gathered, rather than having to collect new information, and food stamp numbers can also be used on an annual basis to reaffirm eligibility when the time comes. This practice is a  big deal  according to Kennedy because it won t all for an eligibility purge from bureaucratic mistakes.So what happens when a Democrat governor, a Medicaid advocate, nurses and employees with the state s universities and department get together? Over 375,000 people get the healthcare they not only need but deserve.Featured image via Tyler Kaufman/Getty Images",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Owes A Foreign Bank At Least $100 Million – And It’s Fighting U.S. Regulators,"While the country has a meltdown over Hillary Clinton s email scandal (even though she didn t break any federal laws), there seems to be a blind eye on an even bigger scandal   and yes, it would involve Donald Trump.Mother Jones reports that should Trump win the presidency, he will potentially face having to owe over $100 million to Deutsche Bank, which has sparred with U.S. regulators for years. Such a conundrum would be the biggest conflict of interest any presidential candidate has ever faced.Here are the facts:Trump has acquired quite a bit of debt, totaling roughly $355 million (or possibly more) from various loans from a multitude of lenders. His ambiguous financial statement lists 16 loans from 11 different creditors. At least five of these loans are worth $50 million or more, and have no been paid back (at least in full).Deutsche Bank appears to be Trump s biggest line of credit, with loans totaling $295 million for two projects alone  $125 million to buy Trump National Doral golf course, and most recently $170 million for his newest project, his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. With the election a mere five months away, and the hotel slated to open in fall, Trump will (if elected) waltz into the White House owing a foreign bank more than $100 million.That, as Richard Painter, an attorney who teaches at the University of Minnesota puts it, is very troublesome. For starters, this will mean that as President of the United States, Trump will literally be beholden to a foreign bank. And if it s anything like his Ocean City Taj Mahal, will it ever be paid? With bookings for his hotels dropping by a whopping 60 percent, who knows. As Painter told Mother Jones:They [former presidents] had large assets and usually diversified assets. They weren t in a situation where someone could put pressure on them to do what they want. Whereas having a president who owes a lot of money to banks, particularly when it s on negotiable terms it puts them at the mercy of the banks and the banks are at the mercy of regulators. In real estate, the prevailing business model is to own a lot but also owe a lot, and that is a potentially very troublesome business model for someone in public office.Just because Trump is a billionaire doesn t mean he ll pay it all back with full faith. As Mother Jones reminds readers:In 2005, Trump borrowed $640 million from Deutsche Bank and several other lenders for the construction of a Chicago hotel tower. When he failed to pay back the money on time in 2008, the banks, including Deutsche Bank, demanded he pay up the $40 million he had personally guaranteed. In response, Trump sued Deutsche Bank for $3 billion, saying the project s financial troubles were the fault of the economic recession, essentially an act of God, and accusing the bank of undermining the project and his reputation.With no indication of a blind-trust being set up as to avoid a conflict of interest, one could assume Trump would bend the rules in his favor, as he boasts to always doing.And if that alone wasn t a reason to be suspicious, Deutsche Bank has been fighting U.S. regulators for years, which would make a partnership with Trump all the more conflicted.With an ongoing battle of trying to bypass the rules in favor of Wall Street, the German bank was forced to pay a staggering $2.5 billion fine for rigging interest rates. The fine included paying $600 million to the New York State Department of Financial Services, $800 million to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and $775 million to the Department of Justice.The bank also reached multiple settlements for price fixing metals.Great business partners you got there, Trump. When Democrats and Republicans say Hillary Clinton is beholden to banks, maybe the attention should be turned to Trump, who literally owes a bank over $100 million.It s no wonder Trump has pledge to repeal Dodd-Frank.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Melania Trump And Heidi Cruz Finally Get Together On ‘Maya & Marty’ – And It’s Hilarious (VIDEO),"Someone we haven t heard a lot from during the course of this year s election cycle is Melania Trump, wife of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. However, wait no longer, because Maya Rudolph on her new show Maya & Marty just gave us what we can only assume to be a pretty accurate representation of the wannabe First Lady.Rudolph s Melania introduces us to the world of edible diamonds, which are pretty much just regular diamonds that you eat. Alongside Melania on this new venture is Heidi Cruz, wife of Senator Ted Cruz, played by the brilliant Kate McKinnon from SNL.The two ladies get together and discuss the presidential race while munching on some of the diamonds. Heidi starts by saying,  Ted would be very upset to know that I m here, so shhh  but truthfully, you know I m quite fond of you  Also saying,  l love being compared to you.  With Melania saying,  it s so funny because my face is so perfect, and yours is so loose and fun, it s like a broken balloon.  The satirized comparison obviously going back to when the two real-life women were compared on Twitter.It s doubtful these women would ever be friends in real life, but watching Rudolph and McKinnon together is worth every second of viewing.Check the hilarious sketch out here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Calls In Live To CNN To Pummel Trump On Veteran Donations (VIDEO),"When listening to Donald Trump one really can t believe anything he actually says without tangible proof. Let s just say he s not the most honest fellow, and he s a guy who really likes to talk himself up, regardless of facts.One of the biggest falsifications of actual events that Trump has gotten caught doing is with his supposed donations to Veteran groups. Then when called out on these pretty blatant falsehoods by reporters, he verbally assaults them because he doesn t like people calling him out on his lies.Noticing these lies and misrepresentations of actualities is Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Just imagine if it were her greatly exaggerating claims of raising money for Veterans and donations made by herself to organizations. She would get eaten alive by the press and it would likely be a major game-changer.Clinton called in live to CNN regarding Trump, and said: Well, I think the problem here is the difference between what Donald Trump says and what Donald Trump does. He s bragged for months about raising six million dollars for veterans and donating a million dollars himself. But it took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution and getting the money to Veterans. So, look, I m glad he finally did, but I don t know that he should get much credit for that. And she s absolutely correct, and it s likely very true that if Trump hadn t been called out then those donations probably still would not have been made.Donald Trump loves Donald Trump more than anyone else on this planet, and like everyone else, when someone goes after the one you love you may get brutally defensive, as we ve witnessed with the media scrutinization of Trump s supposed donations. And if he can t handle the scutinization from the press, how the hell is he going to handle being leader of the free world?Listen here: Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump was shamed into  actually making his contribution  to veterans https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/YBtMm3adVE  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 31, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Top Gun Lobbyist Threatens To Use The ‘Bullet Box’ If Trump Doesn’t Win At The Ballot Box (AUDIO),"A top gun lobbyist has just warned Americans that if a conservative candidate (meaning Donald Trump) doesn t get elected into the White House, right-wing gun nuts just might open fire.Larry Pratt, who is the executive director of Gun Owners of America and a former Virginia lawmaker, went on his Gun Owners News Hour radio program earlier this week to share a message with anyone who isn t voting GOP in November. In a ridiculous rant, Pratt warned that if Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton get into the White House this election, they ll likely nominate a Democrat as a U.S. Supreme Court justice   a move that could, according to Pratt, threaten gun lovers  precious Second Amendment rights.While pro-gun conservatives have often used this particular argument to scare voters into doubling down on their support for the GOP, Pratt s solution to this problem was concerning, to say the least. He said: We would have to come to an understanding, which we ve been sort of taught, it s been taught out of us, that the courts do not have the last word on what the Constitution is. They decide particular cases, they don t make law. Their decisions, unlike the Roe v. Wade usurpation, don t extend to the whole of society, they re not supposed to, and we may have to reassert that proper constitutional balance, and it may not be pretty. So I d much rather have an election where we solve this matter at the ballot box than have to resort to the bullet box. Yes, Pratt just threatened to use gun violence to get a Republican into the White House. After making this ridiculous remark, his guest   American Civil Rights Union fellow Robert Knight   offered another ridiculous solution. Knight said, Well, there s impeachment, too. You can listen to the crazy conversation between these two idiots below:This isn t the first time Pratt has suggested gun violence to solve a problem and get his way. In March, Pratt objected to President Barack Obama s preferred replacement for the late Antonin Scalia. When Obama announced Merrick Garland as his judicial nominee, Pratt said: The Second Amendment is all about people like Judge Garland.

 S.E. Cupp SLAMS Trump For His Attacks On The Media (VIDEO),"Throughout his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has whined about the media. He calls reporters  dishonest,  tells the thousands of low-information voters who flock to his rallies that the press hates him and therefore they should hate the press. He points to the press pit at these events and tells his supporters to yell at them and every single time he does an interview he complains that someone somewhere in the world of media, even right-wing media, is treating him  unfairly.  On Tuesday, CNN s S.E. Cupp slammed the presidential candidate for his treatment of the media and said that he is  fundamentally confused about the roll of free press. During a press conference about his  support  of veteran s groups on Tuesday, Trump threw another hissy fit about reporters and said that they are being  nasty  and not giving him credit for giving money to vets. Cupp responded to his whining, saying: When you re talking about suing journalists for doing their job, he s not saying that we re getting the story wrong, we re actually doing our job asking questions about where this money went that s the job of the press. He actually said in this press conference today, I wish you d just say thank you, thank me for,  that s not the role of the media, to thank the presidential nominee for raising money. It s not the job of the media to heap praise upon him. So I just think that he s fundamentally very confused about the role of free press.. .@secupp: Trump says he wished the press would just say thank you, that s not the role of the media! https://t.co/QUwwpKW7uS  The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) May 31, 2016I disagree, I think Trump is very aware of the role of the free press, but he doesn t want his supporters to be aware of it. It is no secret that the people who support the billionaire are not the brightest crayons in the box. Trump has even talked about how much he loves his  poorly educated voters.  He needs to convince these people to distrust the press because then they will just tune out the stories that would sink his candidacy. He needs them to ignore the shadiness around the money he supposedly raised for veterans. He needs them to ignore the Trump University story and how he swindled people out of their money. He needs them to ignore every single bad report that they may see on the news in the coming months. It is the easiest way to lead his sheep to slaughter.Trump may be a bombastic, racist, lying asshole, but he isn t stupid   and he is playing his supporters like a fiddle.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Creationist Freak Ken Ham LOSES IT Because The Press Cares About A Gorilla (TWEETS),"Ken Ham is a right-wing, young-Earth creationist lunatic. EVERYTHING in this man s world revolves around the Bible and he wants the rest of us to be just as nuts. On Wednesday, this idiot turned his attentions to the fact that the press has been covering the tragic death of a gorilla who was shot dead because a 3-year-old fell into his enclosure. Proving that he is as heartless as he is crazy, Ham went off on the press for covering the story via his Twitter account. Here are the unhinged tweets:In 5 days thousands babies murdered by abortion, 700 refugees drown, 68 shot in Chicago and a Gorilla dominates news https://t.co/Ar4gG2qgQv  Ken Ham (@aigkenham) June 1, 2016We cannot impose human emotion/morality on a gorilla it is not made in the image of God https://t.co/Ar4gG2qgQv  Ken Ham (@aigkenham) June 1, 2016That s right   we shouldn t feel badly about this poor, innocent animal s death because of something written in a 2,000-year-old book and interpreted by a person who is arguably one of the craziest men alive right now. As if that weren t bad enough, Ham took to his blog to use the bible to insist that he is right and everyone else is wrong to be concerned about the tragic death of this so-called  sin-cursed  gorilla. He ranted: Because we live in a fallen world, sin has affected everything, including gorillas and three-year-olds. Therefore when deciding what to do in a situation where a human being, made in God s image, is in the control of a sin-cursed animal with no sense of human morality, we must do all we can to protect the child from harm. Sure, we have to protect the kid from the gorilla, but that doesn t mean that it isn t a tragedy just the same. Ken Ham, you are insane. Please seek help. Further, you might want to stay off Twitter until you do.Featured image via Mark Lyons/Getty Images",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Former CIA Director Says Trump Is Actually HELPING ISIS – Here’s How,"Donald Trump s idiotic followers may believe that Trump is going to eradicate the Islamic State, especially considering the fact that he threatens to  bomb the sh*t  out of them every chance he gets, but quite the opposite is actually happening. According to former CIA director Michael Hayden, who was also the head of the NSA, Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric is probably helping the terror group instead. In a recent interview with the Guardian, Hayden explained that  the jihadist narrative is that there is undying enmity between Islam and the modern world. When Trump says they all hate us, he s using their narrative. He s feeding their recruitment video. Hayden is correct, no one has slammed Muslims more than The Donald. No once can forget his comments in December, which came a few days after a terrorist shooting in San Bernardino, California. Trump s reaction to the Muslim shooters  attack was: Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. Islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people and Trump threatened to ban every single one of them from entering the United States. If that s not a major motivator for terrorists to attack America, I m not sure what is. Even after Trump s horrific anti-Muslim comments, the xenophobia didn t stop. In fact, it was just the beginning. Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric has inspired violence and harassment toward Muslims all over the United States   for example, people wearing hijabs are being called  terrorist  or are being physically attacked for no reason other than their religion. It s not a coincidence that these attacks were all performed by Trump supporters. Hayden isn t the only one to recently suggest that Trump s anti-Islamic rhetoric is actually a good thing for the terrorist group. Just a few days ago, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman said that the Islamic State would love it if Donald Trump got elected. Friedman said: They would want someone who they think would do something more extreme than the other, push America back in the Middle East, and therefore inflame the situation in a way that ISIS thinks would benefit them.

 Sean Hannity Accidentally Makes The Case For Media’s Scrutiny Of Trump’s Vets Fundraiser (VIDEO),"It s no secret that Sean Hannity is one of Donald Trump s biggest bootlickers. Following Trump s most recent press conference, in which he slammed the media and even called ABC reporter Tom Llamas  a sleaze  to his face, Hannity spoke with Trump about the so-called  liberal media,  and what they ve been doing to the poor guy.During the back-and-forth (Hannity is so far up Trump s rear that this can hardly be called an interview), Hannity demonstrated his complete ignorance of the media s coverage of The Donald s veterans fundraiser by asking: Do they think you need the money? Do they think you re gonna steal it? Yes, and yes. That s the whole issue right there. Apparently, Hannity hasn t been paying attention or he d have known not to ask that question.First of all, Trump s campaign is hardly self-funded and is low on money. He had to have known his  self-funding  scheme couldn t last forever. We re also talking about the liar of liars here   who in their right mind wouldn t be suspicious when money goes missing?In addition to the campaign s financial woes, the Washington Post contacted every one of the 24 charities that Trump listed as beneficiaries of his largesse, back in March, to find out what had happened to that $6 million that he said he raised. They could only account for $3 million of it.There was also Sandra Miniutti, the vice president of Charity Navigator, who said that it s not uncommon for some fundraisers to vet beneficiaries after the fact, such as when they re raising funds in times of emergency. That makes sense, because they need to work quickly under those circumstances. Raising the money and then vetting potential beneficiaries is the fastest way to do it.Miniutti also said, though, that it was fair to question why it was taking so long to distribute the money. Trump already had a list of potential beneficiaries ready, and his fundraiser was ridiculously public. His groups should have been vetted beforehand.Furthermore, Trump received heavy criticism from some veterans groups who were angry at him for using them as a political stunt, and who were angry because they hadn t yet received the money they were promised. It wasn t just the press that was trying to figure this out. Hannity, however, has his blinders firmly in place and is likely blissfully unaware that he just made the  liberal media s  case for them.Watch the whole debacle of an interview below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Meet David French, The Independent Who Republicans Recruited To Run Against Donald Trump","Conservative commentator and Trump hater Bill Kristol has been hinting at a third-party alternative to the GOP frontrunner for months. On Friday, Kristol tweeted that he had indeed found his candidate, and that he was the true principled conservative who would offer voters something real and unique.Well, it s been announced who this Republican savior is and it s National Review writer and constitutional lawyer David French.The man with absolutely no name recognition is the alternative to Trump   a guy who literally has his name plastered on skyscrapers.Congratulations, Republicans, you ve managed to make yourselves look more stupid than you already have. They could have put Romney on the ticket, who may have been the best choice to take on Clinton and Trump. In a moment of irony, just a week ago, French was calling on Romney to run third party, saying he was the  only hope  for the GOP s survival. How about that, not even the current third party candidate thinks he s good enough.And French doesn t even fit the description of what Kristol and his allies were searching for. According to Bloomberg Politics:According to one person deeply involved in the efforts to recruit an independent challenger, the search has focused on individuals who have one or more of the following three traits seen as vital for credibly launching such a bid: fame, vast wealth, and elective experience.Oh, and there s one more harbinger: French hasn t actually officially announced his candidacy. So Kristol s only pick might no actually file to run in the first place.Whereas French may be conservative, he is more principled than Trump: while the GOP blowhard has multiple draft deferments and rips off veteran s organizations, French is an Iraq War veteran and a recipient of the Bronze Star.And French, like Kristol, has had a few words to say about Donald Trump. In March, French wrote a blistering critique of the real estate mogul titled  What Now, Conservatives?  likening him to segregationist George Wallace:The party of Lincoln is in ruins. A minority of its primary voters have torched its founders  legacy by voting for a man who combines old-school Democratic ideology, a bizarre form of hyper-violent isolationism, fringe conspiracy theories and serial lies with an enthusiastic flock of online racists to create perhaps the most toxic electoral coalition since George Wallace.How do you know French is a true Republican? He thinks Trump ruined the GOP when it clearly was George W. Bush. Oh, and he once referred to Planned Parenthood as  disgusting,  so that gives you an insight as to how he feels about women s reproductive health.So maybe French isn t all that better than Donald Trump. Republicans just aren t ready for an orange man with a bad comb-over and tiny hands to ruin their party.Featured image via 93.1 FM WIBC",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Read President Obama’s Moving Proclamation Declaring June LGBT Pride Month,"Every year President Obama  declares  June LGBT pride month. Last year s pride month was a little more special considering the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage across all 50 states.This year, however, showcases another important issue: transgender rights. As states in the south mimic their bigotry from the era of Jim Crow by intentionally discriminating against trans individuals, President Obama and his administration continue to fight for everyone, no matter who they are or who they love.The proclamation begins:Since our founding, America has advanced on an unending path toward becoming a more perfect Union. This journey, led by forward-thinking individuals who have set their sights on reaching for a brighter tomorrow, has never been easy or smooth. The fight for dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is reflected in the tireless dedication of advocates and allies who strive to forge a more inclusive society. They have spurred sweeping progress by changing hearts and minds and by demanding equal treatment   under our laws, from our courts, and in our politics.Taking a page out of the Martin Luther King Jr. handbook (literally), President Obama also echoes the timeless phrase that  we recognize all they have done to bring us to this point, and we recommit to bending the arc of our Nation towards justice. President Obama reaffirmed his administration s opposition to conversion therapy, and support of a national law protecting LGBT members of society from housing and employment discrimination, both in the public and private sector. The president also singled out those suffering from HIV/AIDS, especially men and women of color, and pledged support for more funding.Concluding with,  In line with America s commitment to the notion that all people should be treated fairly and with respect, champions of this cause at home and abroad are upholding the simple truth that LGBT rights are human rights,  and that Americans have a responsibility to end hatred and discrimination wherever they may see it, President Obama for his eighth and last time writes these timeless words of tolerance:By virtue of authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month.The love, tenderness, support and hope shown by President Obama is unparalleled to anything this country has seen before. Can anyone imagine a President Trump doing such a thing?Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: GOP Governor Tells Christians To Martyr Themselves For Right To Discriminate,"This is why we have separation of church and state, to guard this country from religious whackos like Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant.In April, Bryant signed a sweeping anti-LGBT law that allows public and private employers to discriminate against gay people and anyone else such as interracial couples, atheists, and people who have had premarital sex if they claim to have a  sincerely held religious belief. This abuse of religious liberty by Republicans has now reached fever pitch as many red states are adopting similar laws as a way to be bigoted assholes toward to certain groups of people. And now Bryant, despite being criticized by people in his own state, is calling upon Christians across the country to martyr themselves for the right to discriminate.During the right-wing Watchmen on the Wall conference, Family Research Council hate group leader Tony Perkins introduced Bryant as the winner of the first ever  Samuel Adams Religious Freedom Award  for passing the bigoted law in his state, which means Samuel Adams is probably rolling in his grave.Perkins declared that all elected officials should be  ministers of God  and Bryant kissed Perkins  ass by comparing him to David in the Biblical story of David and Goliath. I remember in Sunday school, reading one of my favorite stories. It was about a giant, a bad giant, who came into a valley one day and he called to the Israelites,  Send down your champion and let me vanquish him.  We were in that valley, but Tony Perkins was there with us. He was there as surely as Our Lord and Savior, as surely as the God of all gods stood there with us. And I can tell you how fortunate we are in this nation and in this organization to have a man of faith and leadership in Tony. God bless you for what you do. Bryant then proceeded to whine about the opposition to the discriminatory law he signed claiming that they don t know the history of Christians being persecuted and said Christians are willing to stand in line for crucifixion to secure their right to discriminate. They don t know that Christians have been persecuted throughout the ages. They don t know that if it takes crucifixion, we will stand in line before abandoning our faith and our belief in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So if we are going to stand, now is the time and this is the place. Here s the video via Right Wing Watch:This is proof of how insane conservative  Christians  have become. They imagine that they are being persecuted because they aren t allowed to refuse service to people they hate. Of course, if Christians were really being persecuted in this country they would be dragged out in the streets and beaten or killed as they are in countries where Christianity is a minority religion. That s what real persecution looks like.But Bryant is hardly the first Mississippi governor to use religion to justify bigotry. As a two-term governor and US Senator from the state in the 1920s through late 1940s, Bilbo believed that God sanctioned racism.According to Think Progress:For Senator Bilbo racism was more that just an ideology, it was a sincerely held religious belief. In a book entitled Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization, Bilbo wrote that  [p]urity of race is a gift of God . . . . And God, in his infinite wisdom, has so ordained it that when man destroys his racial purity, it can never be redeemed.  Allowing  the blood of the races [to] mix,  according to Bilbo, was a direct attack on the  Divine plan of God.  There  is every reason to believe that miscengenation and amalgamation are sins of man in direct defiance to the will of God. Another Mississippi governor named Ross Barnett was still repeating the same justification in 1960.  The good Lord was the original segregationist,  he claimed.Segregation has since been outlawed, but conservatives are still using the same argument to justify their bigotry and it s going to be fun watching a federal court put them in their place once again.Featured image via screenshot ",News,"June 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Why This Attorney General Is Going After Trump For ‘Fraud’,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman isn t going to allow Donald Trump s 2016 presidential campaign get in the way of his ongoing prosecution of the GOP frontrunner for  fraud. Schneiderman is the highest profile government official looking into Trump s shady business dealings at Trump University. Customers claim that after they signed up for the opportunity, they were pressured to spend ever-increasing amounts of money with little knowledge of the real estate business to show for it.In an interview with ABC, the attorney general explained that he s not going to back off. We re ready to go,  Schneiderman, a Democrat, told ABC News today.  We sued him long before anyone thought he might run for President. This is not a political case, it s just a straight-up fraud case. Like the judge also looking into the case, Scneiderman has come in for attack by Trump, who has used his high profile to impugn the prosecutor s motives. But that hasn t dissuaded the prosecutor.Schneiderman told ABC News he is not worrying about the confluence of the campaign and his case. The documents, he said only served to offer further proof that the operation was aimed less at teaching students the skills needed to buy and sell real state, and more about making money for Trump. It was clearly a way to separate people who were desperate to make money in hard economic times from their own cash and to get it into the pocket of Mr. Trump and his cronies,  Schneiderman said.The secret Trump University documents have revealed that workers at the operation were given a step-by-step manual on how to convince prospective  students  to give the company access to their money and also explained how to prey on their emotions in pursuit of profits. Trump University is now defunct, after Trump and his partners made money off of regular people, all while egging students on to profit from the 2007-8 real estate collapse.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Secret Trump University Papers Reveal How Business Pumped ‘Students’ For Cash,"It is now clear why Donald Trump attacked the judge in the case overseeing lawsuits against his now-defunct Trump University.The judge ordered the company s internal sales documents to be released over Trump s objections, and what they have exposed is a business that preyed on people s dreams of wealth and success   based on Trump s own image cultivated over the decades  using trick language and sales gimmicks right out of the sleaziest  boiler room. The  playbooks  for the now-defunct business owned by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, were unsealed Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit by customers who say they were defrauded. Last Friday, a judge who has earned Trump s scorn sided with attorneys for The Washington Post who argued that the public had a right to know what was previously confidential.The documents outline how employees should guide customers through  the roller coaster of emotions  once they have expressed interest. The motivation that they experienced can die quickly as the realities of their daily lives take over. It is our job to rekindle that motivation   to make them once again see the potential of achieving their dream,  according to a  sales playbook. The documents show how, rather than a real estate sales course, the Trump University system was designed to push people to pay for ever-increasing levels which they were told would lead to more and more lucrative business. In fact, as the lawsuits show, many were very unsatisfied with the experience. Even more damning is the fact that the business doesn t even exist anymore, but is just another scheme that Trump slapped his name on in order to make a quick buck then ran away when it got complicated.Trump was apparently so concerned about the information in the sales documents coming out that he rescheduled the press conference he had to address his failure to give money to veterans groups to the same day the Trump University documents came out.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The Gun Shop Owner That Banned Muslims Is Now Selling Obama, Bernie And Hillary Targets (IMAGE)","One of Florida s most infamous gun shop owners is yet again making headlines   this time for selling targets that have the faces of President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on them.Last year, Florida Gun Supply owner Andy Hallinan raised eyebrows by banning Muslims from his store, when he made this announcement via a YouTube video: I have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety of all patriots in my community, and so effective immediately, I m declaring Florida Gun Supply as a Muslim-free zone. I will not arm and train those who wish to do harm to my fellow patriots. This of course, got the attention of the racist murderer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman. Naturally, the two gun nuts joined forces to sell confederate flag paintings through Hallinan s store so that Zimmerman could pay his living expenses. Apparently racism and hate speech works, because Zimmerman was able to make $100,000 on a painting so horrible a first grader could have done better.Now, Hallinan s latest stunt is an idea all of his own. On his website, BernieTargets.com,  he is selling the targets with the three Democrats  faces on them for $4.99, marked down from $9.99.Bernietargets.com Hallinan has several other  classy  products for sale on the site, such as a  Muslim-free zone vehicle sticker , an  ISIS hunting permit , a  Mohammed target , a  Muslim-free yard sign ,  Liberal tears gun oil  and a  Hillary for prison 2016 yard sign .If this guy is a fan of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, that wouldn t be a surprise at all. Hallinan clearly agrees with Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric, and is probably right on board with The Donald s horrific proposal to ban all Muslims from coming into the country   which is pretty much what Hallinan tried to do on a smaller scale with his store last year.This type of xenophobia, and blatant hate toward those with different religious (and political views) is so dangerous. Having targets with the faces of President Barack Obama (who Trump has repeatedly implied is Muslim) and this year s Democratic candidates is truly blurring the line between parody and inciting violence.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Kim Jong Un And North Korean Media Enthusiastically Want Trump To Become President,"When your presidential candidate is supported by the media of a corrupt tyrannical regime, that s a bad sign.North Korea is a sworn enemy of the United States, threatening us with nuclear strikes for many years and demanding that we pull our military out of South Korea, a move that would almost certainly be followed by a North Korean invasion of our ally.And that s precisely why North Korean media is enthusiastic about Donald Trump.According to NKNews.org,The article published in state media outlet DPRK Today also referred to Trump s proposal to hold direct talks with Kim Jong Un, praising the likely Republican nominee as a  wise politician  and  far-sighted presidential candidate. In my personal opinion, there are many positive aspects to the Trump s  inflammatory policies ,  wrote Han Yong Mook, who introduced himself as a Chinese North Korean scholar. Trump said  he will not get involved in the war between the South and the North,  isn t this fortunate from North Koreans  perspective? Indeed, it would be most fortunate for North Korea because they wouldn t have to fight our military and South Korea s military at the same time in their effort to unite the two Koreas under a single banner. Of course, uniting would come at a great cost to South Korea since Kim Jong Un would still be the dictator of a united Korea. That is non-negotiable as far as the North Korean leader is concerned.Trump has already threatened to pull US forces out of South Korea unless the government in Seoul increases domestic military spending. Furthermore, he has indicated that he would like to negotiate with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.DPRK Today especially likes this and urged Trump to do it. Yes do it, now   Who knew that the slogan  Yankee Go Home  would come true like this? The day when the  Yankee Go Home  slogan becomes real would be the day of Korean Unification. They even went so far as to attack Hillary Clinton on Trump s behalf, which every single American should be concerned about. The president that U.S. citizens must vote for is not that dull Hillary   who claimed to adapt the Iranian model to resolve nuclear issues on the Korean Peninsula   but Trump, who spoke of holding direct conversation with North Korea. Seriously, North Korea is part of the  axis of evil  former President Bush spoke of during his tenure in the White House. Now the Republican Party has gone from that to being endorsed by North Korean media.Aidan Foster-Carter of the University of Leeds, who is Honorary Senior Research Fellow in Sociology and Modern Korea, viewed the media support as concerning. Admittedly it is not exactly Pyongyang speaking, or at least not the DPRK government in an official capacity,  Foster-Carter conceded.  But it is certainly Pyongyang flying a kite, or testing the waters. For the rest of us, this is a timely reminder   if it were needed   of just how completely Trump plans to tear up established U.S. policy in the region; and what an irresponsible, unthinking menace the man is. Again, the Republican presidential nominee has the support of North Korea because he has threatened to weaken South Korea if Seoul does not comply with his demands.Trump has even expressed admiration for the way Kim Jong Un kills people to retain power. You ve got to give him credit. How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals and all of a sudden, you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it s a culture thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. Every American should be very concerned and very scared about this, especially Republicans who claim they care about our national security and the security of our closest allies.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Goes Completely Racist When Reporting Dead Gorilla Story (VIDEO),"Last weekend, news feeds everywhere were filled with the horrific story of a beautiful silverback gorilla being shot after a 3-year-old boy fell into his enclosure.Anyone who s a parent knows that kids are very slippery. They know that in the blink of an eye, a child can become distracted and run off. Still, rather than blame the Cincinnati Zoo for possibly overreacting, people were blaming the parents. Some of those people, including Fox News, though, are taking that line of blame to a whole new level. They are adding a solid dose of racism.Here s a video of the gorilla with the boy, decide for yourself if the gorilla was trying to hurt or save the boy:The boy and his parents are African-American   a detail which would be meaningless if it weren t for Fox News and racists across the nation. Many people blamed the parents, and the mother, who was at the zoo with her boy and other children, certainly deserves her share of it, but Fox and their classy followers are blaming the father, who wasn t even there. The father, it appears, served time in prison.The Daily Mail, which is one of Great Britain s conservative, lowbrow newspapers, reported that the boy s father, Deonne Dickerson, has a criminal history. He was convicted in 2006 for drug trafficking. He was also charged with numerous other charges, including criminal trespass, disorderly conduct and kidnapping.The Daily Mail does note, however, that Dickerson has appeared to turn his life around. That didn t stop Fox News from running with the story, though. The father has a long rap sheet, including drugs and kidnapping charges,  Fox News host Abby Huntsman noted at the beginning of the program. Some say the parents need to be charged,  co-host Ainsley Earhardt later told wildlife expert Grant Kemmerer,  bringing up the dad s past criminal history who wasn t even there at the zoo at the time. The father wasn t even there. Think about that. Fox News is advocating criminally charging a man who wasn t even there. The fact is, Fox and their viewers won t be happy until all black men are behind bars.Here s the video:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch A 12-Year-Old ‘Scientist’ OBLITERATE Anti-Vaxxers’ Lies In 2 Minutes Flat (VIDEO),"A 12-year-old boy has just gone viral for absolutely shredding every anti-vaxxer s argument against vaccinating children.The boy, who goes by the name Marco Arturo, is a science-loving video blogger who uses his Facebook page to share his findings and ignite discussions related to science. His latest video was a major hit, and has left the young boy shocked that his 2-minute video has been seen by more people than the population of Bahamas, Belize, Greenland, Monaco, Bermuda and Dominica combined.  His educational message to anti-vaxxers has been viewed millions of times, and when you watch it, you will understand why.Marco begins the video addressing two major concerns being proposed by anti-vaxxers: that vaccines are to blame for autism, and that they re part of a government conspiracy. Marco says: We ve all been lied to by doctors and pharmaceutical companies about vaccines. After a lot of research I realized that vaccines do and will cause autism. At first it sounds like Marco is taking their side, but if anti-vaxxers thought they d just found their youngest recruit, they re dead wrong. Seconds later, Marco holds up a folder labeled Evidence that vaccines cause autism, stating that he will explain his findings  page by page.  By now, anti-vaxxers are probably salivating all over themselves, eager to hear the scientific proof that their ridiculous theories are correct. However, when Marco opens the folder, all of the pages are blank. Marco explains: I think it might be because there is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that vaccines are linked to autism in any way whatsoever. To make anti-vaxxers even more furious that they d been tricked so expertly, Marco stresses how important vaccines are, and what they re REALLY responsible for: saving the lives of millions of children. Marco closes by begging parents to get their children vaccinated, and reiterates that there is no evidence that can link vaccines to autism.In closing, Marco notices that one of the pages actually DOES have something on it, which might get gullible anti-vaxxers  hopes up once again. The page says one word:  MIC,  and Marco drops it.Here s Marco s brilliant video:Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Obstructionism Is About To Make An Elderly Disabled Couple Homeless,"An elderly, disabled couple in New Hampshire is suffering thanks to the United States  ridiculous classification of marijuana. Lorraine Sevigny, 61, and Brian Cardinale,59, may be evicted from their apartment after police raided their home and found a tiny amount of marijuana   that the couple uses for medicinal purposes   in a jar.On May 10, Lebanon police carried out a search warrant on the apartment, discovered the marijuana and issued them a citation. Police say they conducted the search after some busy-body an anonymous source provided them with  drug intel. Sevingy told officers that she uses the plant to relieve pain from a traumatic brain injury suffered in a car accident forty years ago. Cardinale smokes pot, in addition to taking 18 other drugs, to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). His debilitating illness, which attacks the central nervous system, has forced him to walk with a cane. Stairs are my mortal enemy,  said Cardinale. I m lucky. I m not in a wheelchair. Medical marijuana is legal in the state of New Hampshire, but Cardinale is unable to get a prescription for it because technically he does not have an address. His apartment was destroyed in a fire in February, so he moved in with Sevingy; unfortunately, the paperwork to put his name on the lease has not been processed yet.Ordinarily someone would not be evicted from an apartment for a misdemeanor drug citation but the type of complex and federal drug laws makes this case extremely frustrating.   The couples landlord, Twin Pines Housing Trust, is a non-profit organization that provides the elderly with low-rent places to live. The organization purchased Sevigny s apartment building in November with the help of a $6.8 million U.S. Department of Agriculture loan and that loan is the problem.When Twin Pines accepted the USDA loan they agreed to a zero-tolerance drug policy. After police searched the couples  home they notified Twin Pines about the marijuana they found and that triggered eviction proceedings.  Andrew Winter, executive director of Twin Pines, said: While we recognize that state policies on marijuana are rapidly evolving, we still need to comply with federal restrictions that govern the financing of our properties. And therein lies the problem. The federal government still has marijuana listed as a schedule 1 narcotic. A schedule 1 drug is one that could lead to  severe psychological or physical dependence.  MDMA (ecstasy) is considered a schedule 1 narcotic. LSD (acid) is considered a schedule 1 narcotic.In February 2015, Representatives Jared Polis (D-CO) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), tried to change the classification of marijuana with bill  H.R. 1013, the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act. In November 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced its companion bill to the Senate, unfortunately, like every bill introduced by Democrats in the Republican-controlled Congress, the bills never saw the light of day. Had Congress acted and declassified the plant as a schedule 1 drug, this couple would not be worried about their future because the police would have never raided their apartment. But here we are, all thanks to the GOP s inability to do their job.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Trump Call Reporter A ‘Sleaze’ For Having The Audacity To Report Facts,"How does the old saying go? The more unapologetically defensive you appear, the more guilty you probably are   or something like that. That at least seems to be the case with Donald Trump any time he is scrutinized on, well, pretty much anything. However, when it comes to his claim that he s raised money for veterans, even though many are saying he s grossly exaggerating the amount, he really doesn t like being called out on the discrepancy.During a press conference on Tuesday, Trump was asked by ABC s Tom Llamas: Mr. Trump, writing a one million dollar check is incredibly generous, but the night of that Iowa fundraiser you said you had raised $6 million. Clearly you had not. Your critics say you tend to exaggerate, you have a problem with the truth. Is this a prime example? Trump responded: No, I raised almost $6 million. Some of it didn t come through, but more money is coming through. The number is probably is going to be when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million. Trump then proceeds to blast the media, and then at one point called out Llamas directly, even calling him a  sleaze  for having the audacity to point out facts. Trump said: But what I don t want is when I raise millions of dollars, have people say, like this sleazy guy right over here from ABC. He s a sleaze in my book. You re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well. Ironically, Llamas does seem to know the facts well, and Trump doesn t like being called out on the fact that he s been exaggerating.Llamas took to Twitter shortly after saying:Trump just called me a ""sleaze."" Should be an interesting week.  Tom Llamas (@TomLlamasABC) May 31, 2016What sort of person running for leader of the free world behaves like this? Trump is completely thin-skinned and bullies anyone who dare question him. If he can t handle being scrutinized, how the hell is he going to lead the nation, or for that matter, work in our diplomatic world interests across the globe. Truth is, he wouldn t be able to. He s remarkably unqualified and we need to make sure he gets nowhere near the Oval Office.Watch Trump lose his damn mind here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Senators Don’t Want Ted Cruz Anywhere Near Their Re-Election Campaigns,"Ted Cruz thinks he could be an asset to the campaigns of his fellow Republican senators. There s just one problem, though: most of them don t like him.Republicans currently face an uphill climb this year, especially with Donald Trump at the top of the 2016 ballot. The nomination of Trump presents a major problem for Republicans who hope to keep their seats or take seats away from Democrats.Indeed, instead of riding Trump s coattails to victory, Republicans are looking at down-ballot rejection as people associate them with the Republican nominee and his vile campaign.Despite being destroyed by Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz wants to lend a hand to his colleagues. That can go a long way toward establishing good relationships,  one Cruz adviser told The Hill.  At the same time, though, I d be wildly surprised if he suddenly started moderating his principles just to get along. Establishing good rapport with colleagues is incredibly crucial to running for higher office. But Ted Cruz has alienated and pissed off most of his Senate colleagues because of his aggressive losing strategies in recent years, the biggest of which is undoubtedly the government shutdown in 2013.Cruz incited the shutdown because he thought it would force President Obama to dismantle Obamacare. In the end, it was a PR nightmare for Republicans as the American people rightfully blamed them for shutting the government down.But the Cruz adviser thinks his colleagues will be interested in taking Cruz s help. I think politicians are practical people,  he said.  They re going to be pretty interested in the kind of support he can give them I think fewer people would say they don t want him now. Unfortunately for Cruz, he seriously underestimates just how much his colleagues loathe him.As it stands, incumbent Republicans facing tough re-election battles don t want Ted Cruz making their lives more difficult.When asked by The Hill if she would accept help from Ted Cruz, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said,  Uh, no. I don t think I d ask anyone to come up, generally, other than I had [Sens.] Joni [Ernst (Iowa)] and Shelley [Moore Capito (W.Va.)] up,  she continued.  This is about me campaigning for New Hampshire. I m going to be focusing on my campaign for me. It s not a reflection on him, or anyone else he hasn t contacted me, but I m sure there s a lot of different races out there. In other words, please don t come to New Hampshire, Ted.In Pennsylvania, Senator Pat Toomey also faces a tough campaign, but that doesn t mean he wants Cruz there to make it worse.[Cruz is] not going to [be] into what my campaign is doing,  Toomey insisted.And then there is Arizona Senator John McCain, who has famously referred to Cruz as a  whacko bird.  Yeah, he definitely does not want Cruz stumping for him in his home state.McCain said he only seeks help from people he is close to.  I m not close to Sen. Cruz,  McCain declared.So it looks like many Republicans would rather not have Cruz s support, which isn t surprising considering how extreme he is on several issues.Frankly, if Cruz wanted his colleagues to be more enthusiastic, perhaps he should have thought about that before becoming the most annoying voice in the Senate.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 RNC’s Hilariously Delusional Election Model Predicts Obama Might Vote Trump,"The Republican Party is not well   we know it and they know it.After getting roasted in the last general election, the Republican Party conducted a fittingly named  autopsy  on what would need to change before 2016 in order for the party to successfully compete with Democrats. The overall conclusion was that the party needed to do a much better job of reaching out to young people and minorities. Instead, they nominated Donald Trump   a man who launched his campaign by accusing Mexicans of being rapists and who has been endorsed by several factions of the Ku Klux Klan.But rather than mourn the loss of their party, Republicans are just fudging the numbers just so they can get out of bed in the morning. Like Karl Rove screaming that the election wasn t over long past the time when the election was over, the party is trying to  unskew  the numbers that give Democrats a massive advantage going into November.And just how grim does it look for Republicans? Here s the latest projection for how the election might play out if Clinton does get the nomination.But you wouldn t know it if you worked in the Republican National Committee. Their  independent  database has some laughably optimistic assumptions about voters.One prominent example: the current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has been a staunch Democrat for his entire political career. Recently, he has repeatedly said he would vote for the Democratic nominee in November and he s lashed out against Trump, calling him both hateful and ignorant. It s hard to imagine another human being whose vote is more predictable. And yet There s a 95 percent likelihood Obama will vote in the 2016 general election, the database predicts, based on computer modeling. It also shows an 83 percent chance Obama will side with his party s nominee, while suggesting a 10 percent shot he ll back the Republican candidate. By the RNC s metrics, Obama has a 10 percent chance of voting for Donald Trump, and an additionally, there s roughly another 10 percent chance of voting for an Independent candidate It s baffling to think about how the RNC arrived at those numbers. One humorous conclusion is that while Republican politicians try to score cheap political points by labeling President Obama a radical leftist, their own calculations acknowledge he lies well within the current political spectrum. In other words, when they tell their supporters that Obama is a socialist, they know it s a lie.This is how the RNC fudges the numbers slightly so they can turn around and say they have a chance. The model doesn t go overboard. It simply puts its thumb on the scales a little. However, this  slight  lie will have big implications in how the actual election plays out. Obama, along with millions of voters, will, in fact, vote for Democratic candidates whether the RNC wants them to or not. As such, these white lies are merely an exercise in wishful thinking.It s becoming increasingly clear that the Republican Party is what happens when your brain has been exposed to dangerous levels of Fox News for years. The delusions get grander and more incredible, and the defense of those delusions gets more aggressive. The right-wing media has convinced even its own politicians that Obama is deeply unpopular, a failed statesman and a radical. He is none of those things and so the Republicans are perpetually stunned by his success.By way of one example, let s consider the fact that Mitt Romney actually believed right up until election night that he was going to win. This flew directly in the face of all the known data (including Nate Silver s career-making predictions). He and his team rejected any of the information that didn t adhere to their ideological belief that everyone hated Obama as much as Fox News had told them they did.And he got walloped.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Richard Dreyfuss Just Showed ‘Little-Dick’ Donald Trump How To Win A Twitter Battle (TWEETS),"Richard Dreyfuss has provided us with some of the finest moments in movie and television history. His ability to run the table on acting to bring us everything from Mr. Holland to Dick Cheney to Bob s savior, Dr. Leo Marvin, has made him a Hollywood icon and fan favorite for more than four decades. In the age of social media, Dreyfuss is also proving himself to be an amply armed Twitter warrior, taking on the likes of none other than Donald J. Trump.Dreyfuss isn t so much upset about Trump s following of low-hanging fruit; they are as he puts it,  struggling.  The celebrities who have endorsed Trump?

Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) May 30, 2016It s their souls they re whoring out for Trump, and it truly is sickening. To see people who would otherwise be considered intelligent and educated jumping on the Trump train to nowhere is infuriating not only to their fans with half a brain but to Dreyfuss as well. Luckily for Hollywood, people twisted enough to support the orange one aren t exactly A-listers, with Jon Voight being the closest thing to a decent actor in the bunch.After the shot at the Kirstie Alleys and Ted Nugents of the world, Dreyfuss moved on to Trump himself, taking a shot at his  off the cuff  style of speaking, which we like to call  racism :I get the thing about ""off the cuff speaking."" I get it! But when that speaking is dedicated to hurting latino americans, you're a racist.  Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) May 30, 2016We don t need Richard Dreyfuss to tell us that Trump is a racist; it s as obvious as the comb-over. It s always nice, however, to see a public figure adored by so many dropping truth bombs on the Republicans  latest choice to destroy America. Dreyfuss wasn t quite finished yet, however, letting people know that his opinions aren t just speculative; he has actually had experience dealing with Trump in person:I met Donald Trump a few times but first was a party in Malbu where he got very upset that his date had the gault to speak with other guests  Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) May 30, 2016And there s the Donald Trump we all know and despise. If you ve never experienced a man becoming so jealous that his date actually has a mind of her own that he loses his cool, you can t quite appreciate how it affects you. It s infuriating. Trump didn t just get a little upset, either. He was so butthurt that he acted like a  small-dicked prick,  forcing her to leave and causing those left behind to wonder if he would hurt her:He acted like a small dicked prick and pusher from the party and left of us wondering if we had made a mistake letter her go with him  Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) May 30, 2016Autocorrect seems to have gotten the best of him there, but the implications are clear: Donald Trump is a deplorable human being whose own actions have caused people to fear for the safety of women he s dated. With that, Dreyfuss ended his anti-Trump Twitter barrage. Trump decided not to engage, as is usually the case when someone calls him out for his treatment of women.Game, set and match: Dreyfuss. And THAT is how to win a Twitter battle against Donald Trump. Embarrass him to the point that he stays out of it altogether.Featured image by John Sciulli/Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Traffic Signs Hacked With Pro-Bernie And Hilarious Anti-Trump Messages (VIDEO),"On your way into work you may occasionally see portable electronic traffic signs that keep you aware of oncoming traffic problems or perhaps an exit being closed. Here s the thing, though, those signs can be programmed to say anything. Which is exactly what happened to the Texas Department of Transportation early on Tuesday morning in Dallas, Texas.Three signs seemed to be affected, with one reading,  Bernie for President,  and another reading,  Work is Canceled   Go Back Home.  However, the third one said something pretty damn hilarious, and perhaps honest, who s really to know without proof it s not. It read,  Donald Trump is a Shape-Shifting Lizard!

 CO GOP Swears Racist Anti-Obama Pic Was A Hack – After Lawmaker Says It Was A ‘Joke’ (IMAGE),"The Colorado GOP needs to get their stories straight regarding an outrageously racist anti-Obama Facebook post. Top Delta County lawmaker Linda Sorenson posted a picture of President Reagan feeding a baby monkey, and the caption read,  I ll be damned   Reagan used to babysit Obama.  Luckily, even though the photo was removed, a screen capture lives on so everyone can see what a racist POS this woman is:As if that wasn t bad enough, Sorenson originally said that the photo was nothing more than a  joke,  and went on to say, I really don t care if people are offended by it.  Considering the history of racism in America, and the way black Americans have been compared to animals and treated like animals throughout the history of this country, anyone in such a position of power should definitely know better than post a photo depicting the first black president as any sort of ape.Now, the GOP in Sorenson s county is in full-on damage control mode, and they are insisting that somehow a hacker got ahold of Sorenson s Facebook page and posted the photo to make the lawmaker look like a racist, even going so far as to try to pin the onus for the offensive post on well-known liberal website Media Matters for America.Sue Whittlesey, who is the treasurer for that particular committee, said of Media Matters regarding Linda Sorenson: They ve been harassing her the last few weeks. Vic Ullrey, who chairs this pathetic outfit, said of the matter: This whole thing is a hoax. Someone got into the Facebook somehow. It was hacked and somebody got into it, definitely. Nothing these people say matters, though. They are clearly lying to cover this lying, racist lawmaker s ass. She admitted to not only posting the photo, but to not caring about how offensive it is. The GOP is full of racists, and the way this president has been treated proves it.Featured image via Mike Theiler-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ann Coulter Goes Full Racist, Calls Asian Americans ‘Mandarins’ And Insists It’s O.K.","Ann Coulter, throughout her seemingly long career, has managed to offend just above every group that is not white, male or Christian (or American), although the last one is arguable. She hates African-Americans, Muslims, women, Hispanics, Latinos, Jews, Catholics, immigrants, atheists, scientists, veterans, the LGBT community, and just about everyone else. But the other day, Coulter managed to offend another group of Americans: Asians.Appearing on MSNBC s Hardball with Chris Matthews with Joy Ann Reid, the self-described  Mean spirited, bigoted conservative  struck again when she referred to Asian Americans supporting Donald Trump as  Mandarins.  And in true Coulter fashion, she insisted that it was the correct term even after being told that is was in fact not.Here s how the exchange went:ANN:  You have Mandarin Chinese people with signs for Trump,  Make America Great Again,  written in Mandarin   whether they are Hispanic or Mandarin, the ones inside the stadium are Americans and think of themselves as Americans and want the laws enforced    As I said before they have Mandarins in the audience and Hispanics in the audience. JOY:  What does Mandarin mean? You mean Asian American. They re called Asian Americans, Ann, not Mandarins. ANN: It has nothing to do with demographics. JOY: It s throwback language, it s not 1913. They are called Asian Americans. ANN: Anyways, as I was saying, it has nothing to do with demographics. It has to do with if you re here legally or illegally, whether you consider yourself American, whether the laws on the books are going to be enforced. We have an invasion of people who are - JOY: If your default when discussing Asian Americans is to call them Mandarins, we are not bringing back archaic language here, Ann.  Just talk about people as Americans   Asian Americans. ANN: No, you are not going to police my language. They are Mandarins, it is written in Mandarin. And there it is   the big bad liberal is policing the poor, innocent conservative like a big old bully. Those damn liberals, not wanting to be grossly offensive and racist! How dare they!Now some people may not wholly object to this term. But for starters, it s always important to remember that not all Asians are  Mandarins,  also known as Chinese. When one blanket terms an entire race of people, they dismissing the importance of other cultures, ethnicities, and people of different origin, which is in itself racist. Coulter chose to brush off the importance of these people just because they are Asian (not white), by referring to them with a slur.Second, the term Mandarin was used to describe the public officials of China s imperial government, a government that has not been in place since 1912. So Coulter referring to these supposed Trump supporters as  Mandarins  shows just how stupid she really is, and that she really doesn t care about non-white people or their history.But then again, do any Trump supporters?Watch Ann make a fool of herself (yet again):Featured image via Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bookings For Trump’s Hotels Plummet By 60 percent,"Maybe being a racist bigot isn t good for business after all. As Donald Trump ascends to power within the Republican ranks, his day job of being a hotel mogul is taking a serious hit. As the stupidity spews from his mouth on a daily basis, Hipmunk, a Priceonomics customer and travel search engine, shows that bookings for Trump s hotels have plummeted by 60 percent.The methodology used was an in depth analysis of the total US Trump Hotel property bookings made in the first quarter of both 2015 and 2016.In other words, Trump is losing more than half his business.What s even more shocking is Hipmunk has hotel bookings, on average, on the rise while Trump s are among the only going against the grain. Before running for President of the United States, Trump s hotels saw a 1.7 percent increase annually.According to Priceonomics:In New York City and Vegas, Trump Hotels  share of each city s total hotel bookings dropped more than 70 percent. Even in Atlantic City, where Trump Hotels claim the highest percentage of a city s total hotel bookings, Trump Hotels took a major hit year-over-year. The Trump Taj Mahal s share of bookings is down 17% in the first quarter of this year.One of the only Trump hotels that has seen an increase in attendance is the International Hotel Waikiki Beach Walk, which has seen a jump of 4 percent.The biggest decline comes from Trump s Soho New York, which shows a staggering 74 percent net loss in bookings.While Trump lambasts who he calls the  losers  and  haters,  the American people are saying no thanks to his shady and most likely illegal hotel business. It looks like the only  loser  is the Trump Organization. If this trend continues, Trump may have to file for a bankruptcy for the fifth time. While Republicans hope and prey Target goes under, maybe they should pay attention to their frontrunner s business instead.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Noam Chomsky GOES OFF On Donald Trump: ‘He’s A CLOWN!’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that world-renowned political theorist Noam Chomsky does NOT want Donald Trump in the White House, and thinks it s an absolute tragedy that the presumptive Republican nominee has even managed to get as far as he has.In an interview with Art Is Power, the author and MIT professor criticized The Donald for using  generalized anger  and his racist white supporters  fear of becoming a minority to his advantage, knowing full well that it was a strategy that would work in the polls. Chomsky also likened Trump s hateful rhetoric to Adolf Hitler as he explained Trump s formula for success: So every time Trump makes a nasty comment about whoever, his popularity goes up. Because it s based on hate, you know, hate and fear. And it s unfortunately kind of reminiscent of something unpleasant: Germany, not many years ago. Chomsky pointed out how interesting this year s presidential primaries had been   not in a good way   and used the business mogul as a prime example. He s a clown   literally, he could be in the circus. He s getting huge support from people who are angry at everything. Mostly white males. Working-class, middle-class, poor white males. And their wives and traditional families. They are furious about everything. In his analysis of Trump s campaign, Chomsky explained that all the disgraced candidate had done was tap into America s nativism. In the past, Americans had been worried about being  replaced  by Germans or Irish immigrants. All Trump did was change the words to make his racist supporters scared of Muslims and Mexican immigrants   and he did a great job fear mongering and relentlessly attacking those specific minorities to achieve his goals.You can watch Chomsky rip Trump below:Chomsky has expressed his disgust over the presidential candidate before, when he called the GOP  the most dangerous organization in human history , criticizing it for creating the kind of hostile, extremist political environment that would allow a joker like Trump to rise.Featured image via William B.

 This Migrant Baby Drowned Trying To Escape Syria’s Civil War: He’s Not A Terrorist,"Conservatives have embraced the idea that every migrant trying to escape the Syrian Civil War is an Islamist terrorist operating in a sleeper cell who wants to blow up westerners or institute Sharia law. The reality of the situation is that the people trying to escape this conflict are normal families that look like our own.One such child died trying to escape, and the following heartbreaking photo was taken:Shattering. Photo of drowned migrant baby picture captures week of tragedy in Mediterranean. https://t.co/asSQBjdXpN pic.twitter.com/BWHCT6BVjU  Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) May 30, 2016A photograph of a drowned migrant baby in the arms of a German rescuer was distributed on Monday by a humanitarian organization aiming to persuade European authorities to ensure safe passage to migrants, after hundreds are feared to have drowned in the Mediterranean last week.The baby, who appears to be no more than a year old, was pulled from the sea on Friday after the capsizing of a wooden boat. Forty-five bodies arrived in the southern Italian port of Reggio Calabria on Sunday aboard an Italian navy ship, which picked up 135 survivors from the same incident.German humanitarian organization Sea-Watch, operating a rescue boat in the sea between Libya and Italy, distributed the picture taken by a media production company on board and which showed a rescuer cradling the child like a sleeping baby.The rescuer, a music therapist, said he  began to sing to comfort myself and to give some kind of expression to this incomprehensible, heart-rending moment.  He added,  Just six hours ago this child was alive. While President Obama has decided to accept more immigrants from the conflict, there is an extremely lengthy process for them to come to America, and we aren t accepting very many of them. Republicans have pushed against even that meager number, and some governors have tried to bar migrants from entry (courts have ruled that such decisions are beyond their jurisdictions and they have no say in the matter).Until then, more will die like this infant, trying to escape the horror of war.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 One Of the Biggest Geniuses Ever Issues A Warning About Donald Trump,"Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking is internationally renowned for his insights into space, time, and the fundamental nature of the universe and how it was formed. Despite all this knowledge, Hawking is confounded by the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.For Stephen Hawking, the world-renowned expert in theoretical physics and cosmology, the success of Donald Trump s presidential campaign is a mystery.Hawking called Trump  a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator,  during an appearance on the United Kingdom s ITV network.In addition to his scientific work, Hawking, who has a slow-progressing form of ALS, is a vocal advocate for individuals with disabilities. Trump drew criticism late last year on the campaign trail when he appeared to mock a New York Times reporter with a disability at a rally in South Carolina. Trump later denied mocking the reporter and said he had never met him.Hawking is far from the first prominent British citizen to speak out on Trump. The GOP standardbearer has been so extreme in his rhetoric, especially when it comes to attacking Latinos (he called Mexicans criminals and  rapists ) and Muslims (Trump called for a ban on Muslim travel to the United States), that Prime Minister David Cameron was compelled to speak out.While Cameron disagreed with some who called for a ban on Trump traveling to the United Kingdom, he described the proposal as  divisive, stupid and wrong.  Trump responded to the slam by indicating that he would hold it against Cameron should he be elected president, creating distance between the two countries and their famously strong alliance.Unlike Hawking and Cameron, Trump s anti-Muslim leanings have shown to be popular with Republicans, as polls have shown that a majority of the party s voters support it, including voters who backed candidates other than Trump in the primary.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Let’s Compare President Obama’s Memorial Day Statement To Donald Trump’s,"The mere thought that Donald Trump could succeed President Obama is mindboggling. If you need any visual representation to figure this out, look no closer than the two s personal twitter statements honoring Memorial Day.First we have the Commander in Chief s:This Memorial Day, I hope you ll join me in acts of remembrance. The debt we owe our fallen heroes is one we can never truly repay.  President Obama (@POTUS) May 30, 2016And now Donald Trump s wonderful tribute: Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2016So one honors America s fallen and the other decides to use it as a campaign pitch that eerily resembles Hitler s slogan. How fitting for a Memorial Day tribute. While President Obama lays the wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Trump decides to spend his day railing against Hispanic immigrants, complaining about Bernie Sanders  rally sizes, and of course pledged to build the wall.So instead of actually honoring those who have fallen, Trump continued to bloat his ego and echo his stupid campaign slogans to a group of angry bikers.But the best Tweet Donald Trump ever sent out on Memorial Day is from last year when he decided to use the day to attack those who don t support him:I would like to wish everyone, including all haters and losers (of which, sadly, there are many) a truly happy and enjoyable Memorial Day!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 24, 2015So there s that. President Obama, the Democrat, honors those who gave their lives for us while Trump, the Republican, insults his  haters  and those he perceives to be losers.The difference is night and day. The fact Republicans really think their people care about veterans is laughable especially now that Trump is their nominee.Should Trump win the presidential election, veterans and service members alike will be missing President Obama something fierce.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rosie O’Donnell Retitles The News To More Honestly Depict Donald Trump (TWEET),"As much as he and his supporters want to say the media is against Donald Trump, it s clearly not. Trump has gotten a ridiculous amount of media attention, and it would be easy to say much more than any other candidate of either party.With this media attention comes an abundance of newspaper articles, blog posts and ledes to stories. All with their own way to describe something Trump has said or done or is being scrutinized for. Many of which are pretty straight-forward and bland, not really depicting Trump in a way that really embodies his true essence.Well, fixing this dilemma is none other than the extraordinary Rosie O Donnell who took to Twitter to retitle the news to more accurately depict Donald Trump.For example, Huffington Post titled an article,  Judge Criticized By Trump Unseals Documents In Trump University Case,  but Rosie kept it real and wrote: ORANGE PEOPLE STEAL MONEY FROM UNSUSPECTING INNOCENTS ORANGE PEOPLE STEAL MONEY FROM UNSUSPECTING INNOCENTS https://t.co/1988CJAPB4 via @HuffPostPol #DEPORTORANGEMAN  Rosie (@Rosie) May 30, 2016Which is exactly what he did. Let s not try to sugarcoat what a scam artist Donald Trump actually is. He opened a make-believe  university,  took people s money, and laughed all the way to the bank. He scammed people then like he is scamming people now when he says he ll make a good president. When in reality he d be the worst president we ve ever seen. Yes, even worse than George W. Bush. Trump has absolutely no policy experience whatsoever, foreign or domestic, and he would be an embarrassment to the entire nation if he were to represent us in the world forum.It s getting to the point where you re waiting for the big reveal, as though someone is about to come out and say,  Hey America, you re on Candid Camera,  and we can all breathe a collective sigh of relief. However, until then, kudos to Rosie O Donnell for keeping in real.Featured Photo by Andrew Toth/Getty Images for Fund for Women s Equality/ ERA Coalition",News,"May 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fly Over Shows May 12 Gulf Oil Spill Far Worse Than Reported (VIDEO),"Shell admits to spilling 90,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico on May 12, 2016. Footage of the spill, captured by Ecogig Scientist Dr. Ian MacDonald during a fly over of the site, shows that the company has vastly misrepresented the size and magnitude of the spill.According to MacDonald, the spill covers more than five square nautical miles, the equivalent of 20 square kilometers, or about 5,000 acres.Maps, flight logs and other documentation regarding the aerial survey of the May 12 Gulf oil spill can be found here.MacDonald s survey of the deepwater spill found that the extent of the damage is not consistent with the company s stated figures.As MacDonald reports here:Even if the average thickness of the visible oil were a mere 100 micron (0.1 millimeter, vastly smaller than the areas of emulsified oil that stretch across the area), the visible surface oil would represent about 500,000 gallons of oil.MacDonald is with the nonprofit organization On Wings Of Care. The group has conducted hundreds of aerial surveys and logged thousands of flight-tracking hours since 2004, working in the Gulf of Mexico, Pacific Ocean coast and many other areas.Referring to the recent Shell oil spill, which is located about 100 miles off the coast of Louisiana, MacDonald stressed the severity of what he observed, saying: We haven t seen images like this since the BP disaster of 2010.According to his report, which can be read here, the smell of oil was so strong that it was physically  uncomfortable  for the crew to fly closer than 1,000 feet above the spill.During the fly over MacDonald observed two small  clean-up  vessels.According to the report:There were two skimming vessels in the vicinity, but they appeared to be on the distant periphery of the slick, and the amount of oil that appeared to be within their booms was pitifully small compared to the size of the slick, which covered over 5 square nautical miles.On May 16, SkyTruth, a nonprofit environmental organization based in West-Virginia, blasted Shell s response to the spill calling it  a joke, but not a very funny joke,  writing:Thank you, Shell, for demonstrating quite convincingly over the past 4 days that oil spill cleanup is nothing more than a convenient fantasy.The organization also raised alarms about the shoddy monitoring of offshore drilling operations, noting that the recent spill was discovered entirely by accident.This spill was discovered accidentally by a helicopter pilot flying over the area who happened to spot the slick.  That s right: a modern pipeline at a high-tech deepwater development project leaked thousands of gallons of oil, and that leak was accidentally discovered.  Not because high-tech telemetry on the pipeline signaled an alarm due to a drop in pressure; not because flow metering detected a difference between what was going in one end of the pipe vs. what was coming out the other.  How long would this leak have continued, if not for the sheer luck of having a vigilant pilot happening by?Here s the disturbing footage from MacDonald s fly over of the spill.

 Trump Responds To Third-Party Candidate The Only Way He Knows How (TWEETS),"On Sunday, Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol teased that an  independent candidate   an impressive one, with a strong team and a real chance  could be entering the presidential race very soon   an announcement that would strike fear into the heart of the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump.TwitterAlthough Kristol didn t throw out any specific names, it was definitely an exciting announcement for the #NeverTrump movement, and a predictable move from the Republican strategist. For the last few weeks, Kristol has been calling for an independent conservative to run against Trump   a personal mission that has earned him scorn and names like Republican spoiler  and  renegade Jew  from conservative news outlets like Breitbart.Thanks to Trump s social media addiction and the fact that he is incapable of focusing his attention on creating sound policies and solutions like a true presidential candidate should, Trump noticed almost immediately that Kristol had launched yet another attack against him.Shortly after Kristol s announcement, Trump fired back using his favorite social media platform   Twitter. He lashed out, calling Kristol a  dummy  and  loser  and begged his fellow Republicans  to be smart & strong . He also channeled his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who had recently said that if there was a third-party candidate, we could all kiss the Second Amendment goodbye because the Democrats would take over the Supreme Court.TwitterTwitterTwitterTrump is likely terrified by the idea that he might have another candidate to beat   because surely another Republican candidate would not only split the GOP, but highly jeopardize his chances of winning against Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton. But regardless of how Trump feels about Kristol s announcement, it s definitely an exciting one for the Democrats. If a third-party candidate enters the race to run against Trump, the GOP can pretty much forget about winning the election.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"May 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Kristol: Independent Candidate Will Announce Candidacy Against Trump,"As Republicans unite around GOP candidate Donald Trump, all hope seems to be lost for the  Never Trump  camp.But Republican strategist, commentator and neoconservative Bill Kristol may have just revived the  Never Trump  camp with one tweet:Just a heads up over this holiday weekend: There will be an independent candidate an impressive one, with a strong team and a real chance.  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) May 29, 2016Although Kristol has in no way hinted at who that candidate may be, one can assume it could be from a shortlist of conservatives who have been openly hostile to Trump: Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Governor of New Mexico Susana Martinez, or perhaps Kristol himself.Should a conservative  Independent  run against Donald Trump, such a move would all but ensure a Clinton victory. A split GOP would pave the way for not only a Democratic takeover of the White House, but the GOP would suffer badly in their vulnerable Senate elections, and Democrats could very well take back the House.Simply put, Republicans putting in a third party candidate would be the revolution Sanders and Trump have been talking about all along, and neither would benefit much from it.It s amazing that Republicans haven t learned their lesson from the last two elections   that a last minute effort to add pizzazz to an election never bodes well for their end game. They learned that when McCain tried to pander to women with Sarah Palin in 2008, and they learned that in 2012 when they tried to entice business Republicans with Mitt Romney.Perhaps this third party candidate, aside from Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, could have a real representation by the electorate, sending a strong message to the GOP that their flirtation with right-wing extremism needs to come to an end once and for all.Maybe that was the GOP s end game after all   put the final nail into the coffin that is extremism and start anew, because with America s growing diversity, they won t last long cow towing to the crazies.Featured image via George Frey/Getty Images",News,"May 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Los Angeles Times Endorses Hillary Clinton Ahead Of California Primary,"As Politico reports an almost neck-and-neck race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Los Angeles Times has endorsed the former Secretary of State before the critical primary on June 7.The editorial board laid out plainly their support for Clinton, highlighting her ability to get the job done in the face of rising populism:As all the world knows, Clinton would be the first woman elected president of the United States. That would be a joyous, long-awaited, landmark moment in American history after centuries of discrimination and second-class status for half the population. But the real reason to support her is that she is the Democratic candidate most likely to get the job done.As the mainstream media is peddling a completely false narrative that Clinton s support is unexcited or unenthusiastic, the Los Angeles Times destroys that now hackneyed talking point:[C]linton s candidacy might seem unexciting. But nominating a candidate for president is, or ought to be, serious business. As Obama himself likely would admit after almost eight years in the White House, there is more to being president than grand promises, whether they are about  hope and change  or a political revolution. We admire Bernie Sanders  passion for progress and equality, but our endorsement goes to the candidate who is more likely to translate ideals into action.Sanders and Clinton have been fighting hard to win over the California electorate, which offers up just under 550 delegates. Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 97 percent chance of winning the state, but Sanders has shown to be as competitive as ever.The Times pointed out that Sanders  popular rhetoric amongst younger voters have made him a very formidable candidate who should be taken seriously, not brushed aside even heading into the convention (assuming Clinton clinches the magic number of delegates to win). Saying that he has made the race more substantive and he has drawn Clinton to he left, the board seriously doubted his ability to bring Republicans to the table.But that s not to say he couldn t.On the last day of registration, over 150,000 new citizens were admitted on the rolls, 42 percent of which were between the ages of 18 and 34, a good sign for Senator Sanders. Sanders also has outspent Clinton in critical metropolitan areas all across the state, including Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego and so forth.As the primary winds down, California will be the seemingly final hurrah in a long battle between the two progressive candidates, with one victor walking away as the nominee for president come July.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" There’s A New Memorial Day Tradition, And It Will Piss Trump Voters Off (VIDEO)","It s Memorial Day, which means that most across the country will be Barbecuing, spending time at the beach or just relaxing. Others are being reverent, remembering those who were lost during the nation s numerous wars. There s a new tradition, though, and conservatives won t be happy. The tradition is to burn the Confederate flag.It started lat year and it wasn t big. Several, including artists, and anyone who hates the tradition of Southern racism, joined together in an attempt to enlighten the world on what the Confederate flag stands for. The confederate flag is the N-word on a pole,  said Sarasota, Florida, artist John Sims, who coordinated symbolic burials of the Confederate flag on Monday in the 13 states represented by the stars of the flag, including Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi. Source: IB TimesThis year, organizer John Sims hopes that the movement will spread. Last year, it was over just 13 cities. This year, it could be nationwide, although you don t see a lot of Confederate flags outside of the South. So, Sims has made it easier. He s created a  Burn and Bury  kit that can be downloaded. You don t even have to buy anything. You can print it.While this will definitely anger Trump voters (watch for lots of cries of  political correctness. ), that s not why Sims is doing it. He, like so many in this country, hate what the flag stands for.Southern heritage groups like the Sons of Confederate Veterans  have failed to recognized the unredeemable nature of the Confederate flag as symbol of Southern heritage,  Sims told Think Progress.  And to deny this flag s connection to American white supremacy and fear of the loss of white privilege is insane. I challenge the Sons of Confederate Veterans to come correct and acknowledge that the Confederate flag should be retired as an artifact. And after that they should help advocate for reparations for slavery. He added he hoped Burn and Bury Memorial Day would  ritualistically confront through reflection and catharsis, the pain and trauma of a very horrific part of American history.

Here s the designer of the Confederate flag, Thompson, speaking for himself:Image courtesy of MicThompson went on to describe it as a white man s flag:According to a recent survey, Republicans still love the thing.

 ‘Loving’ Christians Make Plans To Harass Thousands Of People At DC Rally,"A group of about 1,000 Christians planned to attend next week s Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., so they could hand out literature and about $25,000 in Subway gift cards. The purpose was to show the atheists that would be there some so-called  Christian love.  However, the D.C. police have put a stop to that, saying they would have to get a separate permit, and stay on the other side of the National Mall, because such a gathering constitutes a protest.Organizer Ray Comfort told Christian NewsWire the following: In what is so often a cruel world, we tried to show a little kindness and it didn t work. So it now looks like we will be eating Subway sandwiches for the next 40 years. Oh, no. What to do, what to do? Comfort will still be allowed to film the event, because his film crew is too small to need a permit. Since the Reason Rally is free and open to the public, Comfort is now encouraging Christians to go as individuals, and not as a group, so they can still proselytize to the atheists there. That s their M.O.   force their religion down the throats of anyone who doesn t believe in any way possible.While Comfort can understand the perspective of the police they re trying to maintain peace there s a solid chance that there will be Christians there who don t get it at all, and only see their so-called  mission from God,  to convert these heathens. For instance, Eric Hovind, writing on Creation Today, said: On June 4, 2016 we will be gathering in Washington, D.C. to share the love of Christ with a group of people who practice the religion of Selfianity. That s right, they self identify as  Atheists  in order to become worshipers of themselves. Oh, please. Hovind is one of those that thinks atheists (and other non-Christians) are the root of what s wrong with the world. He won t be the only one there to think that way, either.Hovind calls his blog post  REASON hits the Reason Rally 2016,  in a lame attempt to demonstrate that Christianity is the only reason there is. He s one of those that will probably end up hounding the atheists that attend.There is one good thing to come out of this. Some readers of The Friendly Atheist were able to convince Ray Comfort to give those Subway gift cards to the homeless. That there is true Christian love   helping the downtrodden. They need to spend more time doing that, and less time trying to convert people to their religion and taking over the country.Featured image by Brambmanu.

 How One Teacher Responded After Nearly Losing A Student To Suicide (VIDEO),"Brittni Darras teaches English at Rampart High School, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The suicide rate in the state of Colorado reached an all-time high last year. As of 2015, Colorado had the seventh-highest suicide rate in the country. As a high school teacher, Darras has not been untouched by these statistics.According to a post Darras published to Facebook on May 24, the teacher recently learned that she d come  way too close to losing another student to suicide. Two months ago was the first time I cried during parent/teacher conferences. A mom of a student who I have taught for two years showed up at my table with a list of her daughter s teachers. Each one had  yes  or  no  written next to it. As the teacher explained during an interview with KOAA, the student s mother had asked her daughter to identify which of her teachers were  safe to tell,  by writing yes or no by their names.Darras  post continues: My name had a  yes  next to it, so she proceeded to explain to me the reason for her daughter s extended absence. Her daughter- a friendly, intelligent, beautiful, driven, young woman- not only planned to commit suicide, but was in the act of doing so when the police got a Safe 2 Tell report, broke in, and stopped her. She had deleted her social media accounts and left goodbye letters; she was ready to leave the world. Darras wrote that she and the student s mother  had tears streaming down our faces. The teacher asked what she could do that might make a difference in the life of the student she d nearly lost to suicide.She wrote: Feeling helpless, I asked if I could write my student a letter to be delivered to her at the hospital; she said her daughter would love that. My student got the letter; her mom said that her daughter cried, turned to her mom and said,  How could somebody say such nice things about me? I didn t think anybody would miss me if I was gone.' She didn t stop there, though. Darras spent the next two months writing personal letters to every one of the 130 students that she teaches. She took the time to tell each student what is special and unique about them. One student who received one of the teacher s handwritten letters described it as  just incredible. During an interview with KOAA the student said: I was just first of all surprised by how much she wrote. Usually when people write letters, it s like one or two sentences, like either  Happy Birthday,  or  Merry Christmas,  or  I hope you re doing fine.' But Darras letters to her students show that she cares deeply for each and every one of them.In her Facebook post, which has now been shared 164,000 times, the teacher wrote: Suicide is growing to be more and more common, and I can t help but to think that it s a direct result of the pressure we put on these kids- to be successful, to fit in, to be the best in their class/sport/etc. We need to remember that each human being is unique, and that is what makes them special. Instead of trying to change it, we need to embrace it, because together, we can make a difference, and we can save lives! By taking the time to show each of her students that they are valued, this teacher is undoubtedly making a difference in their lives.Here s more on this story from KOAA:KOAA.com | Continuous News | Colorado Springs and PuebloFeatured image via video screen capture via KOAA",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Libertarian Candidate Strips On Stage During Convention (VIDEO),"This weekend, the Libertarian Party held its annual convention in Orlando, Florida. On Sunday, as ballots were being counted to determine who would be the party s presidential and vice-presidential nominees, candidates vying for party chairman were each allowed two minutes to speak.During this time, James Weeks, a candidate for the chairman position, took to the stage. Instead of using his two minutes to urge party members to vote for him, he instead used his time to do a striptease.Reporters who were covering the convention tweeted out photos and video of the candidate s performance.The Washington Post s Dave Weigel tweeted:Image credit: Screen capture via Dave Weigel on TwitterAt around the same time, Byron Tau of the Wall Street Journal posted this image to Twitter.Image credit: Byron Tau via TwitterMeanwhile, Vaughn Hillyard of NBC News wondered how C-SPAN was dealing with the spontaneous striptease.Image credit: Vaughn Hillyard via TwitterC-SPAN aired the candidate s performance live.Video of the C-SPAN coverage, which identifies the candidate as James Weeks, was quickly posted to YouTube. At the end of the performance, Weeks told the audience that  it was a dare,  and announcing that he was going to  go ahead and drop out. Watch the video below, courtesy of Crazy Horse on YouTube.According to multiple sources, many Libertarian Party delegates were not happy with Week s performance.Ben Jacobs, a reporter with The Guardian tweeted:NBC News reporter Jane Timm quoted other delegates, one who called the performance  offensive,  and another who feared that it might give people the wrong impression of the Libertarian Party.While Weeks  performance is the most attention-getting story to come out of the Libertarian convention, it s not the only thing that happened.CNN reports party delegates eventually selected Gary Johnson, former Governor of New Mexico, as their presidential nominee and ex-Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld was chosen as vice presidential nominee.Image credit: video screen capture via C-Span on YouTube",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump’s Campaign Manager Gets Brutally Called Out For This Pathetic Lie (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was grilled by Fox News  Chris Wallace over Trump s dismal polling numbers with women and Hispanic people.Trump, being the giant blowhard that he is, recently insulted the Republican governor of New Mexico, who happens to be a Hispanic woman. Not the best move to make if your goal is to take the White House in November.During the interview, Wallace asks Lewandowski about the matter: Corey, why on earth would the now Republican nominee since he s clinched the nomination, why would he call out the popular governor of a swing state like New Mexico who just happens to be the head of the Republicans Governor Association? Lewandowski evades the question, giving Wallace a stock  Trump s just being Trump  non-answer: Well, here s what happened, Chris, and you know this.  Every time Mr. Trump goes to speak somewhere, he lays out the problems with that given location, whether it s Ohio or Michigan, or Indiana, you know, your country is a mess right now. Wallace presses Lewandowski on the issue, playing a clip of Newt Gingrich where he states that Trump needs to do more to appeal to Latinos and women.That s when Lewandowski drops a lie that is so embarrassingly blatant, it should end his career. These are things that are said everywhere we go.  And so, you know, if Donald Trump is winning with Latinos, if you look at the last poll, he s winning with Hispanics.  If you look at the polls, he s doing very well with women.  He has a much more  Wallace cutsLewandowskii off to say: Corey, wait, he s not winning with women and he s not winning with Hispanics.  His numbers are hugely underwater with both. Ouch, that has got to sting. Wallace is telling the truth. Trump s polling numbers with both women and Hispanics (not surprisingly) are extremely low. This call out probably won t stop Trump and the rest of his campaign staff from repeating this ludicrous lie.You can watch the interview in full, below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZpTrryZnxAFeatured image from video screenshot",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Missouri Legislators Took 32,138 Free Gifts From Lobbyists","A new report from the Missouri Ethics Commission documents 32,128 gifts to state legislators from lobbyists undoubtedly hoping to influence their decisions.The Missouri Ethics Commission collected information on gifts provided to state lawmakers from January 2012 to January of this year. St. Louis Today published a searchable database here. The database includes information on lobbying organizations that provided gifts to state lawmakers, as well as the elected officials who accepted them.Many of the gifts were valued at less than $100. The gifts that fell into this value range most often included things like lunch, dinner, drinks and coffee.State lawmakers also accepted thousands of gifts which were valued between $100 and $2,000. These gifts included things like travel expenses and tickets to concerts and sporting events, among other things.Among the organizations that doled out gifts to Missouri lawmakers were lobbyists representing banks, insurance companies, casinos, the pharmaceutical industry, utility companies and many others.An earlier report from the Ethics Commission, which documented lobbyist gifts provided to lawmakers between 2004 and 2014, showed that, on average, state legislators take nearly $1 million worth of free gifts from registered lobbyists each year.While it might be tempting to dismiss the tens of thousands of gifts which are valued at less than $100, the truth is that these gifts buy lobbyists something ordinary citizens don t have, access to government.When was the last time you bought your state representative a cup of coffee or lunch at Red Lobster? Unless you re a lobbyist, you ve likely never had that kind of access to the people who represent you in government.The Missouri Ethics Commission report comes as Governor Jay Nixon seeks to restrict the ability of lawmakers to accept unlimited gifts from lobbyists.Many Missouri residents would like to see a total ban on lobbyist gifts, but it s unlikely that state lawmakers will approve any legislation that goes that far.During an interview with the Associated Press earlier this month, Nixon said he hopes to see the legislature act, even if they refuse to pass a full ban. When the public demands something for a number of years, a response by those that are in elected office to that   even if it doesn t get the full loaf, if it moves forward   is important. Maybe if the public had the kind of access that lobbyists are getting, Missouri lawmakers would be more willing to take action.Featured image via Pixabay public domain",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Expert Just Shut Down Every Claim That Trump Is Not A Racist (VIDEO),"There should be no doubt that racism is very much at least part of what is fueling Donald Trump s presidential campaign. Tim Wise, a major figure in the study of racism, is more than qualified to dissect and explain how Trump is exploiting racism in the United States to further his political ambitions.That s exactly what Wise did during an appearance on CNN s Reliable Sources on Sunday. The show s host Brian Stelter began the segment by mentioning the abundance of analysis on Trump s exploitation of  economic anxiety.  Stelter questioned why there has been so much talk about this economic anxiety and so little about racial anxiety.Wise quickly laid it out that economic anxiety is not the only reason Trump is the only one left in the GOP clown car. If the only reason for Trump s support was economic anxiety then people of color should be flocking to Trump. Because black folks, for instance, are twice as likely to be out of work as white folks, three times as likely to be poor, have 1/15 the net worth, nine years less life expectancy in large part due to economic inequality. Wise just shut down a year s worth of analysts who have desperately tried to shut down Trump s use of the racism with an economics answer.Wise goes on to explain that there are many similarities between what Trump says and what southerners say when questioned about the Civil War. Invariably many will make the ridiculous claim that the war was not about slavery but about state s rights.This is an apt comparison. Since the GOP s creation of the southern strategy, racism has been a key component of the Republican Party s ideology. That racism has come in the polite form. Rather than call for the end of the Voting Rights Act because Republicans want to make it harder for racial minorities to vote, they say it is a matter of state s rights. One of the biggest examples of this is the semi-recent revelation that the GOP s economic policy agenda for the past 40 plus years has been nothing more than a scheme to be incredibly racist without appearing to do so.You can watch the segment below in full.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Implies That He Wants The National Mall To Be Torn Up (VIDEO),"It s become abundantly clear that Donald Trump doesn t think through what he s saying, basically at any given moment. His mouth has no filter, and he says whatever is on his mind at any time without thinking about the consequences of his speech. And then when people call him on his obnoxious rhetoric, instead of backing down or clarifying, he owns the rhetoric and doubles down on it.Now, it yet another moment of being incapable of using critical thinking skills, Donald Trump compares the Rolling Thunder rally, which is pretty much all motorcycles, to Martin Luther King Jr. s march on Washington, and then he also wants the motorcycles to be able to drive all over the National Mall. He doesn t like that they re only able to drive on the streets. However, anyone with a thinking brain could tell you that we shouldn t destroy the National Mall and have it torn up with hundreds, if not thousands, of motorcycles.If Trump sincerely means all the things that he says then we ve got a pretty big problem on our hands if he actually becomes president. So, for the sake of all that is good and decent in humanity, no matter who, vote blue.Watch here:WATCH: @realDonaldTrump says he thought Rolling Thunder rally in D.C. would be like MLK s March on Washington:https://t.co/9HuaDSawUx  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 29, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch These Troops React As Jimmy Fallon And Adam Sandler Honor Them With Hilarious Country Song,"It s Memorial Day Weekend so, along with last week being Fleet Week in New York City, The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon had to come up with something to celebrate all those troops being in town. Fallon s tribute? A song called,  I ve Got Friends On All Bases,  which he and Adam Sandler sang to an audience full of service men and women from all five branches of the military.Fallon began the song with: Well I ll tell you the truth, I love all the troops, protectin  the land, sea and air. Sandler chimed in with: Now you re back in town, keepin  us safe and sound, from that crazy-ass Elmo in Times Square. They both sang that they have friends  from the Navy, up to the Air Force Aces; the Army Greens, Coast Guard and Marines,  being absolutely certain to include everyone in their comedic piece of music. It s especially fitting since we still have lots of troops in the Middle East, and may send a lot more there (and everywhere else) if Donald Trump gets elected in November.But while the song itself was amusing (to say the least), it was the troops  reaction to the song that was the real treat of the evening. Watch below, via The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon: I ve Got Friends On All Bases  is a parody of Garth Brooks   I ve Got Friends In Low Places,  which Fallon and Sandler clearly had a lot of fun with. However, it s a good bet that their audience of soldiers had even more fun than they did.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Lets Chuck Todd Know If He’s Willing To Be Vice President (VIDEO),"With the Democratic primary process drawing to a close soon, and Hillary Clinton likely obtaining the required delegates needed to secure the nomination after June 7, it leaves the question open as to whether or not Bernie Sanders would be open to being vice president.So, while appearing on Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd pressed Sanders on that very issue. Todd asked: Would you take the call if Hillary Clinton asked you to be her running mate? Sanders replied: Right now, again, here we are in California, I m knocking my brains out to win the Democratic nomination. That s where I am right now. What happens afterwards, you know, we ll see. But right now, my focus is on winning the nomination. It s that  we ll see  that has everyone talking. It shows that he definitely seems to be entertaining the idea. However, it s completely understandable that he wouldn t want to definitively say  yes,  or  no  for that matter, as the primary contests are still not over, and Sanders, as well as his supporters, would like to see how things turn out first.Would a Clinton/Sanders ticket unite the party that seems to be divided at the moment? Very likely so, but that doesn t mean it would be something that should happen. However, no matter what, whoever doesn t get the nomination should find it their new purpose to make sure Donald Trump stays out of the White House. Because a Trump win wouldn t only be devastating for the nation, but the entire world.

 WATCH: RNC Platform Leader Refuses To Say How Much GOP Hates Muslims (VIDEO),"It appears that Republicans aren t quite sure if they are on board with Donald Trump s plan to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. During an interview with Jonathan Karl on ABC s This Week, Karl questioedn Republican Senator John Barrasso about Trump s proposed Muslim ban.Barasso, who is going to serve as the chair of Republican national convention s platform committee dodged the answer multiple times during the interview.Here s a transcript of the exchange:JONATHAN KARL: Well, Trump has won. What   where does the party now stand on that Muslim ban?JOHN BARRASSO: You know, the platform is about the core values of our party. It s who we are, it s what we stand for, and I met with Donald Trump about it and he understands that the platform is very important to the Republican Party. It s going to be a conservative platform that s going to be positive, optimistic, looking to the future, focused on things like jobs, the economy, and national security. And what he was focused on with that ban is national security.The platform is going to be focusing on growing the economy. We have too many Americans who are suffering the stagnant wages  KARL: But  BARRASSO: This 1 to 2 percent economic growth that we have here is   cannot be the new normal for America. So the platform is going to be something that all Republicans can be proud of and national security is going to be a big part of it.KARL: But I asked you very directly where does the Republican Party now stand on the idea of imposing a temporary ban on Muslims coming into this country? Donald Trump won; sixty percent of Republican voters in exit polls agreed with him on that proposal. You called it un-American. Where does it stand now?BARRASSO: Well, the platform committee will meet in Cleveland in July for a full week before the convention. It s 112 members of the platform committee. And we ve asked Donald Trump to allow the process to play out. He has agreed to do that. And I ve asked him personally to embrace the platform and I believe he will. National security will be a big part of it.The fact that Barasso can t even address one of the biggest proposals the GOP s new figurehead has called for reveals exactly how dysfunctional the party is at this time.A house   or party in this case   is a one that destined to fall. Trump has pushed the GOP to take new extremes on just about every issue. Now the left gets to sit back and watch as the party divides itself between lite-fascists and moderate conservatives.You can watch the interview in full, below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Marco Rubio DEFENDS Trump Calling Mexicans ‘Rapists’: “I Give Him Credit!’ (VIDEO),"Former GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio made several startling comments in a truly humiliating interview on Sunday, in which he actually defended his least favorite Republican rival, Donald Trump.But it wasn t just Rubio s support that was baffling, considering that their vicious battle to win the nomination was full of insults. It was actually what Rubio said about Trump s racist, grotesque anti-immigration statements that raised eyebrows. Instead of criticizing those vulgar comments, Rubio defended Trump!During the interview, CNN s Jake Tapper brought up the fact that Trump had been gaining the support of  some scary dudes  from  hate groups . Rubio insisted that Trump was not a white nationalist, and remarked that the support from racists has been unfortunate. It s offensive. And not just against me, but the fact that elements like that are still involved in American politics. And traditionally a candidate would disavow that and say,  I want nothing to do with it, I don t want them as part of my campaign. Tapper was quick to note that Trump didn t distance himself from his controversial following at all. Rubio replied: And I didn t like that. And I said that at the time. And you know, it is what it is. Obviously, I don t believe Donald Trump is a white nationalist. I don t believe that those are his views. But I do think that it s unfortunate that people like that have found the ability to express themselves in this way in a campaign. And I didn t like it  I just don t really think that there s a place for that in our party and our country. Rubio then tackled the fact that Trump had made his own racially-charged statements, like the time he called Mexicans  rapists.  Rubio said it was an  offensive comment  and  highly inaccurate,  but ultimately gave Trump  credit  for being able to expertly manipulate the media through offending people: Here s the trap you re in. If you respond to it, [Trump] is getting what he wants. That s why he s sometime saying this, to dominate the [news] cycle. I don t give him credit for what he said, but I give him credit for the way that he understands this stuff.Media is a business and it s driven by ratings, and based on your ratings is what you can charge your advertisers. And so, this content is interesting content. It s different. And it s over the top. And it draws eyeballs and ears to hear what people are saying and see it. Donald understood that. Absolutely disgusting. Being a racist should NEVER be used as a ploy to attract media attention, and supporting this childish tactic is even worse. Shame on you, Rubio, for not only selling out but for encouraging such behavior.You can watch Rubio come to Trump s rescue below:During the same interview, Rubio also apologized for his attacks on Trump while they were facing off for the nomination, particularly the insults that Trump was most sensitive about   his tiny hands.This defense of Trump from Rubio is so pathetic and disappointing, especially because for a while the Florida senator seemed like he was the only GOP candidate that had enough spine to actually go after Trump and give the business mogul a taste of his own medicine. Now Rubio is no better than Ben Carson and Chris Christie, who were both former candidates that took the humiliating leap to endorse Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox News Incites Anger And Controversy Over Hot Dogs…Seriously,"Fox News has declared war on the Merriam-Webster Dictionary for defining a hot dog as a sandwich.America s most embarrassing  news  network literally incited anger over the classification when Fox & Friends reported on it on Saturday.To celebrate Memorial Day, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary posted a tweet reminding everyone that a hot dog is a sandwich because the definition of a sandwich is  two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between. While many people have differing opinions on the topic, the dictionary definition certainly makes it sound like a hot dog is, indeed, a sandwich. Look at Subway for instance.When Subway slices their bread open, they normally do not cut it open all the way through. If one were to turn the bread on its side it would look just like a hot dog bun, except stuffed with meat, cheese, and veggies.So it makes sense that a hot dog can be classified as a type of sandwich.But Fox News viewers lashed out and host Anna Kooiman read out an angry viewer s comment calling the definition  an act of terrorism. Tucker Carlson then chimed in by calling it un-American. It sounds like overstatement but when you attack a hot dog you attack America,  Carlson said.The pair then threw the segment to Clayton Morris, who was out and about in Times Square desperately looking for hot dog vendors to weigh in on the  controversy. When Morris finally found one, the vendor wanted nothing to do with him or Fox News and actually ended up closing down his hot dog stand rather than talk to him. When Morris attempted to serve himself, which most people would call stealing, the vendor returned and apparently brought police with him.Here s the video via YouTube:Is there anything Fox News won t try to stoke anger over? Because trying to make Americans freak out over the dictionary definition of a hot dog is pretty damn petty and ridiculous. Fox clearly will do anything to keep their viewers angry.Featured Image: Pixabay",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Check Out This Racist ‘What Do You Hate Most About Obama’ Poll Conservatives Are Sharing (IMAGES),"Conservatives just love to be stupid. They can t help it; it s a byproduct of believing the rhetoric, propaganda and lies spread by their corporate masters to keep them in line. We all know it; we see it every day. Now, for your viewing pleasure, a conservative page of almost 100K fans has given us some true insight into what matters most to them with a  what do you hate most about Obama  poll that shows the true colors and (lack of) intellect of a collective of like-minded imbeciles.First, let s start with the page itself. In the tradition of idiotic page names conservatives seem to love, this one is called  The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense.  Resistance against what? One could only imagine that it s resistance against the cruel Obama dictatorship that has guided our country through a recovery from the second worst financial crisis in its history. The  line of defense?  That would appear to be a series of dumbass memes that show intolerance and hate that is way over the top, even for these a**holes.Now that we re familiar with the cretins we re dealing with, let s have a look at the poll:If you were going to give five reasons to hate any other President, would the last two entries be necessary? Something tells me this may be a sign of some mild racism. Being a curiously adventurous soul, I fired up one of my alt accounts and messaged the page with a couple of questions about their choices. They were surprisingly cooperative:It was almost too good to be true for the purpose of this article. On the other hand, it s extraordinarily sad that people like this actually exist in the 21st century. Now for the moment you ve been waiting for. The results.Of the 332 respondents, only 6 chose  the color of his skin.  That would have been an indication that the racism we see directed at the president may be somewhat exaggerated had 98 (30 percent) of respondents chosen  He s a Muslim terrorist.  Here is the full list of results:So while 30 percent of respondents are racist piles of doody, more than 50 percent chose the most ambiguous answer possible, proving they have no idea why they hate President Obama. It would have been so much more convenient had they chosen skin color like they wanted to.And there you have it: a look inside the collective mindset of a bunch of Trump-loving racists. You re welcome.Featured image by Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rubio Apologizes For Questioning Trump’s Small Hands In Humiliating Interview (VIDEO),"In what was either an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper or a very public suicide note, Marco Rubio   broken, sad, and tired   suddenly had a lot of good things to say about Donald Trump, the man he once called a lunatic incapable of being president. Rubio, like Chris Christie and Ben Carson before him, has done a complete 180 degree turn on the issue of Trump   which isn t as hard as it sounds if your spine is made of jelly.Speaking with Tapper, Rubio revealed one humiliating detail after another about his evolution. According to his own account, Rubio has privately apologized to Trump for once implying that he had small hands (and a small penis), a conversation that would have been AMAZING to overhear. I actually told Donald   one of the debates, I forget which one   I apologized to him for that,  Rubio said.  I said,  You know, I m sorry that I said that. It s not who I am and I shouldn t have done it.  I didn t say it in front of the cameras, I didn t want any political benefit. He also shrugged off Trump s overwhelming popularity with white supremacists. Apparently, the fact that groups as toxic and hateful as the Ku Klux Klan and various neo-Nazis adore Trump doesn t bother Rubio. Or maybe he s just come to accept that this is what the Republican Party stands for these days. As he says it: It is what it is. It is what it is  might be something you say when you find a little dent on your car in the parking lot. It should NOT be what you say to dismiss widespread racism thriving within the campaign of the man you just endorsed for president. Yikes.However the most egregious demonstration of just how feckless Rubio has become came when the conversation turned towards Hillary Clinton. When Tapper asked Rubio what he thought about Trump using outrageous lies like  the Clintons killed a man in the 1990s  and  Bill Clinton is a serial rapist,  the former presidential candidate said he didn t necessarily agree with the tactic, but Trump should keep doing it because it helps him get votes. I don t think he should change if he s been successful,  Rubio said when asked about Trump dredging up scandals of the 1990s to attack Hillary Clinton, which Rubio said he himself wouldn t do.  I may not like that direction, but at this point, he won and this is the direction that he won on. All of this would be shocking if it weren t so obvious that this was how things would eventually play out. Ben Carson, Trump s least popular campaign surrogate, has dealt with a similar situation, only worse. He had to grovel in front of a man who once said he was little better than a child molester. At least Rubio was just called  Little Marco. For the sacrifice of both his integrity and his political career, Rubio gets to look forward to a long campaign of being further humiliated by Trump. Chris Christie has been forced to endure several instances of degradation at the hands of the guy he now wants to elect president. Considering Rubio s heritage, it seems plausible that Trump will both use him a token Latino and also a punching bag when he needs to rile up his anti-immigrant flock. Dark days are ahead for Rubio   and he knows it.Throughout his interview with Tapper, Rubio s face oscillated between pained expressions. Selling out is never fun.Watch a portion of Rubio s interview with Tapper see if you can pinpoint the exact moment Rubio s soul dies below:Featured image via CNN",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Billy Joel Just Publicly Humiliated The Donald–Oblivious Idiot Trump THANKS HIM For It (TWEETS),"Billy Joel made a fool of Donald Trump this weekend with a shoutout tribute to the orange man in front of a capacity crowd at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Trump made a fool of himself shortly thereafter by showing he has no clue what sarcasm is and thanking Joel for the kind gesture:Thank you @BillyJoel  many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG. Appreciate it- love your music!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2016The  very kind  shoutout went something like this:Billy Joel dedicated The Entertainer to Donald Trump because he's kept him entertained these past couple of months  Emma (@Emma_S12) May 28, 2016That s right the  tribute  to Trump was  The Entertainer,  which if Trump actually liked Joel s music he would know was a shot at his farce of a candidacy. The iconic song includes the lyrics:I am the entertainer And I know just where I stand Another serenader And another long-haired band Today I am your champion I may have won your hearts But I know the game, you ll forget my name And I won t be here in another year If I don t stay on the chartsI am the entertainer And I ve had to pay my price The things I did not know at first I learned by doin  twice Ah, but still they come to haunt me Still they want their say So I ve learned to dance with a hand in my pants I let  em rub my neck and I write  em a check And they go their merry wayI am the entertainer Been all around the world I ve played all kinds of palaces And laid all kinds of girls I can t remember faces I don t remember names Ah, but what the hell You know it s just as well  Cause after a while and a thousand miles It all becomes the sameIt s a song about the trials and tribulations of being in the business of entertaining people, you twit. Billy Joel just thanked you for keeping him entertained, not for inspiring him or making him believe you were good for anything else. The song is a testament to the futility of your existence because unlike Billy Joel, you have zero talent and nothing worthwhile to offer anyone.This wasn t the first time Joel has made the joke, either. Remember when Trump thought it was hilarious that  New York State Of Mind  was dedicated to Ted Cruz? He failed to recognize that Billy had also dedicated a song to him in Denver. Which song?

 Roads Melt As Record-Shattering Temperatures Hit India (VIDEO),"This week temperatures in the town of Phalodi, located in the state of Rajasthan, India, reached 123.8 degrees F. It was the highest temperature ever recorded in the country.As CNN reports here, the brutal heat is taking a massive toll on the people and the economy. At least 400 people have died from heat-related causes over the past four weeks.Photos published by CNN here show devastated crops, dead livestock and melting roads in New Delhi, where temperatures reached 109 degrees F.A video posted to YouTube reportedly shows  a road in Shaheed Chowk, Silvassa, Gujrat,  which  is melting due to scorching heat. The country s current deadly heat wave comes on the heels of a devastating summer heat wave which claimed the lives of more than 2,500 people in 2015. Last year s deadly wave of heat in India was the fifth deadliest in recorded history.Think Progress reports:According to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, India is getting hotter as humans continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. With these increases in heat, the report   produced by 1,250 international experts and approved by every major government in the world   said with high confidence that the risk of heat-related mortality would rise due to climate change and population increases, along with greater risk of drought-related water and food shortages.Today there are 330 million people in India who do not have access to enough water to fulfill their daily needs.The country has reported higher than average temperatures throughout 2016.As Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, explained to Think Progress, the unprecedented heat waves sweeping across India are happening with  current global warming levels of just 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. If we continue down this same path, scientists say global temperatures will rise seven to nine degrees by the end of the century.Climate change denying republicans in Congress should be required to spend some quality time in India. Maybe walking on melting roadways and baking in a slow oven, set to 124 degrees F, would help them come to grips with reality.Image credit: video screen capture via World Wide Viral on YouTube",News,"May 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Didn’t Want These Secrets To Get Out, But A Judge Just Said ‘No’","Donald Trump has been trying to suppress internal documents from his controversial Trump University business, but a judge has just ruled that they must be released into the public domain.The Friday ruling, in which Judge Gonzalo Curiel cited heightened public interest in presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, was issued in response to a request by The Washington Post. The ruling was a setback for Trump, whose attorneys argued that the documents contained trade secrets.Curiel s order came the same day that Trump railed against the judge at a boisterous San Diego rally for his handling of the case, in which students have alleged they were misled and defrauded. The trial is set for November.The documents reportedly contain information on how Trump University advised its employees on how to squeeze the most money from students who had signed up for information on building their own real estate business. Trump University has been criticized by former students and investigators like the Attorney general for New York for trying to make money from people desperate to be entrepreneurs, when in fact much of the material they received was worthless.Trump University students have previously said they were constantly upsold new material, while rarely making the kind of money that was promised in ads featuring Trump and his personal branding.On Friday, Trump included an attack on the judge in the Trump University case in his remarks at a campaign rally. He described the judge as a  Mexican,  when in reality he is a U.S. citizen.Trump University is among the many failed businesses Trump has been involved in over the years. Other companies that failed include Trump Steaks, Trump Air, and Trump Magazine. Trump s business and casinos have filed for bankruptcy several times. Yet despite these failures, Trump has regularly presented himself as a  winner  who is unfamiliar with losing.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Racist TX High Schoolers Spray Paint ‘Whites Only’ Near Drinking Fountain (IMAGE),"Several high school seniors in Texas won t be having such a high old time for graduation this year, and it s all their own damn fault. 17-year-old Ryan Westbrook, 18-year-old Ethan Sigmund, 18-year-old Christian Joeckel, 17-year-old Hayden Honoloka and 18-year-old Cameron Bodenstab will now be spending their remaining high school days facing charges for a racist crime. The teens allegedly spray painted  whites only  near a water fountain on their rival s campus, Martin High School. They claim it was a  senior prank.

 A High School Student Just Bashed ‘You Deserve Rape’ Pastor’s Head In With A Baseball Bat (VIDEO),"For years, a street preacher has been embarrassing Christians by peddling what can only be described as extremist bullsh*t unfit for a family gathering at the Palin household. Brother Dean Saxton, who has been raising eyebrows and blood pressures while simultaneously lowering the standards of human decency by standing around holding  you deserve rape  signs on college campuses and other places   a message to  whores  (that s  Christian extremist  for  women ) that if they decide to consume a single drop of alcohol, or wear something that exposes so much as an ankle or a shoulder blade they deserve whatever happens to them. I think that girls that dress and act like it,  Saxton told the Daily Wildcat in 2013,  they should realize that they do have partial responsibility, because I believe that they re pretty much asking for it.  He s also made some less-than nice remarks about African-Americans and the LGBT community   though he is most famous for telling every female rape victim that they were asking for it. Here are just a few examples of the dumbass bullsh*t that goes on inside the cesspool that is this jerk s mind:via Arizona Daily Wildcat   Now, you may have been wondering, a question may have been burning within you: when the hell is someone just going to take a baseball bat to this motherf*cker?While he was holding his hateful  You deserve to be raped  sign and condemning women who leave their homes without covering themselves head-to-toe in front of Apollo High School in Glendale, Arizona, a female student grabbed a baseball bat and hit him in the head. The Bible says it s not okay to be gay,  he yelled, holding his hateful  rape  sign in his hands in a double-whammy expression of hatred.  You need to stop doing naught, nasty things, Apollo High School. You need to stop looking up naughty, nasty things on the Internet.  All the while, for some inexplicable reason, he was recording the children.Video posted by the preacher himself shows numerous students and teachers approaching him, demanding that he leave. As one gentleman informed Saxton that he shouldn t be displaying this sort of message to kids, we hear a loud, metallic impact noise.With students cheering in the background, the gentleman to whom Saxton was speaking calmly said,  You see that? That s what I m telling you. Saxton then beat a hasty retreat as the students told him to get lost.Tabitha Brubaker, 19, was certainly wrong to respond with violence, but when you think about it it was really Saxton s fault by his own logic. Like men who can t resist raping those dirty, dirty whores who go outside looking like sluts with their elbows and knees showing (the ones he says deserve to be raped), we really can t blame Brubaker for giving into her inability to deal with misogynist bullsh*t and acting on her natural urge to bust this smarmy motherf*cker s head open. After all, by preaching hate in front of a high school, didn t he place himself in a scenario where he was likely to meet someone who wasn t willing to deal with his particular brand of awfulness?Though some would award her a medal, what Brubaker did was a crime and she has been charged with felony assault. She also had some weed on her, so she was charged with possession of a plant as well.Watch the full incident below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" ‘Self-Funded’ No Longer – Trump Now Needs Those Huge, Strings-Attached Donations","Donald Trump has supposedly been self-funding his campaign (sort of), and he loves bragging about how he s not beholden to anybody because he s not taking the big donations that inevitably come with conditions attached. That all may be coming to an end for him now. One of his top advisers, Paul Manafort, spoke to Senate Republicans about the state of his campaign s finances, and admitted there isn t enough money to mount a serious challenge to Hillary Clinton going into this summer s conventions.Oh, the horror. What happened to all that money Trump claimed he had? Supposedly he s worth $10 billion. Oh, that s right, most of that isn t actual cash, and he s been loaning what cash he does have to the campaign. Now the campaign owes him tens of millions of dollars and is finding itself broke anyway.Without campaign money, Trump will have trouble running television ads during June and most of July because he won t have access to any of the RNC s funds until he s officially accepted their nomination. He can t do that until the convention near the end of July. What a crying shame.Trump supposedly already has a fundraising agreement with the RNC, and some of his allies are worried that the RNC is going to take advantage of him if he ends up trailing Hillary going into the fall. The RNC could decide to use those funds to help other Republican candidates win their races, and leave Trump in the dust. Trump supposedly fully supports something like that, but with his history of crying foul whenever the RNC doesn t do exactly what he thinks they ought to do (no matter what he s said out loud), who knows how he ll actually react if he loses the general election.He might have to (gasp!) start taking donations, and courting more of the GOP s major donors. He has a fundraising goal of $1 billion before November, but that will be exceptionally difficult if some of these donors don t get on board with him. So far, only nine of the GOP s top 50 donors have committed to donating money to Trump. The campaign is confident more donors will fall in line, though.Any donations at all, though, will make him beholden to them, which will give the lie to his insistence that he ll remain on the side of the little guy once he s in office. So much for his being the  everyman  candidate. Pardon us while we snicker at his plight.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ARE THEY SERIOUS? Here’s The Insane Thing Republicans Did Instead Of Passing Zika Funding Last Week,"This week marked a particularly shameful level of the kind of Republican obstruction that has now become the norm. As reports came in that Zika had hit the United States with a vengeance, a crucial spending bill that would have allocated funds to fight the devastating illness was derailed. Having ignored the request by President Obama at the advice of disease scientists for $1.9 billion for research and prevention, Republicans offered first just half of that  then just a third.The sheer heartlessness astounded even some among the Republican Party. Senator Marco Rubio, whose state of Florida is ground zero for the Zika virus, gave a strongly worded condemnation of his colleagues  actions on Capitol Hill. The rest of the country merely braced for what is going to be a very scary summer.But while Republicans once again proved they have absolutely no interest in fulfilling even basic levels of governance, they were busy wasting everyone s time on something else. Given the stakes of the spending bill they didn t pass, what they did do is especially offensive.Just as the House was derailing the Zika funding (and an energy and water bill for that matter), they were drafting up a petition to demand the Library of Congress go back to using the degrading term  Illegal Alien  to refer to undocumented immigrants. That s how they spent their work week.Republicans on a powerful House panel Tuesday narrowly defended a tea party-fueled move to tell the Library of Congress how to label immigrants living in the country illegally.The GOP move is designed to force the Library of Congress to retain the term  illegal alien  for cataloging and search purposes, reversing the library s plan to replace  illegal alien  with less prejudicial terms like  noncitizens  or  unauthorized immigration. The Library of Congress has previously explained to Republicans that using the term  illegal alien  in its records is both offensive and confusing. For one thing, Library employees pointed out, the term  alien  could mean a space alien. Nobody is going to confuse an  unauthorized immigrant  with ET.This year, Congress scheduled itself for the least amount of workdays of any congressional term in modern history. Just 111 days will be spent  legislating  (and let s use that term loosely here). This is partly because Republicans have come to the conclusion that the best way to reduce government is to make it dysfunctional, but the other reason is that Republican leaders have realized that with an election coming up, their fanatical anti-government base will abandon them if they even so much as think about reaching across the aisle. Even for something as important as funding the fight against a virus that causes severe birth defects. So instead they ve taken to sitting on their hands. Cowardly? Craven? Cynical? All of the above?It s comforting to know that in the short time that they do spend on lawmaking, Republicans have their priorities in order. Zika funding? No. Supreme Court confirmation hearings? Nah. Changing the semantics of the cataloging and search functions in the Library of Congress so as to be intentionally derogatory? You better believe it.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Navy Unveils The Latest Reason We Can’t Afford National Healthcare (VIDEO),"A new war toy for the Navy was shown off recently in an article published in the Wall Street Journal.The  supergun  as the WSJ s headline refers to it, is really just a large railgun. A railgun is a weapon that uses an electromagnetic charge to fire a round rather than chemical explosives.The only time that cost is mentioned in the article is when it compares the cost of using a railgun projectile versus that of a standard missile. The WSJ reports that each projectile only costs around $25,000 dollars to make, compared to the cost of a $10-million-dollar interceptor missile.  Wow, it almost sounds as if this thing might actually save the military some money in the long-term. It won t though, it s just another military pipe dream that ll end up costing tax payers an arm and a leg   possibly literally seeing as the money that could go towards building these things might have gone to something useful, like a universal national health insurance program.The weapon requires a massive power source the rail gun requires 25 megawatts to work. As Vice pointed out in an article published last year, this need for a huge power source is the reason this technology is going to be quite costly, or even possibly impossible to make practical for a long time. It s hard to conceptualize 25 megawatts, for me anyway. For some perspective, th e Navy s next generation Zumwalt-class destroyer, the 21st-century stealth battleship with electric engines, is powered by a 78-megawatt array of turbine generators. So, firing a rail gun once would take almost a third of the most advanced ship s whole capacity. Most ships today don t have more than 9 megawatts to spare. . . The railgun is going to be tested on the USNS Millinocket next year. The first of three Zumwalt-class ships railgun or no railgun is slated to be delivered to the Navy next year, and the last in 2018. They re estimated to cost $22 billion in total. The bigger problem here is that the United States is entering into a new Cold War era, except this time it is with both Russia and China. Projects like this may give the U.S. a small military advantage over one of these two nations for a few years at least. Then we will have to spend billions upon billions of dollars on new weapons systems that everyone is terrified of actually using, considering the chance that a full nuclear response is a possibility.We have to really ask ourselves is this the road we want the U.S. to go down. Of course, we cannot leave ourselves defenseless but we seriously have to make decisions about what we invest our money into. How exactly do we plan to use these weapons systems, should they ever actually become practical? We also have to ask ourselves if it is more important to spend countless billions of dollars on weapons that are built-in, the justification of defense against the Next Bad Thing, yet will probably end up just being used to  spread a little democracy  to poor nations.I, for one, would prefer to invest in building a nation that makes sure that every person is given the opportunity to get an education, see a doctor, or breath clean air and drink clean water than one that is hell-bent on winning another cold war.You can watch a video of the railgun below.

 Chris Cuomo SLAMS Trump For Promising “A Lot Of Things That Can’t Be Done” In Energy Speech (VIDEO),"Earlier this week, Donald Trump made a speech in Bismarck, North Dakota to talk about his energy policy. While it might have been refreshing for the business mogul to actually talk about a policy instead of attacking his Democratic rivals, saying offensive things about women and minorities or retweeting white supremacists, it s safe to say Trump s supporters should hold off on getting too excited over anything he says   because it s all false promises.During Trump s speech, Trump promised American voters that he would cancel the crucial 2015 Paris agreement that binds all nations to the common goal of tackling climate change, and that he d  rescind  the EPA rules that President Barack Obama set up to decrease emissions from coal-fired power plants. If it sounds improbable, that s because it pretty much is   and no one was faster to point this out that CNN s Chris Cuomo on Friday. In speaking with Trump s campaign senior advisor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Cuomo criticized the GOP candidate for his sloppy ideas. He said: Donald Trump put out a big speech about his energy policy, about coal, about oil, about regulation. And the criticism of it is that he proposed a lot of things that can t be done. You can t get rid of all of the EPA regulations. You can t just make coal as huge as it once was. There are good and bad reasons for that. Fair criticisms that the proposal can t do what Donald Trump says it will do. Huckabee Sanders argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has to be  reined in and brought back down.  She said: I think there are some big things you can do, and exactly what Donald Trump said is we need to move to an all-of-the-above approach. The Obama administration and his energy policy has been job-killing, [has] raised energy costs across America, has been horrible for our country, so we ve got to go back to where we put all options on the table. Huckabee Sanders continued to diss Obama and added that, We ve got to absolutely reverse what has taken place over the last eight years under the Obama administration by taking away the energy independence that Americans have enjoyed and making us more dependent on foreign energy and go back to where we can energize our own country on our own. Cuomo fired back, stating that the EPA wasn t perfect, just like  every government agency.  He continued: But reducing fossil fuel dependence is a very popular thing in America, and that s a big part of the regulations, and in terms of energy independence, the United States right now puts out 74 percent of its oil needs. I mean, I guess you could go to 100 percent, but the idea that we re somehow, you know, really deficient in terms of how much of our own needs we provide for, it s just not true.  Huckabee Sanders continued to try and counter attack, but Cuomo shut her down every time with realistic scenarios and facts. You can watch Cuomo blast Trump s policies below: Trump s energy policy speech came just a day before Trump told drought-stricken Californians that the extreme water shortage they ve been experiencing doesn t really exist, and offered a conspiracy theory as an alternative explanation. Clearly, Trump isn t someone that we can trust for environmental or energy issues.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump: ‘There Is No Drought In California’ — Offers This Conspiracy Theory Instead (VIDEO),"Donald Trump told an audience in Fresno, California on Friday, that there is no drought in California. This has to be the most absurd claim that Trump has made during his campaign. During the event, Trump implied that the water shortage in California was created by the government and environmentalists. We re going to solve your water problem. You have a water problem that is so insane. It is so ridiculous where they re taking the water and shoving it out to sea,  Trump told the crowd made up of mostly California farmers. They don t understand it. There is no drought, they turn the water out into the ocean. California has been in a state of drought for half a decade. In 2015, the drought was less severe than it has been in previous years. Though to claim that there is no drought and to imply that California s water shortage problem has been solely caused by poor water management systems is ridiculous.Trump pointed towards efforts to keep the Delta Smelt, or  a three-inch fish  as Trump referred to it in his speech, from going extinct as an example of environmentalists and the big-bad-government stealing water away from farmers. While water has been redirected in a last-ditch attempt to save the species from complete extinction, the idea that it has had any major impact on farmers is nothing more than a flimsy talking point.Trump is pandering to California farmers who are trying to get legislation passed to build new water infrastructure that would help farmers out. It s probably just due to the fact that he is Trump, that he has chosen to do so in such a ludicrous fashion. I m personally surprised that Trump is spending so much time trying to win over voters in California, a state that is certain to vote blue in November.You can watch the event below in full.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Explains The Exact Reason Trump Won’t Debate Him (VIDEO),"A pre-general election debate between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump would have been a political event that would be talked about for years. However, such a debate will never happen because Trump is a giant chicken. Sanders blasted Trump on Real Time with Bill Maher Friday night.After Trump  jokingly  said that he would debate Sanders ahead of the California primary, Trump quickly backed out. Sanders expressed his disappointment with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee s decision. Sanders put out a challenge to Trump, saying: I would have loved [to debate Trump]! First, he said he would do it, then he said he wouldn t do it. Then he said he would do it, then he said he wouldn t do it. So I would hope if he changed his mind four times in two days, change it a fifth time. Trump claims to be a real tough guy, pushes people around. Hey Donald, come on up, let s have a debate about the future of America. That s when Sanders unleashed a savage takedown of Trump: This guy is a pathological liar. And I don t mean to be malicious, but that is just the damn truth. He would be not only an embarrassment; he would be a real danger to this entire world if he were to become president. Maher and Sanders discussed many things during the interview. Sanders, as he usually does, talked about the tough issues that the American people are facing, including the disappearance of the middle class, the enormous amount of poverty there is in this country, and the need for issues-based politics.Sanders also pointed out how Trump s constant lying and flip-flopping makes him hard to create an effective strategy against. How exactly does one challenge their opponent when said opponent s supporters don t hold that accountable to their stance on the issues or their character? While Sanders himself may have seemed unsure (or at least wasn t willing to lay one out in the open during the interview), Sanders has clobbered Trump on the campaign trail while staying classy.  Love trumps hate,  being a simple effective message that gets to the hearts of both Sanders  and Trump s campaigns.Sanders knows that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, and he has an amazing platform that actually speaks to the needs of the average person   an agenda that will be championed by many long after this current race is over.You can watch the interview in full, below.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Finally Admitted Something He Really Hasn’t Done His Whole Campaign (TWEET),"Throughout Donald Trump s entire campaign, it s been the Donald Trump show. What does that mean? He s made it all about himself. How well HE is doing. What poll numbers HE is getting. What HE can do for the country. How great HE is. He s been saying all of these things as if he s doing all of this on his own without any help from anyone.Well, in a turn of events, Trump just tweeted out something on Twitter that seems to acknowledge, at least in parentheses, that he hasn t clinched the Republican nomination for president completely on his own. There were actually voters involved.He wrote: I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary   by a lot   and with many states left to go! Thank you.

He actually needed votes to get there, and it s nice that he kinda-sorta-maybe in parentheses alongside himself acknowledged the people who got him to where he is.Trump s narcissism knows no bounds, but maybe, just maybe he finally figured out how elections actually work.

 Trump Goes Birther On Federal Judge Presiding Over Trump U Fraud Case: He’s A ‘Mexican!’,"Donald Trump has repeatedly sworn he loves Hispanics and Hispanics love him, but not   apparently   when it comes to the judge presiding over his Trump University fraud trial.Trump, whose guilt in this case is almost beyond doubt, swears that if he loses the case (which is looking likely), it s not because he is a shameless con man. No, it s because the judge is a  hater  and a Mexican. We re in front of a very hostile judge,  Mr. Trump said.  The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, federal judge. Frankly, he should recuse himself because he s given us ruling after ruling after ruling, negative, negative, negative. What happens is the judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that s fine,  Mr. Trump said.The only problem: Judge Gonzalo Curiel is from Indiana not Mexico. Which is great. I think Indiana s fine.It s not the first time Trump has gone birther, of course. He famously set fire to piles of his own money in a quixotic quest to prove President Obama wasn t born in the United States. At several points, Trump even claimed to have proof, but never produced a single shred of evidence. His new accusations do, however, represent the first time Trump has claimed Mexicans   aside from being rapists and drug dealers   are infiltrating the federal justice system to screw over Trump personally.Why would they do that? Trump supporters seem to believe it s because of Trump s immigration plans. Facing a crowd of supporters who had killed time before Trump got up to the podium by mindlessly chanting  build that wall,  Trump knew exactly what he was doing when he suddenly floated the idea that the judge who is about to rule against him is a secret Mexican. He was quite literally preaching to the choir.All of this undermines Trump s assurances that Hispanic voters will flock to him in November. If he sincerely believes a federal judge would be prejudiced against him in his court case because of his Hispanic heritage, then it s not hard to imagine the rest of the Hispanic and Latino population would be repulsed by his message of anti-immigrant hate. He can t have it both ways.Trump closed his remarks by promising to file a lawsuit against Judge Curiel when he becomes president. I m telling you, this court system, judges in this court system, federal court, they ought to look into Judge Curiel. Because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace, OK? But we ll come back in November. Wouldn t that be wild if I m president and I come back to do a civil case? The audience roared   the same audience that at one time probably raged at President Obama for taking a day to go golfing. Suddenly, a president who spends his time in office wrapped up in a personal civil case to settle a grudge is A-OK.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Check Out The ‘Infuriating’ Thing Malia Obama Did That Has Conservatives Calling Her N***** (IMAGES),"The headline from conservative blog USA Politics Today is ominous and tantalizing:  What Malia Obama Just Did With Her Friends Will Make You Furious . It makes you want to know if the older Obama daughter has finally done something that could be considered an embarrassment to her parents. She is, after all, a teenage girl. Teenage girls tend to get into trouble no matter who their parents are. The Bush twins are a great example. While living in the White House the daughters of Dubya had their share of adventures, which were mostly chuckled off by liberals and conservatives alike, because again   they were teenage girls.Why, then, if we could laugh at the Bush twins ducking their security detail to go drinking can conservatives not forgive the shenanigans of Malia Obama? The answer to that is simple and all you need to do is read any conservative blog s comments to see why. Even when confronted by moderates who don t agree with dragging children into politics, conservatives can t help but allow their true colors to shine through:Yes, those are real comments. They accompany an array of like-minded stupidity. You can find everything from imbeciles calling her mother a  Sasquatch  to more of the same BS about birth certificates to good old-fashioned American N-word racism. No matter how ridiculous the a-holes who can t help but make fools of themselves sound, their anger must be about something pretty important, wouldn t you think? Here s a screenshot from the propaganda mill site of the entire article explaining exactly what Malia did to deserve such scathing remarks:That s it. No sources, no pictures   just a story (that dates back to 2014) that Malia made her friend pay for her breakfast. That breakfast, as reported by Inquisitr and The Christian Science Monitor, ended with an $8 tip on a $45 bill, which the waitress noted was a great tip coming from teens. Rather than report the truth, which is that Malia Obama is a teenage girl who enjoyed frozen chai and eggs Benedict with a friend, conservatives felt the need to skew the story into her being some kind of cheap skate who forced a friend to pay and leave a horrible tip.That s how a scandal is born when the people you re trying to reach are idiots who will believe anything negative you can possibly come up with about the black family living in the White House. They weren t upset when the Bush girls had some fun and got in a little trouble, because teens will be teens, but boy were they ever upset when Malia got into Harvard.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 What Sarah Palin Just Asked Us To Do With Trump’s Nomination Will Make You Vomit (VIDEO),"Like a stubborn cold that just doesn t seem to go away, Sarah Palin, for some reason or another, is still around and apparently relevant in our media. You know, the same  lame stream media  that she likes to claim silences her or mixes up what she says when they just quote her verbatim. The same media that asks her  gotcha questions,  which are really just questions she doesn t know the answer to and caught her looking like an idiot.Now, while appearing with Donald Trump at a rally in San Diego, California, Palin told the crowd that despite the media treating Trump like a joke at the beginning, he s still here, and not only is he here, he s going to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.Honestly, I don t know why she s complaining about the media and Trump considering it s been a non-stop Trump show media circus since he announced his candidacy last summer.However, it was what Palin told the media, and everyone else who thought Trump was a joke, to do with Trump s nomination that was utterly nauseating   to say the least.She said of her, and apparently our  golden wrecking ball  after trashing the media: Weeelll, he is now though. He is now we the people s nominee. So, suck it up, cupcake. Okay, first of all, he is not  we the people s nominee,  he is the Republican nominee, not representative of all of the nation s people. Secondly, telling us to suck up anything in regards to Trump will have most of the nation reaching for a barf bag.Oh, and Palin also said Trump  wrecked what needed to be wrecked in order to shine light on the shenanigans.  Well, he certainly wrecked the Republican Party and any hope of ever respecting them again, so sure, he wrecked what needed to be wrecked. However, he s not at all what the country needs, and he needs to stay as far away from the Oval Office as possible. It s up to us to make sure he s stays out of the White House.Watch her words in no particular order here:https://www.facebook.com/politico/videos/10153565461001680/Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Budget Cuts Could Shut Down Every Public School In Kansas,"Kansas  school system has been in considerable trouble ever since the state s Republican government decided to slash funding and change how money was distributed, which badly shortchanged poorer schools. Of course, Kansas Republicans didn t really seem to care until they were sued, and the case went to the state s supreme court. The court ordered them to fix the situation, and we re just certain they put forth their best effort, but the so-called  changes  resulted in no change at all for most schools.After reviewing the plan, the Kansas Supreme Court rejected parts of the plan, saying: Disparities among the districts remain inequitable and unconstitutional. If the legislature doesn t fix the problem in a way that makes funding fairer for the poorer districts by June 30, the court has ordered that all schools will remain closed until the funding problem is resolved.Governor Sam Brownback swept into office with grandiose promises about how tax cuts and budget cuts would result in businesses just flocking to the state, which, in turn would actually increase revenue for the state. The education funding crisis began after the GOP legislature and Brownback cut the state s education budget last year, after Brownback s promises of business windfalls failed to materialize.That s typical Republican thinking   these things never work that way. They live in denial, though.Last year, six districts had to close before the official end of the year because their funding had run out. Fortunately, they d already held enough days of school to still comply with the law, but they had to look for ways to tighten their belts without laying off teachers, which was quite painful for them.All the state legislature did to address the problem was reshuffle dollars around, but didn t increase education funding overall. According to U.S. News & World Report: Because the plan guarantees that no district loses any aid it already has been promised for the next school year, most of them  including the four suing the state   would see no change in their aid overall. Twenty-three would see small increases, covered by the state tapping an existing pot of emergency school aid. Forget Kansas  students. Forget producing graduates that can help take the state and the country into the future. Cutting government spending is Republican dogma. They don t care who they hurt, even if it means hurting children and the education they re entitled to under their state s constitution.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.

" Insurance Agent Calls Robert Reich To Bully Him For Money, Guess Who He Supports For President","This is sad and infuriating.In February, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich suffered the loss of his father.Despite his dad s death, an insurance agent called to inform Reich that his dad is behind on his car insurance payments.Now, one would think that being informed of the death would not only draw condolences, but also an end to the business at hand considering deceased people can t drive, nor can they pay insurance from the grave.But this auto insurance agent couldn t get the reality of the situation through his thick skull. He proceeded to try and bully Reich into paying hundreds of dollars and even informed Reich that not paying would affect his father s credit rating.Reich described the phone call on Facebook. I just got a call from my father s auto insurer, telling me he s behind on his payment. I explained he died in February. He still needs to pay for the last two months,  said the man from the insurance company. But he can t pay. He s deceased,  I said. He owes $348.62, for the period April 24 to June 24,  he said. But he didn t drive then. He died in February. No one has driven his car since he died. Well, someone has to pay or his insurance will be cancelled, and it will hurt his credit rating. I m sure he d be okay if it s cancelled,  I said.  And I don t think he cares about his credit rating. Are you infuriated yet?Clearly, this insurance agent must be a truly heartless person. He even became snippy with Reich upon hearing that Reich s father won t care about his credit rating and the conversation continued to go in circles as the insurance agent tried another intimidation tactic and didn t seem to get that his client was dead and no longer needed car insurance. Are you trying to be smart with me?  asked the man from the insurance company. No, I m just trying to tell you that my father is deceased and he doesn t need car insurance. Have you cancelled his car registration? No, I haven t got around to that. Well, you should. If he s deceased, he shouldn t have a registration. I understand. Nobody s supposed to have a registration if they re not paying their auto insurance.   Right. So, are you going to pay the insurance that s due? I wasn t planning to. Then it s an illegal car. But it won t be on the road. Still illegal. Sorry. That could be a problem for him. He s no longer with us. I know. You made that clear. I m referring to his estate. I don t see how. Well, let s say the state of Florida imposes a penalty for having a car registered in his name but no insurance. And let s say that penalty holds up any legal proceedings in resolving  The insurance agent STILL tried to get Reich to pay the insurance, even going so far as to talk about a hypothetical situation in order to force Reich to reach into his pocket and pay for something that was no longer necessary.Frustrated and growing tired of the phone call, Reich asked the insurance vampire who he is supporting for president. And the answer explains everything. May I ask you a personal question? Personal? Who do you support for President? For President? I don t mean to pry. [chuckling]  Oh, no problem,  he said. You have a favorite candidate?  I asked. As a matter of fact, I do,  he said. And who is it? That Trump fella. Really? Yeah, Trump. Good man. No bullshit. Here s the post via Facebook.Personally, I would have hung up the phone rather than keep repeating myself to the same asshole, but there you have it, folks. An ignorant insurance agent who tries to bully money out of people even if they are dead. That sounds exactly like the kind of person who would support Donald Trump.Featured image via Comunicas",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Video Shows Whales Swimming That May Change Everything We Know About The BP Oil Spill (VIDEO),"We know that the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill was one of the worst manmade disasters in history. Scientists are still desperately studying the behavior of marine life in the region hoping to find clues as to better understand just how much harm BP caused the ecosystem in 2010.That s why when a video showing a pod of orcas swimming very close to the mouth of the Mississippi River off the coast of Louisiana, scientists started paying attention. Whales have never before been seen swimming in the area. While orcas do enjoy coastal waters, they prefer to stay in colder waters.The video was captured by a fishing group, who sent the footage to local news station WWLTV. Dr, Moby Solangi, who is the President and Executive Director of The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies, told WWLTV: This is really an amazing story that you have told. We have not heard about this before.  Dr. Solangi then on went to say that,  That is concerning, you know. It s when these animals start showing signs of change, we need to pay attention. In the video, which is embedded below, it is mentioned that there was another recent example of large marine life exhibiting bizarre behavior. Just two months ago, a group of young pygmy whales was found beached in Mississippi, hundreds of miles away from their normal habitat.When asked about what role the BP spill may have had in these incidents, Dr. Solangi responded, saying: That certainly disrupted their habitat. There s no question. These are top predators and if they re moving somewhere, something may be going on. What s even more disturbing about this is the revelation that BP is facing very few consequences for the marine armageddon they unleashed. In April, it was reported that BP will have to pay $20 billion dollars in a settlement for the disaster.  Though, since we currently live in an age where corporations can get away with just about anything, BP is able to deduct more than $15 billion dollars of the settlement expenses in tax breaks.Scientists are hard at work trying to figure out what exactly is going on in the Gulf region. This bizarre whale migration may just be the thing that points scientists in the right direction.You can watch the video below.Featured image from video screenshot Featured image from video screenshot",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Immigrant West Point Graduate Proves America Is Already Great (IMAGE),"A photo of graduating West Point cadet 2nd Lt. Alix Schoelcher Idrache went viral after it was published by West Point s U.S. Military Academy on Facebook. The photo shows Idrache, tears streaming down his face as the 2016 commencement takes place at West Point, N.Y.Lt. Idrache s back story is the American dream, come to life.He worked his way through one of the nation s most prestigious military schools after immigrating to the United States from Haiti, earning his citizenship and serving for two years as an enlisted soldier with the Maryland Army National Guard, according to Army records.Idrache grew up watching American soldiers in Haiti performing humanitarian missions, not knowing that one day he would be among their ranks.Like many other immigrants, his family did not come to America with much.Idrache s father, Dieujuste, immigrated to America and was able to bring the rest of his family with him in 2009, one year before an earthquake leveled much of Port-au-Prince. The family didn t have much, Idrache said, but his father always stressed the importance of education.Despite the desires of some to say that America is closed, and that nobody else can come in   the only way the country can remain as strong as it is, is for us to continue bringing in immigrants as has always happened. Many of those immigrants have been the ones to serve on the front lines, defending all of our freedom.Some of them have even given up the ultimate sacrifice   their lives   in defense of American ideals. The idea that America would ever seal itself off from the world, especially with a wall, goes against our best interests.Lt. Idrache explained the weight of what he was thinking about during the photo, and about those who came before him and what it all meant. Three things came to mind and led to those tears,  Idrache wrote.  The first is where I started. I am from Haiti and never did I imagine that such honor would be one day bestowed on me. The second is where I am. Men and women who have preserved the very essence of the human condition stood in that position and took the same oath. Men who preserved the Union [in] a dark period of this country s history. Men who scaled the face of adversity and liberated Europe from fascism  Women like CPT Griest, LT Haver, MAJ Jaster who rewrote the narrative and challenged the status quo to prove themselves worthy of being called Rangers. With someone like that on our side, America is already great.Featured image via Facebook",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cops SLAM Gun-Crazy GOP Candidate Who Said They Should Be Shot,"A Republican candidate for a U.S. House seat is under fire from a police union after she made incendiary remarks about pointing guns at police officers and possibly shooting them.Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore is on the receiving end of a rebuke from the largest police union in that state.Nevada s largest police union has come out against Assemblywoman Michele Fiore (R) for her recent suggestion that citizens can take aim at law enforcement officers so long as police point their weapons first. Ms. Fiore, we no longer see you as a passionate advocate for your Second Amendment rights, which we support,  Nevada Association of Public Safety Officers Executive Director Rick McCann wrote in a letter to her office.  Rather, these comments were utterly irresponsible, an embarrassment to your District and our State, and they continue to demonstrate why you are unqualified to hold the position of United States Congresswoman. The comments that enraged the union came in an interview with a local TV station, where Fiore said,  Whether you re a stranger, a bad guy, or an officer, and you point your gun at me and you re gonna shoot me and I have to decide whether it s my life or your life, I choose my life. Fiore has a long history of these types of comments. She described the Bureau of Land Management as the  bureaucrat agency of terrorism,  and was involved in negotiating the surrender of the domestic terrorists in the Bundy rancher family who illegally occupied a federal facility earlier in the year.Fiore is so into guns that she released a  2nd Amendment calendar,  featuring her in numerous glamour photos while also toting a gun, juxtaposed with quotes from Abraham Lincoln and racist rock star and NRA board member Ted Nugent.She writes on the back cover,  The main purpose of this calendar is to focus on the many positive aspects that firearms can play in our lives.

 Trump’s Campaign Is A Complete Mess And This Is Why,"Despite Donald Trump s bravado and far too many in the mainstream media reporting on the hate and misogyny in his campaign as if it simply a normal presidential enterprise, there are some major problems on Team Trump.A new report from the New York Times finds all manner of dysfunction and infighting in Trump s campaign, which previous reports have noted   simply didn t expect Republican opposition to give up the ghost like it did during the primaries.Among the weirder dysfunctional behavior: Trump staffers think they re being spied on.A sense of paranoia is growing among his campaign staff members, including some who have told associates they believe that their Trump Tower offices in New York may be bugged.This isn t out of nowhere. Trump has built the campaign, as the time terms it, around his  unpredictable personality  and the  nearly a dozen Republicans inside and outside the operation  told them the entire thing is a chaotic mess.Now, many Republican officials worry that Mr. Trump is uninterested in transitioning into his new role, including the rigors of going up against Mrs. Clinton in a general election fight.The Trump operation, for instance, has talked for weeks about hiring a full-time communications director, but has yet to bring anyone on board. Ms. Hicks is still the sole communications staff member; the Clinton campaign, by contrast, has a press team of more than a dozen, including people devoted solely to the news media for black and Hispanic audiences.Even more troubling for Republicans, Trump has expressed disdain for a data-driven campaign, preferring instead to run as he did in the primaries, from one media-spectacle rally to the next. But general election voters are not primary voters. They will not be excited and engaged by the racist antics of Trump s anti-Latino, anti-Muslim, anti-woman crowds. In all likelihood they will be turned off by it.And in modern politics, as President Obama showed in spectacular fashion in 2012, data drives campaigns. In addition to a polished campaigner like Obama, a candidate needs the nerds to mine the data, send out targeted messages, and get voters out to the polls. By all accounts, Hillary Clinton has done that, as the Democratic Party has continued to build on Obama s success.By contrast, Republicans in the swing states (Florida, Ohio, etc.) are now begging the national party for money and people while the Democrats and the Clinton campaign are already on a General Election footing.But Trump has his personal jet and his rallies, so he s happy.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Senate Dems To Introduce Constitutional Amendment Overturning Citizens United,"As the presidential race heats up and the coffers start to pour in for a general election, Senate Democrats are preparing to introduce a package of reforms aimed at curbing (once and for all) the influence of big money in politics. This is a liberal s dream come true.Spearheading the reforms is Senator Chuck Schumer of New York   who is poised to become Majority Leader should the Democrats take back the Senate. Closely involved with Schumer are Sens. Tom Udall, Sheldon Whitehouse, Claire McCaskill and Tammy Baldwin.Included in the package is a Constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United and other Supreme Court decisions that have allowed dark money to be injected into the political process.The Disclose Act would be included, which would require outside, anonymous groups that spend money on political campaigns to make the identities of their donors public. No more dark money, no more twice removed parties, no more secrets in campaign finance.A new program in the package would replace the watered down, virtually powerless FEC with a five member independent agency that would tasked with enforcing rules an regulations in a fair and open manner.When it comes to fixing America s broken election system, Democrats will include in the package the FAIR Act, which would effectively end partisan gerrymandering by requiring the states to establish independent commissions to draw district lines, and not lawmakers who hold majorities.Senator Claire McCaskill has apparently bee working on a reform to increase voter turnout and participation, which could mean a provision establishing automatic voter registration.According to MSNBC:There are other efforts to address voting rights on Capitol Hill. A group of Democratic lawmakers earlier this week announced the formation of the Voting Rights Caucus, which has 50 members, all Democrats. They said they ll introduce legislation next month that would ban voter ID laws that force voters to pay an associated cost, for instance by requiring them to obtain a birth certificate to get ID.A new constitutional amendment, a new agency to replace the FEC, automatic voter registration and an end to gerrymandering. This is a package every American should support. Considering the overwhelming majority of Americans (including Republicans) support getting money out of politics, oppose dark money contributions, and support fair elections, the GOP has no leverage to oppose any of these measures.But they will. Such a package would surely fail a Republican controlled Senate and House. But this is an election year, and a year where Democrats could make great strides. If Democrats show up at the polls in droves, we could finally have an America free of big money in politics.If Democrats are serious about political revolution, they will need to come together to have a blue White House, Congress, Supreme Court and state legislature.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Touching Moment POTUS Shared With A Hiroshima Survivor Is Why He’ll Be So Sorely Missed (VIDEO),"President Obama s trip to Hiroshima would come and go without an official apology to the Japanese people for dropping hellfire on them to end World War II. The official position of the U.S. government is that the bombings were a necessary evil to end a war with no end in sight, ultimately saving lives and bringing the world back to peace. Just because the President wasn t in a position to apologize doesn t mean that he couldn t be the man we all know and have come to expect him to be.While the president s speech was eloquent, reminding us that the people of Hiroshima were just like you and I, it was a moment he shared with a man who survived the bombing that is catching the attention of the world. In this video by ABC News, you can see President Obama intently listening to the man s story through a translator. At one point the man begins to break down and our President, obviously working off of pure decency and instinct, put his arm around the man and gave him a hug.The Japanese are a proud people who prefer the bow and the handshake, but the elderly gentleman who had been to hell and back seemed grateful that the President of the United States would show him such compassion:Conservatives, who have been demonizing the president s plans to visit the site for weeks now are out in force, condemning the action as an apology rather than a human being connecting with another human being in a display of true compassion, something their shallow, selfish minds can t quite reconcile with. Anne Coulter, for example, tweeted this bit of assholery before the President hit the podium in Hiroshima:For someone ""born in Hawaii,"" you'd think Obama would prefer visiting Pearl Harbor. pic.twitter.com/F3z1UwHVy9  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 27, 2016Leave it to someone as crass as Coulter to take something as simple as a trip to a friendly state and turn it into the ugliest thing possible. She may have a point, though: All of the idiots harping on this trip and calling it something it isn t have a point. It s not like the Japanese government ever apologized for Pearl Harbor, right?Oh wait. Yes, they did.Regardless of what the clowns tasked with riling up the conservative base think of this particular state trip, it makes those of us who understand diplomacy proud to be Americans.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 VA Middle School Student Accused Of Stealing $.65 Milk Charged With Larceny (VIDEO),"A Graham Park Middle School student was arrested in front of his peers and later charged with larceny, after a school police officer accused him of stealing a $.65 carton of milk.On the day he was arrested, Ryan Turk says he went through the school cafeteria lunch line as usual. When he got to his seat, however, the student realized that he had forgotten to pick up a carton of milk with his meal.He went back to the food service area to grab a carton of milk, but before he could return to his seat he was grabbed by a police officer, who was assigned to the school by the Prince William County Police Department.The officer accused him of stealing the carton of milk.Turk says the police officer grabbed him by his arm and then accused him of stealing and  trying to conceal the milk. The teen admits that he pulled away from the officer, telling him  get off of me because he s not my dad. The student was placed in handcuffs, taken to the principal s office and suspended from school.Later the teen learned that he was being charged with larceny over the carton of milk.The student qualifies for the school s free lunch program.Ryan s mother, Shamise Turk, is outraged over the charges.During an interview with WJLA she said she has been trying to get the teen back in school, but so far that has not happened. I m angry, I m frustrated, I m mad. It just went too far,  the teen s mother said. They are charging him with larceny, which I don t have no understanding as to why he is being charged with larceny when he was entitled to that milk from the beginning. This is what Prince William County taxpayers are paying police and school officials to do? These officials seem to think that prosecuting a middle-schooler over a $.65 carton of milk is a responsible use of taxpayer resources.Charging this student with larceny has nothing to do with justice. This entire thing is nothing more than an outrageous abuse of power.Here s more on the story from WJLA.

 Here’s The Chilling Viral Video Showing Us How Trump Wants To ‘Make America Great Again’,"When listening to Donald Trump speak, he keeps talking about  the good old days  and how he wants to  make America great again.  However, what exactly are these good old days he speaks of, and in case he didn t notice, America is already pretty damn great.Trump would see and hear protesters at his rallies and encourage violence, saying that they should be brought out on stretchers, and that they should be punched in the face. All the while offering to pay legal fees. He keeps saying that he wants to go back to the days when that was seemingly socially acceptable.Well, guess what? It s not acceptable. It s not now, and it should have never been.Putting together a mash-up that will send chills down your spine is Mother Jones. They laid down audio from Trump at his rallies over video from protests during the horrific segregation era in America when Jim Crow still ran rampant in several parts of the nation. Where protesters were beaten, dragged, and sometimes killed.It s an era we most certainly do not want to go back to, they most definitely were not the  good old days,  and it will definitely not  make America great again.  It would set us back decades, and it would divide the nation once again in a way that s just absolutely horrific to even imagine.We need to make sure Donald Trump doesn t get anywhere near the Oval Office. This is not the America we need nor should ever want. Not. At.

Well you know, pregnancy is never   it s a wonderful thing for the woman, it s a wonderful thing for the husband, it s certainly an inconvenience for business,  Trump says.Here s the video via Twitter.The first in a new series: a message from your potential next president on pregnancy.https://t.co/LmUZI20JCo  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 27, 2016So all you women out there who manage to work and have a family, Trump wants you to know that you are an  inconvenience for business. Yeah, that s probably going to piss off a lot of women. And that s the point. Hillary Clinton is laying the groundwork for the general election by releasing these short clips featuring Trump and all the stupid and offensive remarks he has made on issue after issue over the years.Trump is already the Republican nominee so if Hillary captures the Democratic nomination, she would be battling Trump for the White House and America s future.The orange-tanned businessman certainly has a steep cliff to climb when it comes to women voters.70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Trump. And an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton leading Trump 51 to 38 percent among female voters, a 13 point gap that is wider than President Obama s victory over Mitt Romney among women in 2012. NPR reports that if the numbers hold the gender gap would be the widest it has ever been since 1952, which makes it clear that the Republican Party is in serious trouble if they think they can win election merely by courting the votes of white old men.Hillary certainly has plenty of ammunition to fire at Trump with future videos, too. After all, we re talking about a guy who has suggested on mulitple occasions that he wants to have incestuous relations with his daughter, a guy who has openly stated that he is more interested in getting women pregnant than he is in helping to take care of the kids after they are born. I like kids,  Trump once said.  I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them. I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s quotes like this that could bury Trump this November if Hillary Clinton gathers enough of them to use in short videos that will definitely appeal to those who don t have the patience to sit through an entire Trump interview or debate.Trump and and GOP should take note, because it looks like their poll numbers are about to get worse.Featured image via screenshot ",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Former Pastor Turned Teacher Beat Students, Then Hugged, Prayed With Them (VIDEO)","On May 20, Rocky Walker, a former pastor who teaches history at Pauls Valley Junior High School in Oklahoma, was arrested on child abuse charges.According to police Walker physically assaulted at least two students.One student, a 15-year-old boy, was pinned against a wall, placed in a headlock and struck repeatedly.The 15-year-old victim was assaulted at the teacher s home. KFOR reports that Walker had asked the student to come to his home to help him paint.Walker also assaulted a 16-year-old student inside his classroom at the Oklahoma junior high school.The student told police that Walker kept him in the classroom during lunch as a punishment.During an interview with KFOR, Pauls Valley assistant police chief, Derrick Jolley, described the assault: Mr. Walker placed his hand on his shoulder and then struck him several times in the back. When he was done, Mr. Walker hugged him, prayed with him, apologized and sent him on his way. According to police, the students had bruises and other injuries which were consistent with their statements.The two students both came forward with reports of assault on the same day, although the attacks were separate and unrelated.It s very likely that other students have been abused by the teacher, but may have been afraid to come forward.During the interview with KFOR, Assistant Police Chief Jolley stressed the seriousness of the allegations, saying: This is very serious. It s alarming. When someone that is in a position of authority that has all these kids around him, he s actually well-respected and looked up to by a lot of people, a lot of these kids. And, for him to take something to this level, it s a serious deal. Typically, some residents of Pauls Valley refuse to believe the students or police, claiming that Walker could never  do something like that,  because he s a  Godly man. In spite of the fact that nearly every day we read about  Godly men  who sexually assault children, or who use the Bible as justification for physical abuse, torture, even murder, there are still people who believe that everyone who quotes a Bible verse is a  good person. Walker entered a not guilty plea on Monday. He was released from custody on a $10,000 bond.Here s more on the story from KFOR.Featured image via video screen capture from KFOR",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rubio Just Kissed His Political Career Goodbye With One Tweet And The Internet Is Letting Him Know,"What is the price of one s dignity? Florida Senator Marco Rubio recently found himself wrestling with that question and came up with the answer  I d exchange it for nothing, just as long as I get 15 more minutes in the spotlight.  Donald Trump obliged.Having just months ago described Trump as a small dick lunatic con artist (remember how insane the Republican primary was?), Rubio knelt down and kissed the ring this week. On Twitter, he officially endorsed Trump in the most roundabout way possible:In Florida only 2 legitimate candidates on ballot in Nov. I wont vote for Clinton & I after years of asking people to vote I wont abstain.  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 27, 2016Rubio s the kind of spineless politician who won t abstain from voting for Trump, a guy whose rallies he once colorfully described as  a frightening, grotesque, and disturbing development in American politics.  He s voting for that guy.The day before, Rubio said he would give Trump a more ringing endorsement if he let him speak at the Republican National Convention this summer. At one point, Rubio was poised to be the Republican nominee, now he s reduced to begging Trump to let him share the same stage.Apart from the promise of a few  Rubio endorses Trump  headlines, it s baffling to think of why Rubio decided to sell out, and so quickly. The Washington Examiner, a right-wing publication no less, blasted Rubio for his shamelessness.It s one thing to begrudgingly argue that as dangerous as he thinks a Trump presidency would be, that he thinks a Clinton presidency would be even worse. But to actually say that he would be  honored  by the chance to speak on Trump s behalf at the GOP convention, and to downplay his previously stated problems with Trump as mere  policy differences,  is to prove the Rubio skeptics right.That is, far from being an inspirational moral leader, Rubio has shown himself to be more of an opportunistic politician with his finger to the wind.The major problem: Supporting Trump is almost sure to backfire. In the aftermath of the nuclear meltdown coming in November, those closest to Trump are going to be fatally radioactive. In Chernobyl they were referred to as the  walking ghosts,  already doomed but still alive. In November, they ll just be called  Trump s supporters.  Rubio, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of his term (he hardly bothered to work there anyway), is reportedly having second thoughts. He may see throwing himself at the feet of Trump as one way to get his hat back in the ring if he decides to run again.It s a bad miscalculation. Trump may seem popular to the guy who just got absolutely smoked by him in the primary, but the American people still actively loathe Trump. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie learned that lesson the hard way. Already unpopular, a recent poll found that after he announced he would be serving as Trump s campaign jester, a whopping 49 percent of New Jersey voters said they  dislike everything about Gov. Christie.  As polling questions go, that s about the sickest burn imaginable.The internet was quick to reminder Rubio of the fate he just chose for himself.@marcorubio so you'll vote for a guy you called a con artist. A guy you called a lunatic. A guy you called unfit to be president! #sellout  Raj Chudgar (@RajPC1) May 27, 2016Trump tricking Rubio into a Senate loss that would permanently end his career would be the universe's way of making a case that karma exists  LOLGOP (@LOLGOP) May 27, 2016Based on how Rubio has (further) diminished himself in the last 24 hours, maybe Trump's nickname was apt, after all?

 GOP Congressmen Storm Out Of Meeting When Fellow Republican Bashes Homosexuality,"Dozens of Republicans walked out of a meeting being held in the Capitol basement on Thursday after one of their fellow conservatives suggested that they d sinned by supporting a proposal to protect the LGBT community from discrimination.The bill was focused about government spending, but contained an added provision that read: Nothing in the underlying spending bills can undermine President Obama s executive order barring discrimination by government contractors based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Many Republican congressmen had actually been in support of this provision, which was unbearable to a bigot like Rep. Rick Allen (R-GA). Incapable of accepting the fact that LGBT individuals should have the same protections that the rest of the American population is afforded, Allen tried to make the congressmen change their minds about backing the anti-discrimination proposal through one of the GOP s favorite tactics: shame. Allen decided to accomplish this by reading a Bible verse that condemned homosexuality, emphasizing that anyone who was pro-LGBT and supported the proposal  were opposing Christianity . Completely shocked and disgusted by what one of their own fellow conservatives had done, the Bible reading disturbed the meeting and prompted an epic walkout by dozens of Republicans.After storming out of the meeting, one anonymous Republican that was in attendance vented about Allen and told The Hill,  It was f*cking ridiculous.  An aide noted that, A lot of members were clearly uncomfortable and upset. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also spoke on the incident, saying: House Republicans  thirst to discriminate against the LGBT community is so strong that they are willing to vote down their own appropriations bill in order to prevent progress over bigotry. This incident truly proves just how important bigotry and denying people their human rights is to the GOP. It s a party that is clearly incapable of moving forward to modern times, even as some members of their party denounce the old school hateful rhetoric. Republicans like Allen represent the worst of conservatives, and are willing to shame their own in order to block this country from moving forward. We may not like what the Republican party stands for, but the GOPers who voted for LGBT equality and turned their backs on a fellow conservative s hateful rhetoric ought to be commended. Hopefully Allen will learn something from this.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Tells Reporters That He Gives Zero F*cks About Hillary’s Email ‘Scandal’ (VIDEO),"Things got a little heated during a press conference with President Obama in Japan on Thursday. The usually easygoing president snapped at a reporter who wanted to waste his time by asking about Hillary Clinton s emails.Obama told reporters that he was going to take one more question but when a member of the press asked him about Clinton he changed his mind, saying: You know I take it back   I m not taking another question. We re in Japan, don t you have something to do with Asia that we want to talk about? I ll be talking about this in Washington the whole time. I ve already said a lot on those issues   I think these are better directed to the campaign. We don t blame the president for being annoyed. His trip to Japan was an historic trip as he became the only president to ever visit Hiroshima. The reporter could have asked him a number of questions about that, but instead chose to ask a question about a manufactured scandal. As if that weren t ridiculous enough, the press also asked him if he thought Clinton should release the text of her Wall Street speeches. Obama responded to that nonsense by saying: During the course of the primary, people say things that they think will help them get some votes, and once the campaign is over, they move on. The noise that is going back and forth between the candidates at this point   if you want insights into how they re thinking about it, those [questions] should be directed to them. President Obama made it abundantly clear that he does not give a shit about all of the political drama going on. He has a job to do so he is going to ignore the BS and do what we elected him to do.Watch:WATCH: President Obama refuses to answer questions about Hillary Clinton s emails https://t.co/FOKkX3T4Tc pic.twitter.com/8BuHj11n48  Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) May 26, 2016Featured image via Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Two Comedians Imagine The Trump-Bernie Debate And It Is HILARIOUS (VIDEO),"When Donald Trump recently said he would love to have a debate with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during his appearance on  Jimmy Kimmel Live, he probably didn t think it would actually happen   despite the fact that he bragged about how much the debate  would have such high ratings. But it turned out that Sanders was more than happy to fulfill The Donald s request, knowing full well that he could wipe the debate floor with the presumptive Republican nominee on any day of the week and not even break a sweat doing it. In teasing about the debate, Trump challenged Bernie to raise $10 million for charity   a mission that Sanders immediately accepted by responding on Twitter: Game On. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7th primary. So although Trump might have never actually intended on having a face off with the Vermont senator and is likely regretting opening his big mouth (for once), it looks like it might actually happen!We can t wait to see Sanders put Trump in his place, and fortunately we have something to hold us over. We can easily get a preview of what the debate is going to look like thanks to the Trump vs. Bernie Web/TV Series and live tour, which is the genius comedy project of James Adomian (Bernie) and Anthony Atamanuik (Trump).These two comedians have brought Sanders and Trump to life with their spot-on impersonations, perfectly capturing Trump s ability to be offensive and effectively avoid answering direct questions, as well as Sanders  unwavering dedication to human rights movements and the middle class. This skit is absolutely brilliant, and really gives us a taste of what we might actually see before Trump gets his ass handed to him in real life.You can watch the hilarious special below:Let s just hope Trump doesn t  chicken out  of the real debate! Sanders  campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said Bernie is ready to go: We are ready to debate Donald Trump. We hope he will not chicken out. I think it will be great for America to see these two candidates and the different visions they have for America going forward. What we ll have to see, is does Donald Trump have the courage to get on the stage with Bernie Sanders. That remains to be seen.

" Ohio Republicans Create First Step To Privatizing Elections, Would Charge People To Keep Polls Open","The Republican obsession with making it more difficult to vote reached its sickening, albeit inevitable, conclusion in Ohio. State Republicans approved an outrageous poll tax bill that would require Ohio voters to put up tens of thousands of dollars in a cash bond if they want to keep polls open during an election day emergency   with the possibility of not getting the money back.What was once considered a national duty and a democratic process that was the envy of the world has become diminished in recent years as Republicans have discovered that disenfranchisement of minorities and the poor gives them an electoral edge. Voter ID laws and so-called  poll tax  schemes have made it harder and harder for left-leaning demographics to actually get a voice in elections. In Ohio, Republicans just jumped the shark.The new bill could be considered the first step in the road to privatizing American elections. Rather than the government picking up the tab as part of its sacred obligation to free elections, the Ohio GOP   ever paranoid about  Big Gubmint  spending   will require regular voters to put up thousands of dollars to help pay to keep polls open long enough that people can actually vote. The bill is a reaction to a few emergencies in previous elections that caused voters to be unable to reach polling places   a major car accident along a highway and an election ballot malfunction, for example.An op-ed written by Republican Sen. Bill Seitz, the bill s author, shows just how warped the minds of the Voter ID wing of the Republican Party really is: Sadly, in both the November 2015 and March 2016 elections, rogue courts in Hamilton County issued orders extending polling hours. These orders cost Hamilton County taxpayers $57,000, and forced the inside poll workers to stay around for an extra 60 to 90 minutes after already working a 14-hour day. What Seitz doesn t mention is that the extra hour of work meant that thousands of people were allowed to engage in the democratic process and vote. That seems like a pretty big oversight.What Seitz surely knows is that these polling challenges disproportionately affect the poor. The Fox News viewer, average age of 68, is retired and therefore faces few obstacles to voting outside of figuring out how to DVR the latest Fox and Friends episode. Those who work all day and have young kids don t have that freedom. A car accident blocking the entrance to a polling place for even an hour may mean the possibility of not being able to vote at all. Mark Brickner, of the ACLU agrees: Maybe the polling place lost power, or there was a tornado, or the machines malfunctioned, and voters were not able to vote during the day,  he explained.  Now these people could be disenfranchised through no fault of their own. They can do the right thing and try to show up to vote, but they may not be able to wait around for hours if they have to work or go pick up their kids. Plus, [the cash bond provision] brings back a lot of ugly symbolism with the poll taxes of the past, when you had to pay to exercise your right to vote. It s hardly surprising that this is the new low to which the Republican Party would stoop. In a way, paying to vote represents the perfect union between their fanatical drive to privatize everything and their pathological need to keep the number of voters to a minimum. Naturally, even Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who billed himself as a  moderate  during his failed presidential bid, is thrilled by these dangerous ideas. The bill is being sent to his desk and he has shown no signs of not enthusiastically signing it.If it goes through, the crucial battleground state of Ohio will be one natural disaster away from asking its own voters to cough up tens of thousands of dollars just to vote in a presidential election. And a presidential election that could mean Donald Trump becomes president. The stakes have quite possibly never been higher and Republicans want to rig the game before it starts.Featured image via Library of Congress/Politico",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Unfortunate Bug Lands In Trump’s Hair During Rally, Can’t Seem To Escape","In what could be seen as an omen of sorts, a fly just landed on Donald Trump s head, but had no idea what it was in for.It s true that flies are attracted to poop, so for the fly to land on Trump, a man that spews utter bullshit daily, it really should come as no surprise to anyone that a fly would land directly on top of his head. Unfortunately for the fly, though, he seemed to get tangled into what can only be called a nest of sorts that lays directly on top of Trump s head.You can actually watch the bewildered bug land, crawl up on top of his hair, because apparently that s possible with the amount of hairspray used, but then fall in and under, and your heart breaks when you know that may be it for the little fella.Of course, many are making the comparison of this fly to the moment when the bird landed on Bernie Sanders  podium in Portland, Oregon. Clearly showing what sort of creatures are attracted to either candidate   a bird of hope and a fly attracted to bullshit.Watch the Lord of the Flies and his new little friend here:https://www.facebook.com/ABC7/videos/10153577369722452/Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Nugent Reveals The Most Anti-American Thing There Is – Prepare To Laugh Hysterically (AUDIO),"What s the most anti-American thing someone can do besides vote for Donald Trump in November? Apparently, right-wing freak Ted Nugent has the answer to that question, and it s something every American should hear. Speaking with conservative radio host Joe Pags, he tells us: There is nothing more anti-American than the freaks that hate me, and when MoveOn.org, Media Matters, Southern Poverty Law Center, Rachel Maddow and MSNBC lie and spew their hate towards me, it s because I stand with the best families in America. The man certainly thinks a lot of himself, doesn t he? One might have thought there was no more room in this country for egos, what with Donald Trump s ego growing miles by the minute after officially locking up the GOP nomination, but one would be wrong. It takes a lot of ego and chutzpah for Ted Nugent to say that the most anti-American thing imaginable is hating him.He says that the NRA is not a gun lobby during this interview, too. What is it, then? Nugent says it s  mom-and-pop family America, and is standing up for the most fundamental instinct and God-given individual right  that self-defense (i.e. owning guns) is good. Har de har har. Only Nugent can fit this much nonsense into one interview.He also rages against Hillary Clinton and Bernie  Mao Tse Tung  Sanders about wanting to push gun owners down, and he talks about how he s right all the time if so many people have to hate on him so much. Listen to him toss a major word salad below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/266047509  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Let s look at Nugent for a moment. He s incredibly ammosexual   in fact, he was just re-elected as a board member of the NRA, despite the fact that many of the NRA s members aren t nearly as crazy as Nugent is. Nugent thinks that anybody who even criticizes the NRA just wants to help criminals.Before President Obama was elected, he said that he would either be dead or imprisoned within two weeks of winning the election. That hasn t happened yet, but the Secret Service took it as a threat against Obama and investigated it. He also referred to a lawmaker of mixed-race heritage as a  subhuman mongrel. We must acknowledge, however, that Ted Nugent is a patriot among patriots   a word that s been usurped and twisted by the far right to only apply to white supremacists who love guns, fetuses and the Bible. They hate the poor, along with starving children and anyone who thinks helping others is a good thing. He s a true patriot, except for that time he dodged the Vietnam draft by pooping in his pants every day. Or so he said.But to say that the most anti-American thing out there is to hate Ted Nugent is over the top, even for him. This man suffers from delusions of grandeur that we don t even see in Donald Trump for the most part.Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Stringer/Getty Images",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" CNN Accidentally Airs Raunchy Screen Capture Of Reply To Trump Tweet, And It’s Hilarious (IMAGE)","With the presidential race narrowing down to Donald Trump versus either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the news has been pretty slow, and it leaves people to report on things like  enthusiasm  and how one candidate may beat another candidate.During a segment that was focused on Hillary hoping to  shatter Trump s populist appeal,  CNN chose to use Twitter to try to prove how popular Trump has been, so they featured one of his tweets explaining one of his recent rallies.The screen capture CNN chose to use featured a Trump tweet that said: Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim. However, what CNN didn t do was check to see what else was in the screen capture, because if they had, they probably wouldn t have used it. The first reply listed under Trump s tweet stated: Does your c*ck match your skin color? Like, is it orange? Here s the image that was taken and has been circulating on Facebook:Image via CNNOops. Looks like they didn t quite crop that image as well as they should and no one apparently caught it before it went to air. Although, the question in the reply is still a valid one, but one not exactly appropriate for CNN s viewing audience.Nonetheless, this error is frickin  hilarious for the rest of us.

" Why The Latest Email Revelations May Help Clinton, Not Hurt Her","On Thursday, the Inspector General of the State Department released a stinging report on Hillary Clinton regarding the use of her private email server. As expected, republicans pounced on the  findings  in an effort to paint her as an incapable, dangerous criminal (like they haven t already). Democrats, on the other hand, are taking a different approach and surprisingly have a strong defense from the conservative Forbes. Saying the newest findings in the  email-gate  vindicate rather than harm her, contributor Charles Tiefer, who served as Solicitor of the House of Representatives and as an attorney for the Senate Legal Counsel, says the  scandal  may not lie with Hillary Clinton but really with the Bush Administration:It does not add any new serious charges or adverse facts. And, it shows she was less out of line with her predecessors, notably Colin Powell, than has been charged. Powell s handling of his email was so similar, in fact, that when House Republicans drag this issue through hearings up to Election Day, Powell should be called as a witness   a witness for Clinton. To put it differently, she is having a double standard applied to her.If there is any person in the history of American politics that is the poster child for having double standards applied, it would be Hillary Clinton. For obvious reasons (she s a woman), Clinton seems to bear the brunt of rage from people who remain silent when men (or members of their own party) do the exact same thing: embassy security; mere ambition; votes (think crime bill); paid speeches; and now email procedures.Once again, Hillary Clinton is put on blast for an 83 page report, in which only half a dozen pages actually address the Secretary s personal emails   the rest of the pages are appendices, historical context and precedence established by predecessors including Albright, Rice, Powell and now Kerry. And the few pages that do mention her emails mostly discuss broad cyber security policies pertaining to emails.No new information has come out of the report. Just a scathing slap on the wrist for Clinton, who has already admitted that she could have gone about a much better way of handling her emails. But still you ll find Republicans (and indeed some left wing liberals) cry out  smoking gun.  As Tiefer points out:[T]o the extent that she is criticized because  she did not comply with the Department s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act,  the report is making a legal judgment that is not particularly strong. Note how she is not labeled as violating any statute, but rather, a real mouthful of mush    the Department s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.  So we are talking about obscure, dull, bureaucratic policies. Not a criminal statute. Not even a civil statute   just the bureaucratic policies.The fact of the matter is that this is not a smoking gun   just a politicized report of things we already knew. Based on the IG s report, Clinton did nothing illegal, she just created a bureaucratic headache. Shouldn t Republicans be giving her a medal given their intense hatred for the rules and procedures established by bureaucracy?So how does this help her? Well, for starters, it doesn t really hurt her. There s no legal framework established for an indictment, yet (unless we are counting on the FBI or the DOJ to somehow find a smoking gun). Second, it s more ammo for Clinton to use against a very sexist double standard that is applied to women in politics and not men. Third, it s another light shone on the Bush Administration, a penchant for lies, crooked shenanigans, and again, double standards.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Promised To Only Pick A White Man For VP – His Reason Will Make You SICK,"According to Donald Trump, Joe The Plumber was right when he said the only  American  thing we can do is elect a white Republican President, emphasis on white. On Thursday, the Trump campaign somehow managed to lower the bar of decency even more than they already have. Speaking on The Donald s behalf, his campaign chair made a promise that will make Trump s  poorly educated  white supremacist supporters happy   Trump will only pick a white man for Vice President, regardless of qualifications or other factors, because minorities are apparently incapable of being good at the job. He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn t want to do,  Paul Manafort told the Huffington Post.  He seems himself more as the chairman of the board, than even the CEO, let alone the COO. There is a long list of who that person could be,  the campaign chair continued,  and every one of them has major problems. But no matter what their problems, every single one of them is better than those blacks and Mexicans, according to Manafort. He says that the campaign likely won t choose a woman or a member of any minority group:Only Trump s idiot supporters would view choosing a running-mate based on their qualifications for the job rather than sex and skin color  pandering.  Is this really who Republicans want to lead the nation   someone who wants to literally build a wall to keep brown people out of the country, someone who thinks simply being from Mexico makes one a drug dealer, someone who tweets out white supremacist propaganda and encourages his supporters to beat up black people at his rallies (even offering to pay their legal fees)?featured image via Getty Images/Spencer Platt",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Vince Foster’s Sister Is FURIOUS With Donald Trump,"Donald Trump has a strategy to defeat Hillary Clinton, and that s to re-litigate decades of anti-Clinton conspiracy theories   theories that should have been put to bed years and years ago.The ugliest of those theories is that Hillary Clinton had her friend Vince Foster murdered   this despite the fact that numerous investigators, including Clinton attack dog Kenneth Starr, have said that Foster s death was suicide and now his sister is speaking out.Here s more on Trump s accusation:In an Op-Ed in the Washington Post, Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of Vince Foster, said this to Trump:It is beyond contempt that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy, but such is the character of Donald Trump displayed in his recent comments to The Washington Post. In this interview, Trump cynically, crassly and recklessly insinuated that my brother, Vincent W. Foster Jr., may have been murdered because  he had intimate knowledge of what was going on  and that Hillary Clinton may have somehow played a role in Vince s death.How wrong. How irresponsible. How cruel.************************************************Five investigations, including by independent counsels Robert B. Fiske Jr. and Kenneth Starr, concluded that Vince suffered from severe depression that caused him to be unable to sleep, unable to work, unable to think straight, and finally to take his own life.Anthony goes on to say that she and her brother were very close and that he called her a few days before he died saying that he needed help for depression. She found three psychiatrists, but help wasn t early enough. He killed himself three days later. That was only the beginning of her nightmare. The right took the story of Foster s suicide and tried, desperately to pin it (and everything else) on the Clintons.These outrageous suggestions have caused our family untold pain because this issue went on for so long and these reports were so painful to read. For years, our family had to wage a court fight to prevent release of photographs of Vince s dead body. My heartbroken mother was plagued by harassing phone calls from a reporter.Anthony has kept mostly quiet throughout the years, but Trump bringing this up again, many years after this has been settled, is too painful for her, and for her family, to endure.The fact is, that Trump will stop at nothing to appease his ego and win the ultimate political prize. This election will be ugly. A lot of people, who have put the past behind them, will have old wounds opened. Hillary Clinton, like all political candidates, is flawed, but she s not a murderer and to imply so is beyond unethical. Trump is only proving that he s not fit for office, any office.Featured sketch of Vince Foster via Wikipedia.

 Watch Bernie Fans SHUT DOWN This Misogynistic Anti-Hillary Protester (VIDEO/TWEETS),"On Wednesday, Bernie Sanders supporters showed just what classy and decent people they were when they stuck up for Sanders  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton   and also took a stand for women all over the world in the process.This happened when a man was spotted holding a disgustingly misogynistic sign that protested the presidential campaign of former Secretary of State at one of her rallies in Buena Park, California. His sign read,  Women are NOT fit to be President  and  President = man s job.  Here s the awful sign, as posted to Twitter by ABC s Liz Kreutz:Man holds  Women are NOT fit to be President  sign outside Clinton s rally pic.twitter.com/S2Ya6MUAyU  Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) May 25, 2016Fortunately, a group of Sanders  fans were at Clinton s rally to support Bernie   and although they weren t backing Clinton, they knew what needed to be done when they saw this misogynist in action. In the video below, you ll see Sanders supporters confront the sexist anti-Clinton protester, and destroy his sign to show that sexism and leaving women out of politics is a thing of the past. He is shamed, mocked and berated for his oppressive attitudes toward women as Sanders  supporters teach him a lesson he ll never forget. One woman can even be heard saying,  He s a f*cking teacher. Did you see what his sign said? You can watch the video here: Some of the Sanders supporters protesting Clinton tore up the man s  women are not fit to be president  sign pic.twitter.com/t6JScCYgcQ  Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) May 25, 2016The man wasn t identified, but Kreutz reported shortly after posting the video that  The man would not give his name but some people here identified him as a local high school AP calculus teacher.  This caused many people on social media to respond with things like,  He needs to be fired NOW. There s no way girls in his AP calculus class are being treated fairly or constitutionally. Later that day, Kreutz was able to reach him   and his cowardly response was that his sign was a joke    which seriously makes me wonder if this guy might be a Donald Trump fan.Bernie Sanders  supporters might not have been there for Hillary, but they definitely did something honorable   not just for her, but for all women. Thanks to them, this right-wing nut has been properly shamed and this video has gone viral. Hopefully, his school district will find out and he will be fired before his sexist attitude can threaten the futures of any more women and girls.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rosie O’Donnell Just CRUSHED What Was Left Of ‘Sh*tstain’ Donald Trump’s Pride (VIDEO),"Rosie O Donnell and Donald Trump have been engaged in a years-long feud, mostly because he leveled pathetic jabs at her over minor issues. But since Trump began his run for President, watching her smack him around has gone from entertaining to downright epic. On Wednesday, O Donnell made an appearance at a Boy George and Cyndi Lauper gig in New York. Speaking to the crowd, she launched into another attack on Trump that is likely eating away at him this very moment.In a video posted by the Daily Mail, O Donnell joked that she is  depressed because I f*cking hate that orange piece of sh*t.  She says he talked to her therapist about The Donald, and was told not to focus on the 2016 Republican frontrunner. Well I would rather give birth to a flaming iguana while taking a sh*t,  she recalls saying, apparently about his presidential prospects.  I hate him. I hate him. O Donnell noted that someone who was her  enemy for years  is friends with the  sh*tstain with a tinge of orange    a fact that  worries  her.All through her brief set, the audience cheered and laughed, but the man who recorded the video says that a few people were upset with O Donnell. Rosie s routine was just jaw-dropping,  he told the Daily Mail, noting that he began recording after the comedienne called Trump a sh*tstain.  She sounds like she is obsessed with Donald Trump and it was what she spent most of her very short act talking about.  He says that  not everyone was impressed,  tossing out an unverifiable claim that people around him were  shaking their heads in disagreement. One man near me turned to his wife turned and said,  I really hope Donald gets elected so she keeps her promise and moves to Canada ,  the man claims, apparently able to overhear someone s conversation with his wife over both O Donnell and the very enthusiastic crowd. He says that  Another lady was shouting,  Get off and let Cyndi sing'    something that is oddly missing from his video.Recently, O Donnell made headlines with a rather hilarious observation about Trump s mouth   specifically that it looks almost exactly like a puckered anus.Watch O Donnell s latest Trump smackdown below:Featured image via Getty Images (Dimitrios Kambouris)/Getty Images (Spencer Platt)",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: This Congresswoman Put An Anti-LGBT Bigot In Her Place During Hearing,"After an anti-LGBT witness demonstrated her ignorance of transgender people, a House Democrat openly called her a bigot for the record.During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Gail Heriot of the U.S. Human Rights Commission made it pretty clear that she probably should not be part of that body when she testified in writing that transgender people are living in a fantasy world where they are only pretending to be members of the opposite sex. If I believe that I am a Russian princess, that doesn t make me a Russian princess, even if my friends and acquaintances are willing to indulge my fantasy,  Heriot wrote.  Nor am I a Great Horned Owl just because   as I have been told   I happen to share some personality traits with those feathered creatures. Republicans are currently waging war against the federal government s public bathroom policy that protects transgender people from discrimination, which was a response to anti-LGBT policies passed in red states such as North Carolina where transgender people can only use the restroom that corresponds with the assigned gender on their birth certificate.Needless to say, Heriot s testimony made people angry, including California Rep. Zoe Lofgren. I ve got to say, I found this rather offensive,  Lofgren said upon reading the testimony.  It says to me that the witness really doesn t know anything and probably has never met a transgender child who is going through, in almost every case, a very difficult experience finding themselves. Indeed, being transgender is not a fantasy. It s reality and the struggle is very real. Not only do transgender people have to deal with discovering who they are, which often includes therapy and and medical treatments, they have to deal with bigots who have don t understand what they are going through.Lofgren was so offended by Heriot s testimony that she literally called her out for being a bigot for the record. I think you re a bigot, lady,  Lofgren told Heriot after she attempted to interrupt.  I think you are an ignorant bigot. Iowa Rep. Steve King protested on behalf of his fellow bigot by accusing Lofgren of being  out of order  but the California Democrat shut him down, too. Mr. Chairman, it is my time, and I would just like to say that we allow witnesses to say offensive things, but I cannot allow that kind of bigotry to go into the record unchallenged,  she said.Here s the video via YouTube.Lofgren was right to call out Heriot for the bullshit she wrote. As a member of the Human Rights Commission, she should be on the front lines fighting for transgender people to enjoy those same human rights that the rest of us enjoy. Instead, she s nothing more than a bigoted crony doing the bidding of transphobic Republicans.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Gohmert: Homosexuality Is ‘Perverse’ Because Gay Astronauts Can’t Reproduce In Space (VIDEO),"Rep. Louie Gohmert is perhaps America s most troubled congressperson. Vehemently anti-gay, the Representative from Texas has often made headlines for his nonsensical speeches. All of them were put to shame when Gohmert walked up to the podium on May 26 and began speaking about asteroids, Matt Damon and gay astronauts.While on the floor of the House, Gohmert launched into a nearly hour long diatribe against Obama s recent efforts to stop anti-gay discrimination. Having just killed his own party s energy and water spending bill because Republicans noticed it might help LGBT people, Gohmert was unhinged.Claiming homosexuality and transexuality were  perverse  mental disorders, Gohmert decided to  prove  his point by offering up a thought experiment. It is a very dumb thought experiment.I really wonder how many people who had the ultimate power to decide whether humanity would go forward or not. Whether it was an asteroid coming, something that would end humanity on Earth as dinosaurs were ended at one time. Okay, we ve got a spaceship that can go as Matt Damon did in that movie. Plant a colony somewhere we can have humans survive this terrible disaster.If you could decide what 40 people you put on the spacecraft that would save humanity, how many of those would be same-sex couples?In fairness, we do need to give Gohmert credit for acknowledging that the dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid and not because Noah couldn t fit them on his ark. Sadly, the rest of his conjecture is stunningly stupid.The premise that gay people shouldn t be given equal rights because they couldn t make babies in space is faulty for a number of reasons, but here are just a few:Gohmert s homophobic rant is quite possibly so idiotic that it isn t even offensive. Watching a grown man base his hateful ideology on misunderstanding the point of a Matt Damon movie is profoundly sad. It begs the question,  What are other Republicans sitting in the House thinking?  Just knowing that your political views align roughly with that of a bonafide moron like Louie Gohmert is enough to give even the most hardened conservative pause, surely.Of course, there are dumb people of every political stripe, but there s only one Louie Gohmert and he s a proud Republican   and that kind of says it all.Watch Gohmert s insane rant below:Featured image via CSPAN",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Obama Directly Calls Trump Out For Caring More About Tweets Than The Nation,"While speaking at the G-7 Summit in Shima, Japan, President Obama directly called Trump out for his shenanigans and let everyone know that world leaders are  rattled  by Trump s presumptive Republican presidential nomination.Obama also noted Trump s clear priorities, which is that he seems to care more about sending out tweets and Twitter than actually focusing on real-world issues that will have a direct impact on not only the nation, but the entire world.The president said: I think it s fair to say they are surprised by the Republican nominee, they are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements, but they re rattled by him, and for good reason  A lot of the proposals that he s made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that s required to keep America safe, secure and prosperous, and what s required to keep the world on an even keel. The president implying Trump has an  ignorance of world affairs  is being too nice. Trump is utterly naive when it comes to foreign policy and diplomacy, and is, quite literally, a liability to overall geopolitics and international security.He also added: Things don t roll together so well if the United States is not making good decisions. Trump, of course, seemed flattered that the president would say that the world is  rattled  by is nomination, saying  that s good  that the world is mortified of him having the potential to be leader of the free world.The last thing the world needs is another bully.Now, more than ever, we as a nation to come together to make sure Donald Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office. Not just for us, but for the entire world.

 NEVER TRUMP: Ice Cream Shop Kicks Out Muslim-Hating Bigots (VIDEO),"An ice cream parlor in Orange County, California, turned down money from a  Muslim-bashing customer after he insulted a Muslim woman in the store who was sitting and enjoying ice cream.22-year-old Nura Takkish was the target of the bigot.Takkish was sitting with two of her friends at Andrew s Ice Cream and Dessert in Orange County, California, on Monday, May 23, when they noticed a commotion at the counter. A customer was being asked to leave for saying  racist and nasty things,  the shop s baker, Jessie Noah, later told The Huffington Post.Takkish s friend Malaak Ammari started to record the incident on her phone.When you just trying to eat your ice cream but trump supporters won't let you live pic.twitter.com/rW3MI8a2pn  palestina (@itsdatnunu) May 24, 2016The baker handed the bigot back his $3, telling him,  You can give somebody else your business.  Cindy Ramsay, wife of the shop owner added,  If you can t be nice, we don t want you. On his way out, the defeated bigot yelled again:As he heads to the door, the man points a finger at the two women in headscarves and says,  I don t want them near my country. Too bad, we re here,  Ammari replies, still filming.  Sucks for you. Sucks for me? You ll see what happens,  the man replies threateningly. Then Noah walks to the door and closes it as the man walks away.Donald Trump has made anti-Muslim bigotry one of the centerpieces of his presidential campaign. He issued a call for Muslims to be barred from travel to the United States, and repeated the message in a press release and a live media event.The attacks on Muslims have been repudiated by civil rights organizations and leading politicians like President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders. Even some Republicans have said Trump s attack on Muslims is beyond the pale and not reflective of American values.The Trump campaign, after winning the nomination, has attempted to step away from some of those comments. But his most ardent supporters, and a majority of Republicans according to multiple polls, share the same view of Muslims as the bigot in the ice cream parlor.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Method Has Predicted Every Modern Election And Trump Is Screwed,"It s not about polls, it s not about personalities, it s not about unfavorable (or favorable) ratings, it s not even about policy. Moody s, who has predicted every election since Reagan in 1980, says that the Democrat will win the White House and the odds are getting progressively worse for Trump.According to Moody s, it s the economy. It s always the economy, and despite Trump s insistence that we are stuck in an apocalyptic nightmare of 40 percent or more unemployment, people are pretty happy overall, which favors the party in office: Democrats.It s a bad sign for Trump. Moody s has been predicting a Democratic triumph since last August, but the margin of victory is getting bigger for the left as the economy has stayed relatively strong and President Obama s approval rating has risen.The reason a Democrat will win isn t about polling or personalities, it s about economics, says Moody s. The economy is the top issue in just about every election. When the economy is doing well, the party currently in office usually wins again. When the economy is tanking, Americans vote for change.So far, the U.S. economy is chugging along. It s growing. Millions of people are getting jobs, home prices are rising and gas is cheap. All of this favors Democrats. The bad thing is that this puts Trump right in his comfort zone. Just two years before the housing collapse, Trump, on the Howard Stern Show, actually hoped that the real estate market would collapse. You can bet that he s hoping something similar for 2016.Right now, Moody s says the thing most likely to put a wrench in Democrats  plans is if the price of oil was to dramatically rise. Nationally, that level would have to be about $3.00 per gallon. Right now, the national average is about $2.31, which Americans are pretty comfortable with.The other thing Americans are comfortable with, which bodes well for Democrats, is President Obama. His approval rating is over 50 percent for the first time in three years. If it holds at current levels, the two-year increase in the president s approval rating running up to the election would surpass even that of President Ronald Reagan at the end of the Cold War,  notes Moody s.Best yet, the swing states are all looking pretty good. Moody s predicts that Virginia, New Hampshire, Ohio, Florida, Colorado (no wonder Republicans hate legalized pot, it helps the economy and helps Democrats win) and Nevada will all swing for the Dems. North Carolina should go Republican unless the transgender bathroom laws get enough Dems to the polls.Featured image via Joe Raedle at Getty Images (Clinton)/Isaac Brekken with Getty Images (Trump)",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Report Exposes How Trump Dodged $20 Million In Taxes (PHOTO EVIDENCE),"Donald Trump was involved at the highest levels in a cozy real estate deal that allowed $20 million in taxes owed to the federal government to go uncollected. The revelation comes as Trump still refuses to disclose his income taxes even as it emerged that years ago he paid no taxes, despite being a multi-millionaire (he claims to be a billionaire, but there is no independent proof of that).Trump s machinations were revealed by the British newspaper The Telegraph.The billionaire approved a $50 million investment in a company   only for the deal to be rewritten several weeks later as a  loan .Experts say that the effect of this move was to skirt vast tax liabilities, and court papers seen by the Telegraph allege that the deal amounted to fraud.Independent tax accountants and lawyers said that the documents Mr Trump signed   copies of which were obtained by this newspaper as part of a three-month investigation   contained  red flags  indicating the deal was irregular.The paper has also obtained the document making the deal, including Trump s one, unique signature.Kack Blum, chairman of the Tax Justice Network and a financial crime attorney told the paper that Trump is the  poster child  for elites that avoid their taxes, while the burden to make up the shortfall in revenue falls on the shoulders of middle-class Americans.Under New York law, up to 40 percent in taxes should have been paid on the deal if it went through as a traditional transaction. But since Trump was able to get the transfer of funds classified as a  loan,  taxes were completely avoided. Former employees of the company Trump was involved in, Bayrock, said that $20 million in taxes went uncollected.A professor of law and director of tax at the University of San Diego told the Telegraph that the he doesn t think the deal signed by Trump  would survive a challenge  by the IRS.Featured image via The Telegraph",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill O’Reilly Just Made The Most Offensive And Outrageous Claim About Black Lives Matter EVER,"If there is anyone who is as big a bully as Donald Trump, it is Fox News  Bill O Reilly. Whenever he has a guest on his show that has a differing opinion than him, he cuts them off, yells at them and all around treats them like shit. In addition to the way he treats his guests, he lies all the time to his audience and makes inflammatory claims about Democrats and liberal organizations. His love for outrage was showcased on the Wednesday night episode of The O Reilly Factor where he accused Black Lives Matter of  killing Americans. O Reilly introduced the  Talking Points  segment of his show by saying, How Black Lives Matter is killing Americans: that is the subject of tonight s talking points memo.  He went on to say that the movement is a  violent subculture  within the African-American community. Yes, because fighting for the rights, through protests and demonstrations, is SUPER offensive and violent. He claimed: The media will not spotlight that much of the violent crime in America is being committed right now by young black men. Blacks of all ages commit homicide at a rate of 8 times higher than whites and Hispanics combined. Conclusion: There is a violent subculture in the African American community that should be exposed and confronted. I would love to know where Bill gets his statistics from. Obviously, it s The Bullshit Center For White Supremacist Studies. This tired old narrative that black people commit more crimes than white people is, exactly that, bullshit. According to FBI statistics, African-Americans were arrested more than whites for murder and manslaughter, but the numbers varied by ONE percent.However, white people committed far more violent crimes than African-Americans. Sixty-five percent of the people arrested for  forcible rape  were white, that s double the 32 percent that were black. Aggravated assaults? 62.8 percent were committed by whites, 34 percent by blacks. Burglaries? 67.1 percent were committed by whites, 30.8 percent by blacks. The FBI found that 58.7 percent of all violent crimes were committed by white people and 38.5 percent by African-Americans.Table via FBI.govDon t expect O Reilly to amend his false claims, though, he needs to keep his audience nice and outraged. He needs his viewers to believe that black  thugs  are murdering, raping and robbing. The Republican Party needs him to spread this racist, bombastic nonsense because the more fearful white folks are of black people, the more likely they are to vote for people like Trump who are promising to take the country back. They HATE that a black guy has taken up residence in  their  White House and they want to make their Oval Office white again. O Reilly and the GOP know that this is how their vapid base feels so they are fear-mongering HARD.Featured image via Ilya S.

 Watch Hillary’s Reaction When Security Tries To Kick Shirtless Male Supporters Out Of Her Rally,"Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton had a couple of really enthusiastic supporters show up at her Buena Park, California rally on Wednesday. In fact, they were so enthusiastic she had to stop her security team from throwing them out of the event because they decided to remove their shirts.As security moved to escort the shirtless men out of her rally, one of them yelled,  Hillary, they re kicking us out because we don t have our shirts on. They re making us leave because we don t have shirts on.  A laughing Clinton responded by asking security to stop and saying: Well, you know what? As long as they don t take anything else off. You know, you gotta make split decisions that s what leadership is all about. We are a big diverse country. OK, where was I? I gotta admit, it is a little distracting standing up here looking at them. So I m gonna look over this way, and I m gonna look over that way. I m gonna look back there. It was a great moment for Clinton to show off the sense of humor a lot of people do not realize she has. The right wing often accuses her of being an Ice Queen, but she is actually very funny. Her response also highlighted the vast differences between her campaign and that of Republican nominee Donald Trump. The GOP candidate s rallies are filled with violence and hate, while Clinton s is filled with positivity.

" Conservatives Get Out Measuring Tape, Find Obama’s New House Is Sort Of Near Islamic Center","The conservative media, quite literally having nothing better to do, decided rock bottom wasn t deep enough and dug a little deeper. What they found was that President Obama will be moving to a house that s vaguely near an Islamic Center. Surely this changes everything!With Obama s time in office coming to a close, the family announced that they would be staying in Washington D.C. after they left the White House so that Sasha and Malia could finish school there. The house they chose is one befitting a former president and was once owned by a senior adviser to Bill Clinton.The move will put the Obamas in one of Washington s wealthiest ZIP codes, in a secluded precinct backing up to Rock Creek Park that is home to diplomats and a focal point of the capital s cocktail-party circuit. The home itself is luxurious; photographs posted by Washington Fine Properties, which listed it when it sold in 2014, show spacious rooms with hardwood floors, white marble countertops, his-and-her master bathrooms and a terrace with formal gardens.Conservatives, naturally, promptly lost their minds. The Obamas, they reasoned, should not be allowed to live in a nice house. I ll leave the reasons why this particular First Family can t live in a nice house or, say, eat in a fancy restaurant up to your imagination.But the crack team of conservative airheads over at Tucker Carlson s The Daily Caller took another approach: A quick Google Maps search found that the Obamas  new home is  wait for it  sort of near an Islamic Center.Here s how the Daily Caller s Eric Owens framed it:The mammoth, multi-million-dollar mansion where President Barack Obama and his family will reportedly live after the first family exits the White House is located 1,096 feet from the Islamic Center of Washington   one of the largest mosques in the Western Hemisphere.What follows is hundreds of words devoted to painfully describing every detail about the Islamic Center and its function. (Hint: Muslims do Islam in there, if you can believe it.) Hilariously, Owens also notes that the embassy of Oman and the  former  embassy of Iran are  close to Obama s new mansion.  This presumably means something.It s hard to fathom that we are approaching President Obama s final months in office and the right-wing movement has yet to let the  Obama is a secret Muslim  conspiracy go. A quick scroll through The Daily Caller s comment section cesspool finds that a strong majority of readers truly believe this to be the case.If you re curious as to why places like The Daily Caller are obsessing over Obama s proximity to Islamic Centers and the number of bathrooms in his new house, it just might have to do with the fact that President Obama is riding a wave of popularity. Having used his second term to nail one legacy affirming accomplishment after another, Obama currently enjoys a favorability rating that is higher than Reagan s and a strong wind at his back as he closes out a presidency that people like Tucker Carlson and Eric Owens insisted would be a country-destroying disaster.But let s ignore all that because a thousand feet away from Obama s new house is an Islamic Center. Good grief.Featured image via The Wire",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s New Manager Admits The ‘Muslim Ban’ Idea Was To Reel In The Whackos,"Paul Manafort, Donald Trump s new convention manager, may not have gotten the memo that the campaign never openly engages in honesty. Telling the truth inside the Trump camp could start a chain reaction, bringing the whole shindig to a screeching halt. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Manafort basically admitted that Trump s  Muslim ban  was nothing but a ploy to attract the fringe right weirdos who enjoy living in fear every hour of every day. He s already started moderating on that,  Manafort said.  He operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle. Within his comfort zone, he ll soften it some more. He ll still end up outside of the norm, but in line with what the American people are thinking. He starts those conversations on the  outer edges  because that s where the lunatics hang out. Once you ve secured them with a good dose of fear, hate and lies it s OK to move more towards the center, where people who live in the real world tend to be. It s not a new tactic for Trump; it s his status quo. His campaign began with a speech pandering to white supremacists. The wall he s never going to build whether he s elected or not will become legendary fodder for decades of election cycles to come.Manafort says the change will come at Trump s discretion, because  you don t manage Donald Trump.  Trump has already begun the move towards the center, saying recently that the ban he has said he would institute was actually  just a suggestion. Trump s  suggestions  leave little room for doubt on their translation. Was he also pandering to the far-right when he applauded torture and called for the U.S. to kill the families of known terrorists? Was he embellishing when he said that Mexico is  sending us  their worst criminals? Trump has and will say whatever he needs to say to keep those auditoriums stocked with hateful a-holes willing to get violent with protestors for free media coverage.Manafort seems to have the ideal personality to work for Donald Trump; he is completely delusional. On the issue of Trump s lagging support from women and Latinos, he told HuffPo: Hillary is the one who s got a gender gap. And while we are behind among women over all, we re ahead among white women even now. We ll get some black and Hispanic women as we go along, Yeah. Sure you will. As soon as Trump steps onto that stage and tries to treat Hillary Clinton the way he s treated Megyn Kelly, Carly Fiorina and Rosie O Donnell, women across America will be faced with the startling (not really) truth that Donald Trump only cares about his bought-and-paid-for wife and the daughter he seems to be secretly in love with. Even his younger daughter doesn t get a whole lot of billing; which makes you think Trump doesn t find her attractive enough to care about.Featured image by Kenna Betankur/Getty Images",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 What Trump Just Said The GOP Will Become If He’s President Will Send Shivers Down Your Spine,"How does the saying go? If we don t learn from history we re bound to repeat it. Well, listening to Donald Trump s latest remarks the American people need to take a look back at their history books to realize what he may actually be saying, because it s outright terrifying.We already know that white supremacists across the country are beyond excited for the possibility of a Trump presidency, mainly because of his outright and unapologetic racism. Now, he s just uttered something that should send shivers down all of our spines. Unfortunately, most won t even notice what he s saying and it will sound appealing to them.Trump said: Five, 10 years from now   different party. You re going to have a worker s party. He said this with the following explanation, which will appeal to many, many voters, because in all honesty it s true: A party of people that haven t had a real wage increase in 18 years, that are angry. But here s the thing, using the language of  worker s party  is very reminiscent of another  workers  party  and would also fit with Trump s general theme of his very racist and seemingly fascist campaign.Remembering history, let s recall the  National Socialist German Workers  Party  otherwise known as the Nazi Party.Now, is Trump willfully using this language without thinking about its history? Possibly. Should someone tell him that using this language is terrifying? Definitely.Anyway you look at it, though, it fits with the general theme of Trump s campaign narrative of excessive propaganda, slander, hatred, bigotry, and stifling of  the other.  So, to hear him now say that the GOP will become a  worker s party  is absolutely nauseating, and everyone should take heed.Donald Trump is willing to say anything, not caring if he flip-flops, to gain votes to get into power. He hasn t been able to solidify one thing that he s talked about except for the fact that he wants to be president. He, quite literally, has absolutely no qualifying experience to be Commander-in-Chief.

 WATCH: Kimmel Tells Hypocrite Trump He’s ‘Full Of Sh*t’ To His Face,"Donald Trump s past support of Hillary Clinton came back to bite him on the ass during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live.During the Wednesday night broadcast, Kimmel introduced presumptive Republican nominee Trump and after briefly chiding him for his taco bowl tweet on Cinco de Mayo proceeded to ask him if he really thought his campaign for the presidency would ever get this far. When you started all this, I just have to believe that you thought  This will be fun, it ll be a four month thing  and you never imagined it would go this far. Is that true?  Kimmel asked.Trump replied that he didn t think his campaign would come out on top so quickly. He thought there would end up being two conventions with one in July and one in August to determine the GOP nominee. Trump also claimed that he believed Hillary would have won the Democratic nomination long before now, but said he enjoys watching her.Kimmel then asked Trump if he is  enjoying the Hillary/Bernie struggle.  Well I do,  Trump said. And then Trump failed to see the irony as called the battle between to two Democrats  nasty  and that he hates to see that. It s getting nasty,  Trump continued.  I had no idea it was going to be so nasty. And you hate that,  Kimmel replied.  You don t like that. Yeah, I hate to see it,  Trump answered.  I hate to see it. Donald Trump s campaign is one of the nastiest in American political history, perhaps only topped by the 1828 Election.At rally after rally, Trump has spewed violent rhetoric, encouraged intimidation, and launched racist and sexist attacks against anyone who opposes him, including Hillary Clinton, whose husband has been the latest target of vicious attacks by Trump.The mentioning of Hillary Clinton, however, gave Kimmel the opportunity to hilariously hit Trump with statements he made about Hillary in 2008 and 2012. In 2008 you said you thought Hillary  would make an excellent president  and as recently as 2012 you said you thought she was  terrific.' Kimmel asked Trump to explain why he made those remarks and what has changed.Trump claimed that he says good things about all politicians as a businessman, to which Kimmel replied,  So you were full of shit when you said that. Trump could only shake his head in agreement and smile.Here s the video via YouTube.Kimmel definitely caught Trump with a brilliantly laid out trap.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Maine’s Gov. LePage OWNED On Live Radio By Woman Who Has No Insurance Thanks To Him,"Maine s Governor Paul LePage is a Tea Party idiot who refused Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, and all the federal funding that comes with it. The Medicaid expansion part of Obamacare was designed to help people obtain coverage who earned too little to qualify for insurance on the exchanges, but too much to qualify for Medicaid. LePage screwed over tens of thousands of Maine residents with his decision, and one woman was not going to let him get away with it if she could help it.The woman, who was identified as Laura, falls into that gap between qualifying for Obamacare and qualifying for Medicaid. She called in while LePage was being interviewed on Maine Public Radio specifically to blast him on behalf of the 60,000 Maine residents who are still without health insurance because of him: I m actually one of the people affected by the health care issue in Maine, so LePage is wrong in saying that people aren t affected or that wouldn t get the insurance. I would get the insurance if we accepted that money federally. LePage has been perpetuating the lies that no coverage gap actually exists, and that Maine wouldn t qualify for federal funds anyway because their Medicaid program accepts people with incomes of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line. So, of course, he insulted Laura by asking her why she doesn t qualify for Medicaid. Her response was: I make too little money to be on Obamacare. It s expected that if you go to Obamacare that you re going to make a certain amount of money so you can afford the premiums. But if you make $11,500 a year To that, LePage replied that she does qualify for Medicaid, and she retorted: You don t get Medicaid unless you re pregnant, disabled or over 55. This woman is a social worker, so her job includes helping people get access to certain things, including Medicaid. Therefore, she would know this stuff far better than the oppose-Obama-at-all-costs Tea Partier that s in the Governor s Mansion there. The fact that she herself makes too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but too little for Obamacare, was the final nail in the coffin of that conversation.Here s why: LePage s office was hilariously forced to release a statement later in the day admitting that the governor was wrong about the qualifications for Medicaid and the expansion. The state, because of its law, would not qualify for the full 100 percent of federal reimbursement for the first three years, and then the 90 percent every year after that for people between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty line. It qualifies for 62 percent reimbursement there.However, for the 60,000 Maine residents who currently fall into the coverage gap, Maine would qualify for the full federal reimbursement. So Laura triumphantly destroyed LePage s own talking points on the air, forcing his office to clarify things for listeners later on.How embarrassing.

 The Bundys Are Suing Because They Can’t Have Guns….In Jail,"No one has ever accused the Bundy boys of being intelligent. Their grasp on reality is a little sketchy, as is pretty much everything they do. They are the poster children for entitlement   expecting the government to give them free stuff (cattle grazing land), and then when the government charges them, they take over a bird sanctuary in Oregon. Now, they are pissed that after they broke numerous laws, their rights are being stripped away, just like everyone else who s in jail.Ammon and Ryan Bundy, sons of Cliven Bundy, are suing the Multnomah County Sheriff s Office. Some of their complaints don t seem completely ridiculous. They want more access to the law library, discovery material and office supplies. They also feel that the jail hasn t been accommodating enough to their Mormon religion. But it s not all sane, at all.UNSPECIFIED LOCATION   JANUARY 26: (EDITORS NOTE: Best quality available) In this composite with handout images provided by the Multnomah County Sheriff s Office, suspects (Top L) Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy, Ryan Waylen Payne, Brian Cavalier, (Bottom L) Peter Santilli, Joseph Donald OShaughnessy , and Shawna Cox pose for a mugshot photo after being arrested by U.S. Marshalls January 26, 2016 in Oregon. Ammon Bundy and seven others were arrested in a traffic stop along Highway 395 outside Burns, Oregon. One person was killed in the confrontation. Bundy led a group of armed followers, adopting the name Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, and occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. (Photo by Multnomah County Sheriff s Office via Getty Images) My rights are being violated. My right to life is being violated. All of my First Amendment rights are being violated. My right to freedom of religion is being violated,  Ryan Bundy wrote in a supporting statement.  My Second Amendment rights are being violated. I never waived that right. My Fourth Amendment rights are being violated.Wait, what? The Bundys are complaining because they re not allowed to have their guns, in jail!? Oh, and that search and seizure stuff that they tend to do in jail is very tiresome.Believe it or not, the jail hasn t completely laughed off all the Bundy complaints. They have given them more access to the library and they are considering giving them access to a computer of some sort. MCSO is willing to consider permitting inmates to have a solid-state device like an iPad, loaded with discovery including video, legal materials and a word-processing program to be made available to the person only in his cell,  jail officials responded to the request.Just imagine one moment that the Bundys were Muslim instead of Mormon. 9/11 suspects were accused of having laptops, while in Gitmo, according to the unreliable Washington Times.As for the religious gatherings, the jail put their foot down. They wanted to gather together, wearing temple garments beneath their jail clothes. The jail was worried about them gathering, but they did allow them an extra towel for kneeling to pray and they are allowed to wear their religious garments.The jail also refused to give them access to the internet, chairs in their cells, access to other defendants, unmonitored phone calls, a cordless printer and scanner, more storage space and real pens. Come on, anyone who s every watched a prison movie knows that real pens are killers.Not a single one of the jail s concessions have been enough, according to the Bundys. They are considering suing. Here s a copy of the complaint. The Bundys are accused of 16 federal felonies. If they are convicted, they will never be able to own a gun again, not that that will stop them.Featured image via Justin Sullivan with Getty Images",News,"May 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump And Bernie Sanders Agree To Debate Before California’s Primaries,"Jimmy Kimmel landed a rare, on-air appearance from Donald Trump on the May 25th edition of his show, and wasted no part of the segment in grilling Trump on everything. Possibly the most interesting twist, however, came when Kimmel read a question from Bernie Sanders, who will be tonight s guest on  Jimmy Kimmel Live.  The question? Hillary Clinton backed out of an agreement to debate me in California before the June 7th primary. Are you prepared to debate the major issues facing our largest state and the country prior to the California primary? Trump, ever the attention-whore, replied with something surprisingly philanthropic: Yes, I am. How much is he going to pay me? Because if I debated him, we would have such high ratings and I think I should take that money and give it to some worthy charity. If he paid a nice sum for a charity I would love to do that. Trump later said that whatever network picked it up could donate the money to charity for this debate.The Sanders campaign wasted absolutely no time in responding to Trump on this:Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 26, 2016This would be a truly interesting debate, especially given that primary season isn t over yet, despite all expectations that both nominations would be locked up by now. There have already been so many monkey wrenches thrown into the primaries that one would think nobody would notice this one. However, one would be very wrong   this could throw the biggest monkey wrench yet into the works, depending on how the two candidates interacted with each other and the moderators in such a setting.As of the time of this posting, there was no formal arrangement to actually hold this debate, and setting it up could be a logistical nightmare for the campaigns. That could change quickly, though, depending largely on whether the networks see any potential in it. Honestly, they d be idiotic not to want to do it. It s hard to imagine that anybody in the country wouldn t want to see these two put their arguments side-by-side in a debate format.As Bernie said,  Game on.

 White Students Rape Black Teen With Coat Hanger After Months Of Racist Taunting (VIDEO),"A federal lawsuit filed against officials at Dietrich High School, located in Dietrich, Idaho, claims that coaches and other staff at the school contributed to an environment of racist bullying, which culminated in the vicious rape of a Black teen by three white students.As KBOI reports here, 17-year-old Tanner Ward and 18-year-old John Howard, along with a third student who was not named, are facing felony sexual assault charges, after authorities say they carried out a vicious sexual assault on a disabled student.The three white students used a coat hanger to rape their Black classmate in the school locker room, last October.According to New York Daily News:A witness testified that Ward initiated the heartless attack and that Howard was the one who kicked the coat hanger five or six times while it was jammed inside the boy s rectum, causing painful injuries that required hospital treatment.The victim, who testified for the first time about the rape last month, told the court that he remembers the three students laughing throughout the brutal assault.According to the suit, coaches and other school officials created an atmosphere in which racist bullying of the mentally disabled teen was not only tolerated but encouraged.The suit alleges that football coaches urged other students, including Howard, to beat-up on the teen, claiming that it would  toughen him up. KBOI reports that the victim was made to wear boxing gloves, while Howard was encouraged to fight him bare-handed.During the incident, other students and coaches surrounded the Black teen, shouting racial slurs at him. The  nighttime fight,  as it was referred to by coaches and students, ended when the disabled teen was knocked unconscious by Howard.This is just one of many instances of racist bullying described in the suit, which states that the victim  was taunted and called racist names by other members of the team which names include  Kool-Aid   chicken eater   watermelon  and n r,  over the course of several months.According to New York Daily News:Howard, who is portrayed in court documents as the ringleader in the merciless harassment, is accused of forcing the black boy to sing a Ku Klux Klan song he learned in Texas, called  Notorious KKK.  Howard also encouraged other football players to join in on the vicious bullying, the suit alleges.The suit, which seeks $10 million in damages, alleges that coaches and school officials knew what was happening, but failed in their duty to protect the disabled student.As KTVB reports in the video below, since filing the suit the victim s family has experienced harassment from some local residents. The school was placed on lockdown on Wednesday, after news of the story broke nationally.Here s more on the story from KTVB.Image credit: video screen capture KTVB",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Christian’ Dad Forced 14-Year-Old Daughter To Marry MUCH Older Rapist Who Impregnated Her (VIDEO),"There are many good things in the Bible   messages of love, charity, and goodwill toward others   and then there are the parts that should be ignored by even the most devout of Christians. One such segment, in particular, is Deuteronomy 22:27-29, which states that women should be forced to marry their rapists, even stipulating the amount that the rapist must pay for the woman or child he raped. It is likely this passage that led Idaho  Christian  Keith Strawn to drive his 14-year-old daughter to Missouri where he forced her to marry her rapist just like the Bible says.Most fathers would seek justice if a 24-year-old man raped and impregnated his 14-year-old daughter. Strawn will spend 120 days in jail after forcing her to marry Aaron Seaton, her rapist. The  Biblical  marriage lasted 120 days. Ultimately, Strawn s daughter miscarried. But he had an interesting defense of his decision to marry her off to her rapist:FOX31 reports:In August 2015, Strawn took his 14-year-old daughter and then 24-year-old Aaron Seaton to Missouri to consent in their marriage. Seaton, now 25, pleaded guilty to a rape charge in April and is believed to have impregnated her. The victim miscarried.Seaton is serving a 15-year prison sentence. Court records show Strawn  harbored and protected  Seaton by allowing him to live with his teenage daughter. If you get them pregnant then you marry them,  Strawn told [the judge] during the hearing.Strawn s attorney argued that he receive a six-day jail sentence   less time than Creationists believe it took God to create all of existence   and probation because his client s decision to marry off his daughter to her rapist  might have been a religious motivation. (The victim) told me herself that her father asked her several times during the trip to Missouri, and even the day of the marriage, if it was something she wanted to do, the attorney said, as though that mattered. I love my daughter very much and I would never do anything to intentionally harm her or put her in harm s way,  Strawn told the judge.  I made the wrong decision, and I made that decision in duress. It is unclear if Seaton paid Strawn the required 50 silver pieces for his daughter, as is required by the Bible, nor did he explain what he meant by  duress. Strawn was originally charged with two counts of felony injury to a child and one of accessory to rape. As part of a plea agreement, two charges were dismissed and Strawn agreed to plead guilty to a single count of felony injury to a child. The sentence was 110 days more than the prosecution s recommended 10-day sentence   which I am sure we can all agree is pretty awesome, though it could and should be longer.Watch a report on this horrific abuse below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Hasn’t Gotten The Memo That He’s All But Wrapped Up The GOP Nomination, And It’s Hilarious","Since Donald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee for president, and the Democratic primary season isn t nearly as close to over as the Republican primary season, Trump ought to be spending his time trying to unite his party and gather as much support as possible. Instead, he s still acting like he s in the thick of the primaries.At a rally in Anaheim, he attacked South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley for endorsing Marco Rubio; Jeb Bush for having low energy (what?); and Mitt Romney for being a  choker.  He also said that Romney was stupid, and  choked like a dog. What month are we in now? He thinks it s still January, apparently.Those three haven t endorsed him yet, so obviously, in Trump s dimension, the way to get their endorsements is to alienate them. House Speaker Paul Ryan still hasn t endorsed Trump either, and Trump has been busy been attacking him on his favorite social media platform, Twitter. One has to wonder how he thinks he ll be well-positioned to win the presidency and work with Congress if the Speaker of the U.S. House can t stand him.At a rally in New Mexico on Tuesday, he attacked New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez because she wouldn t endorse him too. Martinez is the first Latina governor in U.S. history, the first female governor of New Mexico, and chair of the Republican Governors  Association. He slammed Martinez on Tuesday night, saying: We have got to get your governor to get going. She s got to do a better job. Okay? Your governor has got to do a better job. She s not doing the job. Hey! Maybe I ll run for governor of New Mexico. I ll get this place going. She s not doing the job. We ve got to get her moving. Come on: Let s go, governor. He went on to lie about New Mexico getting flooded with Syrian refugees, and basically acting like Martinez is his opponent. It s sad, and also hilarious in a way, because one would think he d want to secure as many endorsements as possible now, especially those of people as important as Martinez and Paul Ryan.Trump doesn t even hear the GOP s calls for him to try and unite the party   they may as well not exist. He thinks unity is a nice pipe dream, but not necessary for him, and really, who cares about healing rifts that run across the entire U.S., right? It s the same with the calls for him to act more presidential. He s stuck in the past. Either that, or he s out for the blood of everyone who s ever wronged him, which is likely the reason he s stuck in the past.Soon, he s going to have to face off against either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. What will he do then, should he still have some prominent Republicans who continue to refuse to endorse him? General election season will be mighty interesting if he doesn t get with the program here. More than 60 percent of Americans already view him unfavorably, and this attitude could further alienate Republicans and Democrats alike. Too bad for our dear Mr. Trump.Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Campaign MAJORLY F*cks Up By Accidentally Emailing Its Anti-Clinton Strategy To A Journalist,"Donald Trump s best efforts to smear Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton have just been ruined and exposed   thanks to the carelessness of his own campaign!On Wednesday, Politico reported that Trump s campaign was planning to roll out several attacks against the former Secretary of State, focusing on her involvement in the Whitewater real estate scandal   which would be an entirely new strategy, considering that all Trump has been doing over the last few days is going after the sexual history and rape allegations of Hillary s husband, former president Bill Clinton.Trump s latest attack blueprint was revealed in an internal Trump campaign email, after campaign adviser Michael Caputo sent a request for a Republican National Committee researcher to work up information on HRC/Whitewater as soon as possible,  stating that  This is for immediate use and for the afternoon talking points process.  In the process of getting the information together, these plans were accidentally sent to an journalist. How does the Trump campaign f*ck up this badly? It s an interesting story. According to Politico: The email was obtained by POLITICO when Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, who [Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo] copied on his request to the RNC, accidentally responded instead to Marc Caputo, a POLITICO reporter who is not related to the Republican consultant. And Trump s anti-Clinton strategy wasn t the only thing Hicks let slip through the cracks. She also gave away the fact that RNC staffer Michael Abboud could possibly be jumping ship and joining the Trump campaign. Hicks said, He is still an employee of the RNC and we need to be sensitive to that until he comes over to our team full time. Hilariously, Hicks didn t realize how badly she d screwed up until about 20 minutes later   and all she did to rectify it was send the journalist another email. The email s subject line read,  Wrong email, obviously  and the message contained one pathetic word:  Apologies.

 Amy Schumer’s Response To Body Shaming Trolls Is Absolutely PERFECT (IMAGE),"Women, especially women in the public eye, are the constant victims of body policing. We re too fat, we re too thin, our breasts are too small, too large, or too fake. Comedian Amy Schumer is one woman who is the constant victim of such comments, specifically those regarding her weight. Schumer may not be a skinny minny, but she is a strong, healthy, beautiful woman who is not ashamed of who she is or how she looks. That never stopped hateful trolls from calling her fat, though. Well, Schumer decided to take those trolls to task via Instagram in the most perfect way   by posting a photo of herself in a swimsuit.The post was captioned: I meant to write  good morning trolls!  I hope you find some joy in your lives today in a human interaction and not just in writing unkind things to a stranger you ve never met who triggers something in you that makes you feel powerless and alone. This is how I look. I feel happy. I think I look strong and healthy and also like miss trunchbull from Matilda. Kisses! Here is the embed of the post:I meant to write  good morning trolls!

" While Texas Republicans Focus On Abortions And Bathrooms, It’s Still Legal To F*ck A Cat","Republicans  priorities are out of whack. In Texas, the GOP is currently waging a war on women   specifically on their ability to have a safe and sanitary abortion instead of taking a wire hanger to the bathroom. Top GOP legislators in the state have waged an extended war on Planned Parenthood based on fraudulent, heavily-edited videos depicting the health organization as an evil cabal that murders babies and sells their body parts to the highest bidder.Top GOP legislators in the state have waged an extended war on Planned Parenthood based on fraudulent, heavily-edited videos depicting the health organization as an evil cabal that murders babies and sells their body parts to the highest bidder. Though the creators of the  baby parts  videos were ultimately indicted by a grand jury and face decades in prison, the war on Planned Parenthood rages on in the Lone Star State.Texas  latest assault on women s rights comes in the form of an attempt to legislate bathrooms so that transgender women   even those some would call  passable  in a callous and offhanded sense   would be forced to use the men s restroom. A bill filed Sunday would institute harsh penalties for anyone who was born with a penis if they entered a women s shower or toilet facility regardless of whether or not they identify as a woman. In fact, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick recently called this blatant act of discrimination a priority of the  highest order. That s not a euphemism  while Republicans are focused on legislating vaginas in one way or another, it is not a crime for someone to unzip his pants and violate a feline with his penis. This may seem shocking, but it s true.On Tuesday, Bloomberg published a report that revealed some horrific facts about the latest state to embarrass our nation with ridiculous attempts to legalize human rights violations:When Katie Jarl started her job as the Texas state director for the Humane Society of the U.S., she received calls on a monthly basis from law enforcement and animal cruelty officers about bestiality cases. They asked whether they could arrest individuals for animal cruelty and how they could remove the animals from the home, she said.Jarl was forced to tell them they couldn t do anything because bestiality is still legal in the state of Texas. The problem is we simply don t have a law,  she told Bloomberg BNA.  When something s not illegal, it s a problem for law enforcement. Texas is one of nine states and the District of Columbia whose criminal codes do not include an enforceable bestiality statute.Jarl says that unless someone has sex with an animal in public so they can be charged with another crime, there are no limits to what a motivated and sick individual could do to the neighborhood cat, horse, or iguana population. There is absolutely no way to stop someone from exercising their apparent right to violate an animal, Jarl says. This, of course, is a problem because crimes against animals often escalate into crimes against humans, including the children whom Republicans claim their bathroom bill would protect: Animals are often the gateway to abusing children, women, and other human beings,  she said.Prosecutor Jessica Milligan agreed. Milligan heads the animal cruelty division for the District Attorney s Office of Harris County, Texas.Violence against animals and humans typically arise in a domestic violence context, but Milligan told Bloomberg BNA that she has seen more sinister cases. Right now they aren t considered criminals,  Jarl says.  They re allowed to do this legally.  Under current laws, animal rescuers are forced to return runaway pets to their owners when there are clear signs of sexual abuse   something that is certainly not OK.Unfortunately, one major problem is that Texas legislators don t know what the f*ck is going on in a general sense, but moreso when it comes to bestiality. Jarl says she is working with lawmakers to get a law on the books that would officially ban bestiality. She says that many are surprised it is not already against the law. I never thought I would have to convince anyone that bestiality should be illegal,  she says, but in Red States, anything is possible. Unfortunately, even if she manages to make a law banning bestiality happen, Bloomberg notes that rural areas,  where animals are seen as tools,  will present a problem because unless the media gets involved, it will be difficult to bring attention to the problem.Milligan says that bestiality is becoming more common in Texas, noting an upswing in such horrific would-be crimes since about the time President Obama was re-elected (within the last four years)   though she concedes that she is unsure if bestiality is on the rise or if people are just more open about posting their exploits on social media.Interestingly, Texas legislators remain silent on this issue, preferring to expend energy and taxpayer money on a nonsensical, multi-pronged war on women.Featured image via My San Antonio/Visualizeus",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 American Liar: Wingnut Icon Chris Kyle Wasn’t The Hero He Made Himself Out To Be,"There s nobody your standard issue right-wing nutjob loves more than Chris Kyle. His story is the stuff of ammosexual dreams. Not only did he join the military to go fight terrorists, he scored more kills than anyone in Iraq. He also told some blatantly fictitious stories about things he did here at home, but his military career? Not even those darned lefties who think glorifying killing women and children for any reason is wrong could deny what s written in black and white. Ultimately, it seems, it s those same records that will cheapen the legacy of Chris Kyle.An investigation by The Intercept  reveals that while Kyle does have a remarkable military record, it wasn t enough for his ego. In his book, American Sniper, Kyle said: All told I would end my career as a SEAL with two Silver Stars and five Bronze [Stars], all for valor. That s awfully impressive. Unfortunately, it s a lie. According to internal Navy documents, Chris Kyle received one Silver Star and three Bronze Stars. Why anyone would need to embellish a career already that impressive is truly baffling, but Kyle did. Is it really that big of a deal, though? So the guy told a little fibsky what s the harm in that? Apparently, when it comes to Navy SEALS and valor, there is little that is worse. According to The Intercept:Kyle was warned at least once before American Sniper was published that its description of his medal count was wrong, according to one current Navy officer, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the case. As Kyle s American Sniper manuscript was distributed among SEALs, one of his former commanders, who was still on active duty, advised Kyle that his claim of having two Silver Stars was false, and he should correct it before his book was published.Current and former Navy SEALs interviewed for this article, who agreed to speak on background because they feared being shunned by their close-knit community, did not dispute Kyle s heroism in combat, but saw the inflation of his medal count as significant because they consider battlefield embellishments to be dishonorable.Not only did Kyle lie, he was called on it. It may have been one thing if he could have claimed he thought he had medals or that,  aw, gee there were so many I got mixed up,  but that time came and went. Not only do Kyle s lies about shooting looters after Katrina or killing carjackers with his 2nd Amendment now get the  pants on fire  rating   his military career is now in question as well. Who is to say that he didn t embellish other things? The man was obviously constitutionally incapable of telling the truth.Maybe it s a good thing. Maybe a few fewer women and children met their end with what Kyle called  180 grains of justice.

 Senator Who Once Betrayed America To Iran Has Gall To Accuse Harry Reid Of ‘Cancerous Leadership’,"Senator Tom Cotton just put on a legendary show of hypocrisy on the floor of the Senate and my jaw has not quite left the floor. Cotton is known these days as  Tehran Tom  thanks to his poorly executed attempt to derail President Obama s nuclear agreement with Iran by organizing a secret letter that was sent to the Iranian government instructing the country to ignore the diplomatic agreement or else, so it s a little rich that he feels confident in lecturing another senator on  leadership. However, it s not just Cotton s shameless hypocrisy that is striking, but the apparently fully realized fantasy world he lives in. So powerful are the delusions and so blind is he to the real world, it s a wonder Cotton manages to walk through his office without bumping into a coffee table. Here s Cotton, a man who recently held up a crucial bill because it would have allowed the Iranian nuclear agreement to go forward, slamming Sen. Harry Reid for   don t laugh, this is serious   obstructing a defense bill. As a junior senator, I preside over the Senate. I usually do in the morning, which means I m forced to listen to the bitter, vulgar, incoherent ramblings of the Minority Leader,  Cotton said.  Normally, like other Americans, I ignore them. I can t ignore them today, however. Cotton tore into Reid for stalling a vote on a crucial defense bill, even though the bill eventually passed 98-0.  When was the last time the Minority Leader read a bill? It was probably an electricity bill,  Cotton quipped.Why was Reid holding up the bill? For one thing, Republicans decided to add an amendment that would allow religious organizations to legally discriminate against gay people (in defiance of federal law). It s a favorite pet project of the GOP and, you may have noticed, has absolutely nothing to do with funding the military. Reid may be forgiven for feeling like amendments like these are unfettered bullshit and intentionally placed in important defense bills so that people like Tom Cotton can grandstand about them.Ironically, another aspect of the defense bill that has led to controversy is amendment requiring women to register for the draft. Why is that in there? Well, it s a funny story.The move to require women to register for the draft had an unlikely origin, when Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.)   who opposes the Obama administration s recent decision to open up all combat roles to women   proposed the change in the House Armed Services Committee to start a  discussion.  But to GOP leaders  surprise, the committee approved his language, prompting them to yank out the provision in a Rules Committee maneuver before it could go to the floor.In other words, Republicans in both the House and Senate have worked overtime to shoot themselves in the foot then scream at Democrats for not providing them with bulletproof shoes.It s clear what going on here. The Republican-led Congress has bravely led Congress to its lowest approval numbers in history. It s function as an equal branch of government has been replaced by a level of gridlock so severe that almost nothing gets accomplished. Having gotten Congress to this point by obstruction, Republicans are eager to diffuse the blame by pretending  both sides  do it.In Cotton s hysterical screeching, there s a very real fear that nobody is buying it anymore. Even someone as delusional as him can see that.Watch Cotton s ravings below via C-SPAN:Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Democrats Preparing A Coup To Oust Debbie Wasserman-Schultz,"As the Democratic Primary wraps up and tensions continue to flare, Capitol Hill Democrats are quietly discussing a possible coup to oust DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.Wasserman-Schultz, who has been seen as wildly divisive in the primary, is facing a mountain of criticism and uphill battles as she braces for a tough primary fight in Florida.According to an exclusive, in depth report from The Hill, Democratic Senators have been meeting together to draw up a plan to force the Florida Congresswoman to resign. One Democratic Senator, who is pro-Clinton and who remained anonymous, told The Hill: There have been a lot of meetings over the past 48 hours about what color plate do we deliver Debbie Wasserman-Schultz s head on. I don t see how she can continue to the election. How can she open the convention? Sanders supporters would go nuts. It s worth noting that these Democratic lawmakers couldn t actually oust Wasserman-Schultz; only the National Committee could do that, and would rely on talks between Clinton and Sanders.Another Democratic Senator echoed these sentiments, saying if the party hopes to attract young people, Wasserman-Schultz must go: We need to get this figured out and come together. Hillary s got the nomination. She needs Bernie s energy. It s time for her to accommodate. It s time to pick hard-nosed people to cut through things and figure out a deal. They [young people] need to know this is their party. However, not all Democratic Senators are cooling to Wasserman-Schultz. Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring at the end of this term, said the Congresswoman has done a good job,  and said,  If you look at her platform committee appointments, she really gave a lot of room to Bernie supporters. Senators Bill Nelson, Tim Kaine, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jeanne Shaheen, and others have gone on record with The Hill vehemently denying the attempted coup and pledging their support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Chair Xavier Baccara have also expressed their support for the DNC Chairwoman.The only member of he Senate to endorse Sanders, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, has remained neutral, but chastised Wasserman-Schultz for  adding gasoline to the fire  after the contentious and disastrous Nevada convention.An aide to Joe Biden told The Hill that the Vice President supports her.The issue surrounding Debbie Wasserman-Schultz continues to divide Democrats with roughly two months to go until the national convention in Philadelphia.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Attacks New Mexico’s GOP Governor After She Refuses To Endorse Him,"If Donald Trump were a smart man, he d be doing everything he possibly could to woo New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez who has not yet thrown her support behind him. She is the perfect GOP poster woman    tough  on crime, anti-immigration, pro-corporate tax cuts, opposes Obamacare, and she is anti-gay marriage. However, instead of doing what a typical candidate would do and trying to win Governor Martinez over with his plans for the future, Trump has chosen to attack and bully an endorsement out of her.During a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Tuesday night, the presumptive Republican nominee slammed the governor to his vapid supporters: We have got to get your governor to get going. She s got to do a better job. Okay? Your governor has got to do a better job. She s not doing the job. Hey! Maybe I ll run for governor of New Mexico. I ll get this place going. She s not doing the job. We ve got to get her moving. Come on: Let s go, governor. Trump went on to say, Syrian refugees are being relocated in large numbers to New Mexico. If I was governor, that wouldn t be happening. LIES!First of all, Governor Martinez is one of those Republicans who has no interest in helping Syrian refugees. She believes that the government doesn t vet refugees; basically, she has no idea what she is talking about. Because of her lack of education on how resettlement works, her state is not very welcoming. In fact, the Refugee Processing Center reports only ten Syrian refugees have been settled in New Mexico since 2011, the year Martinez assumed office.TEN. That s the  large number  of Syrians Trump is talking about.So, the question of the day is: Did Trump s speech convince the governor to support him?Not even a little.Martinez spokesman Mike Lonergan issued a statement responding to Trump s criticism: Apparently, Donald Trump doesn t realize Governor Martinez wasn t elected in 2000, that she has fought for welfare reform, and has strongly opposed the President s Syrian refugee plan. But the pot shots weren t about policy, they were about politics. And the Governor will not be bullied into supporting a candidate until she is convinced that candidate will fight for New Mexicans. Governor Martinez doesn t care about what Donald Trump says about her   she cares about what he says he will do to help New Mexicans. She didn t hear anything about that today. Good for her. I may disagree nearly all of Governor Martinez s policies but at least she isn t going to allow a misogynistic jackass bully her into submission.Featured image via Mark Lyons/Getty Images",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rush Limbaugh’s Show Is In Financial Ruins Thanks To Liberal Boycott,"It s being dubbed the  rare boycott that actually worked.  In today s age of endless cycles of outrage and amnesia, Rush Limbaugh probably assumed that listeners would forget and forgive after, in a fit of characteristic rage, the conservative radio host called a Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke a  slut  on air (for the crime of using birth control, no less). Instead, it may have finally cost Limbaugh his job.It s been four years since Limbaugh lashed out at Fluke, but the damage is finally being felt. For one thing, his show   which is still a go-to source of batshit crazy   has been dropped by an ever growing list of advertisers and affiliates who, understandably, have no interest in being associated with Limbaugh s sickening brand nor care about appealing to his vicious, toxic listener. Making matters worse, Limbaugh s $38 million a year contract is expiring and as negotiations begin, suddenly the thought of paying a man tens of millions of dollars a year to call a college student a slut doesn t seem like such a good investment.Much of this is due to David Brock and his liberal watchdog organization, Media Matters for America. According to Politico, the company has spent over $100,000 on organizing the Limbaugh boycott that may finally take him down.The anti-Limbaugh faction came up with the social media-friendly slogan  Flush Rush.  The group s efforts met considerable success in the months that followed. Dozens of companies, including Netflix, JCPenney and Sears, announced they would boycott Limbaugh s show. Most have yet to return. And the increasing popularity of platforms like Twitter, which can be used to stoke outrage and promote boycotts, makes it highly unlikely they ever will.The Sandra Fluke incident  did a lot of harm to talk radio,  Darryl Parks says.  Thirty-eight percent of revenue disappeared overnight.  And the damage was not limited to Limbaugh; he hurt all of talk radio, including even some liberal hosts. Certain programs Michael Savage, for example, and in an earlier era, Bob Grant had always been considered  toxic  by some advertisers, but after the Fluke incident, entire stations or indeed, the entire format of talk radio were deemed no-go zones by blue chip brands.Compare this boycott to those frequently half-heartedly kicked off by the right and it s easy to see why the outcome was different. Unlike, say, the attempt to boycott Starbucks because they made their holiday cups red, the  Flush Rush  boycott is on firm moral ground. What Limbaugh did, and continues to do, to the people who happen to catch his ire is pathetic and wrong. While the color of a coffee cup might be  controversial  to some, listening to Limbaugh label a young woman a slut because she doesn t want to get pregnant is deeply repugnant regardless of your political leanings.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: This 10 Minute Elizabeth Warren Speech Needs To Be Played On Repeat Through November,"There s been an ongoing battle between presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. The two have been verbally sparring back and forth for over a month now. Trump hurling insults, and Warren absolutely pummeling him with actual intellect.Warren s most recent remarks came Tuesday as she brought up the fact that Trump was rooting for the mortgage market to fail back before the housing crisis eight years ago. He was hoping to literally bank off people losing their homes.Warren said: Donald Trump was drooling over the idea of a housing meltdown because it meant he could buy up a bunch more property on the cheap. What kind of a man does that? Root for people to get thrown out on the street? Root for people to lose their jobs? Root for people to lose their pensions? Root for two little girls in Clark County, Nevada, to end up living in a van? What kind of a man does that?  I ll tell you exactly what kind. A man who cares about no one but himself. A small, insecure money-grubber who doesn t care who gets hurt, so long as he makes some money off it. What kind of man does that? A man who will never be president of the United States. And she s absolutely correct.Warren also went into how Trump keeps complaining about Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform bill, and how it s apparently limiting banks from doing business. She said: Donald Trump is worried about helping poor little Wall Street? Let me find the world s smallest violin to play a sad, sad song. Adding: Can Donald Trump even name three things about Dodd-Frank? Likely not, but neither can his supporters, and he s relying on their ineptitude to get ahead.Oh, and Warren is clearly getting under Trump s thin skin, because this is what he had to say after the Massachusetts senator s speech:Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk, no action!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2016That, from a man who, quite literally, has absolutely no policy or diplomacy experience whatsoever. Trump is clearly terrified of strong women and he needs to realize that hurling insults at women who have had to battle every step of the way to get to where they are isn t going to work. He s not the first bully they ve come across, and he most certainly won t be the last.Watch Warren s amazing speech here:Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Chuck Todd SHRED Trump For His Hypocritical Attacks On The Clintons (VIDEO),"Ever since his GOP rivals dropped out of the presidential race and he became the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump has stopped attacking his fellow Republicans and focused his childish attacks on his biggest competition   Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton. And of course, he s doing it the only way he knows how   by being a misogynist and attacking her marriage. The only problem is, Trump is too stupid to fully grasp the full hypocrisy of what he s doing.It s been widely reported that in the past, Trump was somewhat close to the Clintons   he even invited them to his (third) wedding. But what many don t realize is that the very attacks Trump is making on the Clintons are things that Trump previously defended the political power couple against.No one pointed this out better than Chuck Todd on Wednesday morning, when he appeared on NBC s  Today  to call Trump out for being a  walking contradiction. It was already an amazing segment, with  Today  showing some footage of Trump calling Paula Jones, a woman who accused former president Bill Clinton of sexual harassment years ago, a  loser. The show also aired an old video of Trump saying that the way HE treated women would prevent him from being president if he were to run. In a statement that has come back to haunt him, Trump had said, Can you imagine how controversial I d be? You think about (Bill Clinton) with the women, how about me with the women? Can you imagine? In the past, Trump had also downplayed Bill s Monica Lewinsky scandal, saying,  Look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into, with something that was totally unimportant   and they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. But now that the stakes are high and Trump needs to defeat Hillary, his attitude has done a complete 180   and Todd isn t letting him get away with it. To show just how insane it is that Trump has continued to slide by with voters despite his lies, Todd said: I don t know why people give him a pass on this. I mean, I asked him, I said what Trump do we believe? What you said about Hillary Clinton five years ago, or what you say about her now?He has contradicted every single attack he s made on the Clintons. You can find sound to contradict it. It doesn t touch him. Todd also encouraged Hillary to start fighting back against Trump s attacks, and to leverage Trump s own mistakes to destroy his chances of getting the White House. I think he s counting on this, that the Clintons don t want to engage him on this. So he thinks he s got free rein to do it.If (Hillary Clinton) can make the case that, you know what, he s just like every other politician. That is the most dangerous description you can have if you re Donald Trump   it just hasn t taken hold. You can watch Todd take down Trump below:Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Stephen King And Hundreds Of Other Writers Pen Open Letter Rejecting Donald Trump,"The keepers of the written word in America are so abhorred by the prospect of Donald Trump becoming president that they penned a letter to the country declaring their opposition.Hundreds of writers and authors, many of whom are world renowned, wrote and signed a letter listing the many reasons why they refuse to support the presumptive Republican nominee.Among those who signed the letter include horror author Stephen King, author of The Joy Luck Club Amy Tan, and novelist Daniel Handler, better known to audiences as Lemony Snicket.The letter condemns Trump for abusing language to advocate for violence, bigotry, sexism, and division all in the pursuit of power, which the authors point out has created many a dictatorship. They also declare that wealth and celebrity do not qualify anyone to speak for all Americans, much less lead the military.And in a final flourish, the writers declare that they  unequivocally  oppose Trump s candidacy as a  matter of conscience. Here s the full letter via Lit Hub.Because, as writers, we are particularly aware of the many ways that language can be abused in the name of power;Because we believe that any democracy worthy of the name rests on pluralism, welcomes principled disagreement, and achieves consensus through reasoned debate;Because American history, despite periods of nativism and bigotry, has from the first been a grand experiment in bringing people of different backgrounds together, not pitting them against one another;Because the history of dictatorship is the history of manipulation and division, demagoguery and lies;Because the search for justice is predicated on a respect for the truth;Because we believe that knowledge, experience, flexibility, and historical awareness are indispensable in a leader;Because neither wealth nor celebrity qualifies anyone to speak for the United States, to lead its military, to maintain its alliances, or to represent its people;Because the rise of a political candidate who deliberately appeals to the basest and most violent elements in society, who encourages aggression among his followers, shouts down opponents, intimidates dissenters, and denigrates women and minorities, demands, from each of us, an immediate and forceful response;For all these reasons, we, the undersigned, as a matter of conscience, oppose, unequivocally, the candidacy of Donald J. Trump for the Presidency of the United States.450 writers and authors signed the letter. And a petition has been included so that other Americans can their own names in opposition to Trump.You can add your name by clicking here.What began as a joke has grown to become a threat to our nation and our democratic values. Donald Trump is a disgrace who never should have been allowed to get this far. But he has by appealing to the worst that the conservative base has to offer, including racist white supremacists, misogynists, and gullible evangelicals who think Trump is the new Jesus.As the authors wrote, this is not the time to stay at home while the rest of the country votes. This is the time for  an immediate and forceful response  that makes it clear that any political party who puts the country in this kind of danger will be deprived of capturing political power. That means we all need to use our right to vote while we still have it and overwhelmingly reject Trump and Republicans in November.Featured Image: Getty/Isaac Brekken",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama’s Approval Rating Hits Three Year High – Here’s Why That Matters,"Rasmussen Polling wrote a commentary last year outlining ten factors that will determine who the next president will be. Among those was, of course, the candidates themselves and their rung mates, the state of the economy, the ongoing culture wars, and how vigorously the candidates fight in swing states. But one factor, which seems to have an influential and historical trend in elections, is the current president s approval rating. As Rasmussen found:Postwar history suggests that when a president has weak approval, his party pays a price in the next election. Harry Truman (1952), Lyndon Johnson (1968), Gerald Ford (1976), Jimmy Carter (1980), George H.W. Bush (1992), and George W. Bush (2008) all had mediocre-to-poor approval ratings, and the opposing party won all of those elections (defeating incumbents Ford, Carter, and H.W. Bush, and winning open-seat races in the others).When President Obama was elected in November 2008, George W. Bush s approval rating was a dismal 19 percent. In July 1992, when George H.W Bush was campaigning against Bill Clinton, his approval rating fell to a record low 29 percent.Well if this is a precedential factor that helps determine who the president will be, Democrats should be breathing a sigh of relief.A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows President Obama s approval rating is 51 percent, while his disapproval rating is 46 percent. The last time President Obama had the majority of approval from the country (in this poll), was during his second inauguration in January 2013.The numbers, NBC shows, could be beneficial to Hillary Clinton:The president s relative political strength could be a significant boon for Hillary Clinton, whose 2016 candidacy is largely focused on preserving key aspects of his Democratic policy-making.The poll shows that Clinton, despite her own high negative ratings as an individual candidate, could enjoy some other structural advantages as well in the 2016 contestAstoundingly, 54 percent of Independents (remember, President Obama lost Independents in 2012) approve of the job he s doing.That s good news for Democrats, who are relying on a large turnout of Independent voters to counter Donald Trump s right-wing populism.Similarly, Gallup Polling shows the president s approval rating stands at 52 percent, up two points from the previous week. The last time President Obama had an approval rating of 52 percent (according to their polling), was in February 2013.This is good news for Democrats. Clinton, who is well on the way of becoming the nominee, has made continuing the Obama legacy a staple in her campaign. That resounds well with Democrats and apparently should with Independents.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"May 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 How John Oliver And A Cat Created An International Incident (VIDEO),"Since John Oliver left the Daily Show to take a spot on HBO, his is one of the few satirical news shows to regularly follow international news. As it turns out, dictators don t generally respond well to satire and Oliver has found himself in a bit of a brush up with the Kremlin-backed ruler of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov   all over a lost cat.In a segment on HBO s Last Week Tonight, Oliver ridiculed the friend of Putin after Kadyrov took to Instagram to ask the world to help find his cat, which he called a  toyger,  which as you might guess, is a cat that has been bred to look like a tiger cub.         .          .      ,            .          -   .      ,    -   ,              ,        ,        .          .  ,      -       .        ,      .  ,              .            ,    -   .      ???????? #  #  #  #  # A photo posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95) on May 16, 2016 at 4:29am PDTUnfortunately, without the help of unreliable translation software, we don t know exactly what the post says, but he did ask for help and he did say that  we have begun to seriously worry,  asking people who have seen the cat to get in touch.Now, Kadyrov is not a nice person, despite his apparent love of cats, so Oliver couldn t leave it alone. Not only did he release the video, but Oliver trolled the leader on Twitter.Here s the video:And this: .@RKadyrov Is this your cat? pic.twitter.com/2UacV3km7J  John Oliver (@iamjohnoliver) May 23, 2016Featured image via Twitter. Kadyrov was not happy. Apparently, he follows American social media as carefully as the equally thin-skinned Donald Trump. He once again took to Instagram to mock Oliver, this time in English, although the text reads like he ran it through one of those terrible translation programs.Recently my  tiger cat  has left the house. It happens in spring from time to time. He also needs to meet with friends, mingle and share news. By cat rumors he has in our district a familiar she-cat with which he s going to start a family. I m sure that after spring affairs, the cat will return to native walls. Perhaps, he ll bring his sweet love with him. I got used to share with my friends in Instagram with all news, including cat issues. And this time I didn t want to leave as a secret the cat s adventures. I receive lots of photos. Some people say that they saw the cat in Vladivostok, Japan, Iceland, New Zealand, and even in the Oval Office of the White House! I am grateful to all, but this is NOT my cat. It became known that even the American TV channel  HBO  joined to search. The anchorman comedian   John Oliver asks millions of viewers to look for a cat. I knew long ago that in the USA unevenly breathe to my younger friends. One day horses aren t allowed to jump, the other   a cat is a real star of a show. Oliver laments a fact that we put on t-shirts with a photo of the President of Russia   Vladimir Putin. Yes, millions of people rejoice t-shirts with the image of the national leader. For this purpose, there is a good motivation. Vladimir Vladimirovich is a wise, courageous, resolute Head, who managed to withstand unfriendly campaign, which is conducted by the USA and its assistants. Thanks to Putin, we have crushed terrorists among whom there were also citizens of the USA, and European citizens. The country directed by Obama under the guise of peacekeeping operations spark new wars and bloody internal conflicts, in which die millions of people. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria  That s why there is nothing surprising that Oliver also got a wish to appear publicly in a T-shirt with an image of Putin, but not Obama. #Kadyrov #Russia #Chechnya #USA #HBO #Oliver #findkadyrovscat #Ihavenotseenyourcat #IHAVESEENYOURCATA photo posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95) on May 23, 2016 at 11:41am PDTThis would all be funny, and well, it actually is, but Kadyrov is one of the most notorious human rights abusers in the world and if he has his way, he ll have a lot more influence in the coming months and years. At just 39, the anti-Muslim activist is looking for a position to be made for him in the Kremlin.Critics accuse the leader of kidnapping, torture, torching of homes and other human rights abuses. According to Human Rights Watch, Kadyrov shuts down all critics in Chechnya and now he s trying to shut one down in the United States. Kadyrov is also a strong admirer of Russian strong-man dictator, Vladimir Putin.He said it was no surprise that he liked to wear Putin T-shirts, and that  millions of people rejoice t-shirts with the image of the national leader . This, said Kadyrov, was because Putin is a  wise, courageous, resolute Head, who managed to withstand unfriendly campaign, which is conducted by the USA and its assistants .Source: The GuardianAs for the cat, well, he s apparently okay. He s apparently just a Catanova. By cat rumors he has in our district a familiar she-cat with which he s going to start a family. I m sure that after spring affairs, the cat will return to native walls. Perhaps, he ll bring his sweet love with him,  Kadyrov wrote.For now, though, perhaps Oliver should have his food tested for polonium-210. Kidding.

 Republicans Sabotage Obamacare So They Can Claim It Doesn’t Work,"Did your Obamacare premiums go up this year? Blame Republicans.In their effort to destroy President Obama s signature legislative achievement, Republicans voted to repeal the law a bazillion times since taking over the House. They ve also filed lawsuit after lawsuit hoping that a federal court will see things their way and strike it down.However, both efforts have failed miserably as the Supreme Court has ruled against Republicans in two major cases. Plus President Obama would simply veto any repeal bill should it reach his desk.Republicans desperately want to use Obamacare as a campaign talking point this year. The only problem is that Obamacare is turning out to be a successful healthcare program that is becoming as ingrained in our society as Medicare and Medicaid as more and more Americans sign up and get health insurance.According to the Washington Post, more than 11.3 million Americans have signed up for Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act.Furthermore, CNBC reports that  fewer than 1 in 10 Americans lacked health insurance in 2015, the first time ever in the nation s history that the uninsured rate has fallen so low, and a clear sign of Obamacare s impact. It s a stunning victory for a program that has only been in full effect since 2014. Much of that success is due to the Medicaid expansion part of the law, which means even less people would be uninsured if Republican-controlled states had not refused to expand Medicaid for their own citizens.Obamacare has also created jobs despite Republican doomsday predictions.All of these successes not only makes Obamacare more popular, they make it harder for Republicans to repeal it without suffering major consequences on Election Day.That s why Republicans have devised an underhanded new strategy in their continuing obsession to kill Obamacare.Talking Points Memo reports:In late 2014, Republicans inserted a provision in budget omnibus legislation that tinkered with what s known as the risk corridors program, which buoys insurers who spend more money than they planned for on covering populations that are sicker than anticipated.The provision resurfaced in the political discourse last fall when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) took it on a victory tour during his presidential campaign, bragging that he stopped a health insurance  bailout.  The legislation did not so much end the program as screw up the mechanism by which money can be carved out to fund it. The risk corridors can now only be funded by transferring profits from insurers whose populations cost them less than expected, and the government can no longer pull from savings elsewhere in the law to make up the difference.Washington and Lee University School of Law health law expert Timothy Jost explained to TPM that while the tweak isn t near enough to destroy the law, it has caused  significant problems,  and is a  major factor contributing to premium increases this year. Basically, Republicans are deliberately making minor tweaks to Obamacare mechanisms so that certain parts of the program become weaker than they were originally. New reports then come out showing that premiums went up. Then Republicans use those new reports to brag about how Obamacare is broken even though they were the ones who broke it in the first place.So if you discover that your healthcare premiums have risen this year, you can blame Republicans for that and you can make sure they never screw with your healthcare again by punishing them at the voting booth this November.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Donald Trump Campaign Is Getting Out The Vote – For Democrats,"Now that Donald Trump has more or less sealed the Republican nomination, Democrats see a very real possibility that he could be president and that is scaring people to death. Thanks to Trump, last minute Democratic voter registrations in California are up   way up.In the first three months of the year, California added 1.5 million new voters through the end of April   double the number of new voters added during the same time period in 2012. And the total number of registered Democrats increased by nearly 100,000 people between the beginning of January and the beginning of April   compared to a gain of just 15,000 registered Republicans, according to an analysis from Political Data Inc., a California-based voting analytics firm. What s interesting is that the upticks have been greatest among Democrats and Latinos on those days where Donald Trump is kind of dominating the conversation,  said Mitchell, a former Democratic consultant who has analyzed California voter registration from day to day and by party affiliation since January.Source: PoliticoOf course, this is bluer than blue California. Trump won t win the Golden State, but the state is heavily Latino, and that could mean a lot for the general election in November. In fact, it reflects a pattern that s been happening throughout the primaries.While Republican turnout is at an all time high, Democrats have been almost as busy:Turnout has nearly been just as intense on the Democratic side, where 11.7 percent of eligible voters have cast their ballots, the highest percentage since 1992 other than the year Barack Obama was first elected president in 2008.Several media outlets have recently reported large swaths of legal Hispanic citizens are registering to vote in swing states across the country with the express purpose of casting their ballots against the unapologetic Trump. The outspoken New York real estate magnate launched his campaign by deriding Mexican immigrants as killers and rapists. We ve seen more people this year that want to become citizens and specifically because they want to vote against Trump,  said Mi Familia Vota executive director Ben Monterroso, whose group is among those leading a nationwide effort aimed at getting more Latinos to the polls.Source: Latin PostThe Latino vote represents more than 1/6 of the entire voting populace. Latinos are also the fastest growing demographic in the country. Even before Trump called all Mexicans  rapists  or blathered on about his  big, beautiful wall,  that he would have Mexico pay for, the Republican Party has been on the losing end of the electoral sea change. The last time a Republican wont the majority of the Latino vote was in 2004, and that was George W. Bush, who spoke Span(gl)ish and said he d prioritize comprehensive immigration reform. Yes, George W. Bush was a disastrous president, but his immigration stance was still much better than Trump s.The reality is, that without the Latino vote (yes, he did win the Latino vote in Nevada, but only the very small Republican Latino vote. The vast majority of Nevada Latinos are Democrats), Trump has a very tough road ahead of him: There is no president that can get the White House without having the Latino vote,  Mr. Monterroso told the Latin Post.  You have key states that without the Latino support, the candidate is not going to win, and if those key states don t vote for the president   they re not going to make it. The data backs him up. By most political scientists  estimates, the eventual Republican nominee needs between 40 and 47 percent of the Latino vote to win in a general election.Still, there is a chance Trump could find an issue that appeals to enough Latinos that he could siphon off a few votes from the Democratic nominee. It s doubtful he ll win the Latino vote anywhere, but he doesn t have to win it. He needs about 40 percent of the Latino vote. Is that possible? Well, Romney received 23 percent in 2012 and he wasn t anywhere near as divisive. If California, and the primary so far, are any indication, things look good for the Democratic nominee, assuming the party isn t too divided.Featured image via David McNew at Getty Images.

 BREAKING: DOJ To Seek Death Penalty For Charleston Church Shooter,"Almost a year ago, a deranged white supremacist went into an historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina and killed nine people, including the pastor who was also a state senator. To make things worse, the gunman, Dylann Roof, sat with the parishioners at their Wednesday night Bible study and worshipped with them after they welcomed him into their midst. Then, he went on a bloody massacre after expressing that racist hatred was the reason for his carrying out the crime.Now, nearly a year later, federal prosecutors are looking to seek the death penalty against Roof for his deadly rampage. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that her review of Roof s crimes was  rigorous  before she made the decision to attempt to have him executed. Lynch went on to say that  the nature of the alleged crime and the resulting harm compelled this decision. Authorities say that the following factors make the case eligible for the ultimate punishment:The victims  families were informed of the decision to move forward with the death penalty on the federal charges via a conference call. Steve Schmutz, who is the legal representative of three of those families, says of the decision: The families will support this decision. Really, I think the families have mixed emotions about the death penalty. But if it s ever going to be given, this case certainly calls for it. He is right, of course. Prior to going on his killing spree, Roof wrote a long, hate-filled, rambling manifesto that is arguably one of the most hateful documents ever posted on the internet. There s no doubt in anyone s mind as to what he did and why.Now, personally, I am usually 100% against the death penalty. State sanctioned killing is barbaric, and there have been too many botched executions to truly support it here. Murdering a murderer makes us no better than he is, especially if it is done in an inhumane and torturous way. However, if anyone deserves it, it is this piece of shit. This guy literally murdered people due to the color of their skin, and no other reason. Further, he picked the historic Emanuel AME Church so that he could  magnify the societal impact  of his horrific crime. He knew the history of Charleston with regards to the freeing of slaves and the liberation of Black people, and he knew the history of that church.This one is difficult for me. As a liberal, I don t support the death penalty. But, as a Black woman living in South Carolina, I know the level of racism present here. This is one time I really can t say that Loretta Lynch or anyone else is wrong.Rot in hell, Dylann Roof. It s definitely where you belong.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,"May 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Young Republicans Chairwoman Resigns Over Trump – Here’s The AMAZING Reason Why (IMAGES),"As Donald Trump looks like he s going to be leading the Republican Party in the general election, many conservatives are either jumping ship entirely, or at least voicing their disapproval in various ways. For Katrina Jorgenson, the communications chairwoman of the Young Republicans National Federation, this meant resigning from her position and writing a lengthy Facebook post about why she would never support The Donald.Jorgenson posted the message on Monday afternoon, stating that because  her principles would not allow  her to get behind Trump s divisive, vulgar rhetoric, she was announcing her resignation. In the post, she shamed those who supported Trump, and made it clear that this was a major step backwards for the future of the GOP. She wrote: Regretfully, I am resigning from my position as Communications Chair with the YRNF. With the practically fulfilled nomination of Donald Trump as our presidential candidate, I can no longer continue to carry out the duties of this position. My principles will not allow it. We have been told for years how we are the future of the party, this is our opportunity to seize that future. But if we have instead decided to uphold a man who does not represent us or our views  I cannot participate in that. Jorgenson didn t hold back   she called the business mogul a  hateful fascist  and called him out on his forever growing list of controversies. Jorgenson also expressed bitterness that Trump s rise had forced Republicans to compromise their beliefs and principles. In doing so, she criticized other conservatives for supporting a candidate that was going to destroy the entire Republican Party, and most likely the country if he gets into the White House. In denouncing the presumptive Republican nominee, Jorgenson stated that there was absolutely no way that she could continue her role in the Young Republicans National Federation and still maintain her dignity, knowing full well that she was going against her values: Many of you may choose to support Trump in order to beat Hillary Clinton, that is your decision. For me, I cannot support a candidate who endorses bigotry and lawlessness, with a minimal understanding of the fiscal policies long associated with our party, even if he does have an  R  after his name. I could not later tell my children I did the right thing, instead I would have to live with allowing my politics to be corrupted. I cannot stand by and continue to write newsletters and posts that so strongly conflict with my personal values. I will not surrender my beliefs.This is not the way forward. I will not quietly fall in line. I will not give up my principles. You can read her entire post here, which immediately received praise from like-minded viewers. Many other #NeverTrumpers were more than happy to back Jorgenson s decision up, telling her that she had done the right thing:FacebookFacebookFacebookFacebookTrump has divided the Republican Party in a major way, and it will likely never be the same again. And now that the GOP has allowed such a divisive fear mongering idiot to lead their party, Trump is threatening to divide and destroy America the same way.Featured image via Katrina Jorgensen Facebook",News,"May 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bigot Christians Make A HILARIOUSLY AWFUL Anti-Trans Music Video To Boycott Target (VIDEO),"Ever since Target decided to stand up to transphobic bigots and allow transgender individuals to use the restrooms that matched their gender identity, the retail chain has come under attack by thousands of anti-gay activists.Protesters have started to visit the stores with no other goal than to shout anti-trans hate speech, and many are threatening to boycott the store. Now, Target has come under fire from another hate group   Faith2Action, a Christian group that describes itself as a  pro-active launching pad for the pro-family movement,  which has recently made a ridiculously pathetic music video called  Don t Target Our Daughters .The music video is a fear mongering piece of work, in which the horrific audio features a singer spewing lyrics such as, No matter how long it s shouted, sin is not a civil right. And calling evil good will never make it right.  The video also shows a Target card being cut up, a little girl being attacked in a bathroom stall, and an invitation for viewers to help Janet Porter (the bigot who made this video) boycott the store in an event scheduled for June 4th.The video is so terrible, it s honestly hard to sit through the entire thing. It wasn t long before Facebook users ripped the video to shreds. One commenter wrote: Any plans to protest our Tea Party legislature in Tennessee for not expanding health insurance to thousands and thousands of children? Surely, child poverty and health is a big issue with you, right? One woman pointed out a fact that has been overlooked by the video s creators, remarking that despite what these bigots would like to have people believe, there have literally been ZERO instances in which a transgender person has assaulted anyone. She said: Your daughters have been sharing the restrooms with transgender women their whole lives. They are in no danger by continuing to do so. A transgender woman, however, will be in danger if they must use the men s room. Another commenter had a genius solution for anyone bothered by transgender people having the freedom to live their lives as they please: I have an earth-shattering idea. Perhaps you all can simply mind your own business and just shop elsewhere?

 Crowd On ‘The View’ Goes Wild When Bernie Calls Trump Exactly What He Is (VIDEO),"While speaking with the ladies from The View via satellite from Anaheim, CA, where he s been campaigning, Bernie Sanders was asked about Donald Trump and how Trump has been  hammering the Clintons.  He was asked if it s fair to go after Hillary Clinton for what her husband  may or may not have done. Bernie immediately said it is not okay, and then goes on to tell the truth about Donald Trump.He flat-out calls Trump a  demagogue  and a  bigot,  which got audible loud cheers from the studio audience in attendance.Bernie also added: He has nothing to say about the important issues facing our country. He also made clear that Trump cannot be President of the United States.When pressed about the fact that some of his supporters have said they would vote for Trump over Hillary if he doesn t get the Democratic nomination, Bernie said not to believe the polls this early on.

 This Gay Couple’s Trolling Of A Neo-Nazi Rally Is Nothing Short Of PERFECT (VIDEO),"Racists, homophobes, misogynists and other bigots are out in droves these days   and not just in America. Case in point   a rally held by Neo-Nazis in Madrid, Spain, where the hateful group was protesting immigrants. However, a gay couple there gave these idiots a real run for their money, by choosing to hold an impromptu make out session right in front the moronic haters who chose to refer to them as  faggots,   queers,  and   AIDS patients.  It seems that just the sight of the two men holding hands in public was too much for the Neo-Nazis to bear, so the couple decided to give them even more to complain about.David Fernandez and Gregor Eistert were simply out and about like any other couple, having a good time and minding their own business, but their very existence sparked a firestorm of hate from the group. Their actions were brave beyond belief, as we all know how violent hate group members can be. Fernandez says of the encounter: I was filled with rage when I heard what they said. So, I took Gregor and began to kiss him. It was great. I then remember hearing screams and insults about being gay. Unfortunately, it seems that the local police were more concerned with the delicate sensibilities of hate group members than they were with the safety of these two men, though, because they asked them to stop kissing, which is nothing short of shameful.Still, though, good on David and Gregor. They really stepped up to show these awful people what they think of their hate.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative Heads EXPLODE After Obama Appoints Transgender Woman To Faith-Based Council (SCREENSHOTS),"President Barack Obama made history when he appointed a Christian Air Force veteran to the President s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Since conservatives love our troops, this is a move that they widely celebrat oh, wait   they have a problem with it.Satin is quite successful; she served as a member of the United Church of Christ s executive council with great success. In fact, she is the first openly transgender member of the UCC executive council, and was involved in the church s decision to include transgender individuals in the ministry of the church. Of course, her successes are the reason conservatives hate her. The White House notes that:Barbara Satin is the Assistant Faith Work Director for the National LGBTQ Task Force.  She is an active member of the United Church of Christ and served on the denomination s Executive Council as its first openly transgender member.  Ms. Satin recently worked on the development of Spirit on Lake, a LGBTQ senior housing project in Minneapolis.  She served on the Board of Directors for OutFront Minnesota from 2001 to 2008 and has served as Chair of GLBT Generations since 1999.  She has also served on the Board of Directors of PFund Foundation, a regional LGBTQ community foundation advancing social justice in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, since 2013. Given the current political climate, I believe it s important that a voice of faith representing the transgender and gender non-conforming community   as well as a person of my years, nearly 82   be present and heard in these vital conversations,  Satin said in a statement after the President selected her for her new position.The mission of the President s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, which  brings together leaders and experts in fields related to the work of faith-based and neighborhood organizations in order to make recommendations to the Administration on how to improve the partnerships it forms to serve people in need,  is quite admirable.But conservatives just can t get past that whole  transgender  thing. In the comment section of The Blaze, our frenemies on the Right really let their hatred flow. Some complained that Obama appointed a  dude  (the only time in their lives in which they were angry about a white man being appointed to an important position),                Satin is a good woman who served her country honorably in the military and continues to do so.

 WATCH: Samantha Bee Skewers Evangelicals For Obsessing Over Abortion,"Full Frontal host Samantha Bee returned on Monday to continue mocking evangelical conservative  Christians  and their sordid history.This time, Bee focused on the  Moral Majority s  obsession with abortion and controlling women s bodies.When the show kicked off, Bee introduced the next part of her examination of the history of the evangelical movement. Last week, we took a look at the religious right   those coveted evangelical voters that conservatives spent decades pandering to only to be dumped just before November prom for a heretical billionaire bully who only says the word  God  when he is ejaculating on a pile of money,  Bee said.Bee then explained how evangelicals were not obsessed with abortion when the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that a woman s right to choose an abortion is protected by the Constitution in the landmark Roe v. Wade case in 1973 because the decision was supported by the Southern Baptist Convention at the time. It wasn t until later on that conservatives decided to politicize the issue.Bee went on to introduce one of the founders of the  pro-life  movement.Filmmaker Frank Schaeffer not only admitted to helping found the movement, he said he regrets it. One of the things that I did back in the day when I was young was help found, start, begin what became known as the  pro-life movement,  Schaeffer said.  It is the single greatest regret of my life. We made a film series called  Whatever Happened to the Human Race  featuring my dad   Francis Schaeffer   and Dr. C. Everett Coop. Bee then played part of the series, which looks like a horror film. Another clip featured a Schoolhouse Rock vibe but the cartoon was equally horrible.According to Schaeffer: Most evangelical leaders didn t want anything to do with it. They wanted to just preach Jesus. They thought politics was dirty. They didn t want anything to do with it. We had to talk them into it. And so, evangelicals began their hostile takeover of the Republican Party and proceeded to prove their  pro-life  credentials by committing 185 arsons, 42 bombings, 100 acid attacks, 26 attempted murders, and 11 murders against clinics between 1977 and 2015.Bee even noted where Republicans got the idea for their war on women by showing a Little Rascals short featuring Spanky founding the He-Man Woman Haters Club. Spanky then raises his arms and Bee stops the clip and shows an image of Trump raising his arms the same way.Then Bee put on the finishing touches by showing video of one of the thousands of annoying anti-abortion nuts screaming outside of a clinic about how the Bible is against abortion. Fine,  Bee said.  Let s look at everything the Bible says about abortion. Oh, look! There it is in the book of doesn t exist. Here s the video via YouTube.Samantha Bee should continue this series on the history of the religious right because she is doing a fantastic job of shining a light on them.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Olivia Wilde Knows Just How Racist Trump Supporters Really Are, And She’s EXACTLY Right (TWEET)","If you ve ever been on Twitter then you know that with how great it is to get and receive information and updates as they happen, with the good comes the bad. The very, very bad.One person who has recently encountered some of the bad is actress and activist Olivia Wilde. She s a huge supporter of equal rights for women and minorities, and stands up frequently against police brutality. However, she recently learned a pretty harsh truth about some of her Twitter followers.First, Wilde tweeted out how important it is to stop Donald Trump and make sure more women get into office:WOMEN CAN STOP TRUMP. Watch this VIDEO & join our movement to elect women! @emilyslist @lauradawnANW @sarahsophief https://t.co/b1boVnfOEX  olivia wilde (@oliviawilde) May 23, 2016She also tweeted her reaction when learning one of the officers involved in the death of Freddie Gray was not being held accountable at all:Until the police are held accountable for violent crimes, we have no chance at peace in this country. #FreddieGray  olivia wilde (@oliviawilde) May 23, 2016However, as anyone knows who frequents Twitter just even a little bit, if you tweet out something against Trump or against police brutality against people of color, you re going to get a deluge of racist replies, and probably a good dose of misogyny as well.After receiving several replies that were pretty awful and offensive, Wilde then tweeted out: You never know how many racists follow you until you post something about police brutality. Or Trump. You never know how many racists follow you until you post something about police brutality. Or Trump.  olivia wilde (@oliviawilde) May 23, 2016And while not all Trump supporters are racist, if you re racist, you re probably supporting Trump. That s a pretty safe bet.

 Trump Backs Conspiracy Theory That Says Hillary Clinton Murdered Vince Foster,"The general election hasn t even truly begun and already Donald Trump has reached a level of mudslinging previous candidates would have been horrified by. Having already dealt an astoundingly underhanded blow to former opponent Ted Cruz by suggesting Cruz s father was involved in the Kennedy assassination, Trump has turned his gold-plated bullshit spewer in the direction of the Clintons.On May 23, Trump gave weight to the conservative conspiracy theory surrounding the death of former White House aide Vince Foster. To the surprise of nobody, Trump put a lot of stock in the idea that Bill and Hillary Clinton murdered White House counsel Foster in 1993 as part of a cover up. The Washington Post, apparently having quite literally having nothing better to do, dutifully reported Trump s comments as if they were genuine criticisms and not, as one might hope, the ravings of a lunatic.He called theories of possible foul play  very serious  and the circumstances of Foster s death  very fishy. He had intimate knowledge of what was going on,  Trump said, speaking of Foster s relationship with the Clintons at the time.  He knew everything that was going on and then all of a sudden he committed suicide. The title of the piece could have been  Trump full of shit , instead it was  Trump escalates attacks on Bill Clinton.  Because when it comes to a theory wrenched from the lowest dregs of the right-wing internet, we gotta hear both sides.Hilariously, seconds after bringing up Foster s death and describing it as  very fishy  Trump claimed he wasn t going to weigh in on what he just weighed in on.  I don t bring up [the Foster case],  he lied,  because I don t know enough to really discuss it  I don t do that because I don t think it s fair. Again, we catch a glimpse of just how nasty Trump s campaign is going to be towards Clinton. He s unable to run on policy (Trump doesn t have any), experience (Trump doesn t have any), or integrity (Trump doesn t have any). He s also unable to point to Obama s presidency due to the inconvenience of it being extremely popular. Instead, cheap shots, conspiracies, and outrageous lies are the only weapons in his arsenal and he clearly plans to use them relentlessly.For what it is worth, there is absolutely no evidence that the Clintons were involved in Vince Foster s death. In a Snopes post titled  The Clinton Body Count  (who said Snopes didn t have a sense of humor?), fact checkers find roughly zero evidence that the Clinton administration killed Foster or anyone else to cover up damning scandals. According to multiple investigations, Foster sadly took his own life following a harassment campaign partly led by right-wing news outlets like the Wall Street Journal and a political scandal.White House deputy counsel Vince Foster committed suicide on the night of 20 July 1993 by shooting himself once in the head, a day after he contacted his doctor about his depression. A note in the form of a draft resignation letter was found in the bottom of his briefcase a week after his death. (Note that this letter was not, as is often claimed, a  suicide note ; it was Foster s outline for a letter of resignation.) Foster cited negative Wall Street Journal editorials about him, as well as the much-criticized role of the counsel s office in the controversial firing of seven White House travel office workers.Donald Trump, who freely admits that he doesn t know anything about the case, finds that evidence he has heard (from right-wing blogs)  fishy    which makes him either a lying smear merchant or a complete and utter moron.

 WATCH: This US Marine Veteran Went To Trump Tower To Warn The World About The ‘Fraud’ Inside (VIDEO),"Alexander McCoy, a veteran of the U.S. Marines, helped led a protest outside Donald Trump s Trump Tower on Monday. The event was organized to shame Trump after recent reports revealed that he lied when he said he had raised $6 million to support veterans earlier in the year.In the video, McCoy explained that the episode shows that Trump  has not shown any honor in his actions or his policies.  He added,  he would make a reckless and dangerous commander-in-chief, and as Americans we would be fundamentally less safe with Donald Trump as president.  McCoy also referred to Trump as a  fraud. The veterans assembled outside the New York City landmark to raise awareness of what Trump has done.Former Marine Alexander McCoy and Army veteran Perry O Brien, who led the demonstration, have repeatedly said that Trump overstated the amount of money he raised at a Jan. 28 fundraiser for veterans causes to inflate his reputation among Republicans. (Of) the $6 million that Donald Trump supposedly raised for veterans charities, a significant portion of that money either never existed or it just vanished,  O Brien, 34, who served in Afghanistan for over three years, told the Daily News as his fellow veterans and their supporters touted signs reading  Vets Vs Hate. Trump put on the so-called fundraiser on the night he chose to skip out on the Republican primary debate because he was afraid of tough questioning from Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly. Trump initially claimed the event had raised $6 million, and spent the next few days praising himself for the accomplishment, as part of the publicity drive for his campaign during the primaries.Subsequent reports showed that the money raised was about half that amount, according to the Daily News. Some veterans groups told the paper that they haven t received any of the money Trump promised in his first, extravagant claims.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Insider: This GOP Plan To Steal The Election Had Them So ‘Giddy’ They Were ‘Frothing At The Mouth’ (VIDEO),"Republicans plan to use laws about voter ID to win this fall s elections, since they know that in many states if all the voters who show up to vote are allowed to do so, their party will lose yet another presidential election   its third in a row.They are very excited at the effect those laws could have if left unchecked, according to an insider who is now speaking up.Last week, during the federal trial on Wisconsin s voter-ID law, a former Republican staffer testified that GOP senators were  giddy  about the idea that the state s 2011 voter-ID law might keep Democrats, particularly minorities in Milwaukee, from voting and help them win at the polls.  They were politically frothing at the mouth,  said the aide, Todd Allbaugh.Studies show that voter ID laws suppress minority votes, key to Democratic victory.A recent voter-ID study by political scientists at the University of California at San Diego analyzed turnout in elections between 2008 and 2012 and found  substantial drops in turnout for minorities under strict voter ID laws. These results suggest that by instituting strict photo ID laws, states could minimize the influence of voters on the left and could dramatically alter the political leaning of the electorate,  the study concluded.Watch this video of people getting assistance, trying to register to vote under the GOP s new harsh voter ID rules:Despite Republican claims otherwise, getting these IDs often requires documents   like birth certificates   that poorer minorities have trouble accessing.In one instance documented by the Washington Post, a man whose mother changed his name in 1964 has to present the original 52-year-old document changing his name before the state of Texas will issue him a voter ID card, which he needs to be able to vote.Seventeen states will have new voting restrictions in place for this fall s election for the first time. Many of the laws were passed by Republican-held state legislatures in 2009, right after Obama s historic victory in 2008.They apparently were afraid that if the voters were allowed to have their say, Republicans might not ever be contenders, so they rigged the system.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Most Disgusting Betrayal Of America (So Far) Is About To Be Exposed,"Donald Trump s mortgage company was part of the carnival of greed that preyed on the American people by providing subprime mortgages to unqualified borrowers, a practice which led to the financial collapse in 2008 and the Great Recession that followed.Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign is planning a major push to bring up Trump and his role in the business that led to billions in bailout costs for the American taxpayer.About a dozen surrogates and local elected officials in Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado, Nevada and elsewhere will host calls, events and release statements focused on Trump s response to the housing crisis that precipitated the economic recession.Trump wasn t just on the outside of the scheme. His company was right in the middle of it.Clinton s allies plan to highlight that Trump Mortgage approved subprime mortgages to unqualified borrowers. The mortgages were one of the key financial instruments linked to the crash.Trump even handed out advice on how to profit from a crash like the one that would eventually occur and consume millions of jobs in America and around the world. In his book, How to Build a Fortune, Trump said,  If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who will be part of the Clinton push, released a statement highlighting Trump and his role in the collapse: You don t make America great by rooting for its economy to fail. While Hillary Clinton was proposing measures to ease the effects of the housing bubble on American homeowners before the crisis, Donald Trump was cheering on the market s collapse and reportedly peddling sub-prime loans so he could try to get even richer. Once again showing that Trump s so-called business sense is more big talk and bravado than anything resembling actual insight, Trump launched a mortgage business in 2005, even as warning signs began to emerge that the mortgage industry was about to soon face trouble.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Supreme Court Gives A Big ‘F You’ To GOP, Rejects Racist Gerrymandering","The Supreme Court did something amazing on Monday. They decided, with a unanimous conscience, that the principle of  one person one vote  was the way to go in a Democratic Republic like the United States.Still reeling from the disastrous decision that struck down the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Republicans sought to double down on their assaults on voting rights through racist gerrymandering.Today, the Supreme Court gave Republicans a well-deserved  F-You  when they rejected the GOP s appeal to a lower Virginia court ruling that overturned the redistricted map.Sending the case back to the lower court, the Supreme Court basically said they got it right, and see no reason to consider an appeal, thus giving Democrats (and the people of Virginia) the fairness they deserved and were robbed of in 2012.Two years ago, a federal court struck down Virginia s newly drawn congressional maps because the drawers packed tens of thousands of black voters into an already heavily black, heavily Democratic congressional district. The redrawing, which heavily favored Republicans, allowed the GOP to win 8 out of the state s 11 congressional districts, even though President Obama won the state by three points and the electorate was down ticket.While it won t capture a majority of the 8 seats held by Republicans, the decision will certainly be turning the 4th Congressional District blue. Currently represented by Randy Forbes, the district will go from having a 48 percent Democratic electorate to a rightful 60 percent.With Democrats aiming to take back the House and keep the swing state of Virginia blue in November, this decision has come at a very good time.Looks like another gerrymandering, redistricting ploy from the Republicans to steal the elections has gone down in flames. Last year, the Supreme Court smacked down Republicans in Arizona when they tried to pull the same shenanigans. With Arizona s booming Hispanic and Latino populations, GOP control is on the verge of collapsing.Republicans want to hold onto absolute power, and they are seeing it slip away from them. So they try to cheat to win. And sometimes the Supreme Court does he right thing and blocks them from doing just that.Since it wasn t picked up, that means at least 5 Justices (out of eight) or more said no. If Scalia was still alive, I wonder if the case would have been picked up. And had it been picked up, how would the Court have decided it?Maybe Republicans shouldn t be so quick to turn down a moderate Merrick Garland confirmation. Not that he outcome would have been any different in their favor.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s New ‘Christian Policy’ Advisor ACTUALLY Thinks He Can Control The Weather (VIDEO),"Move over, Storm-From-X-Men! In addition to having gigantic hands (the most giganticestest in the world, no less!), a huge dong (you can see it from space), and a daughter he totally doesn t want to sleep with (or does he?), Donald Trump has managed to pick up a new ally: an old white dude who can control the weather!In his effort to pander to evangelicals, Trump has enlisted the aid of Frank Amedia, a televangelist who blames AIDS on  unnatural sex  who entered into a conspiracy to fix a court case for a friend in 2001. He s also able to control the weather through the power of Jesus, or something.Amedia, who now serves as the billionaire s liaison for Christian policy,  claims that he personally saved his daughter from disaster when an earthquake off the coast of Japan sent a tsunami to a Hawaiian island on which his precious little snowflake was staying. Thanks to the power of prayer and an ego large enough to think that an omnipotent being would even notice him, let alone do him a solid, Trump s  God guy  says he was able to talk his BFF into stopping the tsunami just off the shore of the island. I stood at the edge of my bed and I said,  In the name of Jesus, I declare that tsunami to stop now,  he says in a video in which he tells the tale of that time he and God went all  X-Men  on that storm.  And I specifically said,  I declare those waters to recede,  and I said,  Father, that is my child, I am your child, I m coming to you now and asking you to preserve her.  Apostle, it was seen by 400 people on a cliff. It was on YouTube, it was actually on the news that that tsunami stopped 200 feet off of shore. Even after having sucked the waters in, it churned and it went on and did devastation in the next island. Interestingly, he seems entirely unconcerned with the people who live on the next island over. Maybe there are limits to God s power and these  Christians  know better than to ask him to do more than save their own skins.Last December, a Texas woman also exhibited this strange weather control power. Sabrina Lowe of Rowlett says she saved her family s lives when she asked God to redirect a tornado to a neighboring town. Apparently, God listened. Lowe s family was spared, but the tornado went on to kill an additional eight people. While little is known about these rare superhuman powers, it seems that weather control thus far has a rather limited scope. Further study is needed.Watch Amedia talk about his weather control capabilities below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s New Pathetic Anti-Hillary Ad Frames Bill Clinton As A Rapist (VIDEO),"If there s anyone who shouldn t be pointing fingers at other men for the mistreatment of women, it s probably Donald Trump. Yet today, Trump completely ignored his grotesque track record with women, as well as his own rape allegations for the sake of a childish attack on his rival, Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton.In the complete absence of self-awareness, Trump posted an attack ad on Hillary today via Instagram, bringing to light past allegations of sexual assault against her husband, former president Bill Clinton. This isn t the first time Trump has attacked the Clintons this way, and they ve done a decent job defending themselves. But this time, Trump has taken things a step further by actually using recordings of the victims accusing Bill. As the ad comes to a close, Hillary is heard laughing while ominous music plays in the background.You can watch the attack ad below:Is Hillary really protecting women?A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 23, 2016 at 8:27am PDTAs Hillary has positioned herself as being a champion for women (as she was long before her presidential campaign began), Trump feels that his best shot at turning female voters away from the former Secretary of State is to highlight her husband s problematic sexual past.The interesting thing about this is that Trump himself has seemingly forgotten that he has also been accused of rape. In trying to smear the Clintons with this nasty ad, Trump has ironically and unintentionally made a case against himself. In the 1990s, Trump s first wife Ivana had accused the business mogul of brutally raping her while they were still married. Here s what Ivana said, which appeared in the Trump biography Lost Tycoon:Ivanka Trump statementAnd Trump s misogynistic attitudes toward women don t stop there. He s been accused of groping women, being super creepy when it comes to sexualizing his own daughter, has attacked numerous female celebrities, personalities and politicians   including Fox News  Megyn Kelly and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and said that women should be punished for seeking abortions. Not to mention, there is a never-ending list of every misogynistic, sexist thing Trump has said or done to women. So while Trump is trying to soil the Clintons  name, all he s really done is just put a spotlight on himself. There s a reason why almost 75% of American women don t like The Donald, but he seems to live in denial.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Don’t Buy The Media Hype: Democrats Are More United Now Than In 2008,"The Democratic Party has descended into madness. Democratic voters are split. The convention is going to be a disaster. Bernie Sanders may take his supporters and walk away, thus handing Trump the presidency.These are the headlines the mainstream media has been peddling now for months. As the omega primary creeps up (with California and New Jersey up for grabs), it s becoming evident that one candidate will walk away the nominee.This, of course, has incensed members of the opposite candidate   and naturally so. And of course the media has pounced on these feelings, and has ran nonstop coverage in an effort to tear the party apart.No matter how loud the pundits scream, and no matter how blistering the op-eds are, don t buy into the hype. Because there is one truth that the media doesn t want to report on:The Democratic Party is more united now than it was in 2008   and Obama won in a landslide. The one outlet that seems to have the guts to report on it is Vox, not surprisingly.In fact, what the mainstream media doesn t want to remind you is that in May 2008, 15 percent of Democrats overall said they wouldn t vote for Obama. Today, May 2016, only 6 percent of Democrats say they won t support Clinton.When Clinton dropped out in 2008, 40 percent of her supporters said they would not vote for then-candidate Barack Obama. Today, as it becomes increasingly likelier than Clinton will become the nominee, only 25 percent of Sanders supporters claim they will not support her candidacy should she win (a number that is shrinking).As Vox puts it,  Obama needed, in other words, to overcome a hurdle that was twice as big as the one facing Clinton. And they also noted:Last but by no means least, McCain was a broadly popular figure with considerable cross-party appeal. He wound up losing pretty badly in the end due to a very unfavorable economic situation and a campaign that saw him abandoning most of his crossover positions. But as of late May it really wasn t totally crazy to imagine a hawkish, domestically moderate white Democrat feeling that he had a lot in common with McCain, especially if there was a little covert racial bias in the mix.And for Democrats freaking out over Trump overcoming Clinton in a handful of polls, at this time in 2008 and 2012, McCain and Romney respectively overtook President Obama in the polls multiple times.The explanation for that is, presently, the Republican Party is more  united  now than the Democrats, considering they have one candidate while the Democrats have two still running.Bottom line: Democrats are smarter than the media conglomerates think, and they see firsthand the risk of a Trump presidency. They aren t going to blow it.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Republicans Want A Trump/Gingrich Ticket, Think Six Wives Will Appeal To Women","Apparently, the fact that 70 percent of women view Donald Trump unfavorably is making Republicans think that what he needs is a running mate who also treats women like shit.A top Republican consultant thinks Trump and former disgraced Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich would make the perfect political pair because their six wives combined means they  understand women  better than anyone else. I think Newt is lobbying to be the vice president, and I think their people are paying a lot of attention to him,  Ed Rollins told the National Review on Monday.  It d be a ticket with six former wives, kind of like a Henry VIII thing. They certainly understand women. Wow. Just wow.Republicans are facing an unprecedented opposition from female voters and their solution to fix that is to double down on the whole  let s nominate someone who disrespects women  idea.Donald Trump is on wife number three. And given his history, you can bank on him eventually seeking wife number four when Melania is no longer  a 10  in his eyes.He cheated on his first wife with the woman who became his second wife and was quick to start a relationship with the third Mrs. Trump during the separation.And that relationship history is probably why Trump is so keen to count Gingrich as one of his top allies.Let s not forget that Newt Gingrich also cheated on his first wife with his second wife and callously asked for a divorce while she was recovering from cancer surgery in the hospital. Then he cheated on his second wife with the woman who would become his current wife. In 1993, Gingrich began an affair with House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek and divorced his second wife after she refused to grant him the open marriage he wanted. Keep in mind, this hypocrisy unfolded as Gingrich and Republicans sought to impeach President Bill Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky.And so, Trump has included Gingrich on his short list of vice-presidential candidates and some Republicans are thrilled because they think their six marriages make them experts when it comes to women and that they ll somehow be able to make women flock to their campaign.Frankly, it s insulting.If Republicans really think this is their best strategy to persuade women to vote for the GOP in November they truly never understood women at all. Just the idea that being like Henry VIII, who had two of his wives executed, would make them somehow more appealing to women demonstrates perfectly just how terribly Republicans have treated women. They literally think emulating a womanizing 16th century English king is the best way to deal with women in the 21st century. If anything can make MORE women hate Trump and the GOP, this is it.Featured Image: Wikimedia ",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 O’Reilly Sues Ex-Wife He Allegedly Assaulted For $10 Million – For ‘Cheating’ After She Left Him,"Bill O Reilly is a real piece of work. On his show, he often passes judgment on those he believes aren t upholding what he considers  family values , while when not in front of a Fox News camera, his home life disintegrates around him.Recently, the host, who once accused Beyonce of singing  gangsta rap  that encouraged young girls to get pregnant, suffered a civil court deathblow when a panel of judges granted his ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy sole custody of the pair s two children   based partly on some of the disturbing statements from the children themselves. O Reilly s daughter once told investigators that fights between her parents could reach the point of violence thanks to O Reilly s legendary temper.[A] court-appointed forensic examiner testified at a closed hearing that O Reilly s daughter claimed to have witnessed her father dragging McPhilmy down a staircase by her neck, apparently unaware that the daughter was watching. The precise date of the alleged incident is unclear, but appears to have occurred before the couple separated in 2010. The same source indicated that the daughter, who is 16 years old, told the forensic examiner about the incident within the past year.O Reilly ongoing ugly separation with his former wife took another twist this week when O Reilly s lawyers announced that they would be pursuing a lawsuit against McPhilmy. Her  crime  was that she went on to have another relationship after she left O Reilly (but prior to their legal divorce). Or as O Reilly calls that: Fraud.Gawker notes:According to court documents filed late last month, however, O Reilly intends to sue McPhilmy for $10 million on charges of misleading him about the terms of their separation agreement. In the same papers, the Fox News host accuses McPhilmy of using the proceeds of their separation to underwrite an affair with another man. And he wants the entire lawsuit to proceed in secret.O Reilly claims that his separation agreement, which included financial compensation to McPhilmy should be invalid because she was in a relationship with another man. It s not entirely clear  why.  One theory is that this is really about control. O Reilly doesn t like the idea that his ex-wife gets to live her life out from under his thumb  especially if she got to keep some of his money in the divorce.That would fall in line with O Reilly s deeply troubling actions in the wake of his marriage woes. When he suspected his wife of having an affair in the first place, he used his political and financial power to try to persuade his local police department to harass the suspected interloper (who was a police detective on Long Island). The police department appears to have done O Reilly s bidding, ordering a bewildered internal affairs officer to mess with the detective in order to get him to stop dating O Reilly estranged wife. The police ordered [Internal Affairs detective] Harasym to meet with two private detectives working on behalf of Bill O Reilly. They had information about an NCPD officer they believed to be carrying on with O Reilly s wife. Delargy told Harasym to launch an investigation into the man and to tell him to end the relationship.Instead O Reilly lost his wife, his kids, and any claim he ever had to get to be sanctimonious in front of a camera. With nothing left to lose, O Reilly appears to want vengeance instead. It s hard to imagine a court will side with him, but it does present O Reilly the opportunity to once again make his ex-wife s life miserable. It may not be family values, but it s certainly O Reilly s values.Featured image via The Blaze",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Elizabeth Warren HILARIOUSLY Continues Battle With Trump, ROASTS Reputation With Women (VIDEO)","If you haven t heard about the ongoing battle between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren then you re clearly living under a rock, or possibly a newborn baby. They ve been going back and forth on Twitter, in speeches, and every time he tries to call her  goofy  or  Pocahontas  (because he s apparently five years old) she smacks him down harder and harder.During her commencement address at Suffolk University this past weekend, Warren went after him yet again.Taking a brilliant dig, because let s face it, she s brilliant, Warren said: How s this speech polling so far? Higher or lower than Donald Trump s unfavorable numbers with women? If you weren t aware, Trump isn t doing so well with women, polling at 70% unfavorable. But can we be all that surprised? He s very misogynistic, constantly calling women names, and him going after Warren and then Hillary Clinton for actually being a woman, is just another example of that.Something tells me Warren isn t about to let up any time soon. Trump can try his name-calling games, but when it comes to strong women who have had to fight twice as hard to get half as much recognition their whole lives, he s in for a big surprise. Those games may work on weak Republican men, but just you wait. Just. You.

 The Shocking Detail Trump Doesn’t Want You To Know About HIS MOTHER (VIDEO),"A rather interesting detail has emerged about Donald Trump s mother that is threatening to derail part of Trump s campaign that he s heavily relied on to win over America s most racist voters.According to a recent report released by The National, Trump s mother, Mary Anne Macleod, was actually a poor Scottish immigrant that came to the United States to make a better life for herself   a realization that stands in stark contrast to the story the business mogul has been telling.It shouldn t come as a shock that The Donald would hide the fact that his mother came to America with nothing but $50 in her purse. Why wouldn t he want people to know that his mother came to the country dirt poor and became a multi-millionaire philanthropist, other than the fact that he has slammed immigrants all throughout his presidential campaign? After all, his website says this: The influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high, and makes it difficult for poor and working-class Americans   including immigrants themselves and their children   to earn a middle-class wage. Nearly half of all immigrants and their US-born children currently live in or near poverty, including more than 60 per cent of Hispanic immigrants.Every year, we voluntarily admit another two million new immigrants, guest workers, refugees, and dependents, growing our existing all-time historic record population of 42 million immigrants.We need to control the admission of new low-earning workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities  rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream. The  low-earning worker  that Trump is trashing on his website is the very person his mother was when she left Scotland to come to America in 1930. Despite that he has his mother to thank for the opportunities he was given, Trump can still find it in himself to say foolish, hateful things like, We re building a wall. It s going to be a wall that is not   nobody s going through my wall. Trump builds walls. I build walls. The report by The National isn t the first time the fact that Trump is the son of an immigrant has threatened to ruin his hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric. Earlier this year, Trump s former GOP rival Ted Cruz called Trump out during a childish  birther  fight. Cruz said: The legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on, some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil. Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified, and interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified because Donald s mother was born in Scotland, You can watch that moment below:But before Cruz, Real Time s Bill Baher did an even more amazing job at highlighting the hypocrisy in Trump s immigration stance   and it goes much deeper than his own mother. Laying into the presumptive Republican nominee, Maher pointed out that two out of three of Trump s wives have been immigrants. Maher said: Nobody brings this up about Donald Trump, who is always on about,  We can t have foreigners coming into this country!  His first wife is from Czechoslovakia. His current wife is from Slovenia. So, if you think crawling under a wall is the most disgusting way to become an American, somewhere there is a Panamanian woman hiding in a truck full of chickens with ten pounds of heroin-filled condoms in her stomach who s thinking,  Well, at least I didn t have to blow Donald Trump.

" Planned Parenthood Evacuated In Florida, 7 Hospitalized After Unknown Substance Found In Clinic (VIDEO)","Planned Parenthood clinics have long been targets for right-wing  Christian  extremism and it looks like they may have struck again, this time in Florida.Sarasota Fire and Rescue responded to a call at the city s Planned Parenthood office Monday morning. Two Hazmat crews   one from Sarasota, the other from neighboring Manatee County   were called to the scene to investigate an unknown substance in the building. According to a spokesperson, 38 people were inside of the downtown clinic, seven of whom were taken to the hospital after experiencing shortness of breath. In addition to the evacuation of the clinic, a nearby school, the Sarasota School of Arts and Sciences, was put on lockdown.Image via video screenshotPlanned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida issued the following statement:At Planned Parenthood our top priority is the safety of our patients and staff. The situation at our Sarasota Health Center is still developing. All staff have been evacuated, with seven taken to the hospital to monitor their health. No patients were on site. We are grateful to emergency responders and law enforcement for their quick response.Here in Florida and across the country, Planned Parenthood has strong security measures in place, works closely with law enforcement agencies, and has a very strong safety record.We are looking into the cause of this issue and will keep you informed of our progress.At this time, nobody knows what made the people inside of the clinic sick, but with all of the right-wing hate focused on the organization it is easy to automatically assume the worst. Last year, a conservative pro-fetus organization doctored videos and accused Planned Parenthood of  selling baby parts.  Their lies led to the murders of three people at a Colorado Springs PP clinic. Christian terrorist Robert Dear shot and killed the three people and injured nine others. He claimed that he carried out the crimes in response to the doctored videos and claimed he was a  warrior for the babies.  In addition to the shooting, a number of clinics were the targets of arsonists.One thing is certain, in an age when Republican organizations use fear-mongering and lies to keep their base whipped up in a frenzy, nobody is safe. Their rhetoric is dangerous and we have seen the evidence of it too many times   hopefully, this isn t one of those cases.UPDATE: Hazmat is reporting that unknown, uncapped cleaning chemicals were found in a closet, as well as baby food in a stairwell.

" John Oliver Offers Harsh Critique Of Dem Primary, Tells Us Who Should Be Winning (VIDEO)","Is the primary process in the United States messed up? To be blunt   absolutely, and Last Week Tonight s John Oliver took Sunday night s show to highlight what makes the process so confusing and unbalanced, and what we can do to help fix it.As far as who should be winning the Democratic primary? This time around, it s the person who is winning the Democratic primary   Hillary Clinton.Offering up a history lesson was The Daily Beast: States used to not have primary races, but that all changed at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, when Hubert Humphrey received the nod despite failing to win a single primary or even be on the ballot prior to the convention. This, of course, resulted in a now-legendary riot at the convention that left CBS newsman Dan Rather roughed up by security guards on the floor. So that leaves us with the primaries and caucuses system one designed to give party leaders more say. So, the system is better, but far from perfect, and still leaves control of who gets the nomination in the hands of too few. As we vote in primaries, if you vote in the primary, you are telling the delegates who you want to represent you, but it is still ultimately in their hands.The Daily Beast also offers this regarding the now infamous superdelegates: For those unaware, superdelegates comprise about 15 percent of the 4,763 total delegates, and these superdelegates elected officials, former party presidents, and party bigwigs  are unpledged, and can vote for whatever delegate they want regardless of who won in their state or district. So, during his show, Oliver offers some pretty damned good analysis that should clear things up for people still upset about how things are turning out.Oliver states: Now for the record, Politifact looked into the charges of rigging in Nevada and found  no clear evidence the state party hijacked the process,  and you can disagree with that, as I m sure Bernie supporters will in the comments  section below this video alongside hurtful remarks about my personal appearance like,  Oh look, it s British Millhouse  But the larger point Politifact made regarding Nevada, that I think everyone can agree with, is that  the arcane party structures don t reflect how most people assume presidential selection works,  and that in itself is a huge problem. Any competition should have clear rules. You don t get to the end of a football game and say,  OK, who found the most eggs? He later added: Sanders supporters might argue that doesn t include all caucus votes, but when The Washington Post estimated the rest, they found that [Hillary] would still lead by 2.9 million votes, and even if you multiply all those estimated caucus votes by 7 to account for lower turnouts, even if you give Bernie a bonus of 10,000 extra votes in every state that s voted so far, and even if you tack on an extra 100,000 votes just for shits and giggles, she s still comfortably ahead. And if you re still really angry at the system, getting mad at the rules after you ve already entered the game isn t going to do you a whole heck of a lot of good. Does it suck? Sure. But it s what you signed up for.Oliver offers a solution that many should take very seriously, but it s going to require people actually staying involved in politics past a favorite candidate running for office. He said: Let s together pick a date early next year to actually write an email to the chair of each party and remind them politely to fix this. I propose February 2nd. Now, that will be easy to remember because it s Groundhog Day, which does seem appropriate because, unless this primary process is fixed, we are all destined to live through the same nightmare scenario over and over again until the end of fucking time. The primary process has been around for several decades now. It isn t new, and to get mad at it now is good, but you need to stay angry beyond the given moment of your candidate losing. Revolutions don t happen overnight. They happen over several years, and to truly enact change requires commitment. Commit to change. Make sure it happens. Push party leaders to put together a better process, and hopefully, over time, it will happen. But complaining about it every four years like it s something new won t do a damn thing.Kudos to you, John Oliver, for perfectly breaking it down.Watch the full segment here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Demi Lovato Takes A Stand For Trans Rights At #BBMAS And It Is GLORIOUS (TWEET),"Musicians tend to be very left leaning. Unless they re Ted Nugent, usually rock stars stand up for LGBT equality and other civil rights causes. That is just what superstar singer Demi Lovato did Sunday Night at the Billboard Music Awards.Awards are a very important musical event each year, and it s a great place to make a statement.Lovato took the stage to do her performance, and she wore a mesh top with pro-transgender bathroom symbol on it as part of her concert ensemble. She didn t have to say a word; that top showed the thousands of people in that audience and the millions of people at home where she stands on the issue of transgender rights. The It Gets Better project tweeted a photo of Lovato as she sang at the awards show:Kudos to @ddlovato   taking a stand for the #LGBTQ community at the #BBMAs. #genderneutral #itgetsbetter pic.twitter.com/oLZ2uHBlQO  It Gets Better (@ItGetsBetter) May 23, 2016This is an amazing gesture. Some stars don t want to get political, especially when it comes to culture wars, but sometimes it is important to use one s influence to speak out for vulnerable people, and to promote what s right. That is what Demi Lovato and brave stars like her are doing. They are well aware that they may lose fans who disagree with their stance, but they do it anyway because they want to use their public platform for good.Thank you, Demi Lovato!

 String Of Deaths Linked To Human Experimentation By Bone Cement Company,"Prosecutors allege that bone cement manufactured by Norian and its parent company, Synthes, was used to conduct  human experimentation,  resulting in a string of deaths over the past several years.As Fortune reports here, the deaths were the result of spinal injections of a product called Norian XR, described as  a cement that has the unique capacity to turn into bone when injected into the human skeleton. Norian XR was never approved by the FDA for use in the human spine. To the contrary, the FDA required the company to mark the product as  not approved  for such use.Experiments conducted at the University of Washington exposed the dangers of using the bone cement to treat human spine injuries as early as 2002. When tested on pigs, the Norian XR caused severe blood clotting, resulting in the deaths of the animals.Synthes had acquired the California-based Norian Corporation with the intention of altering Norian XR for use in spinal treatments. Nothing was going to stand in the way of company profits.Prosecutors say that the company launched a scheme specifically designed to get around FDA approval.As The Dallas Morning News reports here:CEO Hansjorg Wyss directed a few sites to perform 60 to 80 procedures in spinal surgeries using the Norian bone cement and to publish clinical results. He recruited surgeons to test-market the product on patients, court records show.The patients who were exposed to the experimental treatment were never told that the product was not approved by the FDA.By 2010, a string of deaths had been attributed to the company s human experimentation.Lois Eskind, age 70, was injected with Norian XR while a company salesperson watched. The Dallas Morning News reports,  The product leaked into Eskind s veins and led to the clotting that killed her. The company did not inform the FDA of Eskind s death. They continued to experiment on human beings without their knowledge or consent, causing the deaths of many other people, including Reba Golden and Joan Bryant.In 2010, Synthes and Norian, along with four top executives, were convicted of conducting unauthorized clinical trials on humans. Norian paid a $22.5 million penalty, while Synthes paid $669,800 fine.

 Oregon Won’t Prosecute Baby’s Abuser Because He’s Too Young To Testify,"An anguished Oregon couple took to social media this week in hopes of getting justice for their one-year-old son, Jacob, who was beaten by a babysitter two months ago.Pictures posted to Facebook show scrapes, cuts, a black eye and deep bruises which were left on the baby s face and arms during the vicious assault.Image credit: Joshua Marbury via FacebookWe can t even imagine the amount of trauma he must have experienced, all at the hands of an adult who was supposed to protect and care for him.Image credit: Joshua Marbury via FacebookJacob s parents, Alicia Quinney and Joshua Marbury spoke to Oregon Live on Friday. The first thing I saw was a black eye,  Quinney said.  I thought maybe marker got on his face or something. When he turned over, his whole right side of his face   black and blue. Quinney told Oregon Live that she knew right away that the babysitter had hurt him.She took Jacob to the hospital. Police met her there and opened an investigation into the assault.But prosecutors informed Jacob s parents that no charges will be filed against the person who did this to their son.As Oregon Live reports:Washington County Deputy District Attorney Dustin Staten emailed Quinney a link to a story published by The Oregonian/OregonLive detailing the challenges the law poses for prosecutors. The headline: Even pets are better protected than young kids under Oregon abuse laws, prosecutors say. To convict a suspected child abuser of felony assault or criminal mistreatment, the article explained, prosecutors must prove that the victim suffered a  physical injury  under Oregon law. That means proving the child experienced  substantial pain. The article explains that:Appellate rulings have made that hard to prove if victims can t talk about the extent of their suffering. Prosecutors say children younger than 5 often aren t able to articulate  substantial pain.  The same can be true for older children with developmental disabilities or those who don t want to speak out against their abusers.In essence the law leaves vulnerable young children like Jacob completely unprotected.Quinney took to Facebook to express her outrage over the state s completely irrational and irresponsible law, writing:After TWO months of waiting we only find out that charges are dropped BECAUSE my one year old cannot tell you verbally he was abused and my son did not show he was in pain OR that this person  intentionally  did this. I am SO furious that I m not using profanity HOPING something is done and this goes viral.Quinney goes on to say that Portland authorities have a verbal confession. As Raw Story reports here, they also have multiple statements from medical professionals who showed Quinney how the bruises on her baby were  handprints. Even with all of that, the law still makes it almost impossible to  prove  the case.Animals can t talk, yet animal abuse is prosecuted in the state of Oregon. How is it possible that a helpless infant has fewer protections under the law than an animal?Quinney points out in her post: A dead body cant tell you who killed them. Yet a baby isn t held to the same standard because he can t talk? Well neither can a dead body. THAT S BLASPHEMY. You waited 2 months if not longer to tell us this? Something needs to be done. NOBODY can just hit a child and more to just get away with it because the child cant verbally tell you. There s no doubt that Oregonians need to change these outrageous laws. The law should protect the most vulnerable among us. Instead, in Oregon, the law excludes the most vulnerable from protection. That s not acceptable.Featured image via Joshua Marbury on Facebook",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Lamborghini Rolls Up To White House, Gives Terrifying Glimpse Of What May Come (VIDEO)","Some of Donald Trump s biggest fans and supporters are working and middle class Americans who often struggle from paycheck to paycheck and are fed up with how our current system operates. That current system being, of course, where all the money is on top, the middle is taxed too much, and regular working people aren t given a fair shake.What these people fail to realize is that the person they want as Commander-in-Chief is merely pandering to that anger and using it for his own selfish goals of achieving the highest office in the land, even though he lacks any of the required experience.In what can only be seen as the best foreshadowing of what a Trump presidency would be like, a Trump-themed Lamborghini was driven up to the White House by a car enthusiast and parked outside. The car, like Trump, screams unattainable opulence. When a man refers to a million dollar loan from his father as a  small loan  you know he has no grasp on reality.According to the man in the video, the car is in town for goldRush Rally, which apparently is an  automotive lifestyle rally. Secret Service did show up to see what was going on. The man from the video said: They just wanted to come take a look at who I was and what s going on, because, especially being in front of the White House with Donald Trump plastered on the front of the car, I can see why they d be questioning what s going on. Ya think?However you look at this, it s probably one of the most obnoxious things you ll see this year, if not you re entire life. Only to be outdone by an actual Trump presidency. Which, by the way, we need to make sure never ever happens.Check out the video here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Beautifully Slams Trump’s ‘Dangerous’ And Idiotic Gun Policies,"It s no doubt Hillary Clinton has made gun violence a cornerstone in this election. For the first time, the issue of gun violence and mass shootings are at the forefront of national presidential politics.So it should only make sense that the GOP s candidate and the NRA s newest puppet Donald Trump would try to hijack that attention and sweep it under the rug.After the NRA gleefully endorsed the presidential blowhard, Trump promised to eliminate gun free zones (while speaking at a gun free gathering) while slamming Hillary Clinton as  heartless  for wanting to  restrict  people s access to guns.Clinton didn t take to kindly to former (and brushed off the latter). Speaking at a conference organized by the Trayvon Martin Foundation, Clinton said:This is someone running to be president of the United States of America   a country facing a gun violence epidemic   and he s talking about more guns in our schools, he s talking about more hatred and division in our streets. That s no way to keep us safe.The conference, organized by Trayvon Martin s mother Sybrina Fulton, aimed to bring together mothers who lost children to gun violence. Over 200 individuals showed up for the conference, including Fulton and Queen Thompson Brown, whose son was killed in Miami. Queen, not budging to the sensationalized claims of gun grabbing, told reporters that their mission is not to take away guns, but to promote  common sense gun laws. Clinton continued:We have a moral obligation to protect our children no matter what zip code they live in. If you want to imagine what Trump s America will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry, picture more anger and fear.Saying she would not be silenced or bullied, Clinton pledged to stand up to the gun lobby, specifically the NRA.So the American people are faced with two options: one that cow tows to the NRA (even though he supported a ban on assault weapons) and one that has never waivered in her support of victims of gun violence. We have one candidate that promises gun free zones while preaching in a gun free zone, and another that sits down with mothers and fathers who have lost their children.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Children’s Minister, Church Pastor Charged In Tennessee Human Trafficking Case (VIDEO)","An undercover operation conducted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) along with the Knoxville Police Department resulted in 32 arrests on prostitution charges. Two men, one a Baptist children s minister and the other a  creative pastor,  at a nondenominational church, were also charged with felony human trafficking.According to TBI, 46-year-old Jason Kennedy was arrested after he responded to an ad promising sex with an under-age girl. Kennedy showed up at a hotel room where he believed that the young girl would be waiting for him. Instead he was met by police.WBIR reports that Kennedy has been the children s minister at Grace Baptist Church in Karns, TN for two-and-a-half years.Church officials claim that Kennedy never behaved suspiciously around the children he  ministered to. Kennedy s church also issued an oddly worded statement after his arrest. The choice of wording creates serious doubts about whether the church conducted an actual background check before hiring him to work with children.After informing parents and church members that the children s pastor has been arrested for attempting to have sex with a child, the statement continues:The church s background check turned up no issues that indicate any previous problem. In fact, the children s pastor in his application affirmed that he had no issues in his background of a criminal or other nature.This statement implies that the church s background check consists of asking a potential employee to  check the yes box if you re a child predator. The second man charged with human trafficking was 36-year-old  Zubin Parakh of Oak Ridge, TN. Zubin also showed up at the hotel expecting to have sex with a child.According to WBIR:Parakh is connected to Lifehouse Church in Oak Ridge. A church spokesperson said Parakh serves as a volunteer as a  creative pastor. Although Parakh is not officially a pastor at Lifehouse Church, he was working toward becoming one.The thirty other men and women arrested were charged with prostitution-related crimes.According to police, Kennedy and Zubin were the only two people who showed up at the hotel expecting to have sex with someone under the age of 18.Here s more on this story from WPVI: Image credit: video screen capture WPVI via YouTube",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Won’t Believe The Insane Anti-Obama Bullsh*t This Idiot ACTUALLY Wrote To His Local Paper,"On Saturday, Illinois newspaper, the Belleville News-Democrat. published the unhinged ravings of one of the perpetual haters of sanity regarding President Obama s yet-unfulfilled mass gun-grab. Sure, he s gone seven years without taking guns away from Americans   even the Stupid Part of America   but Steve Kassa Jr. of Edwardsville is certain that any day could be the day, and he wrote to share his mindbogglingly-stupid thoughts with everyone. Obama was up to his lying and deceiving propaganda again trying to drum up support like Hitler installing to take your guns away,  Kassa writes.  He s had his prostitute in the media, Katie Couric, doing gun propaganda all week on satellite.  In fact, he says that the President  even used the Sandy Hook conspiracy  (that s right   he thinks Sandy Hook was fake) to emphasize his point that it s probably not a good idea to allow unhinged people to buy and own guns without some form of safeguard in place. After this last big breaking of the law and getting in America s face with this transgender thing, if you can t see America where this guy is wanting you disarmed, you better watch some of the rise and fall of the third Reich on AHC or the American History Channel,  he continues, segueing into the inevitable ill-informed Hitler comparison: These people have a very evil, demonic agenda and soon as they get the guns, if they can, you will see worse than what happened in Germany in World War II here in the United States. In reality, had Mr. Kassa opened a book at some point in his lifetime (not even a history book, just any book that mentions Hitler s rise to power), he would know that while Hitler seized guns from his enemies, he was actually quite in favor of an armed populace. Politifact notes that, like his party s modern-day American counterparts, Hitler was in favor of open carry, deregulation of firearm regulations, and allowing children to own guns:The Nazis adopted a new gun law in 1938. According to an analysis by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University School of Law, it loosened gun ownership rules in several ways.It deregulated the buying and selling of rifles, shotguns and ammunition. It made handguns easier to own by allowing anyone with a hunting license to buy, sell or carry one at any time. (You didn t need to be hunting.) It also extended the permit period from one year to three and gave local officials more discretion in letting people under 18 get a gun.The regulations to implement this law, rather than the law itself, did impose new limits on one group: Jews.Then, things got crazy (yes, then). Kassa decided to bring Agenda 21 into the mix: The rich white elite Democrats wanted the American Indians  ground, so the first thing they did was disarm them, the next thing they did was put them on a reservation (Agenda 21), and then they stole their ground. Go check out Agenda 21 for yourself. Agenda 21 is a fictional New World Order plot to depopulate the earth and control everything that is mindlessly parroted by people who have trouble figuring out how to operate a doorknob. In reality, Mother Jones notes that Agenda 21 isn t actually scary at all, despite the ominous-sounding name:While the name might sound a bit ominous, Agenda 21 is a voluntary action plan that offers suggestions for sustainable ways local, state and national governments can combat poverty and pollution and conserve natural resources in the 21st century. (That s where the  21  comes from. Get it?) 178 governments including the U.S. led by then-President George H.W. Bush voted to adopt the program which is, again, not legally binding in any way, at the 1992 U.N. Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. These people are very evil and you bet they want the guns so bad they can t stand it, as it s not for your safety, but for theirs,  Kassa concludes.  God bless America and unite as the one world order will have Obama coming after you. Be prepared, stick together.

 San Diego Padres Deliberately Humiliate Local Gay Men’s Chorus (VIDEO),"California is known as one of the most gay-friendly areas of the country, but they are not without their share of homophobes. This was made abundantly clear on Saturday during a home game being played by the San Diego Padres baseball team. The San Diego Gay Men s Chorus was due to perform the national anthem prior to the game s start, and things went horribly wrong.Perhaps there was already foreshadowing that the Gay Men s Chorus would not be welcome to do their performance, considering the fact that there were calls for them to pay for tickets for the so-called privilege of performing   even if they had no intentions of staying to watch the game. However, if you think that was bad, what happened during the performance itself was infinitely worse. As the chorus took the field to sing the Star Spangled Banner, to their horror, a recording of a woman s voice singing the song was played. Game officials made no move to stop the recording, and made no apology. The Gay Men s Chorus just had to stand on the field until the recording finished, and then they were taken off the field. When they were being led away, there were many homophobic taunts shouted, including one that chanted,  You sing like a girl.The San Diego Gay Men s Chorus released the following statement regarding this disgusting situation:What should have been a night of joy and celebration at Petco Park last night, instead turned into a nightmare raising serious questions about homophobia within the San Diego Padres organization and its relationship with the LGBT community.Before the start of the last night s San Diego Padres game, 100 volunteer singers of the San Diego Gay Men s Chorus took to the field to proudly sing the National Anthem. Instead, in front of the large crowd gathered for the LA Dodgers game, the San Diego Padres played the recorded voice of a woman singing the anthem.No attempt was made to stop the recording and start over. No announcement of apology was made to the singers or their friends and families in the stands. No attempt to correct the situation occurred other than to force the 100 men to stand in the spotlight of center field for the song s duration and then be escorted off the field to the heckles of baseball fans shouting homophobic taunts including  You sing like a girl. This incident followed several days of troubling comments and behavior within the San Diego Padres organization. Three days before the game, San Diego Padres representatives aggressively sought to prevent singers from performing the National Anthem unless they purchased a ticket to the game even if they did not plan to stay for the game which was not part of any previous discussion or written or verbal agreement and would have cost the small, community-based non-profit thousands of dollars. The demand eventually was rescinded on Friday following repeated complaints made by SDGMC and San Diego Pride to San Diego Padres management.With this as background, we call on the San Diego Padres and Major League Baseball to immediately launch a full and transparent investigation into the incident to determine if someone or some people intentionally engaged in anti-gay discrimination or a hate crime by playing a female s voice to represent a group of gay men with the purpose of denigrating and/or ridiculing gay men. The historic significance of such an act is not lost on the LGBT community especially in relation to professional sports and added to the depth of embarrassment experienced by the singers and their families.We also call upon the City of San Diego City Attorney s Office and the City of San Diego Human Relations Commission to independently investigate this incident to determine if members of the San Diego Padres organization engaged in activity in violation of the San Diego Human Rights Ordinance or engaged in any deliberate hate crimes based on sexual orientation.We applaud San Diego Padres President and Chief Executive Office Mike Dee for reaching out to our organization to apologize and to offer to meet with LGBT leaders to discuss the incident. We look forward to this meeting. We believe it is important to work together with the San Diego Padres organization to build bridges within the LGBT community rather than burn them down as happened last night.However, we are very disappointed with the San Diego Padres dismissively brief two sentence statement at 9:37 p.m. on Saturday, May 21, 2016 which did not appropriately address the gravity of the situation nor pay due to the 100 volunteers who took to the field in celebration and were led off in humiliation.Hopefully, Mike Dee gets rid of the people associated with and responsible for what happened at that baseball game. There is simply no excuse for what was done to these singers. This is blatant homophobia, and it was done in an effort to humiliate an organization of gay singers, to let them know in no uncertain terms that even in supposedly liberal California that they would not be accepted.Since fans were deprived of the opportunity to hear it on Saturday, here is a video of the San Diego Gay Men s Chorus singing the national anthem:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Suspicions Mount As New Details On Donald Trump Self-Funding Emerge (IMAGES),"As Addicting Info reported here, Donald Trump is very likely running the biggest campaign scam in American history.While Trump claims to be  self-funding  his campaign, the majority of the candidate s funding comes in the form of loans from Trump owned entities, rather than donations.In reality, Trump s campaign owes Donald Trump tens of millions of dollars. While he claims that the campaign won t be expected to pay the loans back, his most recent campaign filings with the FEC show that this money is still being treated as campaign debt.When Addicting Info first reported on Trump s self-funding scam in April, his campaign owed the candidate $17.5 million. At that time, loans to the campaign from Trump accounted for 70 percent of all contributions received.As NBC reports here, since the campaign s last filing with the FEC the amount owed to Donald Trump has more than doubled, now exceeding $43 million.In spite of Trump s assurances that the loans won t be paid back, this invitation to an upcoming fundraiser, obtained by the Los Angeles Times and published by NBC News here, raises even more suspicion about the loans.Image credit: Los Angeles Times via NBC NewsAccording to the information printed on the invitation, the first $2700 of each donation received during the fundraiser is designated for the Trump campaign to use in the primary election.NBC News verified that the information printed on the invitation is accurate.Since the republican primary election is over, it would seem that the only reason to continue raising money for Trump s primary campaign is to pay off his earlier campaign debts, all of which are owned by the candidate himself.As we reported here, Trump once vowed to be the first presidential candidate to make a profit from his campaign.There is nothing stopping Trump from using future donations to pay himself back for the loans he s made to his own campaign, with interest.The latest FEC filings, along with the details of his fundraising activities, suggest that that s exactly what he s planning to do.Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Portland Public Schools Tell The Koch Brothers To Get Out (VIDEO),"As schools across the nation are fighting science, schools in Portland, Oregon are giving a big middle finger to politically motivated science denial text books and making sure that everything that students read in school says that yes, climate change is real, and yes, it s caused by humans.On Tuesday, the school board passed a unanimous resolution that requires that all text books that mention climate change mention it as fact, not as theory. The books must also say that humans caused it.In testimony to the board, Bill Bigelow, a former Portland teacher, told district officials that  we don t want kids in Portland learning material courtesy of the fossil fuel industry. Bigelow said that material that treats climate change as anything other than fact is published by companies making concessions for fossil fuel companies. He pointed to words such as  might,   may  and  could  in educational materials.Source: Oregon LiveConservatives, naturally, are flipping out, saying that this move is political, when really, it s the other side that s all about politics over science.Portland public schools ban textbooks that cast doubt on climate change https://t.co/PciB5gBemASchool Board playing liberal politics.

Galileo would be unimpressed. https://t.co/YLrUk9INq1  Bryan Fischer (@BryanJFischer) May 21, 2016Is the Portland school district being political? Not really. There is a scientific consensus and even a voter consensus, that climate change is real and man-made. Beyond that, what is the benefit to making it up? There s no such thing as  Big Green Energy,  except maybe for all the big energy companies that see the writing on the wall and are themselves investing in green energy. In other words, if there s a political conspiracy, there has to be someone who benefits, and the parties who benefit, to make the conspiracy believable, must be more powerful than those on the other side. That s simply not the case with climate change.On the other side of the debate, you find Republican politicians, and you find the big money, led by the Batman villains known as the Koch Brothers.According to Greenpeace, the Koch brothers have spent nearly $80 million in attempting to convince Americans that climate change is a hoax, perhaps perpetrated by Al Gore (really, does that make any sense whatsoever?).Here s more about it:Like all Batman villains, the Koch brothers are smart. They know that the best way to create sympathetic voters is to get them young, and get them young is what they do. While the brothers don t write textbooks, their hands are all over the books that go to schools throughout the country. The textbooks attempt to rewrite history, give students an anti-government bias and yes, teach them that climate change is a hoax. That s the real political agenda, but it all happens behind the scenes, so voters don t notice. That s why a school board meeting might seem a lot more political than two billionaires working quietly in the background, destroying the planet.Featured image via Joe Raedle with Getty Images.

 Report: Black Women Have Become The Most Educated Group In The U.S. (VIDEO),"According to The National Center for Education Statistics, black women have recently emerged as the most educated population of people by race and gender in the United States. That makes them a powerful force in the political and business world.The NCES found that: From 1999 2000 to 2009 10, the percentage of degrees earned by females remained between approximately 60 and 62 percent for associate s degrees and between 57 and 58 percent for bachelor s degrees. In contrast, the percentages of both master s and doctor s degrees earned by females increased from 1999 2000 to 2009 10. Within each racial/ethnic group, women earned the majority of degrees at all levels in 2009 10. For example, among U.S. residents, Black females earned 68 percent of associate s degrees, 66 percent of bachelor s degrees, 71 percent of master s degrees, and 65 percent of all doctor s degrees awarded to Black students. The number of degrees that have been awarded to racial minorities in the United States has been on the rise for the past two decades. No, that doesn t mean that racial minorities are trying to take over the U.S. as I am sure many white supremacists would claim. It just means that many of the barriers that prevented black women from getting an education have begun to recede.Many people may have missed the notice due to the overwhelming amount of negative portrayals of black women in the media. According to a report in Essence from 2013, negative depictions of black women occur twice as likely as positive depictions of black women.This news comes with some caveats. Despite being the most educated bloc of people in the United States, black women are still making far less money than their white peers. There is also still only one black woman on the Forbes 500 list. That means that there is still a lot of work to be done to end the racial disparities in the United States.ATTN recently produced a video that gives a great rundown of the situation, you can watch it below.https://www.facebook.com/ATTNVideo/videos/1555955044709451/Featured image from (Photo by Erik S.

" Former Israeli Prime Minister BLASTS Israeli Government, Says Israel Has Become A Fascist State","It appears that the curtain that hides the true nature of Israel is finally beginning to be pulled back. On Friday, former prime minister and defense minister Ehud Barak told reporters that Israel has been  infected by the seeds of fascism.  That may be one of the biggest understatements of the year, though it does show the beginnings of a new internal outcry against Israel s government.Haaretz reports:Responding to the resignation of Defense Minister Moshe Ya alon earlier in the day, Barak said that it  should be a red light for all of us regarding what s going on in the government. Life-sustaining Zionism and the seeds of fascism cannot live together,  Barak told a Channel 10 interviewer.Ya alon s resignation is  the end of a chain that began with the case of the soldier who shot [a wounded Palestinian assailant to death],  Barak said.  Such incidents give us an X-ray image that is opposed to the will of the people. What has happened is a hostile takeover of the Israeli government by dangerous elements. And it s just the beginning. This government needs to be brought down before it brings all of us down,  Barak added.  There are no serious leaders left in the world who believe the Israeli government. That last quote is particularly relevant to the United States, seeing as the U.S. has acted as Israel s vanguard for quite some time now. The Obama administration s relationship with Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been tense, to say the least. Much of this has to do with Netanyahu s avowed disapproval of President Obama s Iran nuclear deal.However, due to rapid changes in the political ideology of people in the U.S. that may change depending on the administration in power. While a majority of Americans still have a favorable opinion of Israeli, Democrats and Independents  favorability of Israel is plummeting. The Republican Party s positive outlook on Israel remains rock solid, showing support for Israel has become an increasingly partisan issue.Featured image from (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Obama’s Former Speechwriter Tweets Top 5 Reasons Not To Vote For Trump, And They’re Perfect","When it comes to Donald Trump, a lot of people have a lot of different opinions. While some seem to think he speaks for them when Trump elicits fear and anger, others see right through his shenanigans and are very well aware of where Trump has come from, what he as done and said, and how much he s only in this race for himself and not the greater good.One of the people who sees right through Trump and his poppycock is former President Obama speechwriter, Jon Favreau. He recently took to Twitter to perfectly summarize Trump and give us five reasons no one should ever vote for Trump, especially if they re a working class American.Here is Favreau s summary of Trump:Trump:1) Profited off of 9/112) Rooted for the housing crash3) Ran a fraudulent university 4) Sued for tax dodging 5) Is a dick  Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) May 20, 2016And if you think he s lying, don t worry, he sourced everything as well:Links:1) https://t.co/alx1shhGCi2) https://t.co/nERH9BgIoP3) https://t.co/NsmmfGCbbw4) https://t.co/W1hTwTeoS05) Duh  Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) May 20, 2016With the  duh  being, by far, the most accurate. Of course, there are many, many more reasons not to vote for him as well (racism, sexism, etc.), but this was a good jumping off point.The only reason Trump wants to be president is to say he s president. He doesn t care about the nation, and his actions more than prove that point. He only cares about himself and his own ambitions. And for goodness sake, America, realize this sooner rather than later.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images   Twitter",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Doesn’t Want His Supporters To Know His REAL Stance On Gun-Free Zones,"Donald Trump recently went after the gun nut vote in a hard way when he declared during the National Rifle Association s annual meeting on Friday that he, as president, would get rid of  gun-free zones.  Of course, Trump didn t mention during his pandering that many of the properties that he owns could be described as gun-free zones. He also just backtracked on the issue to a large degree, days after the meeting.An official with the Trump Organization told ABC News that there are  no restrictions on licensed individuals carrying in our hotels or golf clubs. That statement turns out to be completely false. Here is a rundown of properties that ABC News discovered that do, in fact, have restrictions on carrying guns. Mar-a-Lago, Trump s posh Florida club, doesn t allow guns, a hotel staff member told ABC News.Trump National Doral, in Miami, Florida, doesn t allow guns either, a security official told ABC News. The resort would  much rather not  have guns on the property, said a security official with the hotel, who noted that guns are  not to be carried on our property. We ve had guests that have brought them before,  he said, but those guns  had to remain in their safe the whole time in the room. A security worker at Trump National in Jupiter, Florida, said  no  when asked if guns were allowed on premises by citizens who are licensed to carry them. Asked about exceptions for people like off-duty cops, the staff member directed ABC News to a supervisor, who said the hotel had no comment at all on guns at the property.Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County, Florida, also doesn t allow citizens with concealed carry licenses to bring their guns on the property, a golf-shop worker told ABC News. Now, of course, these policies make sense. Who would want to go to a resort or golf club to relax only to be surrounded by insecure people carrying around firearms? The same could be said for any establishment. Why should the staff or patrons at a restaurant or retail store have to deal with the person who just walked in carrying an assault weapon?So, once again we find a clear disconnect between what Trump says and reality. Maybe Trump just wants to ban all gun free zones except those that are enacted on premises that primarily serve the wealthy? As he has recently stated in another attempt to pander to the  the second amendment is the only amendment that matters  crowd, Trump stated that he thinks that teachers should be able to carry firearms on school premises.Except that, since he Trump, he can t even seem to make up his mind on that matter. On Sunday, Trump was questioned about his stance on letting teachers carry firearms during an interview on Fox & Friends. That s where he stated that: I don t want to have guns in classrooms. Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms. That means absolutely nothing and is a far cry from what he was preaching just a few days ago and his pledge he made in January when he said: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools   you have to   and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, OK? My first day. There s no more gun-free zones. Trump appears to be willing to spout any NRA talking point in an attempt to pander to anyone willing to be pandered to.  In some cases  does not in any way mean a blanket throwaway policy like he has been describing for most of his campaign. Instead, he now offers this ambivalent stance on a topic that impacts millions of lives.Featured image from (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 5-Year-Old Girl Kills Herself After ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Dad Leaves Gun On A Table (VIDEO),"Once again, the NRA s favored masturbatory aid is responsible for the death of a child. The terrorist group masquerading as a  gun rights  organization regularly informs us that keeping a gun in the home is probably the safest thing someone can do for his family next to hiring an army of ninja chimpanzees, but the truth is that both can lead to unintended and disastrous consequences   the sort that took the life of 5-year-old Haley Moore on Saturday.Neighbors describe Moore s father, Eric (a retired veteran the NRA would normally use as the poster-ammosexual for gun safety), as being  vigilant  about keeping his guns out of the hands of his child   the sort of thing we can expect the NRA to say about most parents who bravely decide to transform their homes into veritable armories   but reality, unfortunately, reared its ugly head when he decided to take a shower at around 9:45 a.m., leaving a loaded .45 handgun on the table.Next door neighbor Joy Ursin told WVUE that she learned what happened when Haley s terrified older siblings informed her: The oldest kid, she told me because they came over to us when all this happened, she s traumatized, my sister, my sister shot herself. Ursin says she comforted the older children as their father called law enforcement   after he finished his shower, that is. The gun should ve been locked up but at the same time, you should, I think that from an early age, getting children familiar with them and enough to know it s not a toy is the biggest thing,  Labat said telling the news station that it s  definitely sad when something like this happens. Unfortunately, this isn t the solution either. Not only does the simple act of keeping a firearm in the home increase the risk of harm coming to yourself or your family members, but Mother Jones noted in 2013 that  For every time a gun is used in self-defense in the home, there are 7 assaults or murders, 11 suicide attempts, and 4 accidents involving guns in or around a home.  While it is comforting for some to think that a child well-informed about the dangers of guns will not touch them, an ABC experiment in which children were exposed to  hidden  firearms directly after taking a NRA gun safety class ignored the danger and (for the most part) played with the guns they found anyway.Haley died from her injuries in the hospital, another victim of the NRA s jihad against sanity.It is unclear if Eric will be charged with a crime for causing his daughter s death, but we won t be holding our collective breath.Watch a report on the senseless and completely avoidable death below:FOX 8 WVUE New Orleans News, Weather, Sports, SocialFeatured image via Facebook",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Took Federal Money Meant For Small Businesses Affected By 9/11 Attacks,"Trump is a millionaire who clearly doesn t need federal money for his businesses, but he took it anyway, even though it was supposed to go to small businesses that were devastated by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.When the twin towers fell that day, it did significant damage to many area businesses. Many businesses were wiped out entirely because they were based within the World Trade Center. In the aftermath, people avoided the area and area businesses struggled to survive the economic hit.That why Congress tried to come to their rescue by passing a recovery program earmarking hundreds of millions of dollars meant to help small businesses that were affected by the attacks.However, small businesses that could have been helped were actually shortchanged because wealthy corporations ended up getting awarded millions of dollars despite not being near Ground Zero.Donald Trump s building at 40 Wall Street is one mile away from the World Trade Center, yet Trump was able to claim that the building only had $26 in the bank and that it was a small business in order to receive $150,000 that should have gone to revitalize the real small businesses around the World Trade Center.But 40 Wall Street brings in $8 million in revenues every year, which goes beyond the federal definition of a small business.Even if there had been any damage to 40 Wall Street because of 9/11, Trump could have definitely paid to fix it himself. But he didn t. Instead, he swindled the Empire State Development Corporation out of $150,000 of taxpayer money so that he wouldn t have to reach into his own deep pockets.It makes one wonder just how many times he has taken federal tax dollars throughout his career as a businessman, which makes the fact that he continues to refuse to release his tax returns all the more infuriating.Not only would those documents show us exactly how much money Trump makes every year, it would show us how much he has suckled off the government teat. But he has excused not releasing his taxes because he claims he is being audited, which the IRS says wouldn t prevent anyone from releasing copies of their tax returns. Clearly, Donald Trump has something, or many somethings, to hide that could make Americans hate him even more than they already do.Taking 9/11 funds from small businesses is just the tip of the scummy iceberg.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Racist Anti-Muslim Protesters Didn’t Expect To See This At Their Rally (VIDEO),"A group of anti-Muslim protesters descended on downtown Houston to protest the completed construction of an Islamic library inside of an already existing Muslim community center. Less than a dozen protesters actually showed up to the protest. The event was organized by a group called  The Heart of Texas.  Apparently, no one associated with the group even bothered to show up the event.The turnout for the counter-protest was huge. More than fifty people showed up to protest the anti-Muslim protesters.The Facebook event for Heart of Texas  protest is loaded with all sorts of fear-mongering: Imagine Texas turning in a muslim [sic] ghetto full of mosques and  Islamic Knowledge  centers,  the group writes.  It s gettin  real. One protester, Ken Reed, wore a shirt that says  White Lives Matter  said that: This is America. We have the right to speak out and protest, and that s what we re doing. We feel that Texas, our great state, and the United States is being threatened by the influx of Islam. While the Muslim population has grown in Texas over the past decade, particularly in Houston, there isn t any good reason to view them as a threat. Muslims account for less than 2% of Houston s total population. That s much higher than the national average, though are still very much a tiny minority in the city. Keep in mind that 94% of terrorist attacks in the United States between 1980 and 2005 have been committed by non-Muslims. We re here to show the Muslim community that there are people of faith based and non-faith based philosophies standing in solidarity against racist bigots trying to intimidate them,  said Ramon Mejia, an organizer of the counter protest said.It s always great to hear that there are people are willing to stand up to bigotry and intolerance. Especially in a place that is known for having an abundance of both of those things.You can watch video footage of the protest and the counter-protest below.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Drinks And Dancing As Things Got VERY Real During Cold Open Of SNL Season Finale (VIDEO),"No matter which candidate you re pulling for to be the Democratic presidential nominee, you re likely to find the cold open from Saturday Night Live s season finale pretty damn hilarious. Of course there will be some who won t see it as funny, and those people need to calm the hell down, because it s comedy and no one is perfect, and SNL just perfectly encapsulated what s happening in the Democratic race, whether you like it or not.Both Kate McKinnon and Larry David reprised their roles as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and met up at a bar to unwind from what s been a pretty grueling race. The bartender announces that the bar is closing, but Bernie refuses to leave announcing that he ll leave when he s good and ready to leave. It s at this point that Hillary and Bernie have one last drink at the bar   Bernie a drink that that s  refreshing and revolutionary  that  draws huge crowds,  while Hillary had a beer  no one likes, but gets the job done. The pair then rehashes over the campaign and what they might have done differently, and while Bernie admits that he secretly imagines being a millionaire and eating fancy foods, Hillary  admits  that she  really really  wants to be president. Something Bernie is keenly aware of.Hillary then invites Bernie to dance where, of course, she insists on leading, and the two dance off throughout the SNL studio.It s going to be a long summer without the SNL cast going after the candidates from both sides at every turn, but one thing is for certain, the season premiere this fall is bound to be pretty damn epic.Watch the cold open here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WaPo Editorial Goes Full Racist, Wants To ‘Weed Out’ Voters Based On Right-Wing Testing Guidelines","Right-wing ideologues are at it again with voter suppression. When not passing discriminatory voter ID laws and striking down the Voting Rights Act, they are passing off half-assed, offensive journalistic  philosophy  as legitimate commentary.Enter right-wing libertarian columnist David Harsanyi and his op-ed in the Washington Post.Titled  We must weed out ignorant Americans from the electorate,  the article at first glance seems innocent   yes, we all wish people we deemed  stupid  didn t vote. Liberals wish conservatives didn t vote, and conservatives wish liberals didn t vote.However, when reading deeper, one quickly finds out that Harsanyi has an extremely nefarious way to achieve this   forcing voters to pass a civics test if they wish to vote.Saying to voters,  Unfortunately, we can t trust you,  Harsanyi says  Let s give voters a test. The citizenship civics test will do just fine. The reason? The writer thinks the American public is too ignorant to vote:At the same time, let s also remember that checking a box for the candidate whose campaign ads you like best is one of the most overrated obligations of the self-governed. If you have no clue what the hell is going on, you also have a civic duty to avoid subjecting the rest of us to your ignorance.The questions? Simple (if you have the privilege to from an educated background:Admitting that he believes the school system and society fails to teach the public proper civics, Harsanyi says he doesn t care. He s made up his mind. He doesn t seem to know (or maybe he just doesn t care) that his civics test, banking on the fact that people will fail it, would disproportionately affect black and Hispanic voters, Americans who don t speak English, and voters with intellectual or learning disabilities. All these people, regardless of what Harsanyi thinks, are Americans who are all entitled to vote without any discriminatory barriers.But Harsanyi addresses that:Of course, we also must remember the ugly history of poll taxes and other prejudicial methods that Americans used to deny black citizens their equal right to vote. Any effort to improve the quality of the voting public should ensure that all races, creeds, genders and sexual orientations and people of every socioeconomic background are similarly inhibited from voting when ignorant.CAUSE THAT JUST MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER, DOESN T IT!? That was the same thing the racist bigots in the South said when passing their discriminatory Jim Crow laws.This attack on the basic dignities of voters and their absolute right to vote without barriers is disgusting, but we shouldn t put it past a libertarian, or rather faux-libertarian considering actual libertarians are for freedom with no barriers.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" LA Republican Proposes Banning Strippers Over 160 Lbs, Age 28 (VIDEO)","A Louisiana state representative introduced legislation that would ban strippers who are over the age of 28 or who weigh more than 160 pounds.According to local news reports Rep. Kenneth Havard, a Republican representing Jackson, introduced the legislation in response to an earlier measure which would prevent strip clubs from hiring women under the age of 21.Havard proposed an amendment to the bill, imposing age and weight restrictions for women working as strippers in the state.Many of the state s male lawmakers responded to Havard s bill with disturbingly sexist actions and comments.Several male lawmakers can be seen on this video tossing around dollar bills, while others can be heard laughing at the proposal.After coming under fire from Rep Nancy Landry, who asked if the amendment was meant to imply that women over a certain age or weight were not fit to dance, Havard replied that he was just trying to make sure they don t hurt each other.When asked if he believed the amendment was offensive, Havard quickly withdrew it.Rep. Julie Stokes took to the floor to slam her male colleagues in the state house, saying: Looking out over this body, I ve never been more repulsed to be part of it. After calling out fellow lawmakers on what she described as a history of disrespectful behavior, Stokes went on to say: You know I suggest that everyone in here look around at their own bodies and their own daughters. Stokes continued: I think we need to put an end to this. I hear derogatory comments about women in this place regularly. I hear and I see women get treated differently than men and I m going to tell you what, you gave me a perfect forum to talk about it right now. It has got to stop. That was utterly disrespectful and disgusting. Havard claims that the proposed amendment was a joke.When asked if he felt that he should apologize for his conduct on the house floor, Havard responded: I don t know if I ll ever apologize for being politically incorrect. It s just not in my nature to do that. Political correctness has, in my opinion, ruined the country.

" Trump Said America ‘Never’ Wins, But Obama Just Took Out A Major Terrorist","On Friday, Donald Trump gave a speech to the NRA after picking up their endorsement ahead of the general election (they don t care if he has a week record on guns, as long as he s a Republican), and in his speech Trump made an insane claim about the country he hopes to lead. Trump proclaimed,  We don t win anymore. We never win. This is, of course, absurd. You can check out the hashtag #WeWinDonald for examples of America winning over the last 240 years (disclosure: I started it).But before the ink on the NRA s endorsement was even dry, along came news of another American victory. This time against the Taliban, who once harbored Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks (his death, another win for America).The Pentagon says it launched an airstrike in Afghanistan Saturday targeting Mullah Akhtar Mansur, the Taliban s overall leader. Though the Pentagon is still assessing the results of the airstrike a U.S. official said Mansur was  likely killed  in the airstrike personally authorized by President Obama. Today, the Department of Defense conducted an airstrike that targeted Taliban leader Mullah Mansur in a remote area of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region,  said Peter Cook, the Pentagon s Press Secretary in a statement released Saturday.The Pentagon press secretary also explained that Mansur has been  actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners. President Obama authorized the drone strike that appears to have killed the Taliban leader while en route to Vietnam on Air Force One.You may remember that President Obama s epic correspondent s dinner roast of Donald Trump came at the same time the Bin Laden raid was about to be executed. Perhaps it s time to start panicking if you re in Al Qaeda or the Taliban   or ISIS   when Trump s buffoonery is in the news.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ben Carson Gets Humiliating Trump Campaign Demotion – Claims He Requested it, Fools No One","Ben Carson was (very) briefly the Republican frontrunner for President of the United States   and now he s getting demoted by Donald Trump s campaign for being too big a liability. The campaign which once tweeted a picture of Trump eating a taco bowl with the caption  I love Hispanics  thinks Carson makes them look bad.And sadly, they re probably right.Ben Carson has managed to step on every rake in the yard in his bumbling attempt to help Trump get elected president. He s confided to reporters (on the record) that Trump might make a terrible president, but at least  we re only looking at four years. How bad has Carson been for Trump? Dubbing him the  worst surrogate ever  CBS News  Emily Schultheis pegged Carson early on:A campaign surrogate s job is to travel across the country and go on TV, saying nice things about the candidate and helping boost his or her chances at the presidency.What a campaign surrogate is not, however, supposed to do, is suggest their candidate is a bad person, admit he has a Twitter problem and an issue with  humility,  defend that candidate by suggesting a TV anchor has been charged with a crime, and reassure skeptics that, even if your candidate is a terrible president, it s only for four years.So when Carson made headlines yet again for screwing up   this time naming a list of potential vice presidents Trump was considering including Alaskan campaign death knell Sarah Palin   Carson was removed from the vice presidential planning group. Or as Carson s spin team meekly put it, he asked to be removed because he had many more super important jobs to do.That lie was exposed in less than a week. The real story is that Trump kicked Carson to the curb because Carson had absolutely no idea what he was doing.Three sources close to the Trump campaign said Carson didn t leave on his own. He was pushed.According to sources close to Trump s campaign, Carson was demoted after Trump specifically wanted him to head up the VP selection team. He submitted names that he thought would be valuable picks and inevitably lost his top spot days later. Carson allegedly called Trump afterwards and was angry that the situation played out like this.At this point, it s hard not to feel bad for Carson. Having seen the highs of being a front-runner, Carson got smoked in Iowa thanks to a vicious lie spread by Ted Cruz. Later he would be pulled into a literal closet to hear Ted Cruz tell him  sorry not sorry.  Only to finally give up and throw his lot in with Trump   a man who once called him a pathological liar barely above a child molester. Now that same man is firing him and only because Carson s mouth almost never bothers communicating with his brain before saying things like  He has some major defects, there s no question about it, just like the rest of us. But before we let Carson s sadsack routine tug on our heartstrings, let s remember that this is a man who ran for president on the premise that the Egyptian pyramids were grain silos only to give up and throw his weight behind a man he seems to have nothing but contempt for just to cling a bit longer to the political spotlight. Carson s right about one thing, he does have major defects.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Attack Ad Accidentally Reveals What’s Really Behind The Bathroom Laws,"If you ve ever wondered why suddenly, now, Christian conservatives are making a huge stink over where people go to the bathroom, grab a match and take a look at this attack ad in Texas.Mail piece says @BriscoeCain is  well known  to those who frequent gay bars in Montrose section of Houston #TxLege pic.twitter.com/fqMH682gWz  Scott Braddock (@scottbraddock) May 20, 2016On its face, it looks like a pretty standard below the belt political attack ad. It might make a candidate an asshole and a bigot to spread unfounded rumors that your opponent is gay, but on the next page is where the real insight into the Republican party is: Irony: Mailer against a Hotze-backed candidate, @BriscoeCain, says he should be kept out of men s bathrooms #TxLege pic.twitter.com/wLOzL3nQRY  Scott Braddock (@scottbraddock) May 20, 2016The transgender bathroom laws that are popping up across the country are not specifically about transgender people. Once the Supreme Court ruled that marriage equality was the law of the land, anti-gay bigots had to take their fight elsewhere. Besides, gay marriage might not be so bad if you don t actually have to see people *gasp* holding hands or *I feel faint* kissing. What s a better way to keep people out of the public than to ban them from using public restrooms?If you think this is a bit of a stretch, think about the bathroom laws themselves. Imagine a very masculine looking man, who happened to have been born with a vagina. Do women, who already see predators around every corner, really want to share a bathroom with him? Should a woman, feminine in every way except for what s between her legs, be forced to use the men s room? Of course not. Anti-LGBT conservatives don t want them to use the bathroom at all, just like Briscoe Cain s opponent doesn t want him in bathrooms.Yes, this is just one person, but this guy (unfortunately, not a Republican) feels that gay people should have their own bathrooms. You know, separate, but equal.Here are a few more charmers:Keep the freaks, perverts, and Fags out of the bathrooms!! https://t.co/owUwDcjhGz  Lisa Smith (@JuliaKi96952130) May 9, 2016 i m not against gender neutral bathrooms, but can we get a faggot only restroom?For all the fags.

 Donald Trump Makes Another Truly Pathetic Attempt At Making Hispanics Like Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump just can t accept that he has completely demolished any and all chances of winning over the Hispanic vote.Refusing to be discouraged by the fact that he s offended the Hispanic community since day one of his disgraceful presidential campaign and continuously pummeled the minority group throughout the election cycle, the presumptive Republican nominee is trying to reach out to the very community that he said was made up of  rapists  and  drug dealers. Trump gave his  first direct message to Hispanic conservatives  over the phone, while sitting alone on a private plane. It s truly bizarre and uncomfortable to watch, but then again so is everything else The Donald does. During his 2-minute message, which was aired at the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference in California, Trump promised to do away with minority unemployment and stop illegal drug cartels. While Trump rattled off a few more talking points, the business mogul s main message to Hispanics could be summed up in these few sentences: National. Hispanic. Christian. Three great words. We re going to take care of you. We re going to work with you. You re going to be very happy. You re gonna like President Trump. You can watch Trump s awkward message below:The idea of Trump sincerely trying to portray himself as a great candidate for Hispanic voter is, quite frankly, hilarious. As much as Trump loves his polls, he must be absolutely oblivious or in severe denial   it s been widely reported that Trump is still struggling big time to get support from the Hispanic community, and that s probably not going to change anytime soon.Many Hispanic voters have pledged their support to Trump s rival, Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton, with only 23% of them stating that they would vote for Trump in November. In fact, many Hispanics registered for the first time this year for the sole purpose of voting AGAINST Trump. No matter how hard Trump tries to undo the damage he did in the beginning of his campaign, his attempts will likely fall short. The Hispanic community will not forget his offensive, hateful rhetoric, and neither should the rest of us.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Lesbian Couple Beaten, Arrested For Holding Hands Wins $80,000 Settlement (VIDEO)","In October of 2015, California couple Courtney Wilson and Taylor Guerrero travelled to Honolulu, Hawaii for what was supposed to be an enjoyable vacation getaway. On the second day of the couple s trip, however, their dream vacation turned into a nightmare.As Addicting Info reported here, Guerrero and Wilson stopped at a Foodland grocery store to pick up some snacks.The couple says that they were dancing and having a good time as they shopped. They held hands and at one point Wilson gave her girlfriend of two years a kiss on the cheek. Upon seeing the kiss, off-duty police officer Bobby Harrison told the couple to  stop it,  then yelled at them to  take it somewhere else. The two women tried to brush off the rude remarks and went about their shopping. Harrison continued to follow and harass the couple, threatening to have them thrown out of the store.As Wilson and Guerrero neared the checkout, Harrison approached them again. At this point, Wilson tried to call 911 on the off-duty cop, but Harrison grabbed her arm. Both women were thrown to the ground by the officer. Wilson was punched in the face by Harrison. The officer then directed Foodland employees to hold the two women down until their hands could be zip tied.Harrison arrested the couple, charging them with felony assault on a police officer. The charges were dropped five months later. During the five months that it took the courts to process the case, Wilson and Guerrero were forced to remain in Honolulu. We spent the money we came with on bail,  Wilson said during a recent press conference. As a result, the couple was forced to sleep in a park.Watch Wilson and Guerrero describe the harassment and assault in the video below, courtesy of NBC News on YouTube.On Friday, the women were awarded an $80,000 settlement in the case. The City Council is expected to approve the award when it meets in mid-July. The couple also received a $10,000 settlement from Foodland.According to NBC News Officer Harrison  retired  from the police force last year.Featured image via video screen capture NBC News",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Robert Tracinski (@Tracinski) May 20, 2016In going through these tweets, one will see some predictably sexist tweets about how it s just as sexist for a company to have an entirely female leadership staff as it is for them to have an entirely male leadership staff. That s male privilege talking, though   we still live in a man s world here. Women have it much harder in the workplace, including climbing that vaunted corporate ladder, than men do.An all-female editorial team in a man s world is great. However, for a supposedly liberal outlet, whatever attempts they re making at racial diversity suck. We have to wonder whether their HR department screens out resumes of people with  black  sounding names like many other HR departments do. We also have to wonder whether they consider black people to automatically be less qualified, like many other companies seem to.Perhaps they re afraid they ll lose readers if their readers know they have black people on their editorial staff.Yes, companies should absolutely put the people they believe to be the best qualified in open positions. Oftentimes, however, black candidates are judged more harshly than other candidates, especially white candidates, due to racial biases in a variety of areas. HuffPo, this is extremely disappointing.Image via screen capture from embedded tweet by Liz Heron",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Just Dropped A Bomb On Debbie Wasserman-Schultz That Could End Her Career,"Debbie Wasserman-Schultz hasn t exactly been kind to the Bernie Sanders campaign. As Chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, Wasserman-Schultz has a duty to see that the party s primaries are fair and just and that the candidates are treated equally. The Sanders campaign has long complained that they have been treated anything but.Many of the rules the Sanders campaign doesn t like aren t new and certainly shouldn t have come as a shock, such as the use of superdelegates and closed primaries in states like New York, but there have been other things the campaign harped on that were met with a brick wall, such as the debate issue. It was almost as if the DNC didn t want anyone to watch they were scheduled so poorly. At a time when people were tuning in to watch the Republicans tear beach other to pieces in primetime, the Democrats looked like they were almost hiding their candidates, scheduling debates on Saturday nights during college and pro football s playoff season.The campaign has little recourse, as they are bound by the rules of the DNC, but Sanders on a personal level has dropped the bomb that he is supporting Wasserman-Schultz s opponent, Tim Canova, in his primary run against her in Florida s 23rd congressional district. Canova, a Sanders supporter, is a much closer fit to the senator s platform than Wasserman-Schultz, especially where dark money is concerned. She has repeatedly voted to keep that money flowing through the halls of corruption, where Sanders and Clinton both have called for it to end.There was a time when an endorsement from Bernie Sanders may not have seemed like that big a deal. Those days are over. Sanders has amazing influence with young people, and if enough in the Miami-Dade area come out to vote for the guy Sanders supports, Wasserman Schultz could very well be out of a job. Asked about Sanders  endorsement of her opponent, she said: I am so proud to serve the people of Florida s 23rd district and I am confident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in Congress. Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent, I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary. I look forward to working together with him for Democratic victories in the fall.The congresswoman will have to a little bit better of a job convincing people she s neutral. Actions speak louder than words.Featured Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Tweet Perfectly Connects #AllLivesMatter And Zimmerman Gun Auction (IMAGE),"At this point, the arguments against the #AllLivesMatter crowd s rebuttal against the #BlackLivesMatter movement have been well documented. The point that  Just because someone says  Save the rainforest  does not mean that they are saying  F*ck all other forests  should have ended the debate. However, the debate continues. One person on twitter saw the connection between the #AllLivesMatter and the recent sale of the gun George Zimmerman used to kill Trayvon Martin.Here s the tweet:It should be noted that the gun actually sold for $250,000 dollars but that does not change the point at all.There have been no major systemic changes to the institutions that have racism built into their core. Since the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement, it has been proven again and again just how much it is needed.Many people have claimed that the gun is a piece of history and that s why people are willing to pay so much money for it. I have to wonder if the person who bought the gun would also be willing to pay a quarter of a million dollars for the hoodie that Trayvon Martin was wearing the night he was killed by Zimmerman. I highly doubt that they or most of the people who put serious bids in for the weapon would be willing to do so. Especially when it is taken into account that at least part of the money Zimmerman will receive, will be donated to groups that fight the Black Lives Matter movement.That s because the gun isn t just a piece of history. It is a trophy for white supremacists. It is a symbol that a grown man can kill an unarmed black teenager, be protected by the state s legal system, and then go on to make a fortune off of the tragedy that person has caused.Featured Image Photo by Joe Burbank-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NRA President Has Meltdown Over Voting Rights And It Was SO Hypocritical,"National Rifle Association President Wayne LaPierre had an absolute meltdown at the organization s annual conference on Friday about voting rights. LaPierre is extremely pissed off that Democrats want to restore voting rights to ex-felons. Apparently, he doesn t think these people deserve the right to vote, but he s totally cool with violent felons owning guns.During his speech in Louisville, Kentucky, LaPierre said: There is no limit to how far the elites will go to put Hillary in the White House. They re even allowing convicted felons the right to vote, including violent rapists and murderers. It sounds outrageous, but it s true. The Democratic-led Maryland General Assembly did it for 44,000 ex-cons. In Virginia, Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe   Hillary s longtime bagman   did it for 206,000 convicted felons.Tentacles of the Clinton machine are out registering those felons right now. They re releasing them and then they re registering them! Heck, when they sign their release papers, they might as well just give them a Hillary bumper sticker at the prison door. The NRA president isn t wrong. Maryland and Virginia DID restore voting rights for that number of people and rightfully so.  Unlike Republicans, we believe that everyone deserves the right to vote. Voting is in an inalienable right and it should not be taken away because someone was convicted of a felony. I personally believe that even my father s murderer should be allowed to vote. I loathe him, but my personal feelings should not have any influence over whether or not he performs his civic duty. He was convicted of killing my dad, went to prison, served his time and released. He was held accountable for his actions, paid the price and now is free to live his life.Republicans, on the other hand, are against restoring voting rights because felons are disproportionately likely to be minorities (my dad s murderer was white) and minorities tend to be Democratic voters. The GOP are notorious for voter suppression shenanigans targeting poor, minority and young voters because they know that the fewer people at the polls, the more likely they are to win. So, of course, LaPierre doesn t want felons to have their voting rights restored, but he does want them to own guns.According to the Huffington Post the NRA and the Republicans they have in their pockets have been fighting for decades to restore gun ownership rights to felons. In many cases, those felons were convicted of violent crimes and when they were allowed to own firearms again, they committed more offenses. That is of no consequence to the right or the NRA, because they believe in second chances! For gun owners, anyway.In 2015, Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) sponsored an amendment that would have funded a program to restore Second Amendment rights to ex-offenders. During a floor speech, Buck said, America is a land of second chances. One mistake should not define your future.  The NRA boasted about the amendment on their Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/NationalRifleAssociation/posts/10153506293466833 The land of second chances  unless you would like to vote. The hypocrisy is breathtaking, isn t it? Now, the right could argue that we, too, are being hypocrites because we do not believe that ex-felons should be allowed to own guns again. I disagree. I m fine with ex-felons having their gun ownership rights restored IF they did not commit a violent felony. I m sorry, but if you hurt somebody and went to prison for it, you cannot be trusted with a gun. Period. Owning a firearm and voting is not the same thing.Wayne LaPierre and his followers only care about one thing: arming as many people as they possibly can so that gun manufacturers get richer and richer. They don t actually care about ex-felons, because is they did they d make sure the same people they wanted to give guns to, also had their rights to participate in their democracy restored.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Fraud’: Major Veterans Group Accuses Trump Of Ripping Off Soldiers,"The military veterans group VoteVets is blasting presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a  fraud,  after it was revealed that his claim that he raised $6.5 million for veterans was a lie.A Washington Post report uncovered the truth behind yet another wild Trump statement:One night in January, Donald Trump skipped a GOP debate and instead held his own televised fundraiser for veterans. At the end of the night, Trump proclaimed it a huge success:  We just cracked $6 million, right? Six million. Now, Trump s campaign says that number is incorrect.Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the fundraiser actually netted about $4.5 million, or 75 percent of the total that Trump announced.Trump used the $6 million figure as a public relations talking point for himself in the days following the fundraiser, while he campaigned for votes in the Republican primary. Yet when asked by the Post to account for all of the money he allegedly collected, Trump refused. Paul Rieckhoff, founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told the Post,  That s just shady. Right? No matter how you cut it, that s just shady. Now VoteVets has responded to the Post article, and they are also blasting Trump for the way he used the veteran s issue to boost his own profile, while giving soldiers less than he promised.Responding to the story, Iraq War Veteran and Chairman of VoteVets.org, Jon Soltz said: Donald Trump is a cheap fraud.  In a classic fraud move, made himself look good to the public, by lying to the American people, and veterans, about how much he raised for veterans  groups, when he hid behind them to get out of the GOP debate.  He said he raised $6 million.  Now, when investigated by reporters, he finally admits that he overstated the amount by millions, and never raised what he told people he did.  In fact, there may still be groups who are waiting for their check. Soltz further notes,  We now need to presume that he is lying about how much he claims he has given to veterans over the years, and that s part of the reason he won t release his taxes. VoteVets describes itself as an organization with over 400,000 supporters that uses  public issue campaigns and direct outreach to lawmakers to ensure that troops abroad have what they need to complete their missions, and receive the care they deserve when they get home.

" One Thing Changed About Obama This Year, And It Should Terrify Republicans","While much of the focus of the election year so far has been on Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, understandably, there has been a major change with regards to one of the key political figures in America and it has the potential to be a huge factor on the election.Since January of this year, President Obama s approval rating has seen a double digit increase. He is 12% higher now than he was then.But over the course of the year, Obama s approval numbers changed   quickly, and a lot. In Gallup s most recent weekly average, Obama is at 51-45   the exact opposite of where he was on Jan. 1 and a 12-point swing since then. He s been at 50 percent or higher in every week since March 1, save one.[ ]Looking at quarterly averages of Obama s approval, you can see how stark the improvement has been by party. Democrats have slowly looked at Obama more favorably since the beginning of 2015, but independents have begun to look at Obama much more favorably. After a sharp slide following his reelection, independents turned their opinions of Obama around at the beginning of 2014. Over the past year, that s escalated. And since ratings from Democrats and Republicans are more stable, that shift by independents moves the needle a lot.Multiple factors probably account for the dramatic change, but the improving economy and the contrast between Donald Trump s buffoonish style and Obama s leadership have to be considered. Trump is definitely having an effect among Latino voters, where Obama is up even higher than the average   almost +15%. Trump calling for a wall on the U.S.   Mexico border and describing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists is not a good look for the Republican Party.Obama has already said he will be out on the campaign trail for the Democratic nominee   most likely Hillary Clinton   and it has been decades since a sitting president used his office to campaign for his chosen successor (Gore pushed Clinton away in 2000, and Reagan was too ill to campaign for Bush in 1988, while George W. Bush was enormously unpopular in 2008 and McCain wanted nothing to do with him).A popular president who appeals to both Independents and the party base is a huge asset going into an election against an opponent who is both historically unpopular and who has built his campaign based on offending key members of the Democratic coalition (women, Latinos).Obama (and Biden) won t be a drag on the Democratic ticket. They could be the key to a huge victory.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Hilariously Brilliant Commentary On White Privilege Is Something Everyone Needs To See (VIDEO),"White privilege is a thing. There are many white people who will deny this all day long, though. They think that once slavery was over and Jim Crow laws were abolished, that racism was over. Even the white people who acknowledge white privilege often forget to check said privilege. It s infuriating to white people who actually get it, and especially to people of color. However, it is always refreshing when a white person speaks out about it intelligently, and that is just what Louis CK did on an appearance on Jay Leno s nightly comedy program.It all started with Leno asking how Louis CK s kids were doing. Louis CK responded: My kids are good. I mean, on paper they re great. They re two little white girls in America. Sometimes I look at it that way. I look at them like, you can t say anything. You re doing awesome. Just boiler plate great lives. He then goes on to talk about giving one of his daughters bubble gum flavored medicine, and how she said: Ew!  and he told her  Fuck you ew! You can t say ew! I m sorry. It s medicine. Most children don t have medicine. Most children in the world they get sick, they die on a rock with a bear eating them. That s how they handle it. After a bit more banter in the  little white girls in America  vein, Louis CK then goes on to say that you  can t take people s historical context away from them.  He continues: White people are always like,  come on, it wasn t us!  Like they want black people to forget everything. Like, every year, white people add 100 years to how long ago slavery was. I ve heard educated white people say slavery was 400 years ago. No it very wasn t. It was 140 years ago. That s two 70 year old ladies living and dying back to back. That s how recently you could buy a guy. The comedic truth continues, and it is truly refreshing to hear a straight white man recognize just how privileged he is because of being born, well, a straight white man.If only the rest of white America was this enlightened.Watch this must-see clip below, via Shaun King s Twitter:3 brilliant minutes from Louis CK on white privilege.

 Hillary Wrote This Letter To Superdelegates In 2008 That Bernie Fans May Find Interesting,"Bernie Sanders supporters have been in an uproar about the Democratic National Committee s rules for primaries, specifically the use of  superdelegates.  A superdelegate is someone chosen by the party to represent their interests in a given state. They are unpledged, meaning they are able to vote for whoever they choose at the convention. Bernie Sanders supporters, especially the  Bernie or Bust  crowd   those who pledge to stay home or vote for Trump if Hillary gets the nomination   have decided that the use of superdelegates circumvents the democratic process, making it impossible for anyone but an establishment Democratic candidate to win.Let s put that into perspective real quick: If the RNC had the same rules they wouldn t be forced to nominate Donald Trump.Superdelegates act in the best interest of the party. There was a candidate in 2008 who learned first-hand that superdelegates can make or break a candidacy. Her name was Hillary Clinton. The expected nominee from the start of the primary season, Clinton found herself face-to-face with the up and coming Barack Obama, whose candidacy didn t truly flourish until half of the state primaries were over. As he gained in popularity and it became clear that he was the right choice for America to succeed Dubya, those  corrupt  superdelegates, tasked with securing the best interest of the party, began switching their support to Obama, who was ultimately nominated by quorum call on the convention floor by none other than Hillary Clinton.That s the way these things work. Bernie or Bust may be upset that all those independent voters didn t get to just walk into a Democratic primary and vote, but it really isn t anyone s fault but their own that they don t know the party rules. Primaries aren t general elections; they re nominating processes controlled by the parties. Make no mistake: If Bernie Sanders were in the lead or it looked like he was going to pull ahead, those superdelegates would shift their support and make sure the nominee was someone the registered voters of the party want to support.When Clinton was faced with the exact same scenario in 2008, she wrote a letter to the superdelegates of the party with one last plea for support. Her arguments include things like who polled better against the GOP, who had spent more years arguing progressive causes and who was ultimately more qualified to execute the office of the president:Dear ___________,The stakes in this election are so high: with two wars abroad, our economy in crisis here at home, and so many families struggling across America, the need for new leadership has never been greater.At this point, we do not yet have a nominee   and when the last votes are cast on June 3, neither Senator Obama nor I will have secured the nomination. It will be up to automatic delegates like you to help choose our party s nominee, and I would like to tell you why I believe I am the stronger candidate against Senator McCain and would be the best President and Commander in Chief.Voters in every state have made it clear that they want to be heard and counted as part of this historic race. And as we reach the end of the primary season, more than 17 million people have supported me in my effort to become the Democratic nominee   more people than have ever voted for a potential nominee in the history of our party. In the past two weeks alone, record numbers of voters participated in the West Virginia and Kentucky primaries. And with 40 and 35 point margins of victory, it is clear that even when voters are repeatedly told this race is over, they re not giving up on me   and I am not giving up on them either.After seven years of feeling invisible to the Bush administration, Americans are seeking a President who is strong, experienced, and ready to take on our toughest challenges, from serving as Commander in Chief and ending the war in Iraq to turning our economy around. They want a President who shares their core beliefs about our country and its future and  gets  what they go through every day to care for their families, pay the bills and try to put something away for the future.We simply cannot afford another four   or eight   years in the wilderness. That is why, everywhere I go, people come up to me, grip my hand or arm, and urge me to keep on running. That is why I continue in this race: because I believe I am best prepared to lead this country as President   and best prepared to put together a broad coalition of voters to break the lock Republicans have had on the electoral map and beat Senator McCain in November.Recent polls and election results show a clear trend: I am ahead in states that have been critical to victory in the past two elections. From Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to West Virginia and beyond, the results of recent primaries in battleground states show that I have strong support from the regions and demographics Democrats need to take back the White House. I am also currently ahead of Senator McCain in Gallup national tracking polls, while Senator Obama is behind him. And nearly all independent analyses show that I am in a stronger position to win the Electoral College, primarily because I lead Senator McCain in Florida and Ohio. I ve enclosed a detailed analysis of recent electoral and polling information, and I hope you will take some time to review it carefully.In addition, when the primaries are finished, I expect to lead in the popular vote and in delegates earned through primaries. Ultimately, the point of our primary process is to pick our strongest nominee   the one who would be the best President and Commander in Chief, who has the greatest support from members of our party, and who is most likely to win in November. So I hope you will consider not just the strength of the coalition backing me, but also that more people will have cast their votes for me.I am in this race for them   for all the men and women I meet who wake up every day and work hard to make a difference for their families. People who deserve a shot at the American dream   the chance to save for college, a home and retirement; to afford quality health care for their families; to fill the gas tank and buy the groceries with a little left over each month.I am in this race for all the women in their nineties who ve told me they were born before women could vote, and they want to live to see a woman in the White House. For all the women who are energized for the first time, and voting for the first time. For the little girls   and little boys   whose parents lift them onto their shoulders at our rallies, and whisper in their ears,  See, you can be anything you want to be.  As the first woman ever to be in this position, I believe I have a responsibility to them.Finally, I am in this race because I believe staying in this race will help unite the Democratic Party. I believe that if Senator Obama and I both make our case   and all Democrats have the chance to make their voices heard   everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee.In the end, I am committed to unifying this party. What Senator Obama and I share is so much greater than our differences; and no matter who wins this nomination, I will do everything I can to bring us together and move us forward.But at this point, neither of us has crossed the finish line. I hope that in the time remaining, you will think hard about which candidate has the best chance to lead our party to victory in November. I hope you will consider the results of the recent primaries and what they tell us about the mindset of voters in the key battleground states. I hope you will think about the broad and winning coalition of voters I have built. And most important, I hope you will think about who is ready to stand on that stage with Senator McCain, fight for the deepest principles of our party, and lead our country forward into this new century.The letter was followed by 11 pages of statistics showing that even though she was behind, the race wasn t over. In the end it was the support of superdelegates that gave Obama the clear win.As a Bernie Sanders supporter, I would love to see the last melee of primaries go his way. A big win in California and a couple of other states and there s a chance Bernie becomes the best choice for the party, at which time he can realistically try to woo the superdelegates away from Clinton. If Hillary can hang on and secure the nomination, those of us who care about the future of our country will put our full support behind her.Featured image by NBC Newswire/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Kim Davis Goes Off On Gay People, SCOTUS And Shoving Things Down People’s Throats (VIDEO)","Just when you thought Kentucky County Clerk Kim Davis would drift off into obscurity (as she should) she reemerges just as hate-filled and full of drivel as ever during an interview with Frank Wright of D. James Kennedy Ministries. Neither of these people understand how the Constitution works as supreme law of the land.Davis still seems to believe that the laws of  the Bible  reign supreme over her actions serving the public.She said: I was obeying my law I had couples bring in the whole Supreme Court ruling and I said,  You know, I really don t need to see this because that s not a law, that s a ruling  [and they d say]  Well, why won t you do this?  And so then I go to the Bible and I d tell them, [and they d respond,]  Don t be reading me the Bible.  Well, you asked why I couldn t issue you a marriage license and I m explaining to you, I m showing you why I cannot. They didn t want to hear that though. They wanted to shove that paper down my throat and make me eat it for my dinner. Actually, Kim, the Bible has nothing to do with your job and serving the public. If you re to serve the public as your job requires you to do, you are to abide by the law, including federal law, which in this case is the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution offering equal protections to all citizens, not just the ones that fit your standard under your religion. If you don t want to do your job, might I suggest you resign. You are free to worship as you choose on your own time, but when it comes to restricting others equal protections, you are disobeying the Constitution which was made clear by the Supreme Court. They re not writing new laws to tell you what to do, they are upholding the ones written upon our nation s founding.

 CNN Panelists Laugh In Trump Advisor’s Face After He Says THIS About Hillary (VIDEO),"One of Donald Trump s advisors thought he was going on CNN to smear Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, but instead he was embarrassed on national television for spewing more of Trump s lies.On Friday afternoon, Trump had spoken at an event for the National Rifle Association, where he attacked Clinton s positions on guns so that the right-wing organization would endorse him. Later that day, Trump advisor Stephen Miller echoed Trump s words on CNN, only to be met with hysterical laughter.Host Don Lemon brought up Trump s pandering NRA speech and called the presumptive Republican nominee out for telling lies about Clinton wanting to get rid of the 2nd Amendment. Lemon said: I want to talk about the 2nd Amendment. Because Donald Trump continues to say that Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment. That is false. That is false by every fact-checker, by the campaign, by her, by everyone who is listening but Donald Trump. Why does he continue to say that? Miller could barely finish  Because it s true  before the entire panel   Lemon included   erupted into laughter at the ridiculous statement. Once the laughter had died down, Miller continued to claim that Clinton wanted to overturn the Supreme Court s District of Columbia v. Heller decision that shot down a law that made carrying an unregistered gun illegal, and prohibited the registration of handguns while other weapons were allowed.Miller said that if this decision was overturned, the 2nd Amendment would no longer exist. Guest Sally Kohn jumped in and countered that there had been restrictions on guns long before the Heller decision, and that even Constitutional originalist Antonin Scalia believed that guns should have some restrictions and regulations.You can watch Trump s advisor humiliate himself in the video below:Trump says Clinton wants to end the 2nd amendment, despite PolitiFact rating the claim false. @donlemon has more. https://t.co/GVpoTVIzY8  CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) May 21, 2016Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mark Cuban Says He’d Be Hillary’s VP – But Only Under This One Condition (VIDEO),"Mark Cuban is not a fan on Donald Trump, and he made that perfectly clear in an interview with NBC News  Chuck Todd on Friday.Todd brought up a hilarious comment that the NBA owner and Shark Tank star had previously made when Cuban was asked if he would consider being Hillary Clinton s running mate, because she needs someone like me who could just throw bombs at Donald Trump.  Todd asked Cuban: You joke that you would love to be Clinton s running mate, as long as you were allowed to throw bombs at Trump. If she really did come to you, would you listen? Having gotten his hatred for Trump out of the way, Cuban took on a more serious tone and revealed that he would love to be Clinton s VP pick, but she would have to meet one condition. Cuban told Todd: Absolutely. The key would be that she d have to go more to center. I like the fact that Senator Clinton has thought out proposals. That s a good thing, at least we get to see exactly where she stands. Cuban s skepticism is because he feels that her Democratic rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders,  has dragged her a little bit too far to the left.  He explained: Things like college tuition and, you know, other business elements that really, I think, could hurt the economy. If she s willing to listen, if she s willing to, you know, hear other sides of things, then I m wide open to discussing it. You can watch Cuban s interview with Todd below:Cuban s comments come just a week after several anti-Trump Republicans tried to encourage Cuban to run for president in a third-party bid. Cuban said there wasn t enough time to launch a third-party bid, and that the GOP was courting him for his bluster and volume, combined with substance and the ability to connect with voters on a more personal basis.  Basically, they were looking for another wealthy businessman, but one much more reasonable than Trump. Last week, The Washington Post reported that because the Republican Party didn t want to stand behind Trump, they would try to get an independent candidate to take him out of the race. The piece read: The recruiters also delved into the world of reality television for someone who might out-Trump Trump: Mark Cuban, the brash billionaire businessman and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. Cuban simply replied, I don t see it happening.

 CA Senate Passes Ambitious Gun Control Package That’s Going To Seriously Piss Off Republicans,"On Thursday, the California state legislature passed a series of legislation described as  the most ambitious action ever taken to protect communities from gun violence. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the legislation includes nearly a dozen bills designed to protect the state s communities from devastating acts of violence like the mass shooting that occurred in San Bernardino in December of 2015. The attack, which left 14 people dead and another 22 injured, was the second worst mass shooting in California history.In response to the shooting, democratic lawmakers passed a comprehensive series of bills designed to reduce gun violence.A total of eleven bills were passed. Not surprisingly, nearly all of them were passed without support from republican members of the state legislature.The package included a bill which requires people selling ammunition to obtain a license, as well as mandatory background checks for those purchasing ammunition.Another bill outlaws the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines. SB1446 would ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.The only bill to gain republican support, AB1176, would make it a felony to steal a gun or purchase a stolen gun, regardless of the value of the weapon. Under current state law the felony charge of  Grand Theft Firearm  only applies to stolen guns that are valued at $950 or more.Other measures require owners of homemade guns to obtain a serial number and register such guns with the state, and mandate that owners of lost and stolen guns report the theft to the police within five days of discovering a missing firearm.While the legislation still has to wind its way through the state house for approval, the Los Angeles Times reports that special measures have been taken to try to get the bills approved before June.If the bills fail to pass the House before that time, voters will likely have the opportunity to approve the same measures through a 2016 ballot initiative.California is leading the way in common sense gun control legislation. In spite of NRA propaganda, these measures are not  the first steps toward the government taking away everyone s guns. The bills approved by the California Senate are good examples of sane gun-control legislation. This kind of legislation is both reasonable and necessary.No one is naive enough to think that these measures will prevent all incidents of gun violence. On the other hand, few people are stupid enough to think that doing nothing about America s epidemic of gun violence is a reasonable response to the problem.

 Reports Show Trump Paid Absolutely Nothing In Taxes For Two Years,"Donald Trump has been getting heavy media coverage as of late regarding his taxes and sketchy business dealings, with USA Today detailing in a recent analysis decades worth of tax evasion and ongoing court battles with the government.But now ABC News has obtained New Jersey records that show something even more damaging: In 1978 and 1979, Trump paid zero dollars in federal income taxes, and posted net negative earnings in those years. Remember, this is the guy who s supposed to be the financial guru who will  save  the American economy.As ABC details:Trump claimed negative income in both those years: losses of $406,379 in 1978 and $3,443,560 in 1979. In 1975, 1976, and 1977, he claimed $76,210, $24,594, and $118,530 in income, respectively, paying $18,714, $10,832, and $42,386 in federal taxes, according to the document, the Report to the Casino Control Commission.Now, were these negative postings and subsequent tax evasions before or after his four bankruptcies and court appearances?In 1979, Trump lost the $3.4 million after losing HUGE in investments  on real-estate holdings in New York City:The Division notes that in 1978 and 1979 Trump incurred no federal income tax liability. In 1979, the lack of such liability is primarily attributable to losses incurred by Trump in the operation of rental properties located at Third Avenue, Fifth Avenue, East 56th Street, East 57th Street, East 61st Street and East 62nd Street, New York City, New York.Were these failed investments part of his  art of the deal?  Considering Trump and his business cronies are notorious for overvaluing their properties, this might explain why he lost big in 1979.So not only did Trump screw himself over, he (once again) screwed over investors an creditors involved in the process.Along with Panama Paper mentions, multiple instances of tax evasion, overvalued properties and now this, no wonder Trump has been using every excuse in the book, including an ongoing audit, to not release his taxes   which the head of the IRS has now completely debunked. With all these bombshell reports coming out regarding his taxes, land values, and evasions, how many more years did Trump lose an exorbitant amount of money thus paying nothing back to society? This is highly suspect and a big clue about why he won t release his returns.But with all this information being public if people just take the time to dig, what is he really hiding that could only be found in the documents he won t release?Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" REPORT: Trump Lied About How Much Was Raised For Veterans, Personal Donation Appears Missing","On top of failing to pay charities for months after the fundraiser, despite already having beneficiaries listed, it turns out Donald Trump actually lied about how much was raised   to the tune of around a million and a half dollars. And now, four months later, his campaign is admitting it.In fact, as of this time, only a little over three million has actually been paid out, meaning it s possible that even the new number given by the Trump s campaign is false. That, or worse, it simply disappeared. According to his campaign, donations were pledged that were not received. But that begs the question: If $4.5 million was definitely raised, where did it go?In any case, the amount of time between the fundraiser and actually paying the money is questionable, and Trump has been called out by many people for it   including Sandra Miniutti, the vice president for Charity Navigator, a service that rates charities:In recent weeks, Trump and his campaign repeatedly declined to give new details about how much they have given away. Why should I give you records?  Trump said in an interview with The Post this month.  I don t have to give you records. In the past few days, The Post has interviewed 22 veterans charities that received donations as a result of Trump s fundraiser. None of them have reported receiving personal donations from Trump.Did Trump make good on his promise to give from his personal funds? The money is fully spent. Mr. Trump s money is fully spent,  Lewandowski said.Who did Trump give to, and in what amounts? He s not going to share that information,  Lewandowski said.Of course not.Featured image by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The NRA Endorsed Trump, But They’d Have Ended Him In 2012 For His Comments Right After Sandy Hook","Donald Trump gave a speech to the NRA, who then endorsed him for President. That seems a little odd, given Trump s past support for certain gun control measures that the NRA wouldn t touch with a 60 foot pole. It s especially telling that, as recently as 2012, Trump supported President Obama s attempts at reasonable gun legislation following Sandy Hook. Now, though? They seem to have forgotten.Back then, President Obama said: We can t tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change. We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true. No single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. But that can t be an excuse for inaction. Surely, we can do better than this. Trump s response to that?Back in 2000, he also wrote in his book, The America We Deserve: I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. Those are both things the NRA can t stand. Trump used to call out Republicans for  walking the NRA line,  and  refuse even limited restrictions  on firearms too, which is really all Democrats want. The NRA, however, would have us believe that Obama is coming for our guns any minute now, and, if not him, then the next Democratic president will. Somehow, some way, some Democratic president will take everyone s guns.We have to wonder when that s actually going to happen, since they keep saying it s just a matter of time.So Trump used to be pro-gun legislation, and now he s anti-gun legislation enough for an NRA endorsement. The NRA has a short memory, apparently. While people do evolve on their positions as they learn new facts, this is pandering, because the NRA willfully ignores the facts.Trump, however, must enjoy pandering, because he does an awful lot of it.He s also pandering to the extreme end of the pro-gun crowd, even proudly accepting an endorsement from a Sandy Hook truther back in January. In March, Pastor Carl Gallups gave a speech where he said that Trump was the  pragmatic choice  for Christians. However, Gallups  website calls the Sandy Hook massacre a gun-grab hoax, and allegedly has evidence proving that. He also said that there s no question that the victims  parents are all fakes.The fact that it doesn t occur to the guns-everywhere crowd that Trump s support for the NRA, the gun nuts, and everything they stand for, is an illusion in order to gain support he knows he needs boggles the mind. Of course, it s hard to catch the liar of liars in a lie, because he s got excuses for everything and he s good at making his lies sound perfectly reasonable. He s very likely snowed the NRA here.Featured image by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Sanders Personally Calling Dem Senators, Promising Them Party Unity","As the Democratic Primary devolves into tense moments   reeling from violent and threatening outbursts stemming from the Nevada Democratic Convention   questions are being raised if Senator Sanders can, if he loses the nomination, rally his supporters behind Hillary Clinton.Media outlets and members within Democratic circles are worried a split party could hand Republican nominee Donald Trump the presidency on a silver platter. Sanders allies have denied that his supporters or continuing candidacy could deliver a Trump victory, but nerves have not been eased.That s why Bernie Sanders has decided to personally call Democratic Senators to reassure them that there will be party unity no matter who the nominee is.Senator Dick Durbin, considered the number two Democrat (next to Chuck Schumer), said he received a call from Sanders, promising unity:Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, came away from the conversation on Wednesday convinced that Sanders, who has all but lost the presidential nomination battle to Hillary Clinton, understands the need for party unity and will do his part to defeat presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. We talked about the demonstrations and such,  Durbin said Thursday in an interview.  I am convinced, as Bernie has said repeatedly, he is going to be on the team to defeat Donald Trump. I don t have any question in my mind. Also to receive a call from Sanders was Senator Barbara Boxer, who was verbally accosted at the Nevada convention and feared for her safety during and after. Sanders promised Boxer he would work to encourage a non-violent, issue oriented campaign and work to make the Democratic Party strong. In Boxer s words:He did phone me back last night and he was very distressed about it. It was a very warm conversation, and I told him, he expressed shock that his people would do it. I did tell him the vast majority of those Bernie supporters were sitting in their chairs, they were fine, But there was this group of 50-100 people, they were not young people, they were older people and he ought to check out and see, who these people are, and he said he would. In my mind when he says he does not support any type of violence, I believe him. And he s got to make sure it doesn t happen. People will follow his lead.Sanders a few days ago talked with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at the behest of Senate Democrats, a conversation that neither warmed feelings of unity nor fanned flames of division.While both sides have worried about unity, Sanders has gone on the record, multiple times, saying he would work tirelessly to defeat Donald Trump. And now he has begun to call party leaders with reassurance that his eye is on the prize   a blue White House.Sanders talked to other Senators who weren t named. But these outreaches are reassuring in the face of growing, mounting tension.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Two Stunning New Polls Show These Staunch Red States Could Turn Blue To Avoid Electing Trump,"The GOP didn t panic when a poll conducted earlier this year showed that Utah might vote for the Democratic candidate in November in order to avoid electing Donald Trump. However, they might want to start showing a little concern now, because two new polls show something similar for two more strongly red states. Arizona and Georgia, which tend to vote red in presidential elections, are showing signs that they, too, would turn blue before they d vote for Trump.Donald Trump has long claimed that he s going to win states that typically vote blue in presidential elections, which would rewrite the electoral map, at least for 2016. Georgia and Arizona, however, don t like his misogynistic statements about women or his racist, hardline comments and unworkable policies against immigrants (Utah just plain can t stand him).So can he rewrite the electoral map? Sure, but not necessarily in his favor. In Georgia, Trump leads Hillary by just four points, which is within that poll s margin of error. In other words, they re in a statistical tie there. Georgia has voted Republican in every presidential election for the last 20 years, but they re making themselves into an example of the disdain many feel for Trump s fitness to lead a nation.Over in Arizona, Trump leads Hillary by just two points, influenced by a huge  Never Trump  movement among Republicans there. If Trump can unite the party, he ll probably win Arizona, but for now, it s not looking good for him (and it s looking just terrible for John McCain in the Senate, too. The horror).Trump and his campaign think that his appeal among white, blue collar workers are what will put traditionally blue states back into play for Republicans, creating a ton of new swing states that haven t existed for a long time.They re totally ignoring the fact that this goes both ways, though   they ve already made three red states look at the color blue with new appreciation. Some Republican strategists are pointing out that his polarizing rhetoric, which is alienating women and minorities, will make him struggle in a lot more Republican states.In fact, there is really only one way he ll gather enough electoral votes to win the White House. Hillary has a much wider path than our dear Mr. Trump has.It s not likely that Arizona and Georgia, to say nothing of Utah, will be the only three of these states to start leaning away from Trump. Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell said: With Donald Trump, I think he ll have the ability to turn some working class, blue-collar Democrats   the so-called Reagan Democrats   he ll have the ability to get them to switch over. The question is, are there Republican moderates that will switch over to Secretary Clinton or Bernie Sanders? For every one blue collar worker that Donald Trump picks up, he has the potential to lose one or more suburban Republican moderate to come over and vote for our side. There are actually a lot of those moderates who won t vote for Trump, as noted above. Arizona and Georgia are now key states, along with Utah and many others. Trump might be crowing over his success in states that have lost a high number of manufacturing jobs, but other states have other issues, and all he s proving is he might not rewrite the electoral map so much as partially invert it, giving even more states to the Democrats than usual.Featured image by Mark Lyons/Stringer/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The HORRIFYING Reality Of Executions In This State Has Been Uncovered, But It’s Unlikely To Stop","According to Reuters, a grand jury in Oklahoma found that  jail staff did not verify what drugs they were using for lethal injections and were unaware when the wrong drugs were administered.  This report is another damning piece of evidence that shows that there are many flaws in the supposedly  humane  systems in place for carrying out capital punishments.In 2014, the news broke that the execution of an inmate named Clayton Lockett, who was sentenced to death for murder. An executioner failed to properly put an I.V. line into Lockett. The needle used to inject the lethal drugs into Lockett began to spray all over the execution chamber that he was in. He died, after 45 minutes of agony. Not because the toxins that were pumped into his body worked as intended, but because they caused Lockett to die of a heart attack.After, a massive outcry from the public, which included a scathing condemnation from Amnesty International, Oklahoma made some minor changes to their policies regarding executions. In 2015, two more botched executions were performed. One of those executed was Charles Werner. His final words were  My body is on fire. One of the major factors contributing to these botched executions is due to the absence of sodium thiopental, which is the executioner s drug of choice for lethal injections in the U.S. The drug was taken off from the market in 2011 due to increasing international regulations on lethal injections. States who have yet to abolish capital punishment, have been scrambling to find alternatives.That means, once again in its history, the U.S. is desperately clinging to a practice that the rest of the world is moving towards abolishing. There are many good reasons for abolishing the death penalty but there is one reason in particular that even the staunchest advocates of the deathly penalty must admit is terrifying. A recent study found that 1 in 25 prisoners who are sentenced to death are actually innocent.No matter what protocols are put in place, we can never know for sure if they are truly innocent. I share the same stance as many capital punishment abolitionists, that capital punishment is always wrong, no matter what, whether the convicted individual is guilty or innocent. The idea that innocent people might be subjected to what is increasingly becoming not only a death sentence but a sentence to living their final moments in a state of hell ( My body is on fire ) is unconscionable.Oklahoma, you have already proven that reforming your policies on capital punishment are a facade. It s time to for you and the rest of the states that have yet to abolish the death penalty to give up this barbaric practice.Right now, all executions are on hold in Oklahoma. Since then, not a single execution has been botched and not a single innocent person has been murdered by the state. It s sounds as if they have found the perfect solution to their problem   now they just need to make it permanent.Featured image from (Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers)",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" REPORT: Trump And Companies Tied To Over 100 Lawsuits, Tax Evasion","Donald Trump s financials and business ventures are astronomically sketchier than Mitt Romney s. He refuses to release his tax returns, his name appears in the Panama Papers thousands of times, and now an exclusive report from USA Today shows Trump and his companies are linked to over 100 lawsuits, tax disputes and other legal limbos.An analyst from pored over thousands of documents and concluded, in summary:USA TODAY s examination of Trump s track record as a business taxpayer found not just court actions, but dozens of additional tax disputes with local authorities that didn t reach the courthouse in states including New York, Nevada, Florida and New Jersey. In some cases, Trump s businesses have disputed tax assessments; in others, they have simply not paid the tax bill until after the government took additional action.According to the information obtained from court cases, property records, and other documents showed that every year from the late 1980s to now, Trump and his associates/companies have been involved in tax disputes. Between June 2015 to now, five Trump companies in New York State alone have been issued warrants for more than $13,000 in unpaid or late taxes. Before June 2015, Trump has two other unpaid warrants; $1,580 for Trump mortgage; $1,747 for Trump University. One failed, the other is under investigation for fraud.USA Today issued a detailed list of tax issues over the decades:Not only does Trump have decades worth of tax and assessment issues stemming over three decades, he also overestimates the worth of his properties, something that might be shown in his tax returns and prove that he isn t worth as much as he says he is. For example, the Ritz Carlton Resort and Spa in Jupiter, Florida has been assessed at $13.7 million. Trump, however, personally assesses the property at $50 million, a full $36.3 million more. Then there s the famous Mar-a-Lago, Trump s personal estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Assessed at only $20 million, Trump contends that it is actually worth $50 million.Once again, records show (or don t show, because Trump won t release them) that Trump is lair, cheater, and overblows his worth to make himself look good.Trump s shady business dealings are miles long, miles deep. This is the  great businessman  Republican voters are touting when they spout their support for him.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Imges",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

He even called her  Miss Piggy  and said that she must be  somebody that likes to eat.  He then forced her to work out and try to lose weight.When asked if she d vote for Trump this fall, all Machado could do was laugh.When Hillary Clinton heard about the insults and the response to if Machado would vote for Trump, she tweeted out: Congratulations on becoming a U.S. citizen, Alicia.

 Oklahoma Republicans Are Trying To Impeach Obama For The Dumbest Reason Yet,"Talk of impeaching our first African-American President is like oxygen to Republicans   if they don t mention it incessantly, their tiny little brains shrivel up and they die. This is a scientific fact that I completely made up but has a strong basis in reality. Our frenemies on the right have come up with some real doozies when explaining their repeated attempts to get the black man out of the WHITE house.In 2010, Michigan Rep. Tim Walberg wanted to impeach Barack Obama in an effort to get his birth certificate. In 2012, former Minnesota state Rep. Allen Quist said that the President should be impeached because he isn t deporting brown people quickly enough. That same year, Texas congressional candidate Wes Riddle decided the black man should be impeached for satisfying the conditions of a treaty ratified under George H.W. Bush. A year prior, Tea Party Texas Rep. Michael Burgess suggested impeachment for no better reason than to block Obama s agenda. The month before that, GOP Rep. Tim Scott wanted Obama impeached because he wouldn t allow the country to default on its debts. Weeks after that, Rep. Steve King agreed with this ridiculous notion.If we were to translate all of these moronic reasons to impeach the President, they all boil down to one thing:  He s black.  But as monumentally stupid as those are, Oklahoma s state legislature has managed to come up with some new and original that dwarfs all previous reasons Republicans wanted to impeach the President in the scale of their stupidity. Reuters reports that Oklahoma Republicans have filed a measure calling for Obama s impeachment because of   Lawmakers say they want to get President Obama out of office because he overstepped his constitution authority by protecting transgender students from being harassed by their ideological counterparts across the nation. In fact, they feel so strongly on the issue that are already taking up a measure that would allow students to claim a religious right to have  separate but equal  (where have we heard that phrase before?) bathrooms and changing facilities to keep them away from scary transgender people:Lawmakers in the socially conservative state are also expected to take up a measure as early as Friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students.The bill introduced on Thursday night could force schools into costly construction, which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a $1.3 billion state budget shortfall.The impeachment resolution also introduced on Thursday night calls on the Oklahoma members of the U.S. House of Representatives to file articles of impeachment against Obama, the U.S. attorney general, the U.S. secretary of education and others over the letter.Oklahoma state Rep. John Bennett called President Obama s tyrannical decree that transgender people deserve equal rights  Biblically wrong    a phrase that should never enter politics   and a violation of state sovereignty. In a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth,  Troy Stevenson, executive director of LGBT advocacy group Freedom Oklahoma, said of this ridiculous resolution.This decision comes on the heels of Oklahoma Republicans  decision to make it a felony to perform abortions. Not only would doctors face time behind bars, but they would be  prohibited from obtaining or renewing a license to practice medicine in this state  if they allow a woman to choose whether or not to carry a fetus to term. The bill passed the House 59-9 and the Senate 32-12, so it seems likely that something equally asinine   like impeaching Obama over something stupid   would be just as popular.Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Think Trump Wants To Keep Your Job At Home? Think Again — He’s Been Profiting Off Your Loss,"One of the cornerstones of Donald Trump s campaign for president has been that he s going to keep jobs here at home. He s made it one of the key talking points at his many, many rallies. However, it doesn t seem like he really gives a rat s ass about preventing outsourcing when it comes to his own wallet.Back in March, Trump said: Our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly Frankly I m disgusted with it. Although, that really doesn t seem to be the case considering he s making a profit off investing in the companies he s very  disgusted with. According to Bloomberg: Trump has denounced units of United Technologies Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Mondelez International Inc. on the campaign trail   and has received income of as much as $75,000 from bonds issued by all three since January 2015, according to his latest financial disclosure form released Tuesday. He also has invested in Apple Inc. s stock and bonds even though in February he called for a boycott of the company for refusing to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone used by a terrorist in San Bernardino, California. In fact, only last month did Trump call out Ford Motor Co. by name when he said: Carrier has to know that if they do that   and I m not only speaking to them, I m speaking to Nabisco and Ford and hundreds and hundreds of other companies   they have to know that there are consequences when you want to leave and fire all these people You re not just going to go to another country, make your product, sell it across our really weak borders. Yeah, Trump hates it so much, just like a dog hates a peanut butter covered bone. Mmmhmmm The man is a walking and talking lie machine. His face could literally be next to the word  hypocrite  in the dictionary. Not that any of his supporters have ever opened a dictionary, or for that matter, a book.Trump is not only bad for the United States, but for the entire world. If he were to actually win the presidency, the rest of the world would look at us as thought we re crazy. We re only now getting over the embarrassment of George W. Bush, and Trump is a million times worse. At least Bush had policy experience, Trump doesn t even have that.Enough is enough, America. Trump is bad news and only has his own self-interests at heart, and all the proof you need is in the fact that he s profiting off American loss. He also made a point of saying back in 2006 that he hoped the real estate market tanked so he could buy up all the properties to make a profit.He only wants to be president for himself, and not to  make America great again,  because guess what, America is already great, and that slogan is just coded language that means  go back to the time before a black man was president.  And don t say it s not, because many of his biggest supporters are white supremacists.If you care at all about the well-being of the many and not just the few   vote blue.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" EVEN MORE White Nationalists Are Trump Delegates, Report Says","The American Freedom Party (AFP), a third-way, white nationalist fascist party, is claiming members of its organization are Trump delegates. Last week, William Johnson, an attorney and delegate to Trump, was outed as the president of the AFP white nationalist and subsequently resigned his position.Mother Jones, who broke the story on Johnson, obtained a screenshot of a quickly deleted Facebook post from the AFP highlighting the breaking story, in which a commenter says,  Mother Jones? This page is liberal nonsense.  The AFP then commented,  Of course they are but here is what they don t know: we have more delegates. Johnson told Mother Jones that he himself knows of one other AFP member being selected by a state party to attend the RNC, and that he is an honorary delegate but kept his identity secret:Johnson said there are additional white nationalist Trump delegates who have been in touch with movement leaders, though  I don t actually know who they are. There are people who are surreptitious,  he said. Right now people are still a little bit afraid because they will have the same reaction that happened to me,  Johnson explained.  We just have to give it a few more months before people feel comfortable. With Trump garnering 1,161 delegates (so far), there s no telling how many of them are affiliated with the AFP or any other white nationalist association. Seeing as though one delegate has been outed as a white nationalist and another a pedophile, the public should expect more  comfortable  bigots and weirdos to be outed. So far, according to Johnson, there are at least a handful or more white nationalists picking the candidate for a major party candidate.After Mother Jones broke the story on this, Rachel Maddow got hold of it, further spotlighting that the Trump campaign may actually be filled with even more racist bigots than previously thought.More Trump supporters are doing their part to  Make America Great Again.

 HORRIBLE News For Do-Nothing GOP: Americans Support Paid Family Leave Across Political Lines,"Republican lawmakers oppose paid family leave. But the majority of Americans say they support it, which is bad news for the GOP.As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders vie for the Democratic nomination, one of their shared interests includes support of a federal law that mandates paid family leave.Paid family leave would allow workers to take time off to care for a newborn child or deal with any other family illnesses without having to worry about not getting a paycheck to take care of the bills.The Family and Medical Leave Act already requires employers to give workers 12 weeks of leave, but the only drawback is that the leave is unpaid, which means many workers can t afford to take that much time off if any at all. Paid leave would change that.Three states already have such a law on the books and other states are poised to follow suit. However, because Congress is controlled by Republicans, the effort to pass a federal mandatory paid leave law has gone nowhere because of GOP obstruction.But as the idea becomes more and more popular among Americans, Republicans may be forced to fall in line, and a new poll makes it clear that the GOP should start paying attention to what the people want.According to the Associated Press,An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Friday said 72 percent support paid family leave. Democrats were more likely to back it, but Republicans also expressed strong support. Overall, support was stronger among people age 40-64 and among women.Strong support among Republicans means that GOP lawmakers may have no choice but to throw their support behind the effort if they want to make their constituents happy.In Michigan, which is controlled by Republicans at the moment, Mary Jo Morelli says she supports paid family leave because  I feel that in the U.S., we need to realize that employees, or the workers, can t really do the best job possible if you are worrying about a family member. Pushing for paid family leave would put Republicans in a difficult spot since they would rick losing their corporate sponsorship if they side with workers on the issue. And if they chose to side with corporations, they risk being booted out of office by the voters, which means the issue has enough power to flip state legislatures into Democratic hands if enough voters are made aware of the campaign to enact paid family leave.The Associated Press reports that despite such a law existing in California about 44 percent had never heard of it. That means people in every state need to be educated about paid family leave and how it can benefit them so that the fight can be taken more seriously by lawmakers.Because a happier, healthier workforce is what is best for business and America.Featured Image: Pete Souza ",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You’re Gonna Want To Hear Trump Saying He Wanted Blacks Vs. Whites On ‘The Apprentice’ (AUDIO),"Throughout this presidential race, Donald Trump has said a number of racist things that have drawn outrage from those who have a soul and merriment from those who are pure evil. Some were wondering if Trump has just been saying these things to pander to Republican voters, but new audio reveals he s always done some pretty racist things.For instance, back in 2005 while on Howard Stern s radio program, Trump brought up the fact that he put thought into doing a season of The Apprentice that would feature black people versus white people. Fortunately, NBC knew that idea wasn t going to fly.Trump told Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers: On  The Apprentice there was a concept, okay, thrown out by some person, nine blacks against nine whites. And it would be nine blacks against nine whites, all highly educated, very smart, strong, beautiful. Do you like it? Do you like it, Robin? Quivers responded: I think you re gonna have a riot. But Trump being Trump, said: It would be the highest-rated show on television. Then when Stern asked: Very dark blacks, or light-skinned blacks? Trump responded with,  assortment  against whites. After Trump admitted that NBC didn t like the idea (duh) and Stern very astutely made the prediction it would cause tension, Trump declared that it wouldn t cause racial tension, saying: It would be handled very beautifully by me. Because, as you know, I m very diplomatic  Also, I think you d have 35 million people a night watching. Adding: There s something wrong with it, but I don t know, maybe we should think about it. It seems as if this was much more than a passing thought or idea in the production office for The Apprentice. Trump clearly put a lot of thought into how he might be able to make this idea fly and get greenlit.So, if you had any remaining doubt that Trump might not actually be racist, this should clear things up for you.

 WATCH: Colbert Devises Perfect Advertisement For Trump And The GOP Convention,"If America is going to end the day Donald Trump takes the nomination at the GOP convention, Stephen Colbert was not going to miss out on mocking it.During the Late Show on Thursday night, Colbert relentlessly mocked the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for running his campaign like a reality show because he wants to wait until the convention in Cleveland to announce his vice presidential running mate. It s an apt metaphor, because this year s Republican convention will be the series finale of America,  Colbert quipped.  I can t wait to see the  in memoriam  reel for liberty. With that said, Colbert and his team put together a hilarious ad fittingly describing the convention and how it might go down. In short, just like a monster truck rally. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday   July 18-21, a four-day television event that s going to rock what s left of America. It s the Trump Republican National Convention. There s going to be yelling, angry white men, hats with words on them. Watch Donald Trump rope and brand a naked Ted Cruz   but that s not all. Touch real brains at Dr. Ben Carson s  freakatorium,  and don t miss the marital cage match   three wives enter, one wife leaves. And someone will be punched. Plus, Donald will announce his running mate, Truckasaurus. July 18-21, come one, come all   unless you re a Muslim or a Mexican or a woman who s not a  10. Here s the video:Yeah, that s definitely the perfect way to think about the Republican National Convention. It s nothing more than a glorified monster truck rally for redneck racists who want to see America come to an embarrassing end.Hopefully, most Americans are watching the GOP s Trump circus in utter horror and will be highly motivated to vote in November against it. If not, we all better get ready to kiss civilization goodbye.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Pregnant Women Infected With Zika TRIPLES While Republicans Refuse Funding In Effort To Hurt Obama,"The party that claims to be  pro-life  sure has a funny way of showing it. This week, the CDC released a dire report on the spread of the devastating Zika virus in the United States which found that the number of confirmed cases in pregnant women has ballooned to 157 in a matter of months. The disease which has only a mild effect on adults has been shown to lead to major birth defects in children, including a major risk of microcephaly.How did Republicans in Congress respond? By underfunding the fight   and then earmarking it for next year (and only if Democrats to agree to slash welfare funding of course).On Tuesday, the Senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on Thursday of $1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects. Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts.By next year, the number of cases will likely be in the thousands and the already lowball funding will be even less effective. If that sounds like a truly idiotic plan, experts agree and have condemned it. In response to which one Republican whined,  We will have hundreds of millions of dollars in that bill for next year s Zika response, so to suggest that somebody is being shortchanged the money is just being prudently laid out at the appropriate pace and paid for along the way.  (Note:  Hundreds of millions  is less than $1.9 billion.)Is right now really the time to get  serious  about stewardship of the federal deficit?  Absolutely!  say Republicans who may have just realized they only have a dwindling number of months to stick their thumbs in President Obama s eye and can t miss this opportunity.A month ago, a deal was almost hammered out to provide about half of the $1.9 billion Obama had asked for, but that fell through when Republicans tried to use the spending bill to derail the unrelated Iran nuclear deal. When it became clear that Democrats were not going to destroy the historic multinational deal just because Republicans had Zika-infected hostages, the Republicans dropped the bill entirely   and any pretense of actually caring about the victims of Zika. Their new option, put forward by the House GOP, offers just $662 million and is worse than the original in every way; partly because, as mentioned above, it won t even kick in until next year.While Republicans play these games, Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, has been emphatically insisting that time is crucial and that defunding other programs to move the money around is monumentally idiotic. You can t rob Peter to pay Paul. That s no way to fight an epidemic,  Frieden said.  Let down your guard in one place, stop fighting one challenge and threat to Americans here to fight it better there   that s not a way to keep Americans safe. Which, of course, is of very little concern to Republicans in Congress. Keeping Americans safe has always taken a backseat to blocking any opportunity for Obama to  win.  If that means putting the lives of thousands of women and their unborn children in jeopardy, well, that s a small price to pay for not having to go back home and look a Tea Party voter in the eye while explaining why he or she worked with the president on anything.If the Zika virus could vote, it would surely support the Republican Party.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Alabama’s Only Gay Rep Just Dropped A Devastating Truth Bomb On The Bathroom Bigots,"Alabama State Rep. Patricia Todd (D) made waves earlier this week when she dressed her thoughts up in an extremely articulate op-ed for AL.com that addresses the current  controversy  over where people should pee. Rep. Todd, the only openly gay lawmaker in Alabama, has had just about enough of the ridiculous rhetoric the right has been spewing about men dressed as women legally entering restrooms to molest young girls.The notion is ridiculous; there s no evidence to back it up. Conservatives, for some reason, have to attach something perverted to anything they feel is sexual in nature. Even though a person born a man who has transitioned into a woman going tinkle in a stall in a public bathroom has zero to do with sex, the right has no choice but to go there. Hate and fear are the only way to maintain a long-lasting bigotry towards things conservatives are too shallow to understand.In response to all of the silliness, Rep. Todd wrote:Recently a fellow legislator wanted to talk with me on the issue and he said he supported the law in North Carolina that mandates people use the bathroom of their birth sex. I asked him how many transgender people he knew personally. His answer, of course, was NONE.Therein lies the root of the problem. Rather than having an open mind and considering that transgender people are just people and not some bizarre offshoot of humanity looking to rape your children, bigots are far more likely to just support whatever law comes their way that will prevent them from ever having to have contact with that which they fear. If they can make our children safe in the place where people expose themselves most then maybe there s hope for us a society.It s so stupid. It s just mind-numbingly idiotic. Todd continues her piece with a short list of facts that if people would just listen to would end this controversy right here and now:It s simple. Go to the bathroom. If there s someone in there you don t want to share that intimate a space with, wait until they leave. It s almost guaranteed that a person who spends a lot of time in public and uses public restrooms regularly has been in one with a transgender person. They are more often than not victims of verbal and physical abuse and will hold it until they find a unisex bathroom to avoid confrontation. What we re doing as a society when we put laws like this in place is proving that no matter how hard we try to evolve as a society, the chains of religion and bigotry will always try to drag us back down.Featured image by Al Drago/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Claims Hillary Was Involved In Disappearance Of EgyptAir Flight,"Giddy with the news that an Egyptian commercial airplane had disappeared on route from France to Cairo, Donald Trump wasted no time in taking an undeserved victory lap for his proposal to ban Muslims from the United States. Unable to contain himself, he also went a step further and blamed Hillary Clinton for the plane s disappearance   because why not?Immediately after announcing that he was positive the plane went down due to Islamic terrorism (a conclusion he came to before even a single fact had emerged), Trump released a breathless statement to the effect that Clinton s lack of support for a Muslim ban was the root of all international terrorism. His evidence: a list of acts of terror that had occurred both before she became Secretary of State and after she left.Look at the carnage all over the world including the World Trade Center, San Bernardino, Paris, the USS Cole, Brussels and an unlimited number of other places. She and our totally ignorant President won t even use the term Radical Islamic Terrorism. And by the way, ask Hillary who blew up the plane last night   another terrible, but preventable tragedy. She has bad judgement and is unfit to serve as President at this delicate and difficult time in our country s history.If one were to take Trump s advice and ask Hillary  who blew up the plane last night?  She would probably defer to the experts, who would tell you: We don t know. So far, the investigation has turned up few clues and has only just begun.Although suspicion pointed to Islamist militants who blew up another airliner over Egypt just seven months ago, no group had claimed responsibility more than 24 hours after the disappearance of flight MS804, an Airbus A320 flying from Paris to Cairo.Three French investigators and a technical expert from Airbus arrived in Cairo early on Friday to help investigate the fate of the missing plane, airport sources said.Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said on Thursday that it was too early to rule out any explanation for the disaster. The country s aviation minister said a terrorist attack was more likely than a technical failure.On Twitter the next day, Trump was again telling his supporters that he was the solution to terrorism.Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2016So far his plans to  fix it fast  include bringing back torture, banning Muslims from the United States, and killing the wives and children of suspected extremists in the Middle East. Those vague policies have already made their way into terrorist propaganda videos and are being used as recruitment tools.On Fox News, which went from Trump skeptic to Trump cheerleader with breathtaking speed, the unanimous opinion seemed to be that acts of terror are great for Trump. The bodies haven t even been recovered from the Mediterranean Sea, and Fox host Stuart Varney was bragging about what this could do for Trump s poll numbers. I also think this may be good politically for Donald Trump. He s already tweeted out, saying this is probably terrorism.He s the guy who is saying, hands off, keep Muslims out temporarily whist we figure out who comes in. An incident of this type is surely a plus for Donald Trump. There is, of course, absolutely zero evidence that banning Muslims from the United States would stop terrorists from hijacking an Egyptian airplane, but why should that stop Fox from running with the narrative? If Trump tweets it, it must be true.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Listen To Ann Coulter Pretend She Likes Jews While Making Vile Anti-Semitic Statement (AUDIO),"Donald Trump s number one fangirl, Ann Coulter, believes we have a superior culture we must keep pure. To that end, she thinks that small pockets of certain types of people in the U.S. are fine, so long as they don t overwhelm our wealthy, white, Christian, European culture. Guess who else she said that about? Jewish people.In an interview with BBC Radio 4, the following exchange took place: Americans don t want immigration,  Coulter said, demanding a complete halt.  They don t want any more. Why can t we have a home? BBC interviewer James Naughtie challenged her:  If someone had said that about Jewish immigration into New York a century ago, would you have approved of it? Oh God, not the Jews again,  the exasperated Coulter exclaimed. That s like two percent of the population,  she added.  That did not overwhelm our culture.' Listen to her her put her bigotry on full display below: Why can t we have a home?  We do have a home. That question makes absolutely no sense   she acts like white Christians are being forced out. Has that ever happened to a culture before? Oh, wait, yes it has, when her vaunted white, Christian Europeans forced Native Americans out of their homes.Seeing as how Christianity was born from Judaism, and Jesus Christ himself was a Jew, she takes an odd position on Jews. But Coulter is one of the worst bigots we ve got   that s why she supports Donald Trump. Despite her enduring love for him though, while Trump was talking about how Israel has no greater supporter than himself during one of the GOP debates last year, she tweeted,  How many f ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States? The implication is that she believes Jews have an outsized influence here. She claims that s not the case, though; she was merely talking about how Republicans act like our Jewish population has an outsized influence. She s not the anti-Semite here; or, at least, on her planet she s not an anti-Semite.That s in spite of the fact that she also said, at the time, that Republicans are merely pandering to the Jews. Who is she pandering to, then? Probably Donald Trump.She says anti-Semitic stuff fairly frequently, and then she puts on her walking contradiction costume when she defends herself: Anyone with a pulse knows I am pro-Israel and against the enemies of the Jewish people. I have a whole chapter in my current book praising Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It s the people attacking me who couldn t care less about Israel or Jews. She ll never admit she s said something sick and wrong. That s probably another reason she s a Trump fangirl. He doesn t admit when he s wrong, either. Sure, the Jewish population here is okay, but she d want them deported in a nanosecond if their population exploded. Her hateful, bigoted self needs the comfort of white, Christian Europeans all around her. Everyone else is a threat.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Tehran Tom’ Cotton Says The U.S. Justice System Is ‘Anglo-American’ And We Don’t Jail Enough,"The U.S. has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world, thanks to an awful lot of really bad conservative policies from the 1970s and 1980s designed to make us look tough on crime. Mandatory minimum sentencing, imprisonment for crimes that don t really require it, and more, has not only put millions of Americans in prison, but has had a disproportionate affect on minorities. Is crime down from 30 years ago? Sure. But Senator  Tehran Tom  Cotton thinks we re actually  under-incarcerating. Seriously. You can t make this stuff up. He actually labors under the delusion that we aren t putting enough people in prison. Speaking to the Hudson Institute about a bipartisan crime reform bill currently before Congress, he actually said: First, the claim that too many criminals are being jailed, that there is over-incarceration, ignores an unfortunate fact: for the vast majority of crimes, a perpetrator is never identified or arrested, let alone prosecuted, convicted, and jailed. Law enforcement is able to arrest or identify a likely perpetrator for only 19 percent of property crimes and 47 percent of violent crimes. If anything, we have an under-incarceration problem. He slammed the pro-leniency crowd, and complained that just a tiny fraction of the federal prison population consisted of people incarcerated for something like drug possession. However, the Federal Bureau of Prisons says that nearly half their prison population is there for drug offenses, which are defined as use, sale, possession, or furnishing of illegal drugs. 16 percent of the state prison population is incarcerated for drug offenses.Cotton doesn t let pesky things like facts bother him, though. What s next? A three-year mandatory minimum sentence for unpaid parking tickets? Perhaps a five-year prison sentence for violating pet-limit laws? Who knows with this guy.Besides all of that, the U.S. has 5 percent of the world s population, and 25 percent of the world s prison population. 2.3 million people are in prison here, and nearly half of them are black.Any guesses as to what Tom Cotton thinks of that? He either hasn t noticed (unlikely), or he s got the racist idea in his head that there s something wrong with black people that makes them commit more crime (far more likely). Something else he said, about unjust sentences, could be interpreted that way: I don t discount the possibility of a manifestly unjust sentence, one so out of proportion to the crime that it shocks the conscience. But that s why the Anglo-American system of justice gives the pardon power to the executive.  [emphasis mine]Anglo-American system of justice? There s really nothing to say about that other than,  Wow, this man is racist. One question this brings up is how much he s getting paid by the private prison lobby to be this kind of a hardliner. Increasing mandatory minimum sentences and other nonsense to ensure high prison capacities is more at the behest of those people than it is a  tough on crime  policy.Cotton, who is the man behind the treasonous letter to Iran a year ago, seems to suffer from a delusion that he s actually studied the issue. His answer to crime is no answer at all   it ll make our societal ills worse. But that s what Cotton lives for. He lives for making things worse.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Humiliates Chris Christie AGAIN And It’s Worse Than Ever Before (VIDEO),"Chris Christie s strange loyalty to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has been questioned since the day he pledged his unwavering support to the business mogul. However, every time Trump insults or embarrasses the New Jersey governor, Christie loses even more of the public s respect. This most recent incident further proves that not even Trump has an ounce of respect for Christie, and is really just using him as a prop to make his campaign events more entertaining for his audience.Previously, Trump has humiliated Christie by basically holding him hostage on stage after the NJ governor endorsed him, and dismissing him like an unwanted child during a Tennessee rally by telling him to  get on that plane and go home . This latest incident just adds even more insult to injury. At a campaign event specifically aimed to help Christie get out of his $200,000 debt from his failed campaign   which is embarrassing enough to admit   Trump decided to make matters worse by teasing Christie about something he s always been sensitive about   his weight.Trump had gone on a rant about Nabisco moving factories to Mexico, and mentioned that he was done eating Oreos. Desperately searching for a punchline, Trump looked at Christie, pointed his little index finger at him and said: Neither is Chris! You re not eating Oreos anymore! The crowd erupted into awkward laughter and Trump tried to  soften the blow  by repeating the joke and bringing himself into the equation. No more Oreos, for either of us, Chris! Don t feel bad! For either of us! You can watch this embarrassing moment unfold moment below:To make matters even worse, Trump also announced,  So you know Chris paid off his entire campaign debt tonight  at the rally, clearly rubbing salt in the wound he continually keeps opening. If Christie had any self-respect after the massive failure of his own presidential campaign, you can be sure that it ll be demolished by the time Trump s campaign is over.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch The ‘Liberal Redneck’ Compare Anti-Trans Protesters To Michele Bachmann On Bath Salts,"Trae Crowder, known on YouTube as  The Liberal Redneck,  has returned again with yet another damned funny commentary on the recent creepy obsession that Republicans have with what people do in public restrooms.Crowder started by taking aim specifically at the new wave of idiots that are invading Target department stores, in order to loudly  protest  the fact they allow transgender people to use the restrooms in their department stores. One case in particular was one where a woman was walking up and down the aisles in target, towing along what appeared to be half of her 12 children she claimed to have.Sympathizing with the woman, in the comedic sense, he said he could understand how with 12 kids she was  crazier than Michelle Bachmann on bath salts.  You gotta agree with his logic. With 12 kids, and having to manage them in a militant Christian household that you KNOW she runs, she s probably crazier than an outhouse rat.Crowder is sick of hearing about how Republicans are going to  take their country back  as well, and suggested that they all move somewhere that religion and government are the same   like Saudi Arabia. Crowder said I know what you re thinking    Eww, they re brown, gross. But check it out: they love screaming, they hate books, they throw rocks at queers   you d fit right in.  What a great point. Right?Watch Trae completely own every person who can t stop thinking about people peeing below:Considering how many Republicans get caught doing bad hings in public rest rooms, you would think that they d be focusing more on their own party, instead of an entire segment of society that already lives in such fear of going to the bathroom they are in-and-out while drawing as little attention to themselves as possible.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Pope Just Called Most American Employers (And Donald Trump) ‘Bloodsuckers’,"Pope Francis is no fan of Walmart or of McDonalds, or really of many American companies. In a powerful mass at the Vatican, he called companies that exploit workers  bloodsuckers  and the people who work there,  slaves.  He also said the employers were committing a mortal sin.During mass at the Vatican, he told a story about a girl who found a job working 11 hours a day for 650 euros ($729) a month, paid  under the table . This is starving the people with their work for my own profit! Living on the blood of the people. And this is a mortal sin,  he said at the service in his Santa Marta residence. Without a pension, without health care   then they suspend (the contract), and in July and August (the workers) have to eat air. And in September, they laugh at you about it. Those who do that are true bloodsuckers.  ($1 = 0.8919 euros)Source: ReutersIt s hard to read those words without imagining that the Pope is speaking directly to Americans. The United States is the only country in the developed world that doesn t offer universal healthcare. Fewer than half of Americans have a pension or even a 401(k). Only about half of employers offer any sort of retirement plan.Before Ronald Reagan, it was standard for companies to offer pensions and even health insurance. Then, 401(k) s which are a gift to Wall Street, came along, and pensions went away as some employers chose to offer nothing at all.Not only does this make the companies  bloodsuckers,  it s a bad business move, at least for companies that value their employees. Because people aren t tied to their jobs with pensions, they are leaving them. The average turnover rate is about 40 percent a year.Now, we know how hard Republicans fight against basic health care for all. We also know how hard they fight against a living wage, but we hear little about pensions, unless it s about companies stealing pensions from their employees. The Pope didn t mention that  bloodsucking  tactic. The fact is, though, that Republicans don t like pensions any more than they like healthcare or paid time off. They are doing their best to end them, whether it be public pensions or through destroying unions.

" Bette Midler Takes Hilariously Vulgar Shot At Mitch McConnell, And It is GLORIOUS (TWEET)","Superstar Bette Midler has been having a high old time this election season taking shots at the GOP, and she continued the tradition today   this time taking a shot at notoriously obstructionist GOPer Mitch McConnell. Using her own medical appointment, The Divine Ms. M hit the senator hard via her Twitter account.Apparently, Midler had to go to the doctor for a routine colonoscopy on Thursday, and decided that it would be the perfect opportunity to point out the senator s obstruction of anything and everything President Barack Obama and the Democrats try to achieve. She hilariously tweeted: I just got home from a colonoscopy. Guess what they found? Mitch McConnell! That guy will obstruct anything!! Here is the tweet:I just got home from a colonoscopy.

Now, it is highly unlikely that this wonderful woman would let that douchebag Sen. McConnell anywhere near any part of her body, including her colon, but this is hilarious just the same. The GOP has obstructed President Obama and his administration at every turn since the moment he set foot inside the Oval Office, and they will continue to do so until he leaves, no doubt. That behavior is pretty much par for the course at this point, so it s a good thing we have the likes of folks like Bette Midler to help us poke fun at the absurdity of it all.Keep up the good work, Ms. Midler.

" Trump Is Now Becoming Chris Christie’s Sugar Daddy, And Yes, It’s As Weird As It Sounds","In what is seriously turning into a bromance for the ages, Donald Trump is now apparently turning into New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie s sugar daddy. Instead of a regular old campaign appearance like he s been doing across the nation, at one rally stop in New Jersey at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory Trump will be charging $200 per person to raise money for Christie s debt from his failed presidential campaign.If that sounds weird, it s because it is. Trump is now doing pretty substantial favors for Christie and it definitely makes one wonder what s up.Political science professor Brigid Harrison from Montclair State University said: This is really unique in its character. This is akin to Hillary Clinton holding a rally to pay off Bernie Sanders  debt, or to Barack Obama holding a rally to pay off Hillary Clinton s debt in 2008. And while it wouldn t be unusual if Trump had thrown a fundraiser for the explicit purpose of helping out Christie, doing so with a rally is found to be very odd by experts.And according to NJ.com: Trump will also appear at a second, private fundraiser Thursday for New Jersey s Republican Party, which still has $525,000 in debt related to legal bills from the George Washington Bridge scandal that engulfed Christie s administration. Tickets for that event: $25,000. Looks as though Trump is really starting to embrace the Republican party and now realizes the need for donations and contributors. All this while he still claims to be an outsider, but looks to be squirming his way into the infamous  establishment  likely noting it s in his best benefit moving forward towards November. He s a businessman and likely sees all of this as some form of deal, because it is. It also makes one wonder what role Christie would have within a Trump administration, because it s becoming more and more obvious that may be the course of action.Who knows, really? And hopefully we ll never have to find out.Featured Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" They Asked Hillary If Trump Is Qualified To Be President, Her Answer Was Epic (VIDEO)","In a CNN interview on Thursday, anchor Chris Cuomo asked Hillary Clinton if presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is qualified to be President of the United States. Her answer was simple and to the point:  No, I do not. Question: ""Do you think Donald Trump is qualified to be president?""""No, I do not.""  Hillaryhttps://t.co/04viDc5G7t  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 19, 2016Clinton then elaborated on her direct answer, and laid out the case she will probably continue to make between now and Election Day.She called the crash of an EgyptAir flight early Thursday an act of terrorism and went on to portray Mr. Trump as dangerously out of step with what a commander in chief would need to do to combat such attacks.She cited his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering American borders, his comments about diminishing the United States  involvement in NATO and his remarks that he would negotiate directly with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, as evidence of how  unmoored  Mr. Trump is on foreign policy.The Clinton campaign has been hammering at Trump s radical ideas and temperament to make the case to voters that he is far too unstable to be given access to America s military and nuclear arsenal. At the same time, members of the intelligence community have already expressed concerns that Trump will even be allowed to receive classified briefings as the party nominees are traditionally given.That message will also likely be amplified in the multi-million dollar advertising and voter mobilization campaign that began this week from the super PAC Priorities USA.The attacks on Trump actually echo some of the attacks made by Democrats in 1964 against Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who is consider the godfather of modern right-wing conservatism. President Lyndon Johnson s ad,  Daisy, speculated that nuclear Armageddon could come if Goldwater was elected president.The ad was so effective, it only ran once. That fall, Johnson defeated Goldwater in an epic landslide, 61% to 38%.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oklahoma Republicans Pass Bill Completely Outlawing Abortion,"If signed, the law would make Oklahoma the only state in the nation where abortion is totally illegal.It s unconstitutional and directly challenges the Supreme Court s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, but Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma passed the outrageous bill anyway.On Thursday, the Oklahoma Senate passed legislation making it a criminal act for a doctor to perform an abortion by a vote of 33-12, which basically outlaws the procedure statewide.GOP state Senator Nathan Dahm, who sponsored the bill, believes it is the state s responsibility to force women to carry every pregnancy to term. Since I believe life begins at conception, it should be protected, and I believe it s a core function of state government to defend that life from the beginning of conception,  he said.Governor Mary Fallin, an anti-abortion conservative, is almost certainly going to sign the bill into law, especially when you consider the fact that Oklahoma Republicans have passed several anti-abortion measures over the last few years.This latest and gravest attack on abortion rights makes it impossible for doctors to provide a legitimate medical procedure that many women need because the doctor who performs the abortion faces arrest and prison.According to the Chicago Tribune:Sen. Ervin Yen, an Oklahoma City Republican and the only physician in the Senate, described the measure as  insane  and voted against it.So even the only lawmaker in the Senate who actually has a medical degree thinks this legislation is absolutely crazy.It doesn t get any more clear how dangerous this bill is than that.Criminalizing abortion forces women to seek unsafe back-alley abortions as they become more desperate to end a pregnancy. And since doctors probably won t risk being imprisoned, it means clinics will shut down, thus depriving women of the option of a safe abortion. In short, Oklahoma Republicans want the state to go back to a time when women died in droves due to unsafe abortions.The Center for Reproductive Rights condemned the bill as a  new low  by Oklahoma Republicans and it is expected that a legal challenge will be immediately filed should it be signed into law.Featured image via Pixabay",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Convention Delegate Just Indicted On Serious Federal Charges, Including Child Abuse","The Trump presidential campaign has already faced a rocky road to the nomination, including the now-defused threat of a contested convention, as well as widespread rejection of the nominee from the party elite (he has had the support of the rank-and-file).Now a stomach-turning criminal charge has surfaced.A Donald Trump delegate headed to the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland has instead been indicted on serious charges.A Donald Trump delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention has been indicted in Maryland on federal charges that include using a minor to make child pornography, illegal possession of a machine gun and illegal transport of explosives.Caleb Andrew Bailey, 30, from Waldorf, Maryland, was indicted late Wednesday, according to a release from the Department of Justice.Bailey was listed on the Maryland Secretary of State website as an elected Trump delegate to the party meeting.The Justice Department said he allegedly tried to send ammunition and weapons through the mail to someone in Wisconsin. When they searched his home they found a machine gun. In the indictment that came down, the Department said Bailey  attempted to use and did use a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct to produce child pornography. Previously, the Trump campaign had enlisted the support of a white supremacist as a delegate in California. William Johnson is the head of the white nationalist American Freedom Party and financed pro-Trump robocalls during the primaries.While the Trump campaign first claimed they had enlisted Johnson s support due to a  database error,  they had to rely on him to voluntarily step down since the deadline had already passed for him to be withdrawn.The Huffington Post reported that the Trump campaign had not responded to them about the allegations against Bailey in Maryland, and it was unclear what they would do about his status as a Trump representative at the convention.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Horrific Texas GOP Platform Is Made Worse By Implying That Most Texans Are Gay,"When you live in a state that thinks the worst things about their school system is open bathrooms and the fact that textbooks fail to show Jesus riding a dinosaur, it s not surprising that that state s Republican Party platform would fail to pass a 5th grade grammar test.Well, it wasn t a test, so to speak, but when the Republican Party released their platform, along with its official stance against all things gay, the tiniest of grammar fails seemed to indicate that most Texans are gay. Grammar nerds, judge for yourselves:Homosexuality   Homosexuality is a chosen behavior that is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that has been ordained by God in the Bible, recognized by our nations founders, and shared by the majority of Texans.We ll get to the fact that this is a reprehensible and probably unconstitutional platform in a moment, but for now, let s laugh.The controversy is over the very last comma. There s a grammatical argument going on,  said Rudy Oeftering, vice president of the LGBT Republican group Metroplex Republicans, who brought the issue to my attention.  Some are insisting the use of commas in the  Homosexuality  plank in the platform could be interpreted as saying that the founders and the majority of Texans are gay. Source: The New Civil Rights MovementEven if we let that slide, Texans should be embarrassed at how poorly written the sentence is to begin with.Needless to say, it s a poorly written sentence in general. Either  truths  should be singular or  has  should be  have,  and  nations  lacks a possessive apostrophe.They should be, but anyone who s ever been subjected to Republicans on social media knows that things can get so much worse.Twitter had fun with the Texas GOP, though:Also, the Texas GOP platform would require Caitlyn Jenner and Laura Jane Grace to use men s restrooms, which seems  problematic.  daveweigel (@daveweigel) May 17, 2016 The Truth is Revealed by the Texas GOP Committee @TexasGOP, The Majority of Texans are Homosexuals! https://t.co/Dz9LAHhFrY  PC Godless Liberal (@TheAntiCruz) May 19, 2016@mikesmith8026 @GregAbbott_TX if Mike Smith is the face of the @TexasGOP then they are in trouble #grammar #spelling #stopsayingthug  John (@JohnsPolitics) July 25, 2015If only this was the worst thing about the Texas GOP platform. They want to abolish the 17th Amendment of the Constitution, which allows citizens to vote for their Senators. The Legislature wants to do it instead.They want to nullify any laws that they think are unconstitutional. This amounts to succession. They also want to defund and abolish the majority of government agencies and anything that might have a chance of saving the environment, but they do want a strong military to kill all the Mooslims. Oh, and they want the gold standard back.By now, we re used to that anti-government stuff from petulant Texans, but the plank on homosexuality is the only one that addresses people directly. Here s the entire paragraph. See if it doesn t make you throw up in your mouth a little. Homosexuality is a chosen behavior that is contrary to the fundamental unchanging truths that has been ordained by God in the Bible, recognized by our nation s founders, and shared by the majority of Texans. Homosexuality must not be presented as an acceptable alternative lifestyle, in public policy, nor should family be redefined to include homosexual couples. We oppose the granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for homosexual behavior, regardless of state of origin. We oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose homosexuality out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values.

 This Trump-Loving NRA Sponsor REALLY Loves Trashing Slain Black Children And Their Families,"On Friday, Donald Trump and several of his GOP colleagues will speak at the National Rifle Association s annual Institute for Legislative Action leadership forum. Without a doubt, the event is going to be overrun with racist, right-wing gun nuts   especially because Bearing Arms editor Bob Owens is co-sponsoring the event.Owens is probably tickled pink that he s going to see Trump at the event, as the two men have tons in common. One of the main similarities between them is that they re both wildly racist. When Owens isn t spewing nonsense about  radical  Democrats needing to be hanged for starting  a civil war  against conservatives and gun owners, he s dabbling in his other hobby   smearing the families of slain black children.Owens has repeatedly targeted and gone out of his way to torture the grieving families of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Jordon Davis with his vile hate speech. Not too long after Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, Owens called the teen  a violent, drug-abusing thug who appeared to get off on hurting people  and  a semi-literate violent criminal. He also trashed the musical about Martin s life, saying that it was an attempt to  whitewash a thug s death.  In 2013, Owens said that Martin s mother had raised a  monster  and that her activism against the Stand Your Ground laws that helped her son s murderer George Zimmerman get acquitted were merely for personal enrichment. Owens said: As for why Fulton and her attorneys and Democratic lawmakers in general want Stand Your Ground laws repealed, that s blisteringly obvious as well. Money.A provision of Stand Your Ground law in many states is that if a person is found not guilty during a criminal trial, then that defendant win (sic) civil immunity, and that keeps the families of deceased street thugs from suing the survivors for millions of dollars in civil court. Owens remarked, Good people   will arm themselves against violent young predators like Trayvon Martin  because  any society that hopes to survive simply has no choice. Owens  attitude toward younger victims of senseless, racially motivated attacks didn t improve over time. When 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot by police officers who claimed they thought his toy gun was real, Owens placed the blame on Rice s family once again. Owens said: The Rice family doesn t care anymore about being responsible after Tamir s death than they did about teaching him to be responsible with realistic toy guns while he was alive. Owens also condemned Lucy McBath for becoming an activist against Stand Your Ground laws after her son Jordon Davis was shot and killed. Owens said,  she has become radicalized, and now travels the nation attempting to strip law-abiding citizens of their most basic natural right as a human being, the right [to] bear arms for self-defense. Owens  complete lack of human decency has been seen throughout Trump s campaign, not only within the candidate himself but also in his supporters. One thing has become clear: Trump really appeals to America s worst, and has gained a massive following amongst racists. Just this week, White Nationalists at The American Freedom Party said that Trump had several KKK delegates that the media isn t aware of. He s gotten the support of white nationalists like David Duke and William Johnson, who admitted that he wants Trump s divisive rhetoric to make racism more mainstream.As Owens has chosen to ignore the fact that racism exists and that racially motivated attacks have become a major issue in the United States, it s clear that Trump s ignorant, hateful rhetoric is the perfect messaging for the NRA sponsor. And just as Trump never backs off from a one-sided feud, Owens isn t going to stop torturing these suffering families with his disgusting comments.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Democrats Literally Scream ‘Shame’ At Republicans For Blocking LGBT Amendment (VIDEO),"House Democrats did something extraordinary today: they broke parliamentary procedure on the House floor and literally shamed Republicans after they blocked an important LGBT amendment from passing.Now this should come as no surprise. Republicans have always been hostile towards LGBT rights, and Democrats have been fighting them on the issue for decades. So what changed this time?Well, for starters, the amendment originally was slated to pass, with 218 members voting YEA, with more than 30 Republicans crossing the aisle to join every Democrat. The bill would have barred federal contractors from obtaining government work if they were found to discriminate against anyone in the LGBT community. This is something that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for years.And it looked as though it was going to pass, and the issue could be a thing of the past.But then the TV voting monitor posted on C-SPAN showed that some of the votes from the Republicans were rescinded. The amendment narrowly failed 212-213. Republicans successfully convinced some of their colleagues to take the pandering cowards  way out and turn their backs on those in the LGBT community, thus giving the green light for federal discrimination.Democrats, rightfully so, didn t like that. After thunderous boos from every Democratic member, they decided to publicly shame the Republican cowards by literally chanting  shame  while pointing their fingers at them from across the aisle.When the chair said  There will be order,  Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore shouted back,  No there will not be. Democrats then set out a witch hunt to figure out who changed their votes. They were:Their offices haven t commented, so there is no telling as to why they changed their vote, who convinced them, and their reasoning for doing so. But if keeping to their history of being bigots, that s all the reason they need   to be bigots.Watch House Democrats put Republicans in their place: Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Louisiana GOP Rep SLAMS Her Sexist Male Colleagues On The Statehouse Floor,"It was an epic shaming they all deserved.When Democrats introduced a bill to increase the age limit on exotic dancers from 18 to 21 in an effort to curb sex trafficking, a Republican proposed a sexist amendment that would regulate stripping so that only women  between twenty-one and twenty-eight years of age and no more than one hundred sixty pounds in weight  would be able to work as an exotic dancer.Democratic state Rep. Walt Leger introduced House Bill 468 and it didn t take long for a Republican colleague to demonstrate that lawmakers aren t taking the issue seriously.GOP state Rep. Sam Jones responded by asking if Leger wants to institute a maximum age as well as the House broke into laughter. Leger responded that he s  open to suggestions  but doesn t want to  comment on anybody s tastes. That s when GOP state Rep.Kenneth Havard chimed in by offering his amendment complete with an offensive sexist remark. In the spirit of this legislative session, I will offer up this amendment as a part of keeping the spirit alive of trimming the fat,  he said. Again, the male GOP lawmakers thought this was hilarious and an appropriate way for a government body to act.Not everyone in the chamber was amused, however, as their female colleagues were quick to shame them and forced Havard to withdraw his amendment in humiliation. I ve got to say, looking out over this body, I ve never been more repulsed to be part of it,  GOP state Rep. Julie Stokes said during her condemnation of her sexist colleagues.  I m going to tell you one thing, the disrespect   and I saw it in 2013 in committee, and I ve never been so disgusted to be part of a committee as I was in 2013, somebody made comments, like,  What if it s a classy strip club like Cheetah s in Atlanta?  That s not the way we behave in this body. Becoming visibly more upset as she continued, Stokes slammed Havard for his amendment and told her colleagues to consider their own daughters. I don t even know what Representative Havard was thinking. That s a dangerous thing to do politically. It was a bad idea  I suggest that everybody in here look at their own bodies and their own daughters.Stokes pointed out that these lawmakers are somehow completely fine with barring women under 21 from drinking and buying a lottery ticket but have no problem with 18-year-olds stripping in a men s club.By the time Stokes reached the end of her remarks, the floor was dead silent and she finished by expressing her disgust over their comments and expressed her wish that they show respect to Leger s effort and to all the women present in the chamber. I refuse the spirit of everything that I heard. And I can t even believe the behavior in here. I think we need to call an end to this. I hear derogatory comments about women in this place regularly. I hear and I see women get treated differently than men, and I m going to tell you what, you gave me a perfect forum to talk about it right now. Because it has got to stop. That was utterly disrespectful and disgusting. I really don t have anything left to say. Here s the video:House Bill 468 came about as Leger explained because  back in October Alcohol Tobacco Control did a sting where they found prostitution and drug dealing in at least 14 strip clubs  in the state.Leger went on to explain that strip clubs become havens for trafficking where teen girls are preyed upon because many of them are stripping because they are desperate to earn a living. That s why Leger and Democrats are trying to raise the age limit and that makes HB 468 a legitimate piece of legislation that is not a joking matter.The sexist pigs of the Louisiana Republican Party should be ashamed of themselves.Featured image via screencapture",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Trump Sinks To New Low, Calls Bill Clinton A Rapist On Fox News","Donald Trump took his campaign against Hillary Clinton to a brand new low on Wednesday.During an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, the conservative host and presumptive Republican presidential nominee attacked Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton, in an effort to defend Trump and his mistreatment of women. Are they going to interview Juanita Broaddrick?  Hannity asked before listing other women who have brought sexual misconduct allegations against Clinton.  Are they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey? Hannity then went into the details of the allegations, none of which ever led to Clinton being charged by law enforcement or tried in a court of law. In fact, two of the accusers mentioned by Hannity have testified under oath that Clinton never made unwanted sexual advances toward them.Then Trump chose to chime in and the interview only got uglier. In one case, it s about exposure,  Hannity continued.  In another case, it s about groping and fondling and touching against a woman s will. And rape,  Trump replied. And rape,  Hannity agreed.Trump went on to attack Clinton by mentioning his 1998 impeachment, which failed despite a hypocritical witch hunt by Republican lawmakers, many of whom have been embroiled in their own sordid sex scandals. And big settlements, massive settlements  and lots of other things,  Trump said.  And impeachment for lying, and losing your law license. You know, he lost his law license, OK? He couldn t practice law. And you don t read about this on Clinton. Trump then took aim at the New York Times for publishing an article detailing how Trump behaved with women in private by conducting 50 interviews in six weeks with  women who had worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants; women who had dated him or interacted with him socially; and women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. Their accounts   many relayed here in their own words   reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. The interactions occurred in his offices at Trump Tower, at his homes, at construction sites and backstage at beauty pageants. They appeared to be fleeting, unimportant moments to him, but they left lasting impressions on the women who experienced them. I was so furious at that story, because there s nobody that respects women more than I do, Sean, you know that,  Trump claimed.  And I treat women with respect. And I have   we all have fun. We all have good times. Here s the video:Of course, Bill Clinton isn t Trump s opponent in this race. Hillary Clinton is. So attacking her husband is as bad as attacking Michelle Obama or Heidi Cruz.It s not only a cowardly attack, it s false line of attack that has nothing to do with the battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. If anything, this makes Trump run for the presidency even more of an uphill climb.70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Trump, and unlike his attacks on Bill Clinton, Trump s own conduct with women is an issue in this election. And that conduct has already been turned into an effective campaign ad and will probably lead to the creation of many more.Featured image via screencapture",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jimmy Kimmel Is Pretty Sure He Knows Exactly Why Donald Trump Hasn’t Released His Taxes (VIDEO),"Many of us are still wondering where the hell Donald Trump s tax returns are.

He shows clip after clip of the reality television star repeatedly telling people how wealthy he is, including how he took a  small loan  of one million dollars from his father. Kimmel then says: What if the reason he won t release his tax returns is because he actually doesn t have any money. He s been goofing on us the whole time. Like he s Joe Millionaire and we re the stupid contestants. Wouldn t that be rich? Very valid theory.

 Laverne Cox Tears Trans Hate To SHREDS In Passionate Post After Edited Fox News Interview (TWEET),"It s become quite clear that as much as Fox News wants to make the appearance of being honest and inclusive, it s very much on the surface, so don t believe everything you see.Recently on Fox News, Megyn Kelly interviewed Orange is the New Black star Laverne Cox. The pair discussed Cox being transgender with topics surrounding growing up, transitioning, as well as her love life. However, many were left scratching their heads that talk about North Carolina s discriminatory law, HB2, better known as the  bathroom bill,  wasn t discussed.Here s the thing   it was. It was just edited out.Well, Media Matters has the edited dialogue and created a meme that Cox passionately posted on her Twitter account to make sure that people know she did, in fact, discuss the horrendous bill. Not only did she discuss it, she tore it to shreds with the truth.First, after being questioned why she didn t discuss the bill, she said:@dfoxfarrington we did talk about legislation specifically North Carolina's unconstitutional #HB2 but it didn't make it to air  Laverne Cox (@Lavernecox) May 18, 2016Then later, she posted what was said: When a trans woman is called a man, that is an act of violence  Discriminatory bills like HB2 in North Carolina misgender trans people  The perpetuation of myths about who trans people are [is] at the root of this  Those bills are about making us not exist.

 Fox Host Already Using Tragic EgyptAir Crash As A Way To Boost Trump (VIDEO),"Just when you think the right-wing shills at Fox News couldn t possibly get anymore despicable, they go and do just that. By now, everyone has heard of the tragic crash of EgyptAir flight 804 in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea after it disappeared from the radar Wednesday night en route from Paris to Cairo. While the rest of the world is reeling from this tragic event, Fox Business host Stuart Varney is busy trying turn it into a way to help elect Donald Trump.Appearing on Fox and Friends less than 24 hours later, Varney insisted that this plane crash would somehow encourage the refugee crisis.  He went on to say: I also think this may be good politically for Donald Trump. He s already tweeted out, saying this is probably terrorism.He s the guy who is saying, hands off, keep Muslims out temporarily whist we figure out who comes in. An incident of this type is surely a plus for Donald Trump. So, in other words, it seems that this imbecile is actually glad that this plane crashed and all of these people lost their lives, just since it helps Trump and makes people more determined to ban Muslims from America than ever. His statements are absolutely disgusting, but, then again, what can we expect from a Trump supporting Fox host?I swear, these people never cease to amaze me with how low they will sink. For once, Fox needs to do the right thing and make Stuart Varney apologize for these appallingly insensitive statements.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Small Government’ GOP Rep. Wants A Law To Dictate Exotic Dancers’ Max Weight,"Bill 468, something that the Louisiana state legislature has been working on, deals with strip clubs and will maintain the state s current laws that regulate those clubs. It does, however, add a new regulation: All dancers must be at least 21 years of age if the club serves alcohol. Makes sense.One lawmaker, however, saw that and just had to stick his own amendment in there that would also regulate the dancers  weight. According to Rep. Kenny Havard (R), dancers between 21 and 28 should also weigh no more than 160 pounds.Right, because regulating women s weight is totally okay in a world where women are judged more on their appearance than on anything else. It s also totally okay coming from a guy who claims he s making a point about government overreach. Sure.Havard claims he did this as a joke, much like the proposals in other states that would regulate how men get things like Viagra in protest of laws restricting access to birth control for women. After all, regulating any business, even strip clubs, is massive government overreach with the tiny-government crowd. Dear Kenny here made a very bad joke.He also failed miserably to make his point   the bill itself passed 96-0, meaning it had broad, bipartisan support, and that Havard himself voted for it after pulling his own little  protest  amendment out of the bill. If he could vote for it without that amendment that was supposed to make a point, then he must actually not see it as government overreach.The whole purpose of Havard s amendment is this: Havard, who immediately pulled the amendment, [said] he doesn t regret the  joke  and called it satire   not sexism. He said he meant for the amendment to point out that the bill teeters on overregulation. Supporters of the bill say that they are trying to protect teens from human trafficking. It has won bipartisan support through the legislative process. Okay, so it s sexist satire and a sexist joke. It doesn t matter what Havard claims, he clearly doesn t understand sexism at all. There is nothing non-sexist about suggesting that we should regulate women s weight, even as a joke. Fortunately (or unfortunately for him) he brought the wrath of all his colleagues down onto himself, which is what caused him to pull the amendment. Can t have everyone mad at you for being a raving, sexist hypocrite after all.Exotic dancers actually further the sexual objectification of women, and for a man to say that these dancers, especially if they re young, should be svelte and slender under law sounds more like he wants to enshrine in law that the only women who fit his ideal of sexy and beautiful are the ones who get to be exotic dancers. A joke, a piece of satire, can still be horribly sexist. That s what Havard is and has done. He s outed himself as a sexist pig.Image By Jeffrey Schwartz.

 Dying GOP Senator Spent Final Days Apologizing To Muslims For Trump’s Hate,"Former Utah Senator Bob Bennett lay in a hospital bed fighting a losing battle against pancreatic cancer and the ravages of a stroke, but in his last days he wanted to atone for the damage Donald Trump has done to Muslims in America.Instead, with a slight slurring in his words, Bennett drew them close to express a dying wish:  Are there any Muslims in the hospital?  he asked. I d love to go up to every single one of them to thank them for being in this country, and apologize to them on behalf of the Republican Party for Donald Trump,  Bennett told his wife and son, both of whom relayed this story to The Daily Beast.Bennett served in the Senate for three terms, but his vote in favor of TARP left him vulnerable in the 2010 wave and he lost to Tea Party supporter Mike Lee.In his last days he also spoke to the Deseret News newspaper in Utah and told them,  There s a lot of Muslims here in this area. I m glad they re here. Over the course of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Muslims. He spoke out in favor of a ban on Muslim travel to the United States, and argued for a system to track Muslim citizens. His Islamophobia brought the ire of newly elected London mayor Sadiq Khan, who is Muslim.Khan told Time magazine,  If Donald Trump becomes the President, I ll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith, which means I can t engage with American mayors and swap ideas. Conservative tacticians thought those sorts of tactics would win London and they were wrong. I m confident that Donald Trump s approach to politics won t win in America. Unfortunately, Trump s ideas on Muslims have proven popular with a majority of Republican voters, even those who didn t support Trump in the primaries.Senator Bennett died on May 4.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Campaign Accidentally Reveals How Donald Trump Isn’t Even Qualified To Be Vice President (VIDEO),"Oops. While the media is still talking about the fact that Donald Trump refuses to release his tax returns, his campaign has revealed that his vice presidential pick will be much better vetted than the man wanting the top of the ticket. His VP candidates will have to show their tax returns.Here s the video:Trump defenders will make the point that showing tax returns is not a legal requirement to run for president, but most do and there are good reasons for it, especially with a candidate like Trump.Trump s entire campaign, and his following, has been built upon the idea that he s a magician with money. He s such a money maven he can force unwilling governments to build a wall against their own people. Trump talks a lot, but without seeing his tax returns, we have no idea how much money he has and how he is spending that money. This, while he s demanding complete transparency from Hillary Clinton, and now, from his VP candidates.The MSNBC report went on to say that Trump doesn t particularly care about his VP pick s views on any given issue   that there won t be a litmus test on abortion, LGBT rights or any of the other hot-button issues, but based on all around views.It is pretty normal that Trump would require the tax returns of any candidate, but face it, the odds of his Vice President having the nuclear codes or the keys to the treasury are pretty slim. It s Trump that people are being asked to support, not some, as of now, vague idea of a VP candidate. This is a bit like the twice divorced candidate demanding that his VP pick be married to his or her (probably his) first spouse. It s like Trump demanding that they have a great haircut or like him demanding decorum from his picks. Trump is asking his VP picks to jump through more hoops than he will. This is just more proof that Trump is running for dictator, not president.Featured image via Andrew Burton at Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Being Transgender Could Soon Mean You’re A Sex Offender In Arkansas If GOPer Gets Her Way,"Some people like to create solutions to problems that just simply do not exist, and this time around it s a  solution  to a non-existent problem that insinuates individuals who are transgender are somehow sex abusers or pedophiles and are sneaking into restrooms to harm people. We re seeing transphobic legislation in North Carolina, and now Arkansas looks to be trying to add to the discriminatory hate.These legislative actions are nothing but hate, because laws already exist on the books that don t allow assault or intrusion of privacy. These laws and proposals are just purely anti-transgender bigotry.That doesn t seem to be stopping Republican Arkansas State Senator Missy Irvin, who, according to a blog at Arktimes.com: Looks like Sen. Missy Irvin will win the race to the bottom. A reliable source has seen an amendment Irvin has drafted for a minor bill aimed at clearing up a problem in a sexual indecency law (a Supreme Court ruling says the language doesn t currently apply to guardians of children). Her amendment says anyone who is caught in a bathroom whose gender doesn t match their birth certificate will be charged as a sex offender. New low: Arkansas plans to make trans people sex offenders for existing. pic.twitter.com/KSeNTSEeSX  Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) May 18, 2016What the actual fuck?Not only does she seem to be trying to make transgender individuals criminals, she s allegedly trying to do so by sneaking it into another law. She apparently doesn t think trans people deserve the right to pee in peace. And how exactly does Irvin propose enforcing this sort of thing? The bathroom police? Does she intend of having bathroom attendants in every bathroom across the state asking to see birth certificates while simultaneously also asking everyone to drop their pants or lift their skirts? What s going to determine who gets checked? Short hair? Long hair? Intuition? The whole thing is just absolutely ridiculous.Aren t there actual problems that need to be solved? Infrastructure, education, healthcare? This is really getting absurd. Transgender individuals aren t criminals. They are human beings living their truth and should be lifted up, not torn down.Featured Photo by Sara D.

 Woman Who Worked For Trump Warns “He HAS To Be Stopped” (VIDEO),"Barbara Res worked for seven years as the head of construction for Donald Trump s company and she just told MSNBC s Chris Hayes  he has to be stopped. Barbara Res on her former boss, Donald Trump: ""He has to be stopped"" #inners https://t.co/gLOKoF3NzK  All In w/Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) May 19, 2016Res, who oversaw the construction of Trump Tower and now supports Hillary Clinton, explained to Hayes that Trump  will put our country back thirty years  and  will be bad for our country. She added,  I don t think he has the experience to be president, or the political knowledge to be president.  Res also said Trump s policies are  very backward, very anti-woman, very anti-woman  and very  anti-progress. She served as an executive vice-president with the Trump Organization from 1984-1991, and wrote a book a few years ago about her experiences, All Alone on the 68th Floor: How One Woman Changed the Face of Construction.She also recently spoke to the New York Times about the danger she sees in Trump s candidacy. I couldn t imagine him ever doing a job where he would be beholden not to one person but 300 million,  Barbara Res said in an interview with The New York Times. I think he thinks he s going to be king. Res, who supports Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, said Trump seems to think he can just decree things that a president can t, noting there are three branches of government that work together. I don t see him getting away with all these things that he says he s going to do,  she said.Over his campaign, Trump has promised to do several different projects that would need Congressional support and spending to execute like building a wall on the southern border or banning Muslim travel to the United States, but has never bothered to explain how he would practically get them done, or even explain if they would be legal. During the Republican primary, those promises weren t a problem for Trump, but the general election is unlikely to be as forgiving.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Hagee: Vote For Trump Or Face The Wrath Of God (VIDEO),"It s funny how extreme right-wing Christians always think they know what their God is thinking about politics, especially since most of the candidates who say that God told them to run for president never even get the nomination, much less become president. Well, another such right-wing Christian has added his voice to this narrative: Pastor John Hagee. On the Tuesday edition of his show Hagee Hotline, the fiery preacher issued a dire warning: Vote for Donald Trump in November, or God will come for you. Hagee warned that  God will not hold us harmless,  and that voting is an imperative duty. He continued to rant: I m going to vote for the candidate that s going to make the U.S. military great again. I m going to vote for the party that is going to solve the immigration problem, not the one that has created the immigration problem. I m going to support the party that brings jobs back from China   I m not going to vote for the party that has betrayed Israel for the past seven years. If you can read a newspaper, you know who I m talking about. No candidate is perfect, but I want you to go vote and may God give us a leader who has the courage to put America first and stand up for we the people. Now, I don t know about you, but this sounds an awful lot like a preacher putting politics into religion to me. If Hagee s ministry is tax exempt, he needs to lose that status if he can t stop the politicking. Further, no higher power   if one were to actually exist   would want a dangerous, racist, sexist, xenophobic narcissist as the leader of the free world.This election cycle sure has brought out the nutjobs, all thanks to the likes of Donald Trump. If that man wins, we re ALL going to need some divine intervention for sure.Watch the video of Pastor Hagee s comments, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Former Obama Advisor Rips Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Apart For Attacking Sanders (VIDEO),"If you ask members of the Democratic Party who is to blame for the rift in the party many of them will place the blame on Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz   including former Obama advisor Van Jones.As the leader of the party, the last thing Schultz should be doing is criticizing one of our candidates, but she did. On Tuesday, Schultz told CNN s Wolf Blitzer that Bernie Sanders was condoning violence after the Nevada Convention erupted in chaos: [Sanders ] response was anything but acceptable. It certainly did not condemn his supporters for acting violently or engaging in intimidation tactics and instead added more fuel to the fire. It is never OK for violence and intimidation to be the response to that frustration. That s what happens with the Trump campaign. We can never resort to the tactics that they engage in. On Tuesday evening, Van Jones slammed Wasserman-Schultz s comments and said she is making the rift in the party worse: If you re gonna come out, you re gonna talk about violence, and you re the DNC chair, you ve gotta be fair about it. I think she made it worse. We need to bring these people together   that did not happen First of all, Bernie did say in his statement that he was against the violence. Also, if you want to talk about violence, only one person s been arrested; it was a Hillary Clinton supporter, Wendell Pierce, arrested for assaulting a Sanders supporter. Jones is spot on. First of all, as I said, the only thing she should be doing is bringing our party together and frankly, she has failed miserably. Second, can Sanders supporters be obnoxious? Yes, but so are Clinton s. To say that Bernie Sanders is anything like Trump is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Trump actually tells his supporters that he would hit someone if he could. He encourages violence at his rallies.As a person who has been to a Trump rally and a Sanders rally, I can tell you that the difference between the two atmospheres is like night and day. Bernie s was peaceful while Trump s was full of people hurling insults. The Nevada Convention got a little heated, but it was still nothing like a Trump rally. Schultz comments are a perfect example of why some people believe she favors Clinton over Sanders. Did she compare Hillary to Trump because one of her supporters hit a woman? No she did not. So, she should have kept her mouth shut about Bernie.I hate do not believe in the Bernie or Bust movement, but I do know that the leader of the DNC damn sure isn t helping matters. We are never going to get through to  Busters  with this kind of divisive nonsense.Watch Jones  comments below:Featured image via Leigh Vogel/Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Christian Charity President Embezzled The Entire Fund To Finance Sex Addiction,"One of the tenets of Christianity is  Thou shalt not steal,  but, apparently, Jon S. Petersen s pastor never bothered to tell him that.On Monday, Petersen admitted to a federal judge that he has stolen almost all of the money people have donated to World Ambassadors, Ltd., the charitable organization that he has been the president of for years. He pleaded guilty to one count of filing a false tax return   a crime that could lead to a three-year prison sentence, restitution and a $250,000 fine. The reason for his thievery? He has a sex addiction:In his plea deal, Petersen admitted that he moved $475,000 in donations from the charity to his personal checking account between 2010 and 2014, draining virtually all of its funding, prosecutors said. The group had about three dozen contributors annually. The guilty plea concerned his personal 2013 tax filing, when he failed to report $114,000 diverted from the group as taxable income. The charge carries up to three years in prison, and Petersen may be required to pay restitution to the group s donors.Petersen said he struggled with a sex addiction over the last decade and used the donations to pay for it.I don t think Jesus would approve of this behavior.More than thirty people donated a total of $476,466 to the organization, and Petersen moved $475,555 of it to his personal accounts. What s even more alarming is the fact that this wasn t the only money he was using to feed his supposed sex addiction. He said that he was also using his home s equity and credit cards to pay for it.Think about this for a moment, not just about the Christian hypocrisy, but he probably paid half a million dollars for sex. Whoah.Now, sex addiction is a real thing and we really shouldn t laugh about it (I know it s hard   no pun intended). According to Recovery Ranch:Sex addiction, also known as hypersexual disorder, is characterized by persistent and escalating sexual thoughts and acts that have a negative impact on the individual s life. Sex addicts struggle to control or postpone sexual feelings and actions. Most sex addicts do not know how to achieve genuine intimacy, forming little or no attachment to their sexual partners. Eventually, the pursuit of sex becomes more important than family, career, and even personal health and safety.Just like any addiction it can take over and destroy someone s life. If he is telling the truth, that is definitely what happened here. However, if he is using this as an excuse (which is entirely possible) to cover up his crimes, I hope the judge throws the book at him   not the Bible, but that would work too.Find out more about sex addiction here.Featured image via Wdea.am",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Terrifying Truth About Trump’s 11 Potential Supreme Court Nominees,"Cow towing to the conservatives who think he isn t pure enough (yes, those people exist), Donald trump, the nominee for the Republican Party, released the names of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees he would appoint should be elected.Calling them  Great conservatives judges, great intellects, the people that you want,  Trump promised voters for months he would release  the list  and today we got it.They are:Well, there they are. Eleven judges, anti-women, anti-voting, anti-education, anti-separation of church and state ideologues.

 Mitt Romney’s Effort To Stop Trump Ends Just Like His 2012 Bid For The White House Did,"Man, it has got to suck to be Mitt Romney. We all fail, life is full of ups and downs, wins and losses, but nobody fails as hard and as publicly as Romney has in recent years.On Wednesday, Yahoo News reported that Mitt Romney has ended his attempts to recruit a Republican to run as an Independent against Donald Trump in November:There are signs of concern with Romney s inner circle that his role in the  stop Trump  effort is being exaggerated or overplayed. Several key Romney confidantes did not respond to requests for comment for this article, funneling requests to one source close to Romney who said in an email that Romney  is not now engaged in an effort to recruit a third-party candidate. And while Romney remains  motivated to help the  stop Trump  cause,  a person involved in the stop-Trump discussions said that Romney is not calling or emailing any of the people who are still considering a run. A few potential candidates remain, the source said, although none at the moment are  live prospects. Apparently, Romney gave up on his efforts to recruit a GOPer to run against the presumptive Republican nominee when prospective candidates like  Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse said no. Although the #NeverTrump movement is still a thing, fewer right-wingers are speaking out against him. It is entirely possible that Trump s threats against people who were against him are working. Last week one of his campaign officials threatened to blacklist vendors and supporters of the anti-loudmouth billionaire movement.Mitt Romney entered the presidential primary earlier this year by blasting Donald Trump. Some people within the party looked at him like he was a superhero. Here was the 2012 Republican nominee trying to save the party, All hail, Mitt Romney!  Trump, on the other hand, swatted Romney s attacks away like he was a little, annoying gnat. It was actually interesting to watch as a Democrat. How was the guy who the GOP settled for in 2012, really going to save the day?Well, he didn t and now he has failed again. He wasn t able to beat Trump anymore than he was able to beat Obama.Poor Mittens.Featured image Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 OOPS: One Of Trump’s Proposed SCOTUS Nominees Spent The Last Year Calling Trump A Moron (TWEETS),"In an effort to  get serious,  Donald Trump unexpectedly announced a long list of federal judges he says he might pick to replace the deceased Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court should he be elected. One of his top picks (all of whom are white) is Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett. And he s apparently as surprised as anyone.Justice Willett has been pretty clear that he actively loathes Donald Trump. On Twitter, a large portion of his comments are directed towards tearing apart the Republican presumptive nominee. Just two days before Trump released his name, Willett was using a Muppets gif to sum up his feelings on the 2016 election.#Election2016 is brought to you by the letters S, M, and H. pic.twitter.com/ymJLlJO3Mg  Justice Don Willett (@JusticeWillett) May 17, 2016Many of his tweets attack Trump specifically.Low-energy Trump University has never made it to #MarchMadness. Or even to the #NIT. Sad! ? pic.twitter.com/DWcfJOZkPu  Justice Don Willett (@JusticeWillett) March 15, 2016What is the Trump University mascot?  Justice Don Willett (@JusticeWillett) March 11, 2016One from just a month after Trump announced that he would be running (and at a time when most Americans figured Trump s campaign would detonate upon lift off), Willett was already nailing Trump for his thin skin and petty insults.""With malice toward none, with charity for all . . . except for all the losers, clowns, and dummies."" President Donald Lincoln  Justice Don Willett (@JusticeWillett) August 7, 2015And perhaps the very best tweet   and probably the one that will cost Willett the chance of ever being selected:Donald Trump haiku Who would the DonaldName to #SCOTUS? The mind reels.*weeps can't finish tweet* pic.twitter.com/a326AP0mN1  Justice Don Willett (@JusticeWillett) June 16, 2015Willett is certainly no liberal. He worked on George W. Bush s presidential campaign and was appointed a Supreme Court of Texas justice by then Governor Rick Perry. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, for instance, scoffed at Willett and his fellow selectees as being laughably right-wing. Instead, Willett s beef with Trump appears to be entirely based on the fact that, like many Republicans, he can t believe a buffoon like Trump managed to get the GOP to actively support him.Neither can we.Trump s half-baked SCOTUS nominee selection can be added to the growing body of evidence supporting the idea that Donald Trump has absolutely no idea how to run a competent campaign. While the press scrutinizes every minor slip up coming from other candidates, particularly Hillary Clinton, Trump has managed to botch his own PR efforts at every turn. On Cinco de Mayo, Trump threw every bit of common sense to the wind and tweeted out a photo of himself eating a taco bowl with the caption  I love Hispanics!  He pushed an economic plan that economists said would add $10 trillion to the deficit and then promptly retracted it. He  accidentally  sent a white nationalist delegate to the convention. His list of gaffes grows exponentially by the week. The fact that he clearly spent all of five minutes googling his list of SCOTUS nominees is shocking, but not surprising.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Marco Rubio SLAMS The GOP For Obstructing Obama In Surprising Speech On Senate Floor (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, the Senate and House of Representatives voted on bills to combat the Zika virus. Of course, as usual, it turned into an  Us against Obama  fight; however, one Republican was super pissed off about it and slammed his own party for playing games with people s health: Senator Marco Rubio.The Zika virus is a huge threat for the United States, but Congress hadn t bothered to address it until this week. The illness is passed by mosquitos and if it infects a pregnant woman it could cause the fetus to develop severe abnormalities. President Obama has asked Congress to allocate $1.9 billion to fight the virus. The House of Representatives did what they always do and gave the president a fraction of what he asked for   $622 million.The House s refusal to fully fund the bill really, really pissed Marco Rubio off and he blasted them, as well as Senate Republicans, during his speech: I support fully funding the requests made, people say the president s request. Fine, it came from the White House. But it s really the scientists  requests, the doctors  requests, the public health sector s requests for how to address this issue. Oh shit! Rubio said something has been backed by science. He must have forgotten how much his Republican colleagues hate science.The senator went on to say that 112 people have already been infected in Florida, Puerto Rico is being ravaged by it and the Senate needs to take it seriously: Why take the chance that at some point this summer we could have a significant and serious outbreak in the United States of America, and everybody here is going to be back in their home state doing their campaign stuff or whatever you re doing this summer, and you re going to have to come back here and either deal with it and explain to people why, when doctors and medical experts were warning us that this was a significant risk, we decided to lowball it . Again, Little Marco seems to have forgotten who he is speaking to. Republicans do not care if something will hurt the people (HELLO government shutdown of 2013!), the only thing they care about is the fact that the Obama administration asked for the funding. The GOP Congress has one mode: Obstruct. That s it. That is basically what they do from the beginning of their terms to the end of their terms. Hell, they refuse to even hold Supreme Court nomination hearings because they are politicking so hard.Finally, Rubio called out the House for their dangerously underfunded bill: Why are we taking this chance? It makes absolutely no sense. I would also say that while I am happy that today, hopefully, the Senate is about to take action on this issue, I m concerned about what I hear coming from the House their funding measure isn t even $1.1 billion. It s $622 million. Quite frankly, that s just not going to cut it. The Senate ended up passing a $1.1 billion package to combat Zika but that is not enough. It should have been fully funded. Unfortunately, the Republican Congress does not take the health of Americans seriously. If there happens to be a huge breakout, I guarantee we will hear these very same members of the GOP blame it on Obama. Because if there is one thing stronger than their obstructionism, it is their Obama Derangement Syndrome.It was nice to see Marco Rubio actually show up for work for once and do his job. Maybe if he d done that more often he wouldn t be leaving the Senate at the end of his term with his tail between his legs.Watch his full speech below:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Phil Robertson Will Be Donald Trump’s ‘Spiritual Advisor’,"After having backed Senator Ted Cruz, Duck Dynasty s redneck-in-chief and serial bigot Phil Robertson is now saying he s  forced  on the Trump train because the people of the Republican Party have spoken and now want Donald Trump as their nominee:I was forced onto the Trump train, but I am happily volunteering my services for Mr. Trump, mainly because the Republican Party has spoken. The people have said we want Mr. Trump. So Mr. Cruz goes down   I love him   but now I m on the Trump train and I ll do everything I can to help him.In true Republican fashion   sheer ignorance   Robertson says that although he isn t too familiar with Trump s record of accomplishments (or lack thereof), he will definitely be supporting him over Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, admitting,  I m taking my chances not even knowing [Trump s record]. I know the Clintons. I m not sure about Trump. I m with Trump. If that doesn t sum up the sad, pathetic state of the GOP I don t know what does.But it gets even better. Robertson has actually volunteered to be serial philanderer s personal spiritual advisor and thinks America should stand by him: I ll make a valiant attempt behind the scenes, you understand, to sit down with Donald with a Bible in between us and I might can help him along with concepts like loving your enemies, loving your god, loving your neighbor. Even your enemies, forgive them and move on. I may can help him in that area. I can see it now: Trump wins and the camera s panning and his spiritual adviser is me. Is America ready for it? Well, America, are you ready for it? Does it come as any surprise that the guy who thinks marrying off 15-year-old girls to full grown men is supporting the other guy who thinks his 16-year-old daughter was (is) hot?What do the two men have in common? The are both faux Christians who think peddling bigoted and outdated religious extremism will get them the redneck, conservative support. And they re completely right.That s some spiritual guidance right there.

 WATCH: This Is How President Obama And Donald Trump Treat Women,"President Obama is currently in his final year as Commander-in-Chief while Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. 70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Donald Trump while 56 percent of women voted for President Obama in 2012. And it s not hard to see why.An incredible video by Buzzfeed compares how President Obama has treated women versus how Donald Trump has treated women.While President Obama has focused on making sure women and girls have the same opportunities as men and boys and appreciates the role that women have played in making this nation strong, Donald Trump objectifies women, judges them based on their looks, and considers them to be baby-makers who can be cast aside for a different woman.The video begins with Trump telling Celebrity Apprentice contestant Brande Roderick that she  must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees. President Obama is then shown talking about his objection to his daughters not being able to have the same opportunities as somebody s sons.  That s unacceptable,  he tells the audience.Then Trump is shown telling a female reporter that she wouldn t have a job if she wasn t beautiful.At the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, President Obama spoke of how that we have to speak louder than the  voices telling our girls that they re not good enough. That they ve got to look a certain way, or they gotta act a certain way. It continues this way throughout the video. Trump makes a negative remark about women while President Obama praises women and fights for their future.Here s the video via Facebook:That s really the choice we face in 2016. Do we want to elect a president who will fight for women or do we want Trump, a man who has shown utter contempt for women and only notices them if they look like a super model. Because if we want a president who respects and fights for women like President Obama, the logical choice this November would be whichever Democrat ends up on the ticket opposite Trump.Hillary Clinton is taking aim at history as she seeks to become the first female President of the United States.  Human rights are women s rights, and women s rights are human rights,  she said at the U.N. 4th World Conference on Women Plenary Session in 1995.  Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely   and the right to be heard. We need to understand that there is no formula for how women should lead their lives,  she continued.  That is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family. Every woman deserves the chance to realize her God-given potential. Here s the video of her full speech via YouTube.Bernie Sanders is also pursuing the presidency. His chances at capturing the nomination are waning but should he win the nomination he would also be a good choice for women in November.Like Clinton, Sanders has fought for women s rights throughout his career. As the longtime senator from Vermont, Sanders has made women s issues a major part of his policy agenda.Sanders explained his efforts to elevate women to the Washington Post in September. You re looking at somebody who s made a cornerstone, a key part of my campaign, the need for at least three months of family and medical leave; somebody who is fighting to raise the minimum wage over a two year period to $15 an hour, which will benefit everybody, but women actually more than men; somebody who regards it as enormously important that we fight for pay equity for women; somebody who believes that our child care system is a disaster today and that we need to have the best childcare/pre-K system in the world, making it universal and affordable.So I think if people look at my record, I think they will see somebody who has had a lifelong record of support for the women s movement and women s rights. Like Clinton, Sanders also supports a woman s right to choose. When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body, that s extremism,  he wrote on Twitter.  Let s say it loud and clear: women control their bodies, not the government. In short, the contrast between Trump and the Democratic Party couldn t be more clear. Trump is a serial womanizer who constantly spews despicable sexist remarks that should automatically disqualify him from running for president. But so far, conservatives seem to have no problem with Trump s anti-women beliefs and that is why ads like the one below will continue to haunt Trump s campaign.Democratic candidates, meanwhile, want women to be equal and be treated with respect and dignity just like President Obama has been pushing for over the last eight years. And that s why we need another eight years or more of a Democrat in the White House.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Paul Ryan ADMITS He Wants People To Work More Hours For No Added Pay,"Knowing that hardworking Americans need to be paid fairly if they are putting in extra hours on the job   hours away from their home and family, hours above and beyond what should ever be expected   President Obama is now strengthening overtime pay rules.In an email from President Obama, he stated: We re strengthening our overtime pay rules to make sure millions of Americans  hard work is rewarded. If you work more than 40 hours a week, you should get paid for it or get extra time off to spend with your family and loved ones. It s one of most important steps we re taking to help grow middle-class wages and put $12 billion more dollars in the pockets of hardworking Americans over the next 10 years. Adding: This is a step in the right direction to strengthen and secure the middle class by raising Americans  wages. When workers have more income, they spend it   often at businesses in their local community   and that helps grow the economy for everyone. According the Department of Labor, the new rules will do the following:Basically, making sure people get paid for the hard work they re putting in.Of course, Republicans are already incredibly upset that workers will be paid fairly for being overused. Republicans seem to prefer people get overused AND underpaid.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-OH) has now admitted that he s furious with President Obama s new rules, claiming: His regulation hurts the very people it alleges to help. Who is hurt most? Students, nonprofit employees, and people starting a new career. By mandating overtime pay at a much higher salary threshold, many small businesses and nonprofits will be unable to afford skilled workers and be forced to eliminate salaried positions, complete with benefits, altogether. Yeah, more money in people s pockets is always harmful to their well-being, and making it so employers hire more employees if they want don t want to pay overtime is definitely harmful to economy. You know, because adding jobs and people being satisfied with their jobs, which in turn lowers turnover and increases quality, is a bad thing.OR NOT.Let s be blunt, Republicans seem want to make sure employers keep as much money as possible by making sure they re allowed to pay employees as little as possible.

 Trump ‘Clarifies’ Abortion Comments: I Meant That Women Should Punish THEMSELVES (VIDEO),"Every time Donald Trump tries to walk back his  punishment  comments on abortion, he only manages to become even more offensive and misogynistic.In a recent New York Times interview with reporter Robert Draper, Trump made yet another pathetic attempt to clarify the disgusting comments he made during an interview with MSNBC s Chris Matthews in March, where he stated that women should get  some form of punishment  for seeking an abortion. Trump originally tried to correct his comments shortly after by saying only doctors who perform illegal abortions should face criminal charges   which was still a very anti-woman stance to take. Now, Trump has made another attempt to defend his comments   and it s just as bad. Trump said: I didn t mean punishment for women like prison. I m saying women punish themselves. I didn t want people to think in terms of  prison  punishment. And because of that I walked it back. TwitterBut it turns out, every time Trump walks his comments back, it s only because he s receiving backlash and he wants to do damage control   he s not really sorry at all. Draper investigated Trump s claims that he hadn t meant that women should be punished, and discovered that the presumptive Republican nominee was lying through his teeth. Draper reported that Trump initially saw nothing wrong with his remark and refused to walk it back  before giving a statement. It wasn t until numerous media outlets swarmed him that Trump tried to soften the blow with another statement that said the exact opposite. Those two contradictory statements were released approximately an hour apart   but that s nothing new for the dishonest, constantly contradicting and flip-flopping candidate.You can watch Trump s original  punishment  comments below and see for yourself that Trump s claim that it was a misinterpretation is complete bullsh*t. This is a guy who clearly hates women, and will be a major threat to their health, safety and future if he gets the White House.To prove just how crazy Trump is, in the same Times interview, Trump insisted he would do better on women s issues than Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton and  everybody else combined.  He said, Frankly, for the general election I think that s a very good issue for me. Trump still remains completely oblivious that almost three quarters of American women hate his guts. And of course, shaming and telling them that they should punish themselves for having an abortion isn t going to help.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama’s Doing Something BIG To Raise Pay For Millions Of Americans (VIDEO),"Throughout his presidency, President Obama has dedicated himself to exploring policies with the goal of making life better for working Americans and making sure they are fairly compensated for their time and effort.Unfortunately, the GOP has become a major obstacle for the President ever since he stepped foot in the White House. After a Republican Congress made it perfectly clear that they won t even consider a minimum wage increase, the Obama administration was forced to seek out another alternative   and it s finally going to pay off. Thanks to Obama s overhaul on overtime pay   which doubles the salary level that workers must be paid overtime, millions of Americans are going to have more money in their pockets. This is major news, because this law hasn t been changed in over ten years!When Obama first mentioned that he wanted to revamp overtime pay, hardly anyone took him seriously. At his State of the Union address last year, the President said,  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they ve earned.  Then, he unveiled a proposal to raise the income thresholds for those who would be eligible for overtime. It still seemed like faraway goal, until yesterday when the Labor Department finalized those new rules   an initiative that the Huffington Post called  one of the most ambitious economic reforms of the Obama era. Vice President Joe Biden announced the decision on Tuesday, stating that middle-class workers have  been getting clobbered  for decades. Biden said: The American people want to work. They want a fair shot. No handouts, no guarantees. Just a good job at a fair wage. Under the new rules, all workers earning salaries under the overtime salary threshold are entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work over 40 hours per week   which many do. The previous threshold was only $23,660   making millions of struggling, hard-working Americans ineligible. But thanks to the Obama administration, that number will be doubled to $47,476, which guarantees overtime rights for any salaried workers earning underneath that number. Before this was changed, only 7% of Americans were eligible for overtime. And it gets better   the threshold will be updated by the Labor Department every three years to make sure that it keeps up with inflation.

 Lead BENGHAZI Witch Hunter Just Accidentally Admitted Main Conspiracy Theory Is Bullsh*t (VIDEO),"Ever since the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, Republicans have been trying everything within their powers to throw the Obama administration, in particular former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under the bus. However, after several investigations surrounding the attack, it has continuously been shown that there was no wrong doing.Even Fox News reported: Investigation by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee has found that the CIA and the military acted properly in responding to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.The report alleges no wrongdoing by Obama administration appointees.Debunking a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies surrounding the incident, the report concludes that there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria. Yet, the investigations still continued and questions are still being raised to this day.Something just happened during an interview on Fox News, however, when one of the lead Republicans who s been leading the charge against the Obama administration accidentally admitted the truth, but then tried to pivot away.While Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) was discussing the fact that one of the lead investigators for Benghazi just quit because there was nothing more to discover, he seemed to debunk his main conspiracy theory that there was a  stand down  order given, which would have prevented military help from arriving at the compound in time to help.Gowdy said: Whether or not they could have gotten there in time, they couldn t. I don t think there s any question about that. But then clearly pivoting as if to give the illusion that he didn t say such a thing, he adds: Why could you not? Why were you not positioned to do it? Why could we not do a lot of things, Gowdy? Why could you not get a decent haircut that didn t make you look like you crawled out of a Harry Potter novel? The fact of the matter is, he just admitted the Obama administration is in the clear and there was nothing more they could have done to get help there in time.What s most interesting is the fact that Gowdy is now raising questions that Hillary Clinton raised right after it happened with her now infamous line,  What difference does it make?  Because in full context, her response to questioning was: With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? Going on to say that we need to figure out what happened, what we can do differently, and how we can go forward to make sure it never happens again.Gowdy is all out of arguments and the Benghazi attack investigations have been settled. What we need to do now is make sure we keep our current diplomats protected and prevent another attack from occurring. Which is what Republicans should be focused on rather than try to use the attacks as a political posturing move to throw the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton under the bus. Maybe we should have an investigation into how many unwarranted, tax-payer funded investigations we ve had.

 George Zimmerman Launches Despicable Attack On Trayvon Martin’s Parents,"In the wake of his failed efforts to sell the gun he used to murder Trayvon Martin, racist George Zimmerman talked to the Daily Beast and said some pretty horrendous things about the slain teen s parents. They didn t raise their son right,  Zimmerman said.  He attacked a complete stranger and attempted to kill him. Zimmerman pursued and initiated an encounter with the unarmed 17-year-old on February 26, 2012 as Martin was crossing through the gated Sanford, Florida community on his way home to his father s house.Despite being told not to pursue Martin, Zimmerman wanted to play cop and did so anyway despite having no reason to do so. He shot and killed Martin with a Kel-Tec PF-9 9mm semi-automatic pistol and claimed self defense and got away with the murder because of Florida s controversial Stand Your Ground law.Zimmerman has been in and out of trouble with the law ever since, and has avoided punishment each time.Further, in a scheme to make money and use the profits to allegedly fight the Black Lives Matter movement, Zimmerman set up an auction seeking buyers for the gun he used to take Trayvon Martin away from his parents forever, parents whom Zimmerman continued to attack during the interview. Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin did everything they could to capitalize on her son s death,  Zimmerman despicably claimed.  She was never a mother figure to him. Tracy Martin couldn t have cared less about their son. He treated him like a dog without a leash. Zimmerman should have stopped talking at that point but he continued to give Martin s parents advice even though he doesn t have any children of his own. Sure, I m sorry for any parent that has lost a child. That being said, I also believe it s their duty to have an internal dialogue to see what they should have done better and what they should have done appropriately. If he succeeds in selling the infamous firearm, Zimmerman claims he will use the money to fight Black Lives Matter, get revenge on the prosecutor who prosecuted him during his murder trial, and fight against Hillary Clinton. The purchaser is guaranteed validity and authenticity of the firearm. A portion of the proceeds will be used to: fight BLM violence against Law Enforcement officers, ensure the demise of Angela Corey s persecution career and Hillary Clinton s anti-firearm rhetoric. It s not the first time Zimmerman has tried to make money off the murder of Trayvon Martin. He once sold a painting of an American flag for $100,000 on eBay, and conservatives donated thousands of dollars to Zimmerman to help pay his legal expenses.Clearly, this monster has no intention of staying in the shadows of society where he belongs.Featured image via ABC/Wikipedia ",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" CNN Attacks Larry Wilmore, Cancels Appearance For Mentioning Them In Comedy Skit","CNN is slowly slipping off the deep end into the pool of corporate-approved fake news with their latest attack on Larry Wilmore. The comedian gave a bit of a roasting to CNN during the recent White House Correspondents  Dinner, which seemed to raise the ire of company executives. As retaliation towards Wilmore they cancelled an upcoming May 4th appearance on Don Lemon s evening show that Lemon himself set up with Wilmore.Let s look at this in a very pragmatic context for a moment. Larry Wilmore made an absolutely HUGE buzz in the media when he stood on stage next to our first black president and said  Yo, Barry, you did it my nig*a!  There was nobody who wasn t talking about this, and having Wilmore on his show to talk about all this would have been a huge win for Lemon. With all this in mind, you can see how Don Lemon wouldn t have been the one who suddenly cancelled the appearance.No, this was from the faceless executives at CNN who wanted to punish a comedian for taking some arguably light, if well deserved, pokes at their growing joke of a  news  network. There isn t anything Wilmore said which was that serious and hasn t been said before about the network for years now.CNN is here tonight. I ve been watching CNN a long time. Yep. Used to watch it back when it was a news network. I did. What, is it all CNN here tonight?I don t know about you guys, but I can t get enough of that CNN countdown clock. Now we can see exactly when they hit zero in the ratings.Source: Washington PostHe even had a little fun with Don Lemon personally, yet Lemon still invited Wilmore on his own show because he simply got the joke.CNN s excuse for cancelling Wilmore s appearance is that they had to handle the coverage of the Indiana primaries. This was a poor excuse, because the Indiana primaries already ended 24 hours before then. He was never given the offer for a rescheduling either.It s a disturbing precedent to set, especially by one of the big three cable news outlets. Corporate media is becoming more and more consolidated under fewer and fewer owners. If CNN s new policy is to punish individuals who are critical of their increasing bend towards fluff news and false equivalencies, then the last few crumbs of journalistic integrity the network has, as a whole, are about to go completely out the window.Featured image via wikicommons",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox Credits Bush For Obama’s Economic Recovery They Spent 8 Years Saying Didn’t Exist,"After eight years of belly aching from every single Republican about how we have virtually no economic recovery under President Obama, Fox decided that the time has come for Obama to credit   wait for it   George W. Bush for the eight years of recovery we ve had under President Obama.I swear to God, I m not making this up. Just watch the video clip below. Brit Hume gets into it after about one minute. He spends the first minute listing off a litany of Republican talking points they ve used for the past 8 years to prove that no economic recovery existed under President Obama. After this brief tirade, Brit spontaneously shifted personalities and started demanding that President Obama give credit for the economic recovery of the past eight years to Dubya.Brit made the wildly incorrect assertion that because there were signs of recovery before President Obama s economic recovery plan became active, that meant none of his efforts had any effect on the recovery. However, because George W. Bush s smaller bailout packages had already taken effect, they get full credit for fixing the economy. But   and this is the best part   Brit then went on to say that the economy recovered on its own,  because that s what markets do,  and implied that no government assistance was needed at all for it to happen.I know that sounds a bit confusing. It s because it s one of the most reality-free statements made by a Republican in the past eight years.Then there s the unspoken point of Republicans whining for eight years straight about how unfair it is for Obama to tie anything George W. Bush did to the economic conditions during his presidency. They now have decided that there is, in fact, a recovery that exists so now they are rewriting history to say George W. Bush caused it when he wasn t even in office any longer. And that whole part about Dubya not having any effect on Obama s woes? Yeah let s just forget they ever said that.Watch the Fox go completely stupid in two minutes flat below:Featured image via scrapetv",News,"May 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Megyn Kelly Leaves Trump Literally Sputtering After Bringing Up His ‘Bimbo’ Comments (VIDEO),"After a very public falling out, Megyn Kelly finally got her chance to sit down for an interview with Donald Trump. Rather than make nice, Kelly seized the opportunity to call out Trump to his face on some of the disgusting things he s said about women (including Kelly) over the years. His reaction was  unexpected.In the midst of Trump s lengthy interview with Kelly, he was asked about the way he disparagingly called women  bimbos.  For once, Trump, whose face went from orange to deep red, was tongue-tied, awkward and  low energy.  He was extremely off his game   and it was cringe worthy to watch.Kelly brought up Trump s Twitter activity, which often features the candidate for   and it s important to keep this in mind  President of the United States passing along messages from his fans that include sexist, racist, or violent remarks. Trump s defense was lame:  You would be surprised at the ones I don t retweet. Kelly persisted:  Bimbo? Uncharacteristically, Trump could only meekly sputter mindlessly. No come back. No counterattack. Just awkward half-formed sentences punctuated by painfully long moments of silence.Watch the moment Megyn Kelly confronted Donald Trump over the  Bimbo  retweets. pic.twitter.com/ysWETO5nFs  Breaking News Feed (@pzf) May 18, 2016Afterwards, Trump seemed to regain some of his more recognizable awfulness. He claimed Kelly must have been called a lot worse than  bimbo  over her lifetime, so she shouldn t be upset when he does it.Kelly s response was pitch perfect:  It s not about me. It s about the messaging   to young girls and to other women. Trump had no response. His message to young girls and to other women is one backed by sexism and objectification. Kelly may have been called worse than  bimbo  over her lifetime, but Trump has certainly said worse, too.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Next Fox News? Why Facebook Is Sucking Up To Conservatives,"Facebook is in the middle of a charm offensive targeted at conservatives, and is hosting a meeting between company founder/CEO Mark Zuckerberg and conservative media figures like Glenn Beck and Fox News host Dana Perino.The meeting is happening just six months before a presidential election and in the first election where social media sites like Facebook (and Twitter) have become more influential than ever.After accusations of anti-conservative bias began to burn Facebook last week, the social media giant quietly reached out to Republican Party leaders to douse the brush fire.It contacted the Republican National Committee, whose chairman, Reince Priebus, had publicly demanded that Facebook  answer for conservative censorship    and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which had blasted out a fundraising email lumping the ostensibly neutral tech company in with the  liberal media,  according to a GOP source. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP s main House campaign arm, also heard from Facebook, the source added.The firestorm began after a story on the tech site Gizmodo used an anonymous conservative who claimed to be a former Facebook employee as the source for a story alleging that Facebook was excluding conservative news sources from its trending topics area, a valuable source of traffic for news outlets.Soon after the piece came out, Facebook denied the allegations and revealed its internal rules for what sites are featured in trending topics, but the damage has been done.As they have done for years complaining about the  liberal media,  conservatives are now targeting the  liberal bias  at Facebook. Certainly, Zuckerberg appears to personally lean left, and most employees of a modern tech company are not going to be Rush Limbaugh style right-wingers, but the allegation doesn t have much of a leg to stand on. Conservative sites like Fox News have been shown to trend on Facebook.What this ends up being is an influential media outlet who now feels they have to curry favor with the right wing, bending over backwards so that very loud conservatives don t attack them in the same manner they attack the New York Times and MSNBC.Then, as often happens in conservative media, when false stories and lies about the left surface, Facebook will be obligated to trend them and send traffic and aid in the spread of false information   as long as they aren t attacked for  liberal bias. It s an excellent strategy for the right to get what it wants in yet another form of media.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Another Win For The NRA: Court Rules That Cities Can’t Protect Themselves From Gun Violence,"If you ve ever thought our government is completely run by the National Rifle Association, your mind won t be changed by this article.A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled on Monday that any laws that cities or states pass to protect their citizens from gun violence are unconstitutional.The case was about three business partners in Alameda, California, who wanted to open a gun store, but they were denied a zoning permit. The court ruled in the partners  favor, saying that the right to bear arms meant the right to buy arms. If  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  is to have any force, the people must have a right to acquire the very firearms they are entitled to keep and to bear,  wrote Judge Diarmuid F. O Scannlain (a Reagan appointee) for the 2-1 majority, quoting the Second Amendment.  One cannot truly enjoy a constitutionally protected right when the state is permitted to snuff out the means by which he exercises it. All of this makes sense until you realize that cities and states can regulate virtually anything else that s sold. If a city chooses not to allow a bar or a massage parlor, that s their right. It should also be the right of a city to help mitigate crime, and if fewer guns do that, they can ban the sale of guns.Unlike gun manufacturers, though, massage parlors and bars don t have massive lobbying arms to control their every move. These graphs are a couple years old, but little has changed. Most of the NRA s bribery money goes straight into the pockets of Congressmen   236 of them Republican and 25 Democrats.You can bet that it was the NRA who propelled this case to a higher court in the first place.Judge Barry G. Silverman, named to the bench by President Bill Clinton, wrote in dissent, describing the case as  a mundane zoning dispute dressed up as a Second Amendment challenge. Conspicuously missing from this lawsuit is any honest-to-God resident of Alameda County complaining that he or she cannot lawfully buy a gun nearby,  Judge Silverman wrote.The most ridiculous part of this case is that the ordinance that caused the gun store to be turned away doesn t ban gun stores. It simply says they cannot be less than 500 feet from a residence. They wanted to build it 446 feet away.What this means is that as much as Republicans claim to value property rights (and life), when it comes to guns, there are no property rights. If you don t drool over the thought of guns, your right to keep your children away from guns is non-existent because in the United States, it s increasingly becoming guns before people.Featured image by Ethan Miller at Getty Images.",News,"May 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Melania Trump: Reporter ‘Provoked’ Anti-Semitic Threats From My Fans,"Donald Trump s wife Melania has made some shocking comments in regards to a barrage of anti-Semitic remarks that Trump supporters directed towards a reporter. After Julia Ioffe did a profile of Mrs. Trump for GQ magazine, her life was threatened and numerous hateful comments were sent her way on social media.Now in an interview, Ms. Trump alleges that Ioffe brought the hate barrage on herself. I don t control my fans,  Melania said in an interview with DuJour.  But I don t agree with what they re doing. I understand what you mean, but there are people out there who maybe went too far. She provoked them. Ioffe, who is Jewish, received calls from people playing Hitler speeches, told that she  should be burned in an oven,   be shot in the head,  and was sent photoshopped images of her in a concentration camp uniform.The Trump campaign has received overt public support from anti-Semites and white power groups who believe that the candidate will further their goals of racial purity. One white nationalist paid for robocalls for Trump s campaign and was recently selected as a Trump delegate for the Republican Convention in Cleveland, only stepping down when national media began reporting the story.In the same interview, Melania Trump claims that Donald Trump is  not Hitler,  but he has pushed rhetoric about tracking and barring Muslims that come right out of the same playbook that Hitler utilized against Jewish people.Trump s rhetoric on Mexicans comes from the same place, calling them criminals and  rapists,  rhetoric which inspired supporters to beat up and urinate on a Latino man in Massachusetts. Those assailants are now headed to prison.Despite the hate from his campaign, Republicans are now stuck with Trump. He turns off many of the voters the party said it needed to be viable nationally, but did enough to blow out all the other nominees.

" J.K. Rowling Defends Trump’s Right To Say What He Wants, Sort Of (VIDEO)","As a writer, especially as a writer who writes controversial (to some Christians) books, J.K. Rowling knows a thing or two about freedom of speech, so I suppose it s not surprising that when asked about it, she defends speech, even if it comes from someone as  offensive and bigoted  as Donald Trump.In a speech at the PEN America literary gala on Monday night, Rowling used her personal distaste for Trump s demagoguery to make a larger case for global freedom to speak.  Now, I find almost everything that Mr. Trump says objectionable. I consider him offensive and bigoted. But he has my full support to come to my country and be offensive and bigoted there,  she said, noting a popular online petition to ban Trump from entering the U.K.  His freedom to speak protects my freedom to call him a bigot. His freedom guarantees mine. The Harry Potter author s comments came after British lawmakers debated banning Trump from local travel for  hate speech. If you seek the removal of freedoms from an opponent simply on the grounds that they have offended you,  she said,  you have crossed a line to stand along tyrants who imprison, torture and kill on exactly the same justification. Source: SlateHere s the video:Rowling told the audience that she has little to complain about when it comes to censorship, but she did regale the story of a Christian who accosted her.  I didn t know  I m praying for you  could be so intimidating,  she said.She was probably underselling it. Her books (and movies) have long been targets for right-wing Christians, who are upset by the occult theme. Some have tried to ban the books from classrooms, and some have succeeded. She even had to defend her books in court.As for Trump, she s not a fan. In December, she posted this, referring to Harry Potter s archenemy, Lord Voldemort, who is sometimes compared to Trump:How horrible. Voldemort was nowhere near as bad. https://t.co/hFO0XmOpPH  J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) December 8, 2015However, Rowling loves the freedom of speech much more than she hates Trump, so she s willing to acknowledge that he has the perfect right to say the awful and hateful things that make up his campaign rhetoric.What Trump supporters don t realize, though, is that while I, or Rowling, can defend Trump s freedom of speech, we also have freedom of speech, which means we are free to call him pretty much anything we want. We are also free to call his speech what it is: hate speech. The most important freedom for right now, though, is the freedom to vote against him. Or, as she more eloquently put it,  His freedom to speak protects my freedom to call him a bigot. His freedom guarantees mine. Featured image via video screen capture.

 Trump Now Has An EVEN WORSE Excuse For Why He Mocked A Disabled Reporter (VIDEO),"Donald Trump never runs out of new ways to disgust and offend people. Ever since the first day of his presidential campaign, the presumptive Republican nominee has created controversial moment after controversial moment   behavior that has unfortunately won over the hearts of America s most racist, bigoted citizens. However, now that he s beat out all of his conservative rivals and has a more clear view of the White House, he wants America to forget all of the ways he s tarnished his chances of appearing presidential. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Trump tried to reframe a horrific incident that happened last November, in which he made a disgusting mockery of a New York Times reporter s physical disability. It was a cringe-worthy moment that was heavily circulated, and Trump got rightfully blasted for it after it happened   but now, he s trying to deny it. And as expected, any time Trump tries to defend himself, he only makes it worse. Here s what he said: I would never say anything bad about a person that has a disability. I swear to you it s true, 100 percent true Who would do that to [the] handicapped? I ve spent a lot of money making buildings accessible. Is he serious? For Trump to act like he makes his buildings accessible for people with disabilities is absolutely ludicrous   because that kind of accessibility is required BY LAW. This is also coming from a guy who posted a picture of himself eating a taco bowl to show how much he  loves Hispanics    a particular minority that he has insulted and made racist comments toward during his entire campaign. So obviously, just because Trump s buildings are accessible to people with disabilities, that doesn t mean he wouldn t mock or be prejudiced against them.But it gets worse. The Washington Post also reported that after Trump bragged about how his buildings were so accessible, Trump then satirically reenacted the scene, his arms jerking all around, and said he was trying to show  a guy who grovels    Oh, oh, I didn t say that. I didn t say that.  That was the imitation I was doing. Now  is that a believable story? What an idiot. If you need a refresher, here s the original video where Trump made fun of the reporter. Watch this, and see if you think Trump s latest pathetic excuse for his behavior is  a believable story. Corey Lewankowski, Trump s campaign manager (who physically assaulted a female reporter a few weeks ago) has spoken on Trump s effort to rebrand himself: This is deeply personal for Mr. Trump. He will do anything he can to correct the narrative. He wants to point to specific things that are absolutely false about him and go out and talk about them. Well, he s doing a really shitty job so far.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Crazy Alex Jones Really Thinks ‘Transgender’ Michelle Obama Killed Joan Rivers (VIDEO),"Alex Jones of the right-wing site Infowars is no stranger to insane conspiracy theories, and he has come out with yet another one. It seems that Jones is going after our beautiful first lady again, and this time he is accusing her of hiding a secret transgender past. He also accuses her of murdering Joan Rivers. Too nutty to believe, right? Well not for our friend Mr. Jones.Right Wing Watch posted up a video of Jones acting like a complete lunatic regarding Michelle Obama, and it s too insane even for him. He begins: Don t forget, the famous comedienne Joan Rivers said,  Of course everyone knows she s a tranny.  She s dead serious,  She s a man.  Deader than a doornail in a routine operation where basically she had fire poured down her throat and was a fire-breathing goblin. Dead on arrival. Shoot your mouth off, honey, you will die. So, in other words, this lunatic actually believes that Joan Rivers  death is the result of her knowing that Michelle Obama is transgender, so the first lady had the famously funny lady murdered. But wait it gets even crazier, if you can believe it. Jones continued: I really think   her daughters don t look like her   I really think this is some weird hoax they did again, just like he didn t get sworn in on the Bible, it was the Quran,  Jones continued.  All this weirdness, I mean, I used to laugh at this stuff, but man, it s all about rubbing our noses in it. I think it s all an arranged marriage, it s all completely fake and it s this big sick joke because he s obsessed with transgender, just like some weird cult or something. I think Michelle Obama is a man. I really do. I really do. I believe it. This dude does not belong in the public eye. He belongs in a mental institution if he actually believes this. The Obamas could sue his clearly crazy ass for slander, but why bother? The guy is clearly unhinged.

After a bike ride through town on Saturday evening, Clayton decided to cap off his night with a visit to a local bar known as the Beaver Creek Saloon.While there, he overheard Jacob Olson, 26, and Dylan Dygert, 21, say a racial slur. Denny, who is of African-American and Chippewa Cree descent, approached the two men to confront them about it.All seemed to be going well as Denny shook hands with one of the men. But then something changed as the encounter became more heated. The bartender ordered them to take the argument outside. The trio resumed their argument in an alley. Denny turned and walked away and that s when Olson and Dygert attacked. A push, white flash, bits and pieces of pain,  Denny recalled about what happened. Dygert and Olson pushed Denny to the ground and began kicking and punching him while yelling racial epithets at him. They beat him so badly that Denny thought he might die.Even Olson believed he may have left Denny for dead as a witness told police that Olson told someone on the phone that he may have killed someone.Aside from scratches, bruises, and cuts, Denny suffered a broken orbital bone, which he would need surgery for in order to drain fluid and clean out an infection. He also suffered two swollen eyes, multiple cuts on his head that had to be stapled, and a concussion.Olson and Dygert have both been arrested by Sheridan police and are being held on $20,000 bond.Of course, they claimed they only attacked and viciously beat Denny in self defense. However, they didn t know that the incident had been caught on video, which clearly showed that Olson and Dygert went after Denny after he had already turned and walked away from them. In other words, Denny wasn t a threat and Olson and Dygert lied to police in an effort to save their racist asses.Both men face 10 years in prison for the racist attack and hate crime charges are being considered by the County Attorney s Office. And if they don t charge them with a hate crime, the Department Of Justice should do it for them.But due to this disgusting attack, Denny says he and his girlfriend have received tremendous support from the Sheridan community. I do want people to know that the community of Sheridan has been awesome. We ve had people stopping by all weekend and all week, just saying, you know  giving their condolences and helping us out. It sounds like Denny has all the support he needs to get through this ordeal. Let s just hope Olson and Dygert use their time in prison wisely to think about what they did and learn from it.Featured Image: Billings Gazette",News,"May 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Samantha Bee STOMPS Conservative ‘Christians’ Using Their Own History,"In a glorious segment of Full Frontal on Monday, host Samantha Bee took aim at the religious right-wing movement and absolutely destroyed her target.After taking a brief shot at Ted Cruz and his failed quest to capture the evangelical vote that came out overwhelmingly for the  thrice married foulmouthed tit judge who likes Planned Parenthood and thinks Corinthians is a type of car upholstery,  Donald Trump instead, Bee explored how the religious right took over the Republican Party.It all began 50 years after humiliating evangelical failures to ban alcohol during Prohibition and to defeat the science of evolution during the Scope s monkey trial. Bee played a video of Christians condemning involvement in politics. And then something happened in the early 1970s when Heritage Foundation co-founder Paul Weyrich called upon the Republican Party to reach out to conservative  Christians,  whom political Morton Blackwell describing as  virgin timber on the political landscape. Well, technically virgin, if you don t count butt stuff,  Bee quipped.Bee then explained that it was a court case that pushed evangelicals to get involved in politics during the early 1970s. However, she was quick to point out that the case wasn t Roe v. Wade.In 1971, Bob Jones University, whose  Christian  founder once declared that  if you are against segregation and against racial separation, then you are against God,  claimed it had a sincere religious belief against interracial dating so strong that the school refused to accept black students unless they were already married. This violated IRS regulations so the IRS informed the school that it would lose its tax-exempt status. The school retaliated by filing a lawsuit which they would finally lose in 1983 when the Supreme Court sided with the IRS. Bob Jones University would not allow interracial dating for another 17 years until the restriction became so embarrassing they struck it down in 2000.Evangelicals looked around for another issue to use as a rallying cry and decided to focus on abortion while also trying to establish school prayer while trying to get rid of sex education.Bee then issued a disclaimer: Please understand when I say the religious right, I m not talking about people of faith   hashtag #NotAllChristians   but a political movement to harness voting evangelicals to the conservative Republican cause. When Bee resumed her epic history of the religious right, she noted that evangelicals abandoned Jimmy Carter,  the devout baptist farmer who taught Sunday school and helped the poor,  and threw their support behind a  divorced movie star who hung out with Hollywood Jews, sinners, and believers in evolution.  That man was Ronald Reagan. The year was 1980.And that led to a video of Reagan attending a sermon by televangelist James Robison in which he smeared liberals as perverted communists.According to Bee, that s when  the Christian Right and the Republican Party locked eyes and leaned in for their sloppy 35-year tongue kiss. She went on to point out that the GOP s 1972 platform  didn t contain a single reference to God of religious issues. Bee showed a list. which featured the GOP elephant mascot being raped from behind by a cross, of all the issues Republicans now focus on to please their evangelicals masters, which includes opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.  I hope they sanded that,  Bee said of the cross as the audience laughed.During the final stretch of the segment, Bee pointed out that evangelicals have been losing ground for the last 15 years, especially on the issue of LGBT rights, which is why they have gone full circle by focusing once again on their racist roots by supporting Donald Trump.Here s the video via YouTube.Of course, the rise of the Christian Right as the base of the Republican Party will also be the GOP s downfall as their base gets older and dies off. Donald Trump appears to be their last desperate gasp to hold on to whatever political relevance they once had. But in order for the religious right to lose that effort, Americans needs to vote in November to overwhelmingly reject Trump, his evangelical supporters, and everything they represent.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Noam Chomsky Warns Americans: The GOP Is ‘The Most Dangerous Organization In Human History’ (VIDEO),"Noam Chomsky desperately wants America to wake up and see how destructive Republican values are to the future of this country.In an interview with DemocracyNow, the world-renowned political theorist didn t mince his words when he said the GOP could very well be  the most dangerous organization in human history.  When DemocracyNow s Amy Goodman asked Chomsky what he thought about Donald Trump s unexpected rise as the presumptive Republican nominee, Chomsky explained that the Trump phenomenon was simply an  extreme version of something that s been going on just for years in the Republican primaries. Every time a candidate came up from the base Bachmann, McCain, Santorum, Huckabee, one crazier than the other every time one rose from the base, the Republican establishment sought to beat them down and get their own get their own man you know, Romney. And they succeeded, until this year. This year the same thing happened, and they didn t succeed. The pressure from the base was too great for them to beat it back. Chomsky expertly pointed out that this kind of extremism could be traced all the way back to  the Reagan administration, and that today s Republicans have taken the party s close-minded values to an entirely different level. This has been going on for a generation. And while this has been happening, there s a kind of a vicious cycle. You have more concentration of wealth, concentration of political power, legislation to increase concentration of wealth and power, and so on. [T]he parties have shifted so far to the right that the   today s mainstream Democrats are pretty much what used to be called moderate Republicans. Now, the Republicans are just off the spectrum. Making sure to highlight just how important this election is, and what dire consequences America might be faced with under a Republican president (like Donald Trump), Chomsky told Goodman that today s GOPers are so ignorant, they re basically making it their mission to make the future worse for everyone who has to live in it: [T]he fact of the matter is that today s Republican Party qualify as candidates for the most dangerous organization in human history. Just take their position on the two major issues that face us: climate change, nuclear war. On climate change, it s not even debatable. They re saying,  Let s race to the precipice. Let s make sure that our grandchildren have the worst possible life. Chomsky also noted that the GOP s call for  increased militarization  when it came to nuclear war was something that needed to be confronted, ASAP. He said, There s been nothing this literally, this dangerous, if you think about it, to the species, really, ever. We should face that. Chomsky s comments are dead on   the Republican party has never been more anti-humanity than it is right now. One of the most vile, racist, misogynistic, ignorant members of society is now the GOP s presumptive nominee, and the rest of the party continues to threaten the human rights of minorities, women and the LGBT community on a daily basis. This is a party that is blinded by ignorance and cannot move forward, but is hellbent on making life worse for the rest of us. Their fear-mongering and rhetoric is dangerous, and now it is threatening to destroy the country. And thanks to decades of these horrific attitudes, a racist reality television star is competing for the White House. It is a f*cking disgrace.You can listen to Chomsky call out the GOP at the 17-minute mark in the video below:Featured image via William B.

 Conservative Christian Running For Congress Shares Screenshot With Porn Tabs Open (IMAGES),"Mike Webb is a conservative Christian who is running for office in the hopes that he can represent Virginia s 8th district in the United States House of Representatives as an Independent. Just days after Webb s announcement, his career may already be over due to a careless screenshot that he took and posted to his campaign s Facebook. That s because Webb accidentally left a couple of porn sites open in his browser which can be seen in the image he shared.Here s the screenshot that Webb shared:Here s a closer look at the screenshot:The story gets even more hilarious, considering that Webb was already involved in another controversy. Webb had failed to file his FEC report on time, which he claims that he could not do because of a virus that had infected his computer.The post has been up for 11 hours at the time of this writing. Since Webb posted the screenshot, he has made two more posts to his Facebook page. In the first one, he writes a very long letter of condemnation towards those mocking him. He begins the post by writing,  SEE HOW DIRTY YOU ARE? In the post, Webb writes after that one is far more bizarre. He begins the post by saying  THANKS FOR THE TAB CHECK, RANGER BUDDIES!  This is followed by a Bible verse: For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.  Psalm 100:5The post is accompanied with a screenshot that shows his page s reach. That s because he is proud of the negative attention he has received. Webb goes on to write that the  the Lord  has lifted him up. Apparently, in Webb s mind Jesus has the same mentality as a public relations agent who holds true to the theory that no publicity is bad publicity.Featured image from screenshot via Mike Webb s campaign site",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Abruptly Cancels Interview For An EXTREMELY Racist Reason,"Donald Trump might be desperately trying to win over the Latino vote with his false claims that he  loves Hispanics,  but he s going to have a really hard time   especially when he continues to expose himself as a racist in his everyday interactions.On Monday, Trump s campaign cancelled an interview with freelance journalist Marcos Stupenengo at the very last minute. Stupenengo, who is originally from Argentina, was already in the Trump Tower and had gotten the campaign s approval to do the interview with Trump for TV Azteca. While he was waiting for Trump, Stupenengo took a phone call and was heard talking in Spanish. Nearly as soon as the words came out of Stupenengo s mouth, the Trump campaign did a complete 180 and turned him away. According to a Buzzfeed report: But as he waited to conduct the interview, Stupenengo received a call, and began speaking in Spanish. That s when the Trump campaign informed him they had no interest in taking part in an interview with him, according to a source with knowledge of the incident. Once Trump s campaign decided to cut the interview, one of Trump s Secret Service agents was forced to tell Stupenengo that he had to leave. The agent apologized to Stupenengo, and said that he  didn t know what was happening. When Buzzfeed reached out to Stupenengo, the journalist s comments were short: I can say that after 13 years of journalism worse things have happened to me. Team Trump is actually lying through their teeth and denying that this incident ever happened. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: There was no interview scheduled. We do not know this individual or anything about the alleged situation. Stupenengo isn t the only Spanish-speaking reporter that has been shunned by Trump. Last August, Trump kicked Univision s Jorge Ramos out of a press conference, telling him to  Go back to Univision.

 Democrats Are Spending MILLIONS To Destroy Trump With These 2 Ads (VIDEO),"Democrats are days away from launching a multi-million dollar advertising campaign designed to completely destroy Donald Trump and render him impotent in the general election. The organization leading the charge will be Priorities USA, the Super PAC that backed President Obama s re-election campaign in 2012.The original plan was reportedly to start releasing ads after the California primary, but now the timetable has been moved up.Priorities USA will spend $6 million on ads between May 18 and June 8, hitting Trump in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada, all general election battleground states. The ads will try to do what no Republican could: Take down the businessman who beat a scrum of veteran politicians to all-but-win the Republican nomination. Respect  is a more traditional ad, highlighting Trump s divisive speech, including his campaign rallies where he has gone after minorities, women, and Muslims among others. Speak  showcases Trump s anti-woman comments, many of them from his appearances on shock jock Howard Stern s radio show. In the ad women are shown, sometimes with their families, mouthing along with Trump.Guy Cecil, the Clinton campaign veteran who runs the super PAC, appeared on MSNBC s The Rachel Maddow Show to debut the ads. He explained that while ads in the Republican primary had not stopped Trump, the effort began far too late in the process and often Republicans had been far too reluctant to go after the candidate.Priorities USA, in addition to its own focus groups and research, has also been using the Republican primary as a testing ground for what has and hasn t worked against Trump in the hopes of hitting on the winning formula that will hurt him as much as a similar campaign did against Mitt Romney in 2012.The group reportedly plans to spend at least $130 million in advertising over the next six months.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Angelina Jolie BLASTS Donald Trump’s Hate Speech,"Superstar actress and international humanitarian Angelina Jolie spoke out about Donald Trump s hateful speech that is the central premise of his entire presidential campaign. Speaking at an event in London organized by the BBC about the ongoing Syrian migration crisis, Jolie was asked to respond to Trump s comments on Muslims.Trump has said that if elected president he would enact a ban on Muslim migration to the United States and would also consider a program to track Muslims within the country.The very idea repulsed Jolie:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_juLMpLPORw To me, America is built on people from around the world coming together for freedoms, especially freedom of religion. So it s hard to hear this is coming from someone who is pressing to be an American president. Jolie has served for several years as Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Unlike a lot of celebrities who just talk about global issues, she has actually gone to inhospitable areas including war zones, using the intense media spotlight on her to get coverage of humanitarian and social crises.She recently visited Syrian families currently settled in Lebanon, and asked world leaders to step up and do more to help these people who are innocent victims of the ongoing Syrian civil war.When President Obama announced that the United States would pursue strategies to admit more refugees, several Republican leaders panicked. Some in Congress sought to pass legislation barring refugees while some Republican governors announced that they would not allow refugees into their states   but it isn t up to them, and they actually don t have any legal recourse to block refugees from coming in to America.Jolie also addressed this unwarranted fear at her event today as well, noting: Fear of uncontrolled migration has eroded public confidence and the ability of governments and international institutions to control the situation. It has given space to a false air of legitimacy to those who promote politics of fear and separation.

 Non-Transgender Woman Harassed In Bathroom After Donating Hair To Cancer Patients (VIDEO),"The atmosphere created by conservatives and their anti-transgender witch hunt is becoming more and more apparent by the day. The trend started by North Carolina, with Texas in the process of following suit, is to restrict bathrooms to  gender at birth.  In other words, a transgender woman with double-dee breasts who is wearing a miniskirt would be required to subject herself to harassment by going into the men s room to do her makeup. To most, this is not in any way reasonable. As someone who identifies as a woman, she belongs where she is most comfortable: the women s restroom. But to the uneducated, unwashed religious bigots in our country, she should have to live her life in a constant state of discomfort.But the hysteria has reached a point that even cisgender (biological women who identify as women) must worry about the backlash when one of God s Chosen Imbeciles decides they don t look feminine enough. One such woman is Aimee Toms, who was recently rudely informed that she doesn t belong in the women s restroom. Why?Toms was minding her own business, simply washing her hands at a Walmart in Danbury, Connecticut on Friday when another woman approached her and informed her  You re disgusting!  and  You don t belong here! At the time, Toms was wearing a baseball cap and had very short hair, so she says she can understand why someone might think she is transgender. While her appearance doesn t matter one iota, the reason her hair was short at the time will make the bigot she encountered feel very, very stupid. In a video she posted online, she informed her new hater: Do you know why my hair is so short? In January, I made my third donation to Pantene s Beautiful Lengths Program. Do you know what they do? They take hair donations and they make them into wigs and they give them to cancer patients free of cost. Now, I am damn happy to rock a pixie cut if some kid gets my hair and gets to wear it. And that s worth it to me.You know what isn t worth it? Being discriminated against in a bathroom by some fucking asshole who thinks they have a right to decide what gender I am and that they have a right to judge me for it. After experiencing the discrimination they face firsthand, I cannot fathom the discrimination transgender people must face in a lifetime,  she says.  Can you imagine going out every day and having people tell you you should not be who you are or that people will not accept you as who you are? At this point, the hate is getting ridiculous. Most people have used a restroom with someone who is transgender at some point in their lives without noticing. If daytime talk shows are any indicator, there is a hefty supply of men who have had sexual relations with a woman who happens to have a penis   and they didn t give a flying f*ck at the time. People are people. Transgender people are people who happen to have been born into the  wrong body,  so to speak. There is no harm in a society allowing people to simply be who they are without fear of reprisals. Unfortunately, the American Right disagrees because reasons.Watch Toms lay the smackdown on the haters below:https://www.facebook.com/never.shout.aimee/videos/vb.1473214698/10206543775341127/?type=3&theaterFeatured image via Newstimes",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Delivers A MAJOR ‘F*ck You’ To Trump In Grad Speech (VIDEO),"Since the beginning of Donald Trump s terrible offensive and divisive campaign, Elizabeth Warren has been one of the only politicians with enough balls to stand up to the presumptive Republican nominee and call him out on his bullsh*t. She s proven that Trump basically crumbles whenever a strong woman goes up against him, and her most recent anti-Trump comments show just how capable she is in taking The Donald on.In a commencement address at Bridgewater State University, Warren hilariously mocked Trump once again, clearly following in President Obama s footsteps after he blasted Trump in a recent graduation speech at Rutgers University. After telling the graduating class to  sing like no one is listening and dance like no one is watching,  the Massachusetts senator gave them some more applicable advice   be ready for anything, because you never know what life has in store for you. Poking fun at the orange-skinned business mogul, Warren said: Heck, on my day of graduation, I never imagined I would visit foreign countries. I never imagined I would be a commencement speaker. I never imagined I would get into a Twitter war with Donald Trump. But here I am, living the life! You can watch that hilarious moment in Warren s speech below:The crowd couldn t get enough and gave Warren a deafening applause for her efforts in being one of the few people tough enough to try and bring the disgraced candidate down. Warren also gave the graduating class some advice about dealing with  naysayers  who  these days, say it in nastier and nastier ways.  Pulling from some amazing pop culture references, Warren said: As one of the great philosophers of our time has said,  Haters going to hate, hate, hate hate, hate.  Knowing who you are helps you  Shake It Off.  (applause) Okay, I promised I wouldn t sing, and I definitely can t dance like Britney Spears. It was an amazing speech, and the fact that it came at Trump s expense made it so much better. After the commencement, Warren continued to insult Trump as she spoke to reporters. She said: I think that Donald Trump is a truly dangerous man and there is some risk that he could be president of the United States. I think it s time for all of us to pay careful attention to him and to the issues that he has raised and to start fighting back. Warren also continued to tease us with the idea of ticketing up with the chosen Democratic nominee. She wouldn t give a straight answer on whether or not she would run for vice president if offered the job, but said, I have a job I love and I wake up every morning eager to do that. It s uncertain if Warren will end up on the ticket, but she s definitely proven time and time again that she can handle Trump s nonsense with ease, and that makes her an even greater asset to the Democratic nominee.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas Republicans Adopt Astonishingly Extreme Party Platform,"Perhaps it s time to build a wall around Texas and let it fail as a country separate from the United States, because the Republican Party platform in the state is by far one of the most hateful and anti-American platforms ever produced in this country.The main theme of the Texas Republican platform this year is nullification and destruction of everything they oppose, including women s rights, ethnic diversity, comprehensive sex education, LGBT rights, the separation of church and state, voting rights, and the federal government.Right off the bat, Texas Republicans began their platform document with a preamble pledging their belief in God and and went on to list adherence to  the laws of nature  as a principle   even though the Constitution makes no such references.But it only got worse from there.Texas Republicans openly called for nullifying federal laws and ignoring the rulings of federal courts:Federally mandated legislation, which infringes upon the 10th Amendment rights of Texas, should be ignored, opposed, refused, and nullified. Regulation of Commerce in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution has exceeded the original intent. All attempts by the federal judiciary to rule in areas not expressly enumerated by the Untied States Constitution should be likewise nullified. Any federal enforcement activities that do occur in Texas should be conducted under the authority of the county sheriff.They openly called for eliminating several critical federal agencies which handle labor unions, healthcare, tax revenue collection, and illegal drugs and firearms:We oppose the appointment of unelected bureaucrats and we support defunding and abolishing the departments or agencies of the Internal Revenue Service, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Interior (specifically, the Bureau of Land Management), Transportation Security Administration, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and National Labor Relations Board.They also rejected environmental protection and called climate change a scam:We oppose environmentalism that obstructs legitimate business interests and private property use, including the regulatory taking of property by governmental agencies. We oppose the abuse of the Endangered Species Act to confiscate and limit the use of personal property and infringement on property owner s livelihood.  Climate Change  is a political agenda promoted to control every aspect of our lives. We support the defunding of  climate justice  initiatives and the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency and repeal of the Endangered Species Act.They then called on Congress to repeal the Voting Rights Act:We urge that the Voter Rights Act of 1965, codified and updated in 1973, be repealed and not reauthorized.In addition, Texas Republicans included opposition to same-sex marriage in their platform by calling for the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges to be overturned while also declaring the definition of marriage  as a God-ordained, legal and moral commitment only between one natural man and one natural woman. The platform condemned homosexuality by claiming that it goes against  God s law  and the Constitution and also declared support of controversial ex-gay therapy.Texas Republicans were especially hostile toward a woman s right to choose, calling on the Texas state government to ignore Roe v. Wade and any federal laws and regulations making abortion legal and accessible. In short, Texas Republicans want to outlaw abortion even if it s constitutionally protected.The Texas GOP also expressed opposition to Social Security, which it called for  phasing out,  and called for making Medicaid a temporary program only.Education wasn t left untouched either. Texas Republicans not only called for teaching creationism in school, they condemned comprehensive sex education that could actually reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies that result in abortions in the first place.Texas Republicans are also all about forcing minorities to  assimilate  into their version of American culture and forcing immigrants to learn and speak English so that they can  quickly assimilate. You can read the full platform here.It s time for Texas to be thrown out of the United States. The state no longer shares the values America has held dear for so long. Because of Republican majorities, the state has become an embarrassment that will likely continue as long as the GOP continues to strip away voting rights from people they see as a threat to their power.And it would only be a matter of time before Texas comes crawling back as they realize there is more to becoming an independent nation than simply seceding. If Texas really wants to nullify federal law and go it alone, I say let them go. At least that would deprive Republicans of the 38 electoral votes Texas holds in presidential elections. And it would save the federal government billions of dollars while sparing the rest of the nation from dealing with Texas  stupidity.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" John Oliver Issues Formal Invitation To Trump’s Make-Believe Publicist, And It’s Brilliant (VIDEO)","Finding out Donald Trump was his own publicist in the 1990s, but yet now denies it, is pretty much a gift wrapped in one of those giant Lexus car bows to comedy writers everywhere. He s making the job almost too easy because the content writes itself.With a new take on the whole thing was the team over at Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. They absolutely pummeled Trump and his alter ego  John Miller  during Sunday night s broadcast.After they played the clip of  Miller  speaking of all the women who want to have sex with Trump, including Madonna, Oliver said: Much like his candidacy, that claim is sad but not implausible. Remember, there were rumors that in the  90s, Madonna got together with Vanilla Ice, Jose Canseco, and Willem Dafoe. And what is Donald Trump if not the authenticity of a Vanilla Ice, the likability of Jose Canseco and the terrifying facial expressions of Willem Dafoe? Very, VERY true.Oliver also points out that Trump himself stated in the 1990s that the person on the call wasn t  John Miller,  but rather himself, and he claimed that it was all a joke. Which would be fine, and the issue would be settled if not for the fact that Trump has now reversed that claim and stated the person on the call now isn t him.So, to settle this issue once and for all, Oliver has now extended an invitation for  John Miller  to appear on Last Week Tonight to be interviewed. Not Trump,  Miller. Although, the chances of  Miller  showing up aren t very likely considering he doesn t exist.Watch the whole segment here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans’ Benghazi Witch Hunt Just Went Up In Flames Thanks To Their Own Lawyer,"Unless you re an idiot, you know that while the terrorist attacks in Benghazi were a tragedy, neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton were at fault for the attacks. Of course, Republicans have never exactly been the sharpest knives in the kitchen. For years, the Right has been waging a desperate war on Clinton, Obama, and sanity with their asinine Benghazi investigations. All across conservative media, we hear that Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or both murdered four patriots with their bare hands while blaspheming God s name and murdering babies (or something; it s hard to understand what they are talking about at times).The Republican Benghazi  scandal  has been slowly going up in flames for quite some time now, but a letter from Trey Gowdy s former counsel has completely decimated any hope they have of getting anything useful out of the millions and millions of taxpayer dollars they wasted on this senseless exercise. Nevertheless, Republicans continue to claim that Obama and Clinton prevented the military from taking action that would have saved the lives of the Americans who died in the attacks. This is the drumbeat to which Republicans have goose-stepped as they attempted to railroad the Obama Administration in court   but as much as they try to deny it, reality is a thing. Even more unfortunately for Republicans, their own former counsel in the matter was very clear that no one did anything wrong.On May 16, Rep. Elijah Cummings, the voice of reason in this mess, sent a letter to Gowdy to remind him that his own attorney disputed many of the GOP s claims:Unfortunately, your letter failed to include any statements from your own former Republican Chief Counsel a retired three-star general with more than 33 years of service in the United States Army who repeatedly commended the military s actions on the night of the attacks during closed interviews with Defense Department officials.For example, on January 8, 2016, the Select Committee conducted a transcribed interview with former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. During that interview, your former Chief Counsel stated:I think you ordered exactly the right forces to move out and to head toward a position where they could reinforce what was occurring in Benghazi or in Tripoli or elsewhere in the region. And, sir, I don t disagree with the actions you took, the recommendations you made, and the decisions you directed.Gowdy s former counsel also acknowledged that it was impossible, given time and distances, for military forces to arrive fast enough to make a difference:Your former Chief Counsel acknowledged that it is clear from the time and distances involved that none of the military forces could have gotten to Benghazi in time to save lives.He stated:And, again, sir, I don t mean to suggest that anything could have been done differently to affect the outcome in Benghazi, and I think you would agree with that.But most importantly, there was nothing that could be done at all:In addition, on January 13, 2016, the Select Committee conducted a transcribed interview with the Defense Department s former Chief of Staff, Jeremy Bash. During that interview, your former Republican Chief Counsel stated:I would posit that from my perspective, having looked at all the materials over the last 18 months, we could not have affected the response to what occurred by 5: 15 in the morning on the 12th of September if Benghazi, Libya. So let me start with that positing or that stipulation.Your former Chief Counsel also stated:I don t see any way to influence what occurred there. But what I am worried about is we re caught by surprise On 9/11, we ve got nothing postured to respond in a timely manner and you can debate what s timely, what s untimely, but nothing could have affected what occurred in Benghazi. The conclusions of your former Republican Chief Counsel match almost exactly the findings from more than two years ago of the House Committee on Armed Services, which conducted its own investigation into the attacks in Benghazi,  Cummings wrote, noting that Rep. Buck McKeon, the Republican Chairman of the Committee who led the investigation at the time, was satisfied that  given where the troops were, how quickly the thing all happened and how quickly it dissipated, we probably couldn t have done more than we did. There you have it. Barack Obama killed no one. Hillary Clinton killed no one. If anything, Republicans are trying to distract from their own responsibility in the matter. ThinkProgress reported in 2012 that Republicans had cut funding for embassy security because defending Americans abroad was not a  priority :For fiscal 2013, the GOP-controlled House proposed spending $1.934 billion for the State Department s Worldwide Security Protection program   well below the $2.15 billion requested by the Obama administration. House Republicans cut the administration s request for embassy security funding by $128 million in fiscal 2011 and $331 million in fiscal 2012 .[In 2011] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Republicans  proposed cuts to her department would be  detrimental to America s national security    a charge Republicans rejected.[GOP vice presidential nominee Paul] Ryan, [Rep. Darrell] Issa and other House Republicans voted for an amendment in 2009 to cut $1.2 billion from State operations, including funds for 300 more diplomatic security positions. Under Ryan s budget, non-defense discretionary spending, which includes State Department funding, would be slashed nearly 20 percent in 2014, which would translate to more than $400 million in additional cuts to embassy security.These cuts occurred, of course, not long before the deadly attacks the GOP is so desperate to pin on their favorite enemies.Go figure.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/Getty Images (Eric Thayer)",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jimmy Kimmel Joins The Ladies Of ‘The View’ To Rip Trump To Shreds Over His ‘Publicist’ (VIDEO),"Ever since we ve heard the news of Donald Trump and his  publicist  John Miller, a character he seemingly created to brag about himself, pretty much anyone and everyone has been making fun of him for it, because it s pretty damn hilarious.Making an appearance on The View,  comedian and television host Jimmy Kimmel was no exception. He, alongside the ladies of The View took Trump to task sarcastically and brilliantly bringing the real estate mogul down a few pegs.After Whoopi Goldberg asks Kimmel about the allegations surrounding Trump posing as his own publicist, Kimmel said: If Trump says that wasn t him, we have no choice but to believe him. He s never lied to us before. You could see and feel the sarcasm oozing out of the television.Kimmel adds: It s clearly him. He then suggests that Trump should just admit it was him and say it was a prank call.When asked why Trump would do such a thing and then deny it, Kimmel explained he s probably incredibly embarrassed. Why would he lie about it? Listen, if you were calling People magazine and telling them all the women that wanted to have sex with you, I think you would be embarrassed about it too, right? Kimmel also states that Madonna was allegedly one of the women, and that as vice president this is one of the big questions he will tackle.The worst part about all of this, is that this is clearly is a distraction away from the fact that Trump has no actual policy plans and isn t at all qualified for the job of Commander-in-Chief. A fact that needs to be discussed far more often.Watch the interview here:What does @JimmyKimmel have to say about Trump denying he s his own publicist?  He s never lied to us before!  https://t.co/sC9ioe1l4t  The View (@TheView) May 16, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" These Are Hillary Clinton’s Five VP Choices, And They Are All Excellent","As Hillary Clinton looks forward to the general election, her shortlist for prospective vice presidential candidates has narrowed to just five, consisting of some of the most progressive figures in Washington and beyond.If Clinton wants so pick up some of the die-hard Bernie Sanders supporters, some of whom have pledged not to vote for the former Secretary of State, she will need to match her moderate-to-progressive image with a full on liberal progressive by her side.While Sanders does not make the list, progressive firebrand Elizabeth Warren makes the list, along with:All candidates show absolute tactics   besides Warren and Perez, each candidate comes from a swing state paramount to Democrats clinching a victory. No president in modern America has won without carrying Ohio, which would explain having Sherrod Brown on the ticket (and he s a solid progressive). Kaine and Hickenlooper also come from must win states for Clinton and the Democrats, while Perez (who is Hispanic and speaks fluent Spanish), would help drive out the Hispanic and Latino vote.Warren would undoubtedly bring in Sanders  core base of support   young, white, liberal and Independent.The only trouble with picking Brown or Warren would be that their respective states have Republican governors, which would hurt Democrats  chance of taking back the Senate.While Donald Trump has Sarah Palin on his shortlist (along with the hated Chris Christie and Ted Cruz), Clinton has found herself a diverse group of liberals who have fought hard for worker s rights and minority rights.Outlets speculated for months that Donald Trump should pick Governor Susana Martinez or former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice should he want to repair his broken image with women and minority voters. But, in typical Trump form, he decided to do the opposite and go with a band of moronic ideologues. Marco Rubio is on his short list, but even Hispanic and Latino don t like him, and women certainly hate Sarah Palin. His never ending pandering isn t getting him anywhere with the voting blocs that matter.Featured image via John Sommers/Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Right-Wing Pastor Calls Upon Christians To Die Fighting Transgender Equality,"In response to the Department of Justice s guidelines preventing school officials from demanding that students prove their gender identity to use a restroom, Franklin Graham took to Facebook to whine and call upon Christians to die fighting transgender protections and President Obama.Graham, also known as Billy Graham s demon spawn, posted a lengthy message on his Facebook page on Sunday night asking conservative Christians to  take a bullet  for their beliefs instead of following the law. What would you take a bullet for?  Graham asked.  What are the principles and beliefs that you would not compromise under any circumstances? Even if it meant putting your life on the line? And of course, that led into a Bible story featuring Christians martyring themselves.King Nebuchadnezzar who reigned over Babylon issued a decree that everyone worship the golden image he had made. Three men who knew the one true and living God, refused to worship the king s idol their names were Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The king told them,  But if you do not worship, you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.  Here is their bold reply: O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up  (Daniel 3:16-18).Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stood firm in obedience and faithfulness. They stood up for God s truth. They stood up for their faith, and they didn t waiver, even when it meant putting their very lives at risk.And finally, Graham concluded by asking Christians to martyr themselves now.I want to call on every Christian and every pastor to stand firm like these patriarchs of old and not bow to the secular, increasingly godless culture in which we live even when (not if) we re criticized, mocked, and labeled intolerant. The God of the Old Testament that delivered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from their fiery execution is the same God today and He is still more than able to save. Will you stand against ungodliness? What are you willing to take a bullet for?Here s the full post via Facebook.This kind of rhetoric sounds awfully familiar, doesn t it? Oh yeah, it s what Islamic extremists tell their followers right before they strap bombs to their bodies and blow themselves up in the name of Allah. Except this time, it s an old white male  Christian  leader saying it to Christians in America, proving once again that fundamentalist Christians are exactly the same as their Islamic counterparts.Featured image YouTube",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Sorry, GOP: This Economic Powerhouse Just Got 99% Of Its Energy From Renewable Energy","Republicans have pessimistically said it can t be done, that renewable energy can t do for us what oil, gas, and coal have done for generations.But Germany just put Republicans in their place and proved that clean energy can do just that if given the chance.On Sunday, Chancellor Angela Merkel had good reason to celebrate as renewable energy sources provided nearly 100 percent of the nation s energy needs for the first time.According to Bloomberg:Solar and wind power peaked at 2 p.m. local time on Sunday, allowing renewables to supply 45.5 gigawatts as demand was 45.8 gigawatts, according to provisional data by Agora Energiewende, a research institute in Berlin. Power prices turned negative during several 15-minute periods yesterday, dropping as low as minus 50 euros ($57) a megawatt-hour In other words, clean energy saved people lots of money on their electricity bills on several occasions on Sunday and proved that it is possible to replace conventional energy sources with renewable energy sources.If you take a look at the graph below, you will see that solar power, as represented in yellow, surged to hit the red line, which represents the electricity consumption of the population. For that one shining brief period, clean energy surpassed the conventional sources and embarrassed every single Republican who has scoffed at the prospect of clean energy in the United States.Just imagine if clean energy did this here. Imagine if we actually put our full effort and focus into developing a clean energy infrastructure, we could watch as our electric bills shrink and our dependence on fossil fuels disappears. It would save us money and help save the planet at the same time.But that s assuming Republicans jump on board the clean energy train instead of continuing to be shills for oil and coal companies while claiming that God will save the planet.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Dipsh*t Adjusts Gun He Was Hiding In His SOCK Shoots Himself, Stranger At Graduation Ceremony","Millions of Americans across the country have concealed carry permits that allow them to carry their guns with them almost everywhere they go. The vast majority of these people, including my brother, have the common sense to purchase holsters to place their deadly weapons in; but then we have dumbasses like the one in Augusta, Kansas who thought, I don t need no stinkin holster! I ve got a perfectly good sock!  As you can imagine, this isn t going to end well.Two people were hurt in an  accidental  shooting at Augusta High School s graduation ceremony over the weekend. According to Augusta Police Chief Tyler Brewer, a man was adjusting his gun when it went off, hit him, ricocheted and hit another woman. The shooting took place in a crowded stadium and was completely preventable, but the man was apparently an imbecile:Police told KWCH [News] the gun owner has a permit, and was carrying a small, semi-automatic gun in his sock. The gun in his sock was uncomfortable and he was apparently adjusting it when it went off.He. Was. Carrying. His. Gun. In. His. Sock. HIS SOCK!HIS SOCK!The brilliant, brilliant man ended up with a bullet wound in his foot and the woman with one in her calf. They are both expected to be okay. Chief Brewer said he plans on pursuing charges against the idiot because the shooting happened on school grounds. Imagine that, a gun owner who used his sock as a holster broke the law? Didn t see that coming.The NRA and the silly Republican politicians who are in their pocket claim that Democrats want to steal their firearms because we want stricter gun control laws. This is completely false, of course, and to my knowledge President Obama has still not carried out his nefarious gun grabbing plot, but right-wingers still believe it is going to happen. They argue about even basic laws like mandatory safety classes. Seriously. This shouldn t be a problem but it is and hundreds of people every year are hurt in shootings, like this one, that could have been prevented if the gun owner knew how to handle the weapon they so enthusiastically carry.But what do I know? I m just the sister of someone who owns an arsenal of guns and I ve never been shot once. I wonder why that is? Oh yeah, cause my brother knows that a sock isn t a fucking holster.Featured image via The Chive",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Woman Publicly Disowns Her Parents After She Finds Out Her Mom Is A Trump Troll,"Disowning your parents is an incredibly painful thing to do. These are the people who created you. The people who raised you and loved you and kissed your  boo-boos  when you got hurt. Unfortunately, sometimes it is necessary as Aubrey Perry, an Australian-based artist and author, recently discovered. In an article written for The Sydney Morning Herald, the young woman explained why she had to cut her parents out of her life and the life of her child.Perry was perusing a list of California Trump delegates when she discovered a horrifying name on the list: her mother s. I found her name when I was scanning the list to see if the white supremacist William Daniel Johnson had been removed (since he d said he would not be attending): there she was, #10 on the list. She said her parents have always been racist. Her mother, an ESL (English Second Language) teacher and basic English teacher at the college level, often referred to her students with contempt when Perry was growing up. She said: Greaseball. Wetback. Spic. Beaner. I grew up with these words in the house. Not because that s what people called us. That s what we called Mexicans. Perry explains that she knew her parents believed ignorant garbage, but because she lives in Australia and only speaks to her parents online, through text and on the phone it was easy to ignore   they never spoke about politics. However, after Perry saw her mom s name on the delegate list she started investigating and what she found is what ultimately led to her decision to severe ties: And I don t use Twitter much. But, wow. My mum does. I recently checked her Twitter page for the first time in a while and was shocked. Hateful memes, ugly language, and appearance-based attacks, targeted at Hillary Clinton, stacked up. And not just hateful, but off-topic and malicious calling Hillary  ugly ,  old  and  screechy . An  unlikeable old bag. The  woman card  stinks!  my mother wrote. My mother! A college instructor! She should know better. She s no internet troll. Is she? She was; her mom was a Trump troll and filled all of her social media accounts with racist, sexist, xenophobic memes and posts. She found videos of her mom being interviewed by Fox News at a California rally. Perry said the video shows her mom saying, He sounds like us, he talks like us   I m all Trump, only Trump, always Trump, forever Trump!  The video reminded her of the Imperial Wizard of the KKK saying that the Klan supports Trump because  what he believes in, we believe in. Perry isn t just an ordinary liberal who is disgusted with Donald Trump just because she is a progressive and he is a conservative; his beliefs hurt her family.  My husband is black. We have a daughter together. My parents  support of a candidate who could not decide if he should accept the endorsement of the KKK is completely intolerable in our home and, ultimately, in our world. She finally confronted her mother, and her mom brushed her off. So, she decided to take screenshots of her mom s hate speech, saved the video clips of her interview on Fox News and posted everything on Facebook, slamming her parents for their ignorance. On Twitter she said, Your Twitter feed makes me disappointed and embarrassed of you as a person, a supposed critical thinker, and my mother. Shocked.  Her mom responded by blocking her on social media. Her dad found out and sent her a threatening email, saying: I know you have never said anything you might not like to be made public,  he wrote,  so if you want to continue this attack mode, please remember all things have consequences. Perry said her parents  response to her criticism hurt her but she wasn t surprised. More importantly, though, she said it was time to speak up and let them know that their hate and ignorance was not acceptable. Her entire life she had kept her mouth shut and let their rhetoric roll off her back and that, she explains, is her biggest regret: By ignoring racism, xenophobia, and misogyny within our families, we are accepting it within our culture. To ignore is to accept. As my daughter plays on the floor in front of me while I type this, I think about her ancestry. I think about the suffering that has been endured so that she can live in a free and just world, and I feel a responsibility to the continuity of that humanity. If I don t oppose my parents  behaviour and objectives, if I don t reject Trump and all that he stands for, if I don t change my family s vocabulary so that my daughter never knows the hateful words I heard growing up, I m undoing the progress that generations before me have fought and died for. And that, I won t accept. She s exactly right. As a white woman with a mixed race child and a husband who is from Central America, I know where she is coming from. For a very long time I ignored the hate coming, not from my parents, but from other people who I was close to. People I d grown up with, gone to school with. It was easier to pretend they were not that stupid than to confront them and get into an argument. Like Perry, I came to the realization that by not telling these people how I felt, how their hate affected my son, my husband, our friendship, I was doing a disservice. I started speaking out, I m not friends with some of those people anymore and that s okay, they are not nice people anyway.The point is that by not speaking out, we lead these people to believe that what they are saying is acceptable and it isn t. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel explains why it is important to use our voices to stop this kind of divisiveness, better than I ever could, while speaking to a group of college graduates in 2011: Do not stand idly by if you witness injustice. You must intervene. You must interfere. You are now going into a world which is hounded, obsessed with so much violence, often so much despair. When you enter this world and you say the world is not good today, good! Correct it!

 TN School Officials Told To Falsify Student Disciplinary Codes To Avoid Red Flags,"An email obtained by WTVF in Nashville, Tennesee shows that school officials were instructed to falsify student disciplinary codes, in order to avoid a federal investigation.Nashville s Metro School System has long been under scrutiny from the federal government for a disparity in student suspensions. While Black students account for less than half of the district s student body, more than 70 percent of students suspended in the district are African-American.In 2014 the school district implemented a new set of disciplinary codes. The codes were supposed to help the district minimize disparities by outlining various student behaviors, along with appropriate punishment for each.According to WTVF:The email surfaced after the principal at Nashville s Hunters Lane High School was questioned about her handling of disciplinary data involving one student.That principal, Susan Kessler, fired back with email evidence about what she called a  common practice  involving a district official who s in charge of monitoring student discipline.A copy of the email, which was sent to Kessler by Bruce Curtis, the district s Director of School Discipline, shows that Curtis instructed school officials to change student disciplinary codes  in order to keep the school out of a possible OCR complaint. Here s a screencap of the email, published by WTVF here.Image credit: WTVFThe school district has been involved in numerous OCR (Office of Civil Rights) complaints before. The email suggests that rather than addressing the underlying issues of racial disparity within the school system, officials are falsifying data to make it look as though the district is improving, when really it is not.The release of the email has rightly outraged parents and civil rights leaders.Larry Woods, a civil rights attorney who has brought previous suits against the school district, told WTVF he believes: The clear intent of the memo, of the email, is let s avoid an Office of Civil Rights investigation. Let s cover it up so we won t get into trouble when OCR   Office of Civil Rights investigates us. Instead of expressing concern about what s best for students, the email shows school officials are not only willing to allow students to be suspended for minor infractions, they re also willing to make those infractions seem more serious than they were, in order to cover their own asses.This email alone should be cause for the Office of Civil Rights to begin a new investigation into Metro Nashville Schools.As it stands, we can only wonder how many students have been suspended without justification and how many suspension codes have been changed to cover up the fact that the school district is just as racist as ever.Image credit: Nashville Public Schools",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Proved He Has The Foreign Diplomacy Skills Of A Whiny Child,"Donald Trump has so many feuds going on at the moment it can be hard to keep track of them all. One of the most potentially damaging feuds, though, is with the United Kingdom s Prime Minister David Cameron. Now, that feud continues with Trump s latest comments directed towards Cameron.Cameron has made his opinion of the guaranteed Republican presidential nomination very clear. Back in December, Cameron publicly stated that he thinks Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States is  stupid, divisive and wrong.  Cameron s statement couldn t be more accurate, as Trump s proposal goes against the very basic principles of the United States and would be logistically impossible to enforce.During an interview with Piers Morgan, Trump spoke out against Cameron s comments, offering a sad attempt at an olive branch towards Cameron, where he insisted that he is not stupid and is a unifier. It looks like we re not going to have a very good relationship. Who knows! I hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like he s not willing to address the problem either,  Trump said in the interview, according to the Jerusalem Post.  Well, number one I m not stupid, Okay. I can tell you that, right now   just the opposite. Number two, in terms of divisive: I don t think I m a divisive person. I m a unifier, unlike our president now, I m a unifier,  he Trump concluded.As bizarre as it is to hear a grown man insist to another that he is in fact not stupid, Cameron never actually called Trump himself stupid. He called his policy stupid because it is. It s also nothing more than an incredibly xenophobic, racist, and ridiculous bit of fear mongering. It s one of the first policy proposals that Trump introduced. It sounded the alarm bells that Trump is more than just a buffoon looking for attention, it showed the world that he could actually be a very dangerous threat to the United States and the world if given the opportunity to seize actual political power.Featured image from (Photo by Isaac Brekken/Getty Images)",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Antonin Scalia’s Own Past Ruling Will Hand Obama HUGE Victory On Transgender Rights,"The Obama administration recently sent a missive to public schools nationwide, informing them that they must treat students consistently with their gender identity   even if it is different from what was biologically assigned to them by nature. Long story short, this means no bathroom police in our schools.Needless to say, Republicans didn t take this well. Their reaction was something between Obama telling them a  yo momma  joke and him personally burning the original copy of the Constitution.However, it seems that a victory for the administration will be handed to them by none other than the late Antonin Scalia himself, much to the distress of Republicans everywhere.In the 1990s, Antonin Scaia spoke for a unanimous court decision that found in favor of the plaintiff in a sex-discrimination case. The case was brought from a man who was being bullied by other men and threatened with rape in the showers at his job on an oil rig. The man s employer ignored the problem, and he brought a lawsuit over it. Scalia himself said that his employer s inaction was clearly discrimination based on sex, and he cited the Civil Rights act of 1964 as supporting this decision. Male-on-male sexual harassment was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and the words of the law can be easily read to forbid sexual harassment of any kind. Source: Oncale Vs. Sundowner Offshore ServicesAnd there you have it. Antonin Scalia just handed Republicans one huge fat goose egg on their efforts to make segregation cool again in America by rebooting it to hate on transgender folks. The spirit of the law is incredibly simple to understand. You aren t supposed to be harassed at work, school, or other  public  venue places, especially because of an inborn characteristic like being of a particular gender. The harassment for transgender individuals is impossible to portray differently so it wouldn t be covered by the Civil Rights Act.Republicans are aware of this, and this is why there has been a very recent outcry by many of them to have Congress fundamentally dismantle the Civil Rights Act. They d be willing to essentially trash the entire thing, exposing millions of people beyond only the transgender community to all forms of discrimination   all so they can militarize American restrooms.Featured image via rrstar.com",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Armed Men Break Into Protected Wildlife Area, Kill Rarest Fish On Earth (VIDEO)","The Nye County Sheriff s Office just arrested three men who went on a drunken rampage through a protected area of Death Valley National Park in Nevada.On April 30, Steven Schwinkendorf, 29, Edgar Reyes, 35, and Trenton Sargent, 26 used a gun to shoot off gate locks meant to prevent entry into the protected area surrounding the Devils Hole geothermal pool.The Death Valley pool is the only known habitat for the rarest species of fish in the world, the Devils Hole pupfish.According to authorities, once inside the protected area the men fired the gun several more times, shooting out motion sensors and damaging sensitive scientific equipment.One of them urinated on the ground, while another decided to use the protected spot as a place to vomit.According to a statement released by the Nye County Sheriff s Office:Their unlawful visit ultimately culminated with at least one of the suspects stripping off their clothes and entering the water of Devils Hole. The suspect(s) in the water stomped around the shelf area of the critical ecosystem before swimming around the deeper water, leaving behind a pair of dirty underwear when finished.The statement goes on to say:The intrusion is believed to have resulted in the death of at least one endangered Devils Hole pupfish, and fisheries biologists are trying to ascertain the extended damage that may have been done to food sources and egg sites which could lead to more loss of a species whose numbers are now below the last count of 115 in existence.Security cameras captured footage of the rampage. The Center for Biological Diversity and the National Park Service offered a $15,000 reward for the capture of the three men, saying their actions constituted a crime against the shared natural heritage of all Americans.Now that they ve been identified and arrested, the men face up to a year in prison and fines of up to $50,000 each.Here s more on this story via Newsy on YouTube:Image credit: Video screen capture via Newsy on YouTube",News,"May 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Dozens Arrested During Massive Global Fossil Fuel Protest (VIDEOS),"An ongoing demonstration taking place outside of Anacortes, WA. The protestors created a blockade on the BNSF Railway tracks, which lead to two oil refineries. One of which is owned by Shell, the other is owned by Tesoro. The protest began on Friday, as a part of a global wave of protests against the continued use of fossil fuels. The international  break free  protest demands that the world immediately transition to a fossil fuel-free energy system. Thousands of people all over the world have come together to protest and to take direct actions against fossil fuel companies have taken place on six continents over the course of two weeks. Last summer we stopped Shell s Arctic drilling plans, now we re taking our biggest actions yet. The movement for climate justice is growing and getting bolder by the day. A fossil-free Northwest isn t a fantasy, it s inevitable; if we start now, the change can be fair and rational, and we can demonstrate our leadership,  says organizer Ahmed Gaya said in a press release.Below is a video that shows the very beginning of the encampment.In addition to the blockade, thousands of activists in Washington staged marched in protests and took part in a massive flotilla of kayaks holding banners and signs demanding an immediate transformation to a 100% renewable energy system.https://www.facebook.com/BackboneCampaign/photos/ms.c.eJwzNDA0NTczMTY0tzAyNzAyMNMzRIiYmGKImJmiiRiZYerCUGMOEgEAhxkVfg~-~-.bps.a.10157643178105206.1073741894.19984125205/10157643178270206/?type=3&theaterHere is a photo of the police who broke up the encampment:https://www.facebook.com/BackboneCampaign/photos/a.10157647965685206.1073741897.19984125205/10157647965990206/?type=3&theater On Saturday, about 1,500 people took part in a blockade against bomb trains in Albany, New York.I'm in Albany, NY to support the campaign to @BanBombTrains as part of #breakfree2016.

Activists in Germany also disrupted a massive coal mining operation.Here s video footage of the actions in Germany:Climate change threatens every nation that happens to be on planet Earth though it s effects will not be felt by all equally. Fossil fuel lobbyists have hijacked the governments of the world in order to prevent them from doing anything that might hurt their short term profits, no matter what it costs them and everyone else on Earth in the long run.That s why we need people to rise up and take bold action to encourage politicians to stand up to corporate lobbyists, and to hit corporations that don t give a d*mn about the average person as hard as they can.

 Obama Shreds Trump In Powerful Message To Graduates: ‘Ignorance Is Not A Virtue’ (VIDEO),"On Sunday, President Barack Obama gave an amazing speech at the Rutgers University graduation ceremony.Speaking to well over 50,000 people, Obama went on a subtle Trump-targeted rant to reject the presumptive Republican nominee s divisive, offensive rhetoric. Although Obama never said Trump s name, there was no mistaking who he was talking about as he spoke against  building a wall. Obama said as his audience applauded: The world is more interconnected than ever before. Building walls won t change that. Obama continued his anti-Trump attack, criticizing some of the GOP front runner s positions   such as Trump s infamous proposal to ban all Muslims from coming into the United States. He continued: Isolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country   that is not just a betrayal of our values   that s not just a betrayal of who we are, it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism.  Addressing the 12,000 graduates listening to his speech, Obama urged them to rise above the  strain of anti-intellectualism  that Trump has encouraged in his race for the White House. In the process, Obama couldn t help but laugh as he exposed Trump for the idiot that he is. So, class of 2016 let me be as clear as I can be: In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. It s not cool to not know what you re talking about. It s not  keeping it real  or  telling it like it is.  It s not challenging political correctness. That s just not knowing what you re talking about. You can watch Obama deliver this powerful message below:Obama urged graduates to remain dedicated to learning the truth and keeping an open mind, warning them that only exposing themselves to information that confirms their own beliefs could result in ignorance. Ironically the flood of information hasn t made us more discerning of the truth. It s just made us more confident of our ignorance. Taking the Republican party to task, Obama added that when politicians are  not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up, while actual experts are dismissed as elitists, then we ve got a problem. Soothing frustrations felt throughout the campaigns in this election, Obama reiterated his previous comments on income inequality that he d given during a commencement address at Howard University last week. Obama reminded the graduates how important it was to vote and be involved in the political process: The reason some of these things have not happened even though the majority of people have approved, it s really simple. It s because a huge chunk of Americans, especially young people do not vote. Apathy has consequences. You can watch Obama s full speech below   it serves as a reminder to America s youth that they are powerful, and that they should use that power to unify instead of divide our country.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / Getty Images",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 FL Pastor Targets Neighbor With Nazi Flag Display Over Boating Laws (IMAGE),"Naples, Florida pastor John Gursoy is outraged over new boating regulations in the gated community where he lives. The new regulations include limiting the number of boats that can be parked at one dock and raising the age of boat operators from 13 to 14. Volunteer board members for the community association also voted to uphold a longstanding ban on two-stroke engines. The new regulations so infuriated the Florida pastor that he went to Kinkos and printed off a Nazi flag.Upon returning home, Gursoy raised the flag on a cherry picker in his yard. He also hung a sign slandering neighbor Peter Rietz, who volunteers his time to serve on the board.The sign reads  Peter Rietz Fascist? Discriminates. Image credit: Naples Daily NewsUpon seeing the display, some members of the Florida community were disturbed enough to call police.Because the flag and sign are on private property, local law enforcement officers say no crime is being committed.When asked about the display by Naples Daily News, Gursoy said: This flag is symbolic of the most discriminatory, selective enforcement of rules ever in the history of mankind. He went on to explain how the boating regulations, which were designed to protect the environment and members of the community where he lives, compare to Nazi Germany, saying it was all that  kept coming to my mind. Gursoy told Naples Daily News that he put the sign up as a warning to the community that this is the direction we re going with the current board. Because clearly not being able to park ten boats on a single dock or let a 13-year-old drive a watercraft is just like Nazi Germany all over again. It s very frustrating,  Peter Rietz said during an interview with Naples Daily News.  My wife is up in arms. Our neighbors are all up in arms. The police have been here. It s obviously in poor taste and reflects on the individual. He added, It s hard to believe how someone who holds himself out as a Christian would behave in this fashion. According to Naples Daily News Gursoy is a youth minister at Celebration Community Beach Church.Image credit: Naples Daily News",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Girl On Bike Brutally Beaten By Cops And Then SHE Is Charged With Assault,"Two years ago, 15-year-old Monique Tillman and her brother, like kids everywhere across the country, were riding their bikes. Unlike kids everywhere, Tillman was stopped for nothing more than the apparent crime of Riding While Black.Tillman and her brother made the mistake of cutting through a mall parking lot and running into Tacoma Police Officer Jared Williams, who was moonlighting as mall security. Williams then stopped the pair, telling them they were trespassing and that they might be banned from the mall.The children tried to explain that they ride through that parking lot all the time and they tried to leave. What happened after that might not be suitable for work.Here s the video:If you don t have the stomach to watch the video, the girl is snatched from her bike by the off-duty officer and slammed up against a car while he appears to be choking her. He then grabbed her hair and began throwing her around. He even tased her. He was choking me, grabbed me by my hair and tried to slam my face into the concrete. The next thing I know, I m on the ground being tased,  Tillman said.Source: Free Thought ProjectThen, after it was clearly shown in the video that the girl never even raised a hand toward the officer, she was charged for resisting arrest and assault on an officer for allegedly attempting to kick him. That s right, she was charged for assault. Fortunately, those charges were thrown out after there was no evidence that she tried to kick at all, and a lawsuit has been filed against Officer Williams, the security company and the people who own the mall. A child riding a bike should not have to worry that a police officer will stop her without legal cause and brutalize her,  said (Tillman s attorney, Vito) de la Cruz.  Our communities are weary of another African American child being hurt by unwarranted and excessive police force. Tillman, who is now a digital media student at Bates Technical College, had this to say: I feel like I was targeted because I am a person of color,  Tillman told the Seattle Times.  It was frustrating because I knew I didn t do anything wrong, but I couldn t stop them. Here s Tillman, now 17, talking about the incident, saying all she wants is an apology:Williams still has his job.Featured image via video screen captures",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bette Midler To Twitter: If You’re Deactivating Offensive Accounts, Why Is Trump Still Here? (TWEET)","Twitter is presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump s favorite platform for his many offensive rants. However, like most social media platforms, there are rules against certain kinds of language. That includes hate speech against marginalized groups of people. To that end, the Twitter account of singer Azealia Banks was recently shut down because of racist and homophobic hate speech. That is a good thing, but, none other than Bette Midler pointed out something that should be obvious to all: if they are applying this rule against bigotry on their social networking platform, why the hell wasn t Donald Trump banned from Twitter a long ass time ago?Midler tweeted:Twitter deactivated Azealia Banks  account for homophobia & racism?So why is Donald Trump still here?  Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) May 15, 2016Now, the thing is, nobody should be tweeting out hateful speech of any kind, but isn t it a little suspicious that Trump can troll women, be an open racist and misogynist on a regular basis via his Twitter account, and nothing happens to him? Instead, the social media giant chose to use a black woman as a way to make the point that they are cracking down on the cesspool of an atmosphere on that site.The thing is, the very nature Twitter means that it s going to be a pretty rough and tumble place to hang out. The platform lends itself to deliberately off the cuff, say what you think when you re thinking it remarks. That in and of itself is a recipe for disaster and perfect haven for trolling. The thing is, though, if you re going to try to clean the place up, Twitter powers that be, maybe you should start with the real problem, which is the likes of Donald Trump.That would send a REAL message. Nobody is saying that Azealia Banks didn t deserve to be suspended while she cools off for a bit, but the only message you sent with this suspension is a double standard when it comes to how you treat white men vs. how you treat black women. After all, Trump is running for president and has been as hateful as they come via your platform on a grand scale for eons now, and you ve done absolutely nothing. Is that really the message you want to send?Featured image via Bette Midler Twitter",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Remember That Time Hypocrite Trump Tweeted Obama Should Comply With Record Releases,"With Donald Trump handing out nicknames left and right, one nickname that has come to mind for him would be  Hypocrite Trump. First of all, he doesn t apparently realize that the internet can document the things you say for years after you say them. Secondly, he also doesn t seem to realize that those things that he said can and will come back to haunt him.For instance, back in 2012, Trump, on top of previously requesting President Obama s birth certificate, also demanded that he release his college transcripts.Trump tweeted out on October 30, 2012, only days before the 2012 presidential election: Why does Obama believe he shouldn t comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something? Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2012And of course President Obama wasn t hiding anything, and Trump was just trying to stir up trouble to make people believe the president was up to no good.Now, flash forward to today and Trump refuses to release his tax returns. Documents that every presidential candidate releases to show the nation financial transparency. Of course, Trump has lame excuse after lame excuse as to why he can t release them. All of which have been debunked.So, please, by all means, let s remind Trump of his blaring hypocrisy. Clearly, according to himself, he s hiding something.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images   Twitter",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New York Gun License Broker Paid Off Cops To Approve Client Licenses,"Police have suspended the licenses of at least 37 New York City gun owners following the arrest of gun license broker Shaya Lichtenstein.According to New York Daily News, Lichtenstein s  cozy relationship  with New York City police officers paid off well for some clients who sought his help in obtaining licenses for their weapons.Although the city has strict requirements for obtaining a gun license, many of Lichtenstein s customers were given a pass on necessary paperwork and in-person interviews.For the privilege of circumventing the law, Lichtenstein charged his clients between $5,000 and $25,000.New York Daily News reports that while, there is a mountain of documentation that s required,  to gain a gun license in the city, all some of Lichtenstein s clients needed was  to send in a few pieces of paper for the permit to go forward. On April 18 Lichtenstein was charged with bribing police officers in Manhattan Federal Court.According to the charges published here, an undercover investigation involving Lichtenstein began in 2013.According to the documents, after one of the license broker s closest contacts inside the police department stopped helping him, he offered to pay an undercover officer $6,000 per gun license.While none of the cops who are implicated in taking bribes have been identified by name, an officer referred to as Deputy Inspector-1 is alleged to have taken bribes from Lichtenstein. The documents describe Deputy Inspector-1 as  the Commanding Officer of the License Division. Two other NYPD officers, referred to as Officer-1 and Sergeant-1 are also implicated in taking bribes.During an interview with investigators, Officer-1 stated that Lichtenstein provided the two with  lunch money  in return for approving gun licenses. When asked how much  lunch money  the cops were getting, Officer-1 said $100.Court filings show that the officers approved licenses for Lichtenstein s clients, including people with criminal records who were not legally able to obtain a license in New York City.Read the full complaint here.Featured image via Pixabay",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: GOP Senate Candidate Kept Referring To President Obama As An ‘Animal’,"The presumed nomination of Donald Trump has given a new flavor to the 2016 GOP field. Or, perhaps I should say that the presumed nomination of Trump has given new courage to people who have spent far too many years (in their opinions) hiding their racist views.Carlos Beruff, who is running for Marco Rubio s Senate seat in Florida, is one of those previously silenced people whose racist views have been liberated by the Trump campaign, and he let his racist flag fly high at a St. Johns County GOP meeting on Thursday. His favorite nickname for the President?  Animal. Unfortunately, for seven and a half years this animal we call president, because he s an animal, OK   seven and a half years, has surgically and with thought and very smart, intelligent manner, destroyed this country and dismantled the military under not one, not two, but three secretary of defenses,  he said.  And they ve all written books about it. Sooner or later, you re going to find, this was a plan, he wants us to be just another country. I don t want to be another country. I want to be the United States of America, the greatest country in the world,  he added, garnering a round of applause.Here s the video:Beruff has more than racism in common with Trump. Like Trump, he s a successful land developer and like Trump, he sees the government as standing in the way of him and more riches. If he was to be elected, there would be conflicts of interest from every direction:Today he s one of the wealthiest developers in Southwest Florida, building more than 2,500 homes in three different counties. And as his business grew, so did his political influence fueled by campaign contributions to then Florida Governor Charlie Crist. Crist appointed him to three civic boards. The Southwest Florida Water Management district, the State College of Florida, the Manatee-Sarasota Airport Authority.In 2010 Beruff then shifted his allegiance to Governor Rick Scott, who appointed him to his health panel and reappointed him to positions already held.His role as developer has been no less controversial. For example, Long Bar Pointe, a 500-acre development that environmentalists say could cause irreparable damage to the shoreline.More than 6,500 opponents signed a petition against the Long Bar Pointe development. Ultimately, the county voted Beruff s proposal down and now Beruff is suing the county government for its actions.Source: My Sun CoastBeruff, though, is even more extreme than Trump. He wants to ban not just Muslims, but all immigration from the Middle East. That would even include the Christians who are being persecuted by ISIS.Fortunately for Floridians and the nation, Beruff is unlikely to win. Right now, he s at one percent.Featured image via Carlos Beruff Facebook page.",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher SCORCHES Republicans: Stop Blaming Liberals – ‘Trump Is YOUR Problem’ (VIDEO),"Since the rise of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, the GOP has been throwing up their hands in disbelief and trying to blame everyone but themselves for the success of such a horrendous presidential candidate, all while completely ignoring the fact that conservatives have paved the way for a candidate like Trump to succeed with decades of hateful rhetoric and ignorance.Bill Maher expertly pointed this out on Friday night during his HBO show Real Time, when he sent a very special message to Republicans: stop blaming liberals for the candidate you created! Pointing out several headlines that showed that conservative  think pieces  have been pointing the finger at liberals, Maher destroyed the concept that liberals condescension and political correctness forced otherwise reasonable people into Trump s hateful embrace. Maher brilliantly dissed the illogical, rage-driven individuals that support Trump, sarcastically stating that they would vote rationally if not for overbearing liberals, scientists, and historians and nutritionists telling real Americans that they re dumb. It hurts their feelings when we insult their values with our facts.  He continued: I m sorry you find it irritating when liberals point out that global warming exists or that racism exists or that gay people exist. But here s the thing: You people were wrong about all that. Maher also attacked conservatives  opposition to facts and reason   which has been going on long before Trump entered the political arena. Maher hilariously joked that liberals were to blame for things like the man-bun and gluten free cupcakes   so the GOP must accept blame for the racism and widespread hatred of Muslims, because those are the very attitudes that the Republican party has propelled over the last several years. They are what is truly to blame for Trump s rise.Maher even stated that he himself has mocked political incorrectness in the past, criticizing liberals for overreactions. However, Maher said that  none of that justifies embracing a dangerous buffoon simply because his lack of political correctness is cathartic. To a huge round of applause, Maher sent a message straight to the GOP: Trump is your problem. But somehow the party of personal responsibility doesn t want to take responsibility for this one.

 Republicans Now Trying To Draft Billionaire Mark Cuban For Third Party Run,"A group of desperate republicans which includes Mitt Romney, William Kristol, Erick Erickson, Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson, among others, is desperately trying to find someone to present a third party challenge to Donald Trump.According to the Washington Post, the group of more than a dozen republicans is  commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources  and courting potential contenders. Among those contacted by the group was billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and reality TV star.Cuban told the Washington Post that the group thought he would make a good candidate, based on his  loud persona,  and  ability to connect with voters. As Addicting Info reports here, back in December during an appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, the NBA team owner had nothing good to say about republican frontrunner Donald Trump.Cuban said: There s so much more to come (from Trump). Because they re not playing for real yet. There s nothing at stake yet. This is all just chit chat. He s just warming up the audience. He s like that guy who is going into a bar and he ll say whatever it will take to get laid. Only in this case, he s not trying to f*ck some girl, he s trying to f*ck the country. While Cuban has also criticized Donald Trump s anti-Muslim fearmongering, the billionaire has come under fire for racist remarks of his own.While speaking at a conference in Nashville in 2014, Cuban said: I know I m prejudiced, and I know I m bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I ll move to the other side of the street. When he was asked about keeping racism out of the NBA, Cuban responded by saying, You don t. There s no law against stupid. I m the one guy who says don t force the stupid people to be quiet. I want to know who the morons are. In other words, let racists be racists.According to the Washington Post Cuban says it s unlikely he ll launch a third party bid to challenge Trump because he doesn t believe there is enough time to mount a successful campaign.The group admits there is very little time left to achieve the goal, but they aren t ready to give up yet.As Addicting Info reported here, Romney was at first considered to be a possible third party candidate. Although he decided not to enter the race himself, he is now helping in the effort to find someone who will.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is next on the list of possible recruits.Featured image via Brian Solis via Flickr",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Michelle Obama Wore A Nice Dress, So Conservatives Called Her ‘Ape’ And ‘Gorilla’ (SCREENSHOTS)","This may shock you, but Michelle Obama wears clothing. In fact, sometimes she wears very nice clothing, like the Naeem Khan dress she wore to the Nordic state dinner on Friday. The Washington Post reports:Michelle Obama is standing out in a sea of black tuxedos in a blush-colored, strapless, floor-length gown at the Nordic Summit dinner.The first lady chose a dress by Indian-born designer Naeem Khan for the White House dinner honoring the leaders of Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Norway. She finished the look with gold jewelry and a wispy chignon.While state dinners typically celebrate a single head of state   and Mrs. Obama often wears a gown by a designer from the country being honored   the Nordic party was a twist on typical White House protocol.The President did, indeed, step on his wife s dress. The First Lady feigned outrage, then the couple had some fun with the situation. She looks good,  Barack said when the two paused for photographs.  He stepped on my dress,  Michelle followed up. The President then put a finger up to his lips, playfully  shushing  as though the incident was to remain a huge secret. It was a very human moment for the First Couple. Naturally, conservatives had to jump in to share their thoughts on the  apes  in the White House. You can put lipstick on a monkey, but you still have a monkey,  one commenter on ABC News  Facebook page wrote. One person wondered if  his  (Michelle s)  fake booby  popped out of the dress. Others lamented that she did not fall and harm herself, while some chose to simply call her a  pig  and a  gorilla.                     The unbridled hatred leveled at the First Family is unprecedented. Recently, upon learning that Malia Obama had gotten into Harvard, Fox News fans took time out of their busy day of huffing paint fumes and masturbating to Donald Trump s photograph to inform everyone they thought she was a  n*gger. Barack and Michelle Obama have weathered a nonstop barrage of racist comments since before the President was elected the first time, but conservatives have not been remotely content to leave it at that. They genuinely believe that black people living in the WHITE ( White  is, after all, in the name) HOUSE is a crime against nature.Barack Obama has been arguably the best President in decades, perhaps in our country s history, and will probably be the best for at least decades to come. Michelle Obama is a classy woman whose strength has enabled the President to be all that he is. Their children are impressive young ladies who will certainly make an impact on the world. The problem is that our frenemies on the Right are incapable of seeing anything more than a skin color they hate.Watch this deeply human event unfold below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New Expose Details Just How Terrible Donald Trump REALLY Is With Women,"Americans can thank that pesky liberal media for spotlighting just how awful presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump really is. While he has proven to be a blustering sexist all on his own with comments made towards women like Megyn Kelly, Rosie O Donnell and fellow Republican Carly Fiorina, the press is helping him along as well.But, despite Trump s own damning antics, it s a recent expose in the New York Times appropriately titled  Crossing the Line: How Donald TrumpBehaved With Women in Private   that really dives deep below the surface into Trump s misogynistic harassment towards multiple women:The lengthy expose meticulously details multiple instances of inappropriate conduct with women, from models in the Miss America pageant, to employees in his Trump empire, and they re vivid memories of his disgusting behavior:The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants; women who had dated him or interacted with him socially; and women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks.Their accounts   many relayed here in their own words   reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections.Such instances include:The list goes on and on. From his early days at the military academy in the 1960s to his presidential campaign now, Trump has lived a life of debauchery, sexism, borderline pedophilia, cheating, manipulating and pure misogyny.And now he s the nominee for a major political party for President of the United States. I can only imagine how he would treat interns and White House staff.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ben Carson Accidentally Reveals Trump’s Top VP Choices And The List Will Leave You ROTFL,"The mere fact that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee for president of the United States is quite comical in of itself   not only because it s Donald Trump, but alsobecause he s been able to basically destroy the Republican party. How much more damage can the billionaire demagogue possibly do? Well, plenty if you count the people and more specifically that one person he has on his short list for vice-president. The king of the disintegrating Republican party may anoint a queen. That s right folks, Sarah Palin is on the short list of candidates for Trump s vice-president.According to the Washington Post, Ben Carson, who is now the head of Trump s vice presidential search committee, was driving on his way to a television interview when he accidentally revealed the list to a reporter who was riding in his car. The list included Sarah Palin.After the mellow and weird doctor told the reporter that he would not behave in the same way as Dick Cheney when Cheney headed Bush s vice presidential search committee but nominated himself, Carson s wife, Candy, pointed out that a poll had Carson as the top choice to be Trump s running mate. Carson was told that John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin, and Chris Christie had also been named in the poll.That s when he revealed the names.  Those are all people on our list,  Carson said.  Well, not you,  his wife said.It sure would be hilarious to watch yet another Trump victim start working for Trump. Ben Carson, who prior to his GOP run was a respected doctor and human being, was compared to a child molester by Trump but is now his defender on every news station imaginable. Chris Christie, who was also obliterated by Trump became his lackey. Who could forget the time when Christie stood stone faced behind Trump like a deer caught in headlights? Then of course there s Ted Cruz, or as Trump referred to him,  Lyin Ted,  who was dragged through the mud by Trump. We also can t forget  Little Marco  Rubio, the golden boy of the Republican party, but who was also humiliated by Trump.However, the match made in heaven or should I say hell would be a Trump/Palin ticket. The hope is she ll help bring Trump down in the same way she helped bring down John McCain. It would be quite a surprise for Trump to pick Palin but with these Republicans, you just never know.UPDATE: Donald Trump released a tweet disavowing Carson s list (despite Carson at one time being assigned to help pick the VP), saying  most  of the names on the list are wrong and specifically Marco Rubio.The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.  Donald J.

 Trump Lashes Out At Warren With An EVEN MORE Racist Attack Than The Last One,"During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump referred to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as  Pocahontas. In the piece published on Saturday, Dowd says that she asked Trump if Trump had received any negative comments from Republicans about him and Sen. Elizabeth Warren s Twitter feud. Trump responded to the question with a question, saying,  Who, Pocahontas? The jab is a part of a conservative conspiracy theory that alleges that Warren does not actually have the Native American heritage she claims she does. Apparently conservatives are not capable of understanding that a person can have a mixed racial and ethnic background. Which shouldn t be surprising considering Tea Party types aren t capable of understanding that a man named Barack Hussein Obama,isn t automatically a Muslim terrorist sleeper agent sent here to destroy the United States from the inside.Once again, Trump has denigrated a person based on racial lines. When pressed on any issue Trump falls back to posturing as a bully. He ll take any ridiculous notion and just run with it because he knows that his followers will simply laugh it up.However, even the Republican candidate who seems impervious to gaffes and criticism should reconsider accusing someone of inventing an identity after recent reports of Trump s bizarre  John Miller  scandal. The Washington Post s Marc Fisher uncovered audio recordings that show that Trump invented a fictional spokesman for himself named John Miller back in the 1970 s, 80 s and 90 s. During that period, Trump would pretend to be Miller or on occasion  John Barron - and call reporters where  Miller  would say wonderful things about Trump, in an attempt to inflate Trump s personal brand.Trump has denied the allegations, though the Post reports that there is courtroom testimony where Trump himself had admitted to creating the fictional personality.Featured image  (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SERIOUSLY? Male News Anchor Forces Female Meteorologist To Cover Up Her Dress On Air (VIDEO),"A meteorologist wearing a rather classy dress was shocked when a male anchor humiliated her on air because he felt her clothing was inappropriate. In a scene straight out of the 1920 s, KTLA5 anchor Chris Burrous decided that Libert  Chan s dress was a huge problem   large enough to interrupt her reporting of the weather with the BREAKING NEWS that he felt she was dressed like a dirty, dirty harlot.As she was delivering the wind report, Chan noticed a hand entering the frame. That hand was clutching a drab, gray sweater. What s going on?  Chan asked.  You want me to put this on? Why? Because it s cold? We re getting a lot of emails,  Burrous explained as he thrust the sweater forward. What!  a shocked Chan replied. echoing the sentiments of any reasonable person watching the broadcast. Really? Chan smiled uncomfortably as Burrous put the sweater on her in the middle of her report.  There you go,  he said condescendingly. I look like a librarian now,  she said as she attempted to process what had just happened. That works,  the anchor responded.  It s a librarian who s gone to a cocktail party. Everyone s got an opinion about your dress this morning. Interestingly, Chan had just spent a considerable amount of time off camera where she could have been approached about her dress if there was a problem (but, of course, there wasn t a single issue with her clothing). The anchor, however, chose to shame her on camera simply because she looked good in what she was wearing. I m sorry but the other dress didn t work,  Chan told her asshole of a coworker.  I had to wear something. The rest of Chan s report was uncomfortable, with the meteorologist doing a spectacular job of masking the rage that was building inside her after she was shamed for simply wearing a piece of clothing. At one point, she broke into nervous laughter. I m trying to hold it together in my little sweater,  she explained.Unlike Burrous, she managed to keep things professional the rest of her time on-air. The male anchor was correct, though. Everyone does have an opinion on Chan s dress   more specifically, his reaction to it. Unfortunately, he s not going to like those opinions:        Just to add some perspective, these are the hugely professional shorts Burrous was wearing as he shamed his coworker:The station has not yet released a statement, but anything less than  Chris Burrous has been fired, and we apologize for shaming our incredibly talented meteorologist who deserves a raise  is inadequate.Watch it below, via Raw Story:Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans In Congress Want To Give Donald Trump Unrestricted War Powers,"If Donald Trump becomes president, you better prepare for World War III, because if Republicans have their way, their presumptive nominee will have unprecedented power to wage war across the globe without restrictions from Congress.Throughout his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump has bragged that he  wants to have a much stronger military  so strong that nobody is going to mess with us.  Of course, that means increased military spending that is completely unnecessary because we already have the top military in the world and we spend more on our military than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, England, India, and Germany combined. In fact, we could slash our military spending in half and would still spend more than any other nation.Graph courtesy of Peter G. Peterson FoundationBut Republicans are gunning to keep military spending at monstrous levels and they are willing to give Trump unprecedented and unlimited war power.Earlier this year, Senate Republicans introduced a new Authorization for Use of Military Force that would authorize presidents to wage war anywhere anytime without having to ask Congress for a declaration of war as the Constitution requires.According to Huffington Post:[The AUMF] would give the president new authority to take action against the militant group also known as ISIS or ISIL. It wouldn t put any limits on the duration, geography or use of U.S. ground combat troops in the war, or on the means by which the U.S. military could act. It also would keep in place a broad AUMF from 2001 that never expired and that allows the president to take military action against anyone, anywhere, connected to the terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks.In other words, Donald Trump would have complete power to go to war whenever he wants against whomever he wants and Republican lawmakers are just fine with that because they don t want the responsibility of making war decisions. I don t like the idea of telling a commander-in-chief they can t go where ISIL goes, they re limited by time, geography and means,  South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said.  If I don t like the time, geography or means, I can cut off funding. Alabama GOP Rep. Mike Rogers thinks Donald Trump would  be an improvement  over President Obama, who has used diplomacy effectively in his foreign policy agenda while limiting his own war strategy to air strikes and predator drone strikes rather than sending thousands of American troops to war.South Carolina GOP Rep. Joe Wilson thinks  we need to finish what we started,  and he is totally okay with Donald Trump controlling the military because he suggested Trump will also try to work with the terrorists, too.Senator Chuck Grassley said he would comfortable with Trump as long as he  has a plan,  and Arizona GOP Rep. Trent Franks wants Trump to  advocate the maintenance and strength of a military capable of dealing with the growing threats to freedom this world faces  and  dismiss the practice of Mr. Obama of emboldening our enemies and disheartening our friends. That s basically code meaning that Trump should rip up the nuclear deal with Iran to reduce their nuclear material and attack them instead even though the deal is working.Trump has already declared his disapproval of the deal. He also said in 2011 that America should use  any and all means necessary  to stop Iran s nuclear program, which includes military force.Republicans are already itching for a war against Iran. A President Trump could give them one unilaterally.Trump has also suggested in his book The America We Deserve that he would use force against North Korea, which would guarantee a new Korean War.[In a Trump presidency], North Korea would suddenly discover that its worthless promises of civilized behavior would cut no ice. I would let Pyongyang know in no uncertain terms that it can either get out of the nuclear arms race or expect a rebuke similar to the one Ronald Reagan delivered to Ghadhafi in 1986. I don t think anybody is going to accuse me of tiptoeing through the issues or tap-dancing around them either. Who else in public life has called for a pre-emptive strike on North Korea?Trump has also not been secretive about the fact that he wants to bring back the use of torture and commit war crimes against civilian populations in the effort to defeat terrorists.That s scary enough, but consider this.As president, Donald Trump would also have control over the nation s nuclear arsenal. And he has already refused to rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe and the Middle East.In short, a President Trump could usher in a nuclear Armageddon and Congress has absolutely no problem with this.If Trump somehow defeats Hillary Clinton in November and Republicans retain control of the Senate and the House, we could see World War III as the thin-skinned businessman in the White House responds to the smallest of slights or Republican prodding with military strikes that could spill the blood of thousands of American soldiers and put the country further into debt.That is what is at stake in this election so let s hope people start taking this seriously.Featured image via Flickr ",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: GOP Chair Says ‘People Don’t Care’ About Trump’s Treatment Of Women, Gets Destroyed By Fox Host","Well you really have to hand it to Trump. Now that he s destroyed every establishment candidate, the GOP is left with him as the presumptive nominee. Although some in the GOP establishment continue to kick and scream at the thought of the billionaire businessman being crowned the new king of the party, many are now coming to grips and even defending the demagogue in public and that s quite hard to do given Trump s rhetoric and history.In a sign that the GOP is surrendering to the new face of the GOP, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus defended Trump, even going as far as saying that  people just don t care about Trump s alleged terrible treatment of women.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEbXW2LzjWY]During an interview, Fox host Chris Wallace asked Priebus about a  New York Times report that found  repeated instances of Trump insulting women and making unwanted advances even in the workplace. Priebus  response was odd given that he is the RNC chair. He said,  Well, you know, a lot of things bother me. And obviously, I m the wrong person to be asking that particular question.  Wallace quickly pounced on the chairman, saying,  Wait a minute, why are you the wrong person? You re the chairman of the party. This is your nominee, and they re saying he has mistreated women. Priebus  response was ridiculous. He said: People just don t care. I think people look at Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and say,  Who is going to bring an earthquake to Washington, D.C.?  I don t think Donald Trump and his personal life is something that people are looking at and saying,  Wow, I m surprised that he s had girlfriends.  That s not what people look at. Chris Wallace quickly interjected saying: Whoa, forgive me, sir. It s not whether or not he had girlfriends. The question is whether or not he mistreated women, whether he made unwanted advances, whether he humiliated women in the workplace. It s disturbing to see that the Republican moral compass is non-existent. They would rather support a sexist megalomaniac who disrespects women and minorities than say the truth: Donald Trump is not the right choice to be president of the United States.Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: CNN Host Destroys Trump Campaign Manager For Denying Trump Acted As His Own Publicist,"Despite the fact that Donald Trump has admitted in the past that he has acted as his own publicist, he and his campaign continue to deny that it was his voice on the recordings. Jake Tapper confronted Trump s campaign manager on the issue and his defense of Trump was sloppy and full of nonsense.On Sunday morning s State of the Union, Tapper played the now infamous tape of Trump impersonating his own PR guy, and then asked campaign manager Paul Manafort if the campaign is  seriously claiming that wasn t Mr. Trump?  Manafort stuck to his story but Tapper pressed on and put Manafort on the spot. Tapper said: In 1990 under oath he testified he did use the name John Barron, and in 1991 he told People magazine he did use the name John Miller so this has already been admitted previously. I don t understand why now. Manafort then said,  I don t know those facts to be true or not. I just know that he said it s not him. I believe him.  He then went on in an attempt to change the subject, citing what he said was the lack of importance of the issue: I don t even know the relevance of this frankly. It s 25 years old and they re not dealing with the issues that Trump is trying to focus on today. Jobs, terrorism, immigration problems. These are the issues we should be talking about. Why the media is spending so much time going by 25 years, talking about People magazine on a tape that may or may not be Trump. But Tapper wasn t having it, and he explained the relevance of the story to Manafort. Here s what he said: This issue is here you have a man who in his 40 s allegedly is his own public relations agent, bragging about his exploits with women while married to Ivana Trump, the mother of his three children and speaks to a certain kind of character issue don t you think? Indeed, the character flaws here are tremendous. The lies along with the alleged betrayal of his wife and his disgusting talk about women should all be taken as important issues, especially since Trump is trying to become president. Let s hope it never comes to that scenario.Watch video here on mediaite.comFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rush Limbaugh: Legalize Rape By Calling It A Civil Rights Issue (AUDIO),"During his radio show on Friday, Rush Limbaugh suggested that legalizing rape would be easy as long as you frame it as a civil rights issue like same-sex marriage and transgender protections. The media is not covering this transgender thing the way normal people, or sane people like myself,  a caller told Limbaugh before launching into the myth of predators using transgender protections as a shield to sexually assault women and children in bathrooms. I don t have any daughters, but I have nieces, I have teenage nieces, I have older nieces, I have a wife. This is a safety issue, this is about a predator, like the story you just read, going into these bathrooms and taking advantage of it. And it s happening, but they re not covering it. And it s really interesting how they took gun control and turned it into gun safety, but they re not treating this as a safety issue. And the sick mind of Limbaugh immediately thought of rape and how to legalize it. No, that s actually a good point. Civil rights   you could legalize rape if you called it the Civil Rights Act of 2016. Limbaugh continued, however, by whining about how much civil rights have been extended over the last few decades, especially lamenting that it now covers race, gender, and sexual orientation because he apparently believes only white straight men deserve civil rights. He also claimed it was only  a joke. So they always attach people, the reading public, the news consuming public, has been conditioned to attach the words  civil rights  to race. Now it s being expanded. Civil rights, gay marriage; civil rights, transgender bathroom rights; civil rights, whatever the left wants. Except over here, rape has become a safety issue. But over here this stuff is a civil rights   if, when you hear the left equate anything with civil rights, what you should learn is this is how they are attempting to corrupt the culture. And they re doing it under the banner of civil rights, which is supposed to shut you up. It is supposed to silence opposition, because nobody with a brain is ever supposed to violate civil rights. Never, anybody with a brain would know never to oppose anything that says  civil rights  attached to it. Which is why the joke, you could legalize whatever you want by calling it the Civil Rights Act of 2016, because nobody would have the guts to vote against it. Because if they did you d have the media, Democrats running around, saying so-and-so voted against the Civil Rights Act of 2016 denying all of our citizens equal rights, blah blah blah blah blah. Here s the audio via Media Matters.In his effort to slander Democrats, Limbaugh also claimed that  rape has become a safety issue  for conservatives. First of all, Limbaugh seems to be admitting that conservatives never cared about rape before. And second, if conservatives really believe rape is a safety issue, perhaps they should stop aiding and rewarding rapists by not forcing rape victims to carry rape pregnancies to term. Furthermore, they can repeal laws that allow rapists to seek custody and visitation rights. Or how about believing women when they say they were raped instead of saying they were asking for it.The fact is that there have been zero instances of a transgender person doing anything but using the restroom like a normal person. They certainly haven t sexually assaulted anyone. And that s throughout the 17 states and over 200 cities that have transgender protection in place. In fact, the only men who have gone into a restroom to scare women and children are the ones being purposely sent in there by the Family Research Council, a right-wing group trying to instill fear of transgender people by pretending there is a problem with them using the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity.But get ready, folks. It won t be long before a conservative lawmaker takes Limbaugh seriously like usual and literally writes a bill to legalize rape by excusing it as a civil rights issue. And the way Republicans have treated rape victims over the years, you know they are considering it.Featured image via  screenshot",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: SNL Mocks Trump For Pretending To Be His Own Publicist In Hilarious Cold Open,"In a comedy skit in its own right, Donald Trump is now the presumptive nominee for the presidency of the United States, and it all happened despite the fact that the billionaire businessman has said some of the worst things ever about minorities and women. However, his antics and demeanor are certainly comical and the material he s provided has been a dream come true for late night talk shows and especially the people at Saturday Night Live. The recent discovery that Donald Trump once posed as his own publicist created yet more material for SNL.In the latest skit, Darrell Hammond s  Donald Trump  is on the phone with a reporter who didn t believe that he was Trump s publicist Joe Pepperoni.   No, I am not Donald Trump in disguise,  he said.  This is just what classy people sound like, OK? Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_6Xa6KOlw]Then Bobby Moynihan s  Chris Christie  showed up to help the billionaire businessman and Republican nightmare pick his running mate. When Jebb Bush was suggested, both went into uncontrollable laughter. After everyone from Carly Fiorina to Bruce Springsteen were rejected by  Trump,  he wondered why no major Republican wanted to be his vice president. Christie  immediately saw an opportunity. He said: If I may be so bold. Sir, anyone who didn t want to be your VP would be a damn fool. You are such a special candidate. And maybe, just maybe the person you have been looking for the whole time is standing in this room right now. Trump  replied,  You are so right, Ben Carson, want to be vice president?

 Researchers Used Doctored Pics Of Obama To Link Racism Directly To The Tea Party (STUDY),"It s always been obvious to people with half a clue or better that the hatred towards our president was more because of the color of his skin than anything he could possibly have done politically. Had a white man walked into the same mess and turned it around into hope for the future and a better country than the one he was handed, he d be Bill Clinton.A sociologist from Stanford University had the idea that the resurgence of racism in America didn t just coincide with the rise of the Tea Party, it drove it. That left a lot of analysts slack-jawed, wondering: What was this latent force that drove the emergence of this movement?  said Robb Willer. According to The Washington Post:Willer speculates that one thing connecting these two political earthquakes might be white voters  unconscious racial biases. In a series of psychological experiments between 2011 and 2015, he showed how hostility toward people with darker skin and perceived racial threats can influence white support for the tea party. He and his colleagues published a draft of a paper on their findings online last week  some of the most direct evidence of the importance of race to the conservative resurgence during Obama s presidency.The experiment was simple. Two groups of people are shown images of celebrities that include a picture of the president, one with darker skin and one with lighter. The group that saw the dark-skinned Obama were twice as likely to support the Tea Party when asked afterward. Because of the color of a man s skin and nothing else. Willer s team didn t stop there, either. They moved on to see where else race played a major role and landed smack-dab on white privilege.The groups were given conflicting innocuous reports about the U.S. population and demographics. One report said the white people should hold a strong majority in this country for the foreseeable future and the other says whites will decline into a minority by 2060. The group that heard they were safely white-washed were far more likely to support the Tea Party. When all of a sudden the support of minorities looks like it will be key, support for the Tea Party plummets.All of this, every last bit of it, is due to racism. When the Tea Party stormed Washington DC in 2010, packing congressional offices with morons as far as the eye could see, their number one agenda, along with the rest of the GOP, was to stop President Obama from accomplishing anything. They failed, but the influence is still there. When Lindsey Graham stood in front of cameras and declared that his party had gone  batsh*t crazy,  he wasn t kidding.Featured image from Wikipedia altered by Rob Willer",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jennifer Lawrence Has Two VERY Choice Words For Trump If She Ever Meets Him (NSFW VIDEO),"Whether you love him or hate him, most of us probably have a clue what we d like to say to Donald Trump if we were to ever come into contact with him, and actress Jennifer Lawrence is no exception.While discussing Trump on The Graham Norton Show, a show that airs in the U.K. and doesn t have the strict regulations against language that the United States does, Lawrence let everyone in on a scenario that she tried to make happen.When asked if she had ever met Trump, Lawrence explained that she hadn t, but he was at the same concert she was attending. She explained: I was at a concert where I heard he was attending, so I had my full security team, like I was like  find Donald Trump I was adamant on finding him and making a video of me going,  Hey Trump, FUCK YOU!'

 Video Of Police Shooting 76-Year-Old Mentally Ill Man Released (VIDEO),"On March 21, 2016, 76-year-old Ralph  Phil  Grenon was shot and killed in his apartment by a Burlington, VT police officer. According to Grenon s family, he began showing signs of a mental illness about a month before his fatal encounter with police.Burlington police say that the manager of the apartment complex where Grenon lived called 911 earlier that evening to report that Grenon was exhibiting  threatening behavior. The Burlington Free Press reports that Grenon refused to respond to officers who were called out to the scene. A mental health expert was also brought to the scene, but five hours later he remained unresponsive inside of his apartment.According to the Free Press, officers say they were  unsure of Grenon s state.  For this reason they decided to enter the apartment.While Burlington police have released a significant amount of footage from the night that Grenon was killed, nearly all of it was released in a way that raises significant ethical questions, according to an article published by the Free Press on May 11.As reported here:Police released the videos by posting them on YouTube, but making them difficult for the public to find, following an announcement Tuesday by state and local prosecutors that Officer David Bowers, 23, was justified when he shot and killed Ralph  Phil  Grenon, 76, in March.Additionally, the Free Press reports that:The initial footage was released in an email to reporters Tuesday evening that contained links to the YouTube posts, which used privacy settings that prevented the videos from being searchable through Google or YouTube.University of Vermont media and communications law professor Chris Evans also criticized the way that police went about releasing the video, saying  they definitely did not fulfill the full request,  made by journalists. Evans also pointed out that they did not  follow the procedure they should have followed,  when releasing the video.The video below shows that Grenon was hiding in the shower when police entered the apartment. A group of officers can be seen aiming their weapons at the shower curtain. One officer uses a broom to pull the curtain back, exposing Grenon. At this point it becomes clear that Grenon is holding a knife.Almost as soon as the curtain is pulled back an officer uses a taser on the man. Grenon responds by leaping out of the shower. Shortly after this, officer Bowers opens fire, shooting Grenon multiple times. No other officers discharged their weapons.Watch the video below via YouTube:The Burlington Free Press provides links to additional video footage published by police here.According to both the prosecutor and the Attorney General, the shooting of Ralph  Phil  Grenon was justified.Grenon s daughter, Niki Grenon Carpenter, states that her father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. During a press conference on May 10, she told reporters that she is frustrated with a system that continues to fail citizens who suffer from mental illness. Carpenter says that she hopes her father s death will help change that system.Image credit: video screen capture via Cops Caught On Tape on YouTube",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Racist Barber Pulls Gun On Black Man Who Asked For A Haircut (VIDEO)," Racism doesn t exist anymore! The United States is as inclusive as it s ever been! White supremacists don t live in the USA! We have a black president, that proves it! This is the kind of bullshit you hear from the right-wing all the time. According to them, we live in a post-racial America where everyone loves everyone else and racism is a thing of the past. It is very clear that people who believe this are either lying, stupid or completely unaware of what is going on in the world (I think it s a combination of the three), because it hard to genuinely believe that when you turn on the news and hear about things like the following story.Arthur Hill walked into a barbershop in Rock Hill, South Carolina on Tuesday and asked for a haircut. The barber, Larry Thomas, responded by saying he doesn t  cut black hair.  Hill, shocked by the answer, asked Thomas what he meant and that s when he saw a silver .38 caliber snub-nose revolver in the barber s hand: I was shocked, I was shocked for my life, because I m thinking that could ve been me laying on the floor dead,  Hill, the would-be customer, told NBC affiliate WCNC.  He did not point it at me, but it was clear in sight like he meant business. Thomas told police that Hill was lying and that his guns were all in a shed out back. Officers looked in the shed and found handguns that matched the description Hill gave to them   shocking. York County Sheriff s deputies arrested the barber and charged him with  pointing and presenting a firearm at a person,  a felony.Deputies say Rock Hill barber told African-American man that he ""does not cut black hair"" & pulled a gun on the man pic.twitter.com/GLXPzC2UiZ  WBTV News (@WBTV_News) May 11, 2016When the dipshit was released from jail, his story about where he had the guns suddenly changed. According to The Washington Post he told media outlets that he had the gun because he was afraid: I always have a gun right here,  Thomas told WCNC, as he tapped his cabinet.  But I felt threatened because that man came walking back here to where I was, I felt threatened and I picked up the gun and I had it here by my side. I told him I did not do black hair and he kept coming towards me and I stepped back here and I always keep a gun right here and I just picked up my gun and put my gun at my side, Thomas told WBTV.  That s when he got into my face and said  You meant African American now, didn t you? Thomas also claims that racism had nothing to do with his statement that he doesn t  cut black hair.  Instead, he says that he just isn t good enough to do it. However, although that may seem like a plausible excuse, WBTV says that they found eight other calls to police from the shop. In most of those cases, customers   including a Latino and an Asian man  all claimed they were refused service.It s very obvious that Thomas is a vile piece of racist trash who refuses service to people based on the color of their skin and apparently does it with a gun in his hand. So in addition to proving that racism is not dead, he is also proving that gun nuts are a bunch of wimps who need to cling to their penile extensions to solve their problems. Well done, he is the embodiment of a right-wing imbecile.Watch: https://youtu.be/L2Pk5A-P7-0Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Vehemently Anti-Gay Pastor Arrested On 70 Counts Of Child Porn,"On May 9, Pastor David Reynolds, formerly of Cornerstone Bible Fellowship Church in Sherwood, Arkansas, was arrested on 70 counts of child pornography.According to the Sherwood Police Department, Reynolds  arrest followed a lengthy investigation which began with a tip to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in December.KARK reports that Reynolds had at least three social media accounts which were registered under assumed names. He used those accounts to distribute and receive child pornography.Sgt. Keith Wilson of the Sherwood Police Department told KARK that police also found a large number of pictures on Reynolds computer. One of the photos was of a 13-year-old girl who was identified as a member of Reynold s church. The girl was able to help police identify other children who were in photos stored on Reynold s computer.Reynolds was removed from all duties with the church on March 7, after he admitted to church members that he had a  problem with pornography. Church elders released a statement regarding his removal, saying:On March 7th the elders of Cornerstone removed Dave Reynolds from all responsibility at Cornerstone. Dave had informed two of the elders that he was engaged in pornography and thought the elders might learn of this from another party, hence he decided to inform us of his involvement in this sin. Those two elders specifically asked Dave if he had viewed under age pornography to which he replied that he had not knowingly done so.Reynolds plead not guilty to the charges and is currently being held on a $250,000 bond.Queerty reports that Reynolds sermons were often vehemently anti-gay. According to the website, the former pastor preached against same-sex marriage and consensual same-sex relationships of any kind, saying that all LGBTQ relationships are  sin. How anyone can preach that a relationship between two consenting adults is sin while at the same time sending and receiving images of innocent children for their own sick sexual gratification is beyond comprehension.Image credit: Marine Glisovic KATV via Twitter",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Robert De Niro Makes Sure To Perfectly Roast Trump During GLAAD Media Awards Speech,"Every year GLAAD holds their media awards ceremony to  recognize and honor media for their fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and the issues that affect their lives. This year, GLAAD honored Robert De Niro with the Excellence in Media Award.It was during his speech, however, that De Niro took a moment to take a sarcastic jab at those who think middle-aged white men have it bad, and of course, make fun of Donald Trump while he was at it. He said: You think you ve got it bad, LBGT community? I don t think you know what it s like to be really discriminated against   I recently turned on the television news and saw this odd guy with little hands, and he was raving. Turns out, the ones being discriminated against are straight, middle-aged white men It makes sense. I ve been losing parts right and left to what used to be called  diversity actors. One that really hurts, seeing the role of Dr. Dre in Straight Outta Compton going to Corey Hawkins. And I can t remember the last time I got a Teen Choice Award.   It s not easy being a straight, white man. Of course, he s joking. Being a straight, white man is pretty much winning the lottery when it comes to genetics. Straight, white men start from a point of being respected where most others seem to need to  prove  themselves. And, of course, he s clearly referencing Donald Trump with his  odd guy with little hands  who was  raving  and claiming he s being  discriminated against.  It s funny because it s true, and it s also funny because he just got his ass handed to him by Robert De Niro.Watch the whole speech here:VIDEO: Robert De Niro accepts the Excellence In Media Award at the #glaadawards https://t.co/FMBl01Q1VY  GLAAD (@glaad) May 15, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Franklin Graham’s Daughter: 9/11 Happened Because God Is Mad At Trans People (AUDIO),"Religious bigots continue their hateful rhetoric against transgender people at alarming rates, and now Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of hateful evangelical pastor Franklin Graham and sister to the equally hateful Billy Graham, has jumped into the fray as well. Her statements are especially outrageous; in fact, she has said that the reason the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on U.S. soil happened is because God is  upset that transgender people exist.Lotz appeared on a right-wing hate radio show run by Steve Deace to express her horrible opinions. She said to Deace: What I see in the nation of America right now, just the chaos on every level.There is silliness, there is craziness, there s the most illogical rulings. The one in North Carolina on HB2, which is to protect our children in bathrooms and locker rooms, has become something where the justice department is suing us for something that s just common sense.To me it s evidence that God has backed away. Here is a bit of audio of these statements, via Right Wing Watch:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/263809966  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]If you think that s bad, you ain t seen nothing yet. This nutty woman then went on to pretty much directly blame the advancement of transgender rights in the United States for terrorism. Lotz said: In our nation, one of the things we pray for is that some of this craziness would settle down  [but] our nation seems to be shaking its fist in God s face, we re abandoning God as a nation.What happens then is God abandons us and backs away, he he takes his favour and blessing away from us.[If we repent] I think he would begin to reveal the plots of terrorists before they are carried out, even the weather patterns he can control and protect us from violent storms.I think that s why God allows bad things to happen. I think that d why he would allow 9/11 to happen, or the dreadful attack in San Bernardino. To show us we need him.

 Obamacare Officially Bans Transgender Discrimination,"While Republicans whine and complain that their right to be a bigot is being  infringed  on by the big bad liberal government, the Obama Administration is (once again) doing the right thing by directing the Department of Health and Human Services to ban all forms of discrimination against transgender individuals.Not only does it ban discrimination against the transgender community, it goes even further: all discrimination on the basis of sex overall is banned fully and completely within health programs and entities that receive any federal funding.Regardless of what Republicans will say about this  federal overreach,  the Obama Administration has every right to implement this ruling under the Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities rule which is enforceable as part of Section 1557 of the ACA.Once again, Republicans have been outplayed, and their hatred has hit another legal wall. In a statement, Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services, gleefully defended the decision, saying: A central goal of the Affordable Care Act is to help all Americans access quality, affordable health care. Today s announcement is a key step toward realizing equity within our health care system and reaffirms this Administration s commitment to giving every American access to the health care they deserve. The HHS website plainly lays out a feminist agenda that benefits all women, trans and non:Prohibiting denial of health care or health coverage based on an individual s sex, including discrimination based on pregnancy, gender identity, and sex stereotyping.The decision comes as the Obama Administration also set up blueprints for legal safeguards for trans students in public schools all across the country and sued North Carolina over HB 2, which was found to be in violation of the Civil Rights Act.As Obamacare faces yet another threat in court, Republicans have put forth a candidate that promises to repeal  every word  of the landmark healthcare law on his first day in office.That means everything this law has corrected   sexism, ageism, racism and classism   will again hang over the heads of every American should the buffoon known as Donald Trump become President (assuming Democrats don t take back the House or the Senate).Not only are Democrats winning the culture wars led by President Obama and his progressive administration, they are literally putting in place the legal safeguards to see it cemented for the rest of American history.If Democrats don t see the need to come out and vote, this should open the eyes of every weary, disgruntled voter. Democrats can continue the course for four more years and beyond. As Rob Reiner said, transgender rights are the last pieces of the civil rights puzzle.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Panama Papers Show Donald Trump’s Name Mentioned Over 3,500 Times","The Panama Papers recently exposed the worst of the worst in our world -rich, entitled moguls who hide their money in offshore accounts in order to avoid paying their fair share in taxes.This should have come as no surprise, considering this tactic is a staple of crony capitalism. Right now, a crony capitalist is the nominee for the Republican Party   Donald Trump.Recently, Trump has been dodging and flat out refusing to release his much anticipated tax returns   even though the chief of the IRS has debunked Trump s pathetic excuses as to why he s not releasing them, and news outlets have speculated that the delay is because he really isn t as rich as he says it is.There is another theory though, which would perfectly explain his reluctance to show th American public the financial records regarding his  empire    he has a huge hand in the Panama Papers.As Telesur reports have shown, Donald Trump has a direct or indirect link to 32 companies exposed for unethical shenanigans in the papers. One of his personal entities, the Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower in Panama, is listed. In total, financial big wigs referenced Trump a total of 3,540 times.It is important to note that because Trump sold his  name  (aka his brand) to thousands of investors all across the world, these honorable mentions don t necessarily mean he has had any direct involvement in the unethical, shady and seemingly illegal practices associated with the 140 powerful politicians and business elites involved.But it does seem odd that Trump s name appears quite frequently and he refuses to release any tax information until after the election (which he assumes he ll win).While the mainstream media has appeared silent on the issue due to their inherit bias in favor of the GOP frontrunner, some outlets have had the  audacity  to ask questions. While Trump goes across the country telling all his minions how  huge  his proposals (or lack thereof) are, little do they know he might be involved in one of the biggest fraudulent endeavors in world history.Trump is hiding something big or lying about how much he s worth. Either way, he has backed himself into a corner he can t get out of. And people say Hillary Clinton is the untrustworthy one?Featured image via Mark Lyons/Getty Images",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Anti-LGBT Activist Gets Destroyed When He Can’t Answer Which Bathroom Trans Women Should Use,"The director of the Anti-LGBT group the Family Research Council had an interview with Chris Mathews that he probably should not have shown up for. Travis Webber, who is the director of the Center for Religious Liberty at Family Research Council, seemed quite incapable in this interview, constantly dancing around and attempting to avoid a valid question by MSNBC host Chris Mathews on which bathroom he would suggest for trans activist Jennifer Finney Boyland.The conversation got started when Boyland pointed out that the conservative push on bathrooms was simply an attempt to make up for lost ground after they lost the same-sex marriage battle. Boyland said: I don t think this is about bathrooms at all. I think it s about equal rights. Transgender people don t want special rights. We want equal protection under the law, and mostly what we want is to be left alone. And if we can t be left alone, we d like to be treated with love. So you don t want me in the men s room. And you know how you create that perfect situation? Just stop. Stop coming up with these laws. Stop causing trouble where there is no trouble. Maybe because now gay men and lesbians can get married, and they re no longer the whipping boys and whipping girls in this country, now maybe they re trying to rile up people against transgender people. And it s not right, and it s not fair. That s when host Chris Mathews jumped in, putting Webber on the spot, asking him,  Travis, tell Jenny what bathroom she should use. That s when Webber stumbled and paused, at one point saying,  Yeah, I mean I m not sure, um  .  Mathews then said,  Well just answer that question. Travis continued to avoid the question with a response that had nothing to do with the question, prompting Mathews to include,  See, no, you can t answer the question, can you? Webber s inability to respond to a valid question is indicative of the way conservatives have handled this issue and many others. One thread to notice about these so-called conservative GOP folks is their constant attempt to divide and deny people their rights. Whether it s supporting discrimination for same-sex couples, banning Muslims, building walls, denying rights to transgender Americans, or supporting an apartheid state like Israel which denies Palestinians human rights, the conclusion about conservatives must be that they are crazy.Watch the video here: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Scott Baio Emerges From 1940s Mob Film To Tell Fox News Why He Wants Trump (VIDEO),"One of the great mysteries of the universe is trying to figure out what makes people who otherwise may seem rational like and support Donald Trump for president. Appearing on Fox News, actor Scott Baio let us in on why he supports the real estate mogul, and why others should as well. Although, he seems to just be emerging from the set of a 1940s mob themed movie.When asked why he likes Trump, Baio said: What do I like about Trump? There s no BS. I understand him when he talks. Whomever the Democrat nominee is, he s gonna beat the crap out of  em. Which is what we need. Instead of the crap beat out of us, and I like his policy proposals. What policy proposals? He s been all over the map on pretty much everything, except for his hatred of Muslims and that damn border wall.After being asked why people want Trump, he said: Well I think the thing is that Trump is not a typical Republican. He s sort of, you can t put a label on the guy, which I love. And because the media has stigmatized the Republican brand, he s smart to not cozy up to these guys, and he s unique. He s refreshing. He s exciting. I love to hear him talk, and I m excited about the guy. First of all,  refreshing,  really? Secondly, the media has not stigmatized the Republican brand, they did that to themselves by hating every minority group, the LGBT community, women s rights, and the poor. Blaming the media for reporting what they do is like blaming the guy who called 911 on the fire you set. Nah, it doesn t work that way.Baio clearly likes Trump, but also clearly doesn t understand anything of which he speaks.Check out the interview here:.@ScottBaio:  Whomever the Democrat nominee is, [DJT s] going to beat the crap out of them.  https://t.co/xQbQYNRVrJhttps://t.co/wmwgfpT70E  Fox News (@FoxNews) May 14, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" After Horrific National Anthem Sung At Trump Rally, Pianist Hilariously Pretends To Accompany","While it s not nice to criticize people, per se, for attempting to sing one of the hardest songs ever to sing, one person s rendition of the Star Spangled Banner at a Donald Trump rally in Eugene, Oregon, was flawlessly criticized without words.Zach Lapidus posted a video to Facebook of a split screen of himself on piano pretending to accompany the person singing the National Anthem.To be honest, once the key modulations were hit they were on point, but there were modulations on nearly every line of the song. In fact, almost every key seemed to have been hit at one point or another during the song, and Lapidus seemed to nail every single one of those key changes.The Star Spangled Banner is a tough song to play by any musician, and even harder for vocalists, because the range from the lowest notes to the highest notes are nearly two octaves. Credit should always be given to those who attempt to sing the National Anthem, and even more credit given to those who can do it well. Unfortunately, this was not one of those times.This article isn t so much to make fun of the singer   although, she is at a Trump rally and that should be ridiculed, but rather this is to compliment Lapidus on his accompaniment and ability to pick up on all the modulations. Well done.Maybe this is the version of the National Anthem taught at the Trump School of Music. https://www.facebook.com/zach.lapidus/videos/10107105609892679/Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 More Proof That Rick Scott’s Policies Are Completely F*cking Florida’s Working Poor (IMAGE),"In 2015, Florida s government almost shut down when a battle erupted between the Republican House and the Republican Senate. GOP Senators were fighting to have Medicaid expanded to cover more than 800,000 Floridians, but the House was not interested. Ultimately, nearly a million women, men and children were denied health insurance in the state. It was a huge victory for Governor Rick Scott and right-wing members of the House of Representatives. However, their victory has done nothing to help the people of the state, and now the United States Census Bureau has released data that proves just how much the citizens could have used that expansion.According to Census data, nearly half of the counties in Florida have high uninsured rates. Of the state s 67 counties, 29 of them uninsured rates of 20 percent or higher. The Associated Press reports:The counties, which are largely located in central and South Florida, have uninsured rates of at least 20 percent or higher according to 2014 data released by the Census Bureau.The urban counties of Orange, Miami-Dade and Broward were among those on the list.DeSoto County, a rural county in the state s interior, had the highest estimated uninsured rate at 30.8 percent.Screenshot via census.govWhile the state s citizens are forced to suffer without insurance thanks to the legislature s refusal to expand Medicaid, lawmakers are the recipients of heavily subsidized health insurance:The monthly cost per legislator: $180 a month for a family, or $2,160 a year, and $50 a month, or $600 a year, for individuals. That s only a fraction of the average monthly family premium paid by most Floridians   $1,347   according to data tabulated by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health care issues.Isn t that nice? Florida is the perfect example of how Republican policies screw over the average citizen. The GOP believes that health insurance is not a right that should be afforded to everyone and meanwhile, they benefit from taxpayer-funded health plans. They don t have to worry about how they will pay for a doctor visit if they get sick. They don t have to worry about forking over the full cost of medications. They do not live in fear of an illness bankrupting them. And while they live comfortably, they tell voters that Obama s Affordable Healthcare Act isn t working, but leave out the part about how they ve made sure the people in their state do not benefit from it in the same way blue states do. If Florida lawmakers would expand Medicaid, the uninsured rates would drop dramatically.If Florida lawmakers would expand Medicaid, the uninsured rates would drop dramatically. Unfortunately for Floridians, they are not doing it because then they d have to admit the program is working and it would take away one of their anti-Obama/Democrat talking points.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Assault The Poor With A New Plan To Starve The Unemployed,"Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership are rolling out plans to keep wages stagnant in America for the foreseeable future. A $23 billion cut is aimed at eliminating food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to people on unemployment who are either in school or job training. It s an age-old GOP tactic. Eliminate the help for people who are looking to do better and they are forced out of school or training and into minimum wage jobs.Once they get there, the Republicans can claim they re teenagers living at home for free and it s their own fault for settling for a minimum wage job when all they have to do is go back to school or get some training. And the cycle continues. According to Roll Call:Republican leaders have proposed more than $23 billion in food stamp cuts in a budget plan that could be brought to the House floor in the next two weeks, several sources say.The proposed changes in the food stamp, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, include the end of waivers that allow some adults to receive assistance for a limited amount of time, while they are in school, or training for a job.$23 billion in cuts to food for people. Is there nowhere else we could look for $23 billion dollars? How over budget is that fighter jet program again? We re not talking about handing people cash outside a liquor store here; we re talking about food. All the BS about fraud and dependence and still one in four children in this country struggle with food. Republicans have been after the food stamp program for no reason other than to keep people as desperate as possible.Just imagine if Donald Trump is elected with a Republican majority in Congress. Food will be distributed to the poor in the streets in the form of bags of flour and rice and maybe some milk and whey to make cheese. OK, maybe that s a little extreme. There won t be any free food.  Certainly in a Trumptopian society, the poor will stay out of sight where they belong.Featured image from foodsecuritychallenge.com",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Kentucky Woman Brutally Beaten By Man For Looking Too ‘Masculine’ While Onlookers Do NOTHING,"Ever since the Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, a few things have happened. The number of anti-LGBT hate crimes has seemed to rise, the Christian Right has gone on the offensive (and, in the process, has been very offensive), and Republicans just can t stop talking about men kissing and the possibility of penises in women s restrooms. A Kentucky woman was a victim of one of the aforementioned hate crimes on Thursday simply because a man thought she looked too masculine   and that s not even the worst part.Brittany Nicole Wallace wrote on her Facebook timeline that a man assaulted her because she looks like a  dike.  She recounted the horrifying experience:He told me that he would  beat me like the man I want to be.  He said,  people like me make him hate the world . He started by hitting me over and over in the face until he got me down. After I was down he began to kick me in the stomach, side, and face. Anyone that knows me knows that I tried my best to fight back. The truth is he was bigger and stronger than me.Then it gets heartbreaking. Despite a number of onlookers, not a single person stepped in to help. Not a single person had the decency to recognize that a man beating a woman even after she was on the ground is wrong:I believe that if I had long hair and dressed more feminine this would not have happened to me. The sad part is that no one would come help me either. Several people stood around and watched this happen to me. Again, I truly believe that if I had a more feminine appearance someone would have helped.Despite the attack, Wallace says that it has strengthened her resolve to fight against this kind of hatred:This has not only physically but mentally and emotionally damaged me. I will do everything I can to try to put a stop to this hate and violence. I love people and try to help people all the time. All I ask if you read this is to please stop the hate, and help people when you see them getting hurt verbally, emotionally and physically!She even included photos of her injuries:This sort of hatred needs to stop. Unfortunately, half the country follows a party whose entire platform is built on hatred, whose frontrunner practices almost every form of bigotry possible. Unfortunately, with Right-Wing media and politicians constantly reminding their  poorly educated  followers of the alleged evils of the LGBT community. Even more unfortunately, we can expect this sort of thing if Republicans manage to win not only the Presidency, but seats in the Senate and House.We can t allow this to continue. Vote BLUE in November   not just for the Oval Office, but for every office both local and national. Let s start undoing the damage done by the Republican Party.Featured image via Facebook",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Zionist Billionaire To Give $100 Million To Trump Campaign, In Return Wants Billions For Israel (VIDEO/TWEET)","If you ve ever wondered why the United States gives Israel billions of dollars a year in so-called assistance, you need not wonder anymore.  It s all about working the system, and pro-Israel lobbyists and billionaires like casino mogul Sheldon Edelson know exactly what they are doing to exploit the American process: They buy American politicians.Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is about to receive a big present from Sheldon Adelson of $100 million for his campaign. However, there is an exchange here: If Trump becomes president, then he must ensure that the U.S. continue its unwavering financial support for Israel despite the fact that we can t afford clean water in Flint and our national infrastructure is failing. The U.S. also sends billions to Israel despite the fact that Israel has been ethnically cleansing Palestinians since 1947 and treats them in a way that civil rights activist Desmond Tutu described as worse than the apartheid regime that existed in South Africa.How much money does the U.S. give to Israel?The state of Israel currently receives a staggering $3 billion a year in so-called aid, much of it for its military, which is then used to brutalize the Palestinian people in the form of a military occupation and a settlement apparatus of land theft that is illegal under international law. With the current agreement set to expire in 2017, Israel wants a raise. They are now asking for an estimated $5 billion a year over the next ten years, for a total of more than $50 billion. In fact, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrogantly rejected President Obama s recent offer, which is about $40 billion over ten years. Israel has said that it may hold out for the next president in order to get a better deal.According to Sheldon Adelson, that next president may be Donald Trump. The $100 million he will give to Trump may seem substantial but Adelson, whose loyalties are with Israel, is willing to spend $100 million in order to receive billions for the apartheid state in return. Here s what Donald Trump tweeted about Adelson s previous support for former candidate Marco Rubio:Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2015Since the campaign money is now coming Trump s way, you can bet that Trump is ready to be Israel s puppet and give it what it wants. In an attempt to court big pro-Israel donors, Trump has already stated that he supports the continuation of illegal settlement construction in the Palestinian West Bank. The billions of  dollars that will help Israel continue to rob and oppress the Palestinians will come from fleecing the U.S. taxpayer of money that instead can go to our schools and our healthcare system.Donald Trump is just another political phony who is willing to sell his own country down the river to the highest foreign bidder for personal power.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1eNaH-D_5I]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Megyn Kelly OWNS Transphobic Texas Lt. Governor Over Bathroom Laws,"The Obama Administration has told states around the nation in no uncertain terms that they will not be able to continue to discriminate against transgender students in schools. The language used by Attorney General Loretta Lynch regarding transgender rights was strong and left no room for debate. Of course, bigoted lawmakers around the country are scrambling for a reason to continue enshrining their hate for LGBT people into law, no matter what it takes. One such lawmaker is Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.Patrick appeared on Fox News  The Kelly File and debated Megyn Kelly regarding the issue, and kept babbling on about supposed sexual predators dressing up like women to get access to little girls. Host Megyn Kelly cut his idiocy off at the knees, though, when Patrick kept repeating this tired talking point of bigots everywhere. Kelly said: A lot of sex offenders are men who molest men, little boys. Why do they need to sneak into the girls room? Patrick didn t address this point, but instead ranted on about men in a bathroom with his 8-year-old granddaughter. Kelly cut him off with this one as well, saying: But what if a man looks like a woman and she would never notice him? Patrick then went on to say, Megyn, you re missing the  but Kelly cut him off completely and ended the interview, saying, No, I don t think I m missing anything. Kudos to Megyn Kelly for owning this obvious anti-LGBT bigot.

 Watch This Bible-Waving ‘Christian’ Lady March Through Target Ranting About Devil Rape (VIDEO),"The GOP was right. Thanks to Target s decision to let transgender people use the bathroom in which they feel most comfortable, all sorts of weirdos are showing up. No, we re not talking about people going into the ladies  room to pee. Recently, a creepy new trend has been spreading through the Christian Right like chlamydia through a Texas school that teaches abstinence-only sex education. Christians have been marching through Target stores across the nation whole screaming about how evil it is to allow human beings to go to the bathroom without feeling out of place.In one video, a Bible-waving mother marches through a Target store with her husband and children in tow to let people know what she views as the truth about Target s evil bathroom policy: Attention Target customers: Do not be deceived. Target would have you believe that they love mothers and children. This is a deception. This is not love, and they ve proven it by opening their bathrooms to perverted men. I am a mother of 12,  she announces with her Bible raised in the air,  and I am very disgusted by this wicked practice. Target does not protect mothers and children. Mothers, get your children out of this store,  she commanded.  Mother, have enough decency to get out of this store. It s a dangerous place.  She added that Target s inclusive policy is  hateful  toward families, children, and mothers. Then things got REALLY crazy: America, when are you going to wake up? When are you going to stand up for the right things, America? Are you going to let the Devil rape your children, America? It s time to stand up and have a voice instead of bowing to the homosexual perverted agenda that s taking over this nation? You need to run and flee this place. I wouldn t spend a penny of my money here. This is wicked. This is confusion. This is twisted. This is abominable in the sight of God. Transgender people have been using public bathrooms for an untold length of time. It s never been an issue until Republicans decided it was more important of an issue than poverty, our crumbling infrastructure, educating our children, or even remembering to put the toilet seat down (sorry honey). What is most unfortunate is that this woman took her children along with her on this insane and hateful escapade. It is unknown how much damage she is doing to her children by teaching them nothing but hatred.Republicans were right: creeps are flooding into Target.

 WATCH: Here’s What Happened When Trump’s ‘Publicist’ Called Stephen Colbert,"Stephen Colbert got an exclusive interview on CBS  The Late Show when Donald Trump s  publicist  called in. The publicist has been in the news lately since it was revealed that Trump pretended to be his own representative while dealing with the media in the 1980s and 1990s.The Washington Post reported that Trump often called up reporters who were covering him and pretended to be  John Miller  and  John Barron.  Trump then would use the fake identity to push stories about how he was purportedly dating models and celebrities like Madonna.Trump denied that he behaved this way in an interview with the Today show, but had previously admitted to it in court.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee also seemed to panic when reporters asked about it in a scheduled interview on Friday.Then, Friday afternoon, Washington Post reporters who were 44 minutes into a phone interview with Trump about his finances asked him a question about Miller:  Did you ever employ someone named John Miller as a spokesperson? The phone went silent, then dead. When the reporters called back and reached Trump s secretary, she said,  I heard you got disconnected. He can t take the call now. I don t know what happened. Trump s behavior is so odd and out of the ordinary that mainstream media reporters are often completely confused as to how to cover him. How do you address a narcisstic millionaire pushing xenophobia and racism who is woefully unprepared for the presidency? Perhaps more mocking from comedians like Colbert is the only rational way to deal with it.Certainly the late night comedy writers are getting almost as much raw material   maybe more   as they did when George W. Bush was president. What s bad for the country and national political conversation is most definitely great news for the world of comedy, and they re not stopping any time soon.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 A Congressman Wrote A Book Anonymously That Is Guaranteed To P*ss You Off,"84 pages of how the United States House of Representatives really works is set to be released by a small Minnesota publisher on May 24th. The tell-all, written by a sitting US congressman rumored to be a Democrat, confirms the storied we ve heard and adds a few new twists to how life as a  public servant  actually works opposed to the facade of friendly people in nice clothes who shake your hand and care deeply for your needs, whatever they may be.First let s start off by saying that like anything, there are exceptions to the rule. There s gonna be a district of good people somewhere who have elected a man or a woman who genuinely cares about their municipalities and their lives and improving them no matter what. There are far more, however, nefarious career con artists who have seen first hand through their families or learned coming up the ladder that congressional politics is, for the most part, all or nothing scumbaggery. They know the system and are bred for it. Confessions of a Congressman  set to be released May 24   AmazonThis particular congressman has decided that through anonymity he (says he s a he but could be a she?) will only honestly and openly describe the life of a US Representative at the expense of letting the people know exactly how he   and most of his colleagues   view the American public. DailyMail.com reports having seen the book, using these bullet points to describe the contents:As disturbing as that sounds, it isn t really all that far off from how many Americans already view congress. Their approval rating barely hits double digits. They do nothing. Partisan politics and campaigning have replaced governing in America. There are good people coming up with great ideas being squashed by people like this guy who buy their way through life one election at a time, hoping to someday get the call to the upper chamber where all that fundraising can be replaced with a few years of vacation in between. Maybe someday someone will find out you have the right look for a presidential run.It would be impossible to eliminate politics from government. Limiting the amount of time a particular politician can remain in office, however, would go far towards removing people like the selfish bastard who wrote this book and everyone else who has turned Capitol Hill into 535 ongoing campaigns.Featured image via Wikipedia/thirstynyc.com",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

He hasn t stopped his illegal and unconstitutional racial profiling of Hispanics.Thanks to that darn liberal activist group the ACLU, Arpaio will be in hot water if he continues to practice his clearly racist policies.Judge G. Murray Snow, after a lengthy yearlong investigation after the ruling in Ortega Melendres v. Arpaio, concluded that Arpaio was in contempt on one charge while Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt of one.In the 162-page ruling, Judge Snow wrote:In short, the Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith with respect to the Plaintiff class and the protection of its rights.The three contempt charges stem from three requests from Judge Snow that Arpaio and his band of thugs refused to comply with:According to ArizonaCentral:Snow found that deputies had detained and turned over to federal authorities at least 157 individuals who had not committed state crimes, in violation of his order.Snow said both Arpaio and Sheridan made numerous misstatements under oath.Not only did Sheriff Joe and his deputies knowingly fail to comply with a court ruling, they openly flaunted it and thought that they were above the law.Now the Department of Justice is getting involved. After slapping down Sheriff Joe last year over his racial profiling, the DOJ will work closely with Snow to implement proper sanctions. Should Snow feel so inclined, he may refer the case to criminal contempt. Perhaps jail time might await the Sheriff? One can only hope.But while we wait for this monstrosity to be put in prison, the people of Arizona are faced with another option: voting him out of office. This is an election year, and Sheriff Joe is running. Every election his support shrinks. In 2000, Arpaio won with 66 percent of the vote. In 2012, he garnered only 51 percent.With Trump on the rise as the GOP s newest face, Hispanic voter registration has spiked all across the southwest, including Arizona   something that should scare Arpaio and his cronies to their core. This is what happens when you rule with fear instead of the common good.Now it s 2016, and this man s reign of terror and shame must come to an end. Let the courts deal with him in court, and let s have the voters throw the bum out of office once and for all.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas Teabagger Lt. Governor Promises To Take Away Food From Poor Kids To ‘Resist’ Obama,"Tea Party radio host and Lieutenant Governor of Texas Dan Patrick has officially made the stupidest move yet in regards to  bathroom rules  in our schools. Patrick declared that Texas was prepared to forego literally billions of dollars in federal education funding rather than allow transgender children to use the bathroom. We will not be blackmailed by the president s 30 pieces of silver,  Patrick ignorantly announced. The  we  he refers to are rich elected Republicans that can afford to send their kids to private schools. Not mentioned by any Republican is whether millions of Texas parents and children that are completely dependent on the public school system are also prepared to have their entire school system essentially shut down.This isn t just some minor budget readjustment and  tightening of belts  by teachers and school districts. This is totally defunding the educations of 5.2 million students who rely on federal money to attend an already desperately underfunded public school system in Texas.As of now, the issue of school bathroom use is inevitably headed towards our court system. The legal question is whether or not the federal government can continue using the Civil Rights Act to force schools to allow children to use the bathroom with which they feel comfortable.According to interpretation by the justice department, title 9 of the Civil Rights Act does allow for the federal government to prohibit discrimination based on gender in public schools that receive federal funding.If the courts find in favor of the federal government, which it is very likely they will, the president can then try to use the cutting off of federal funds in order to get state compliance on the law.The White House was asked about the Texas Lt. Governor s comments. Press Secretary Josh Earnest said,  This does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to a statewide elected office.  Truer words were never spoken.Featured image via Brietbart",News,"May 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Is Apparently Eyeing Elizabeth Warren As A V.P. Candidate,"While Donald Trump is considering Arizona s former Governor (and anti-immigrant) Jan Brewer as a prospective vice presidential nominee, the Clinton campaign is eyeing his now arch nemesis   Elizabeth Warren.Warren, who disappointed progressive outlets after refusing multiple times to run for president, has become a viable V.P. choice for both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton in recent months as the primary battle heats up. In recent weeks, the mounting feud between Warren and Trump over Twitter has become an all out brawl, with the Senator from Massachusetts coming out on top every time.According to the Huffington Post, the Clinton campaign has noticed. Senior and close advisors within the frontrunner s campaign have gone on the record (albeit anonymously) saying  very influential people in the campaign pushing for her  and that her ability to  get under his [Trump s] skin  is thrilling. As one adviser told the Post: You want a running mate who can take the fight to the other side with relish. Geography does not matter, but attitude and talent and energy and bringing excitement to the campaign, Senator Warren does all that. Penny Lee, a former aide to Senator Harry Reid and now a Democratic consultant, summed up why having Warren on the ticket with Clinton would be so beneficial, and why senior advisors have been taking her seriously: She can help validate Clinton with progressives and remind them that despite their differences in the primary, the alternative of the Donald would be untenable. Outlets have speculated for months that Clinton s V.P. nominee would be Julian Castro, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or Sherrod Brown, Senator from Ohio. Castro, however, has ruled out being Clinton s V.P. While turning down the slot for second in command, Castro, who endorsed Clinton last year, has been an active surrogate for the campaign across the country.Going into a general election, Warren could prove an asset not just for the progressive vote, but for independents and moderate Republicans, who referred to Warren in a 2015 study group as  smart,   interesting,   sincere,   capable,   knowledgeable  and  sincere. Drafting Warren to a Vice Presidential spot may bode well in a presidential election, but it could hurt the Democrats  chances at keeping the senate.But with Trump as the GOP prospect, maybe a Clinton-Warren ticket could be the explosive candidacy Democrats need.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Patrick Stewart Literally Paid A Guy To Not Vote For Donald Trump (IMAGE),"Patrick Stewart despises Donald Trump so much that he had to make himself feel better by paying a guy to NOT vote for him.The actor most known as Captain Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation and the X-Men film franchise was in New Orleans earlier this week and spotted a homeless man holding up a sign stating that in exchange for $1 he would not vote for Trump.Not only did Stewart give him $1, he gave him four more dollars on top of that for extra measure. Made me forget the humidity for a moment. Worth 5 bucks,  Stewart wrote on Twitter complete with an image of the man and his sign.Made me forget the humidity for a moment. Worth 5 bucks. pic.twitter.com/lRvEoZ31mF  Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) May 11, 2016This isn t the first time Stewart has slammed Donald Trump. Just week ago, he expressed to Vice that he can t believe anyone takes Trump and his  antics  seriously. Well, of course, we had no idea that Dreadful Trump would be up to these antics that he is up to now. And I call them  antics  because how could they possibly be taken seriously. Stewart made the remarks in response to being asked how Donald Trump s extremism and support among white supremacist groups makes his latest film Green Room, in which Stewart portrays a Neo-Nazi, timely.Clearly, Patrick Stewart is not a Donald Trump supporter, and who can blame him?Donald Trump is the scariest political candidate in the presidential race and the fact that a man with strong support from white supremacists and other racist hate groups could very well end up becoming the leader of the free world is a nightmare all too close to turning into reality.Faced with this kind of person in office, perhaps we should all give five dollars to people to keep them from voting for Trump.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s The Brilliant Plan To Make George Zimmerman Regret Auctioning His Gun (IMAGE),"In an apparent attempt to prove to the world that he is the devil himself, George Zimmerman recently decided to auction off the gun he used to murder Trayvon Martin. The move has been universally condemned by everyone who is not a heartless monster.Fortunately, some brilliant individuals decided to hijack the online auction for the weapon, mocking the gun s sale with fake bids. The top bid for the gun was made by someone named  Racist McShootface  in the amount of $65 million dollars. As hilarious as the monkey wrenching shenanigans are, it is saddening to know that there is money to be made, so the gun will eventually be sold and Zimmerman will go on living his new life of luxury and infamy.However, one individual released a plan to turn this terrible event in history into an opportunity to do some good in the world. Shane Claiborne, a Christian activist released a post on his Facebook page where he writes that he and others had planned on attempting to win Zimmerman s gun in the online auction. From there, they would work with RAWtools, a company that turns firearms into tools.The idea of turning weapons into tools come from the biblical verse Isaiah 2:4:He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.Some Christian peace activists live by this verse, encouraging nations and individuals to lay down their weapons and work towards creating world peace.As Claiborne points out in the post, there is one major flaw with this plan. There has been a Twitter-storm of folks suggesting we should acquire the gun and beat it into a plow with our friends at RAWtools,  Claiborne writes.  Initially, that seemed like a powerful idea   to destroy this horrific icon of injustice, and make sure it doesn t take another life. We even had some donors offering to buy it. But then we heard the money was going to be used to fight many of the groups and movements we believe in, like Black Lives Matter. Claiborne then writes that a new plan was eventually formed. I have to say, as far as B plans go, it s a pretty good one. We are going to take a 9mm pistol identical to Zimmerman s, beat it into a plow, auction it off, and donate the money to Trayvon Martin s family foundation. Last night we sent out the invitation to donate handguns and just got the news that we have had 6 guns donated overnight (thanks to Benjamin L. Corey and all who donated so far).And all 6 of the guns are 9mm pistols. (by the way, keep  em coming  email here to donate: [email protected]) My friends at RAWtools, Inc. will be transforming the pistol. And will start the bidding within the next week or so. What a great idea. This just proves that no matter how much hatred and misery some people put out into this world, there are others willing to push back with acts of love and compassion.Here is the original Facebook post.https://www.facebook.com/ShaneClaiborne/photos/a.10150112918376371.279881.100500271370/10153375689991371/?type=3&theaterFeatured image from Rawtools via Facebook",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The IRS Already Commented On Trump’s Tax Returns And Even They Call Him A Liar (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s tax return: we ve heard about little else over the last few days. Voters are asking for them. Mitt Romney is asking for them. Trump initially told us that he wouldn t provide his taxes because the IRS is auditing them. Well, the IRS weighed in on that issue a couple of months ago, and they didn t mince words.IRS Chief John Koskinen explained in an interview with C-SPAN,  The taxpayer controls his returns. There s nothing in an IRS audit process generally that would keep you from sharing that information generally, any way you wanted to. Koskinen further stated,  It would be rare for someone to be audited every year,  and that someone would not undergo another audit for a few years,  two or three at least,  after IRS audit the previous year. It would be rare,  Koskinen stated.Source: Greenville GazetteHere s the video:Even that hasn t stopped Trump from sticking to his audit story.In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2016On Friday, though, his words were harsher, telling George Stephanopolous that it s  none of (his) business. Aside from his supporters, few people are buying the audit story. Some are speculating that he might be a lot less wealthy than he says. Romney speculates that there might be something a lot more nefarious, like mob connections.There s also another possibility, and frankly, it could be a combination of everything: Trump is simply pandering to his voters. Angry white men hate the IRS. The love paved roads and wars and many other things our tax money gives us, but they resent the fact that a percentage of their paychecks are going to the common good. As a matter of fact, Trump was one of the only candidates who didn t say he wanted to abolish the IRS altogether.There s a good reason for that kind of rhetoric. Polls show that among Republicans, especially Tea Party Republicans, only 15 percent view the IRS in a favorable light, while 62 percent of Democrats do. What could possibly be a better tactic than turning yourself into a victim of the evil feds? For Trump voters, nothing.Featured image by Scott Olson at Getty Images.

" White House CLOBBERS Texas Lt. Gov Outrage Over Trans Students, And It’s GLORIOUS","If Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R) thought he was going to get away with being a completely transphobic jerk regarding transgender students using the bathroom, he thought wrong.After President Obama announced that any public school that refused to let a transgender student use a restroom consistent with their identity would run the risk of losing federal funding, Lt. Gov. Patrick lost his damn mind. He went so far as to say: I believe that it is the biggest issue facing families and schools in America since prayer was taken out of public schools. [Obama] has put a policy in place that will divide the country, not along political lines, but along family values and school districts. He says he s going to withhold funding if schools do not follow the policy. Well in Texas, he can keep his 30 pieces of silver. We will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States. Yes, folks, he s that much of a bigot. Letting transgender individuals pee in the appropriate bathroom has nothing to do with  family values  and everything to do with just letting a person pee. However, many Republicans like to label anything that gives them the heebies jeebies as going against their  values,  so this really shouldn t come as a surprise. They likely used to say the same stuff back when black people wanted to use the same bathrooms as white people. These people are bigots and they re not afraid to make sure everyone knows it, coded language and all.Well, the White House heard what Patrick had to say about President Obama s directive, and hit back  hard. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said: Well I think this does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to elected statewide office. Patrick, of course, is also known as being a very far-right conservative talk show host before being elected as Lt. Governor.Earnest also said: This is not an enforcement action. This is in response to extensive requests for guidance and for information and advice that have been put forward by school administrators and teachers and in some cases, even parents, who are seeking practical solutions to this challenge And the challenge here is not to isolate anybody, it s not to discriminate against anybody, it s not to make anybody unsafe. It s actually to ensure that our schools are as inclusive and respectful and safe as they can possibly be. He added that many schools would  welcome this guidance and implement it. In the year 2016, you d think there wouldn t still be such backward, myopic thinking that can t embrace life outside a bubble of what one might think a person should be. However, there is, and because there is, the White House is very open to a dialogue to address concerns. After all, most bigotry and discrimination is the result of lack of knowledge and understanding.Dan Patrick is being Dan Patrick. A man who likes to hear himself speak and doesn t seem to care who he hurts along the way. If he thinks the president asking schools to be inclusive and allow students to choose the bathroom of their gender identity at risk of losing funding is blackmail, then he s clearly a bigot who doesn t want to comply.Good on the White House for smacking his clear bigotry down.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Draws Impressive Crowd At Pine Ridge Reservation (VIDEO),"On Thursday, 1,200 hundred people attended a community conversation with Bernie Sanders at the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. During the event, indigenous people spoke out against the problems facing their community. The most talked about issue was healthcare.Alex Romero-Frederick says,  We ve had relatives that have passed away because of the substandard care at the Rosebud hospital, and as far as having ER available, we live our life like, don t get hurt. While speaking to the enormous crowd gathered before him and one community member in particular, Sanders said: One of the issues that I feel strongly about is just what you said Evie, promises were made, treaties were signed, and those promises were not kept. If elected president, we will keep those promises. Other community members were positively surprised to learn how easy it was to speak with Sanders. The cool part is he s so personable, and he s not this typical Washington, D.C.-level person that s bigger than you and more important and will talk down to you. He was on the same level of us, and that s very important to me,  said Evie.You can watch a video report from KEVN Black Hills Fox below.Sanders has made helping indigenous communities a major part of his platform. He has created policy proposals that specifically address the issues that affect indigenous people into his larger reform projects. Included in those agenda items are policies that specifically address inequality in healthcare, education, police violence, and energy infrastructure.So far in the Democratic primary election, Sanders has received massive amounts of support from indigenous communities. On his campaign website, it is noted that: Bernie is proud to have earned more than 80 percent of the votes cast in the Meskwaki Settlement near Tama, Iowa. He was also favored by voters in caucuses on and near reservations in Nevada. Sanders received a major indigenous shout out last February, when the Indigenous activist, economist, and author Winona LaDuke released a video where she publicly endorsed Sanders. You can watch the video below.Indigenous people are one of the most neglected groups of people in the U.S. Coverage of the issues that indigenous communities face hardly ever make their way into the media s spotlight. It is great that there is a candidate out there pushing those issues into that spotlight.South Dakota s primary is scheduled to take place on June 9.Featured image from video screenshot via KEVN",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Democrats Might Take Back The House, And It’s All Thanks To Donald Trump","As Republicans grow anxious and weary about an impending Trump general election candidacy, Democrats are pouncing on every opportunity to take back an unlikely chamber: the House of Representatives.In 2010, Democrats suffered their biggest defeat   one not seen since the World War II era   and subsequently lost seats (after gaining in 2012) in the 2014 election. In total, between 2010 and 2014, Republicans picked up a net 68 seats, cementing a strong lock on power.But Democrats are hoping to turn the tables in November, and their biggest weapon is Donald Trump.An analysis from Real Clear Politics shows that while Democrats have a very good chance of taking back the Senate, winning back the House would be a very steep climb, but it is possible. All Democrats have to do is show up to vote, and link every Republican running for Congress to frontrunner (and now candidate) Donald Trump. Oh, and Democrats need to vote down ticket if they want to see Congress turn blue:If current trends continue, however, Democrats may have an opportunity to win substantial gains down the ballot. In the most recent RCP average, Clinton leads Trump by 6.4 percentage points. That lead could increase, decrease or disappear before November, but it s a positive sign at this point for House Democrats. Data from recent elections indicate that very few voters split their tickets, voting for one party in the presidential race and another down the ballot. If this pattern holds, presidential performance will be intricately linked to how House candidates will fare this November.In other words, if Clinton maintains her landslide lead (yes, landslide), that means the House could finally be free of the wrath of the Freedom Caucus and Paul Ryan.Republicans currently hold 26 seats in districts Obama won in 2012 and 28 in which Romney won by less than 53 percent. Real Clear Politics  analysts contend that if Clinton could pick up all 26 from Obama s districts and just half of Romney s (due to down-ticket voting), the chances of Democrats taking back the House become inevitable.Donald Trump may be the best thing to happen to Democrats. But a coalition of liberals, progressives, moderates, independents and center-right Democrats will be needed at the booths if this is to become a reality.Should Sanders or Clinton clinch the nomination, the prospect of a blue White House, House and Senate, and Supreme Court could be a reality.With the media constantly propping up Trump to be this god-like figure, it s up to Democrats to keep the truth out there for the electorate: that there is virtually no difference between the de facto leader of the GOP and House Republicans, who time and time again have threatened women s health, immigrant families, and the healthcare of millions of low-income Americans.Democrats have a solid chance. It s time they get out and vote an deliver on the promise to keep progress moving forward.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 London’s New Muslim Mayor Has Some VERY Choice Words For Donald Trump (VIDEO),"While the United States has as one of its presumptive party nominees a raging bigot who clearly hates Muslim individuals, even going so far as to say that if he were to become president he would ban Muslims from entering the nation, London has just elected a Muslim mayor.Now that Sadiq Khan has been elected mayor of London, he has some very choice words for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Khan, being the son of Pakistani immigrants himself, is none to pleased with Trump s divisive rhetoric surrounding the Islamic faith. And it s true that if the United States is to embody freedom, especially religious freedom, Trump needs to be educated on what that actually is, and Khan seems more than willing to provide that education.Half joking, Khan said: I ll need to rush to come to America before November, because if Trump wins, I ll be banned from coming. But in an interview with Time magazine, he was much more serious with his remarks. If Donald Trump becomes the president, I ll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith, which means I can t engage with American mayors and swap ideas. Conservative tacticians thought those sorts of tactics would win London and they were wrong. I m confident that Donald Trump s approach to politics won t win in America. In yet another interview, after hearing Trump congratulated him on his victory, Khan said: My point to Donald Trump is, don t make an exception for me. Reconsider your views on Islam. Driving the point home, also hoping to  educate  Trump, Khan told BBC: This isn t just about me. It s about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world. Imagine if the world were to judge all Americans by the words and actions of Donald Trump. That s exactly what Trump does when he judges an entire religion by an extremist few who claim they are of the Islamic faith, but yet clearly are just sociopaths.Trump s rhetoric is not only bad for the United States, it s bad for the entire world. How is a man, who wants to be leader of the free world, supposed to do so by condemning all people of the world s second largest religion?Watch some of Khan s comments here:Featured image via video screen capture  Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 That Time Donald Trump Posed As His Own Spokesman To Brag About Himself (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is pretty terrible. He s exactly the sort of person who would suggest that Muslims be banned from entering the United States. He s the type of guy who would force any Muslims in the United States to register in a national database and wear special badges, then throw them in concentration camps as a  temporary measure. Trump has spoken openly about building a wall between the United states and Mexico to keep brown people out, openly encouraged his supporters to beat African-Americans at his rallies. Hell, he even has been known to keep a book of Hitler s speeches by his bedside for light reading. He s repeatedly lied throughout his campaign in an effort to paint himself as the best option to serve as President of the United States. But the Washington Post has revealed yet another facet of Trump s douchebaggery: he s also the type of guy who would pretend to be his own public relations  person so he can talk himself up.The Washington Post has uncovered an old recording of what sounds like The Donald talking himself up while speaking to reporters. The recording is from 1991, and is between the now-GOP nominee   sorry,  John Miller    and a reporter from People Magazine. Sue Caswell was covering Trump s media circus-of-the-time   his divorce from Ivana Trump, who says her former husband brutally raped her in just one of the many incidents that led to the end of their marriage as well as his relationship with Marla Maples.The  spokesman  had some interesting insight into Trump s personal life, telling Caswell that he  really didn t want to make a commitment  to Maples because he s  coming out of a marriage, and he s starting to do tremendously well financially.  He assured Caswell that Trump is a  good guy  who isn t  going to hurt anybody  and  treated his wife well    you know, aside from the horrific abuse, and all: Have you met him?  He s a good guy and he s not going to hurt anybody.  The one article said he was going to throw her out of the apartment is total nonsense.  He is going to always treat her well as he treated his wife well.  I mean, he paid his wife a great deal of money.  He did it in a very bad period of time and, ultimately, that was settled.  There were those that say that that was even put that way.  I don t know if you heard that but that Trump became poor until he got his divorce.  And then all of a sudden, he s been doing very well and I guess you probably heard that, too.But he treated his wife well and he treated   and he will treat Marla well.  He s somebody that has a lot of options, and, frankly, he gets called by everybody. He gets called by everybody in the book, in terms of women. Trump explained that he is  sort of handling PR because [Trump] gets so much of it,  and that he was simply doing the PR gig  part-time,  and even took the time to regail Caswell with a tale of the time he met Madonna.Other reporters say they received similarly suspicious calls from  Miller  or  John Barron,  and those reporters all say Trump was the person behind the calls. In fact, some of his top aides and Trump himself have confirmed that he was doing his own PR work. In 1991, People reported:Just two weeks ago, though, Ms. Maples was not even taking The Donald s calls. Not after a PEOPLE reporter played her a tape on June 26 of a man saying that he was a Trump publicist named John Miller. A shocked, devastated Marla identified the voice as that of Trump himself. He announced, among other things, that he d traded in his Georgia peach for an Italian model (Carla Bruni).  When I heard his voice on that tape saying those things, I said,  Whoa! Uh-uh. No more,    says Marla.  If he could say all that stuff and act like it s cool to have this playboy image, then oh my gosh, all I could say was,  Baby, you re on your own.   So she packed a bag, ducking the press as well as The Donald s persistent appeals to reconcile, and took refuge at the Greenwich, Conn., home of her close friend, morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gilford. There she talked, prayed (she and Kathie Lee are both devout Christians) and came to a Donald-less conclusion:  I realized I was not going to die without this person in my life. Meanwhile a penitent Don Juan-ald had come to the opposite conclusion. The John Miller fiasco he called a joke gone awry.  What I did became a good time at Mar-la s expense, and I m very sorry,  says the newly humbled tycoon. As for his wandering eye,  I d felt that I needed space and freedom after the divorce, so I took the opportunity to go out with other women, but I kept coming back to Marla. I realized, why go looking for something when you already have exactly what you want? Despite all of this, on Friday Trump denied that he was the guy behind the calls. I don t know anything about it,  Trump said during an appearance on NBC s Today: I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice, and you can imagine that. This sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. It doesn t sound like me. It was not me on the phone,  he rambled.  And it doesn t sound like me on the phone, I will tell you that. It was not me on the phone. Hear that folks? It wasn t him on the phone. It wasn t him with a bone. It wasn t him on a train. It wasn t him on a plane. It wasn t him on a boat, in a moat, or you get the idea. Sure, he may have admitted it in the past, but he s running for President now. Why tell the truth? This was so farcical, that he pretended to be his own publicist. Here was this so-called billion-dollar real estate mogul, and he can t hire his own publicist,  Carswell said upon listening to the tape for the first time in more than two decades.  It also said something about the control he wanted to keep of the news cycle flowing with this story, and I can t believe he thought he d get away with it. Unfortunately, he keeps getting away with things. Despite his horrific remarks, his repeated lies, and his generally awful attitude, The Donald has managed to land himself the spot as the 2016 GOP nominee. Republicans have repeatedly given him a pass no matter what he says or does because he represents all that is terrible about our society   bigotry, hatred, racism, xenophobia   and that is exactly what appeals to them.Compared to Trump s numerous other lies this is a small one, but it does show how important it is to him that he controls the narrative.Listen to the call below:Featured image via Getty Images/Isaac Brekken",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mississippi Governor Whines About Imaginary Persecution Of Christians In Defense Of Anti-LGBT Law (AUDIO),"In a strong southern drawl that makes his bigotry all the more enraging, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant attempted to defend his state s anti-LGBT law by whining about persecution of Christians, which is something that doesn t exist.When Bryant signed House Bill 1523 into law last month, Republicans made it legal for Christian business owners to discriminate against LGBT people as well as unmarried people who have premarital sex. Basically, as long as these bigoted business owners use religion as a shield they can discriminate against anyone they want.But Bryant defended the law during an appearance on a religious right-wing radio show by openly whining about the so-called persecution of Christians.According to Bryant, Christian business owners are being discriminated against when they are asked to provide service to gay people or atheists or anybody else the owner hates.Of course, that s NOT discrimination at all. Discrimination against a Christian would be if a Muslim business owner refused to do business with a customer simply because of their religious beliefs. Or if a gay cake baker refused to make a cake for a Christian heterosexual couple. If a customer is trying to do business with you, that s not discrimination at all. It s a customer making a transaction in good faith with money, which only helps the business.Nevertheless, Bryant thinks the ACLU is unfairly suing the state because he claims the law is all about preventing imaginary discrimination against Christians and is not about discriminating against LGBT people at all. I mean, they cherry-pick these issues. If they had any integrity at all, they would say,  We understand Mississippi is actually trying to make sure that Christians and people of other faiths are not discriminated against.  It is a nondiscriminatory law. It prevents discrimination against simply that segment of the population that has a deeply held religious view about marriage. Nobody is saying that bigoted Christians can t have an opinion about marriage. But that opinion does not give them the right to refuse service to a gay couple.Despite the fact that Republicans in Mississippi and North Carolina have given business owners a license to bully LGBT people, Bryant complained about alleged bullying and threats from corporations and repeated the conservative myth that transgender protections will allow men to shower in women s locker rooms and use women s bathrooms. We re criticized, we re threatened, we re bullied, we re told by corporations that we re doing the wrong thing?  Bryant said.  Where on earth have we come to simply say,  I do not wish my daughter in her school or in her university to have to have a male in the shower and in the dressing room and in the restrooms. The fact is that in 17 states and over 200 cities that have passed transgender protections there has not been a single instance of a predator using the protections as a defense to commit sexual assault. The only men who gone inside women s bathrooms are the ones the conservative Family Research Council has sent into them in order to scare people into supporting the bigoted laws.Bryant concluded by claiming that Americans support the laws and that they are  common sense  laws. I think the rest of the nation is beginning to wake up and say,  What world do they think we re living in? This is not Hollywood, this is not more liberal areas, this is America, where common sense still prevails. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.True common sense is knowing what real discrimination and persecution looks like. And that means Bryant has no clue what the hell he is talking about. These anti-LGBT laws legalize bigotry against a certain group of people under the guise of religious freedom, a freedom that conservatives have abused for too long. And considering the outrage against bigoted states like North Carolina and Mississippi since they passed their bigoted laws, it looks like most Americans damn well have common sense. The common sense to know what hate, discrimination, and bullshit looks like when they see it, or in this case, hear it.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Lashes Out After Being Grilled To His Breaking Point By ABC Host,"George Stephanopoulos allowed presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to phone into Good Morning America on Friday morning only to be grilled for not releasing his tax returns. Do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision?  Stephanopoulos asked. I don t think they do,  Trump replied before claiming that he will  gladly  release his returns once the IRS completes an audit against him. Of course, the audit may not be over until after the election, a fact that even Trump conceded despite feigning hope that it will end before November.Stephanopoulos didn t buy that argument, however, pointing out that an audit didn t prevent former President Richard Nixon from releasing his tax returns. The IRS has made it very clear that an audit is not a bar to public release,  Stephanopoulos said.  It s entirely your choice. President Nixon released his tax returns even though he was under audit and when you were seeking a casino license in Pennsylvania and New Jersey you released your returns to state officials even though you were under audit. Trump repeated that he will not release his returns until after the audit is complete, which may or may not be completed until after the election, so the audit is a rather convenient excuse for Trump.Trump then erroneously claimed that many presidents have not released their tax returns, and Stephanopoulos didn t let him get away it.  Every single nominee since 1976 has released his tax returns,  the ABC host informed Trump.Trump went on to claim that his release of his  financials  should be enough, but Stephanopoulos noted that such documents fail to show what his tax rate is and how much in taxes he pays.That really set Trump off as he began to complain about having to pay taxes and he admitted that he  tries very hard  to pay as little in taxes as possible. As we all know, the reason why Bernie Sanders has been so popular this election season is because one of his goals is to force the wealthy 1 percent to pay their fair share of taxes.Testiness on Trump s part dominated the remaining part of the interview as Trump repeated that he would not release his returns until the audit is complete and claimed that he shouldn t have to release his returns until Hillary Clinton releases nonexistent missing emails. When pressed further on his returns, Trump said curtly that it s  none of your business. Here s the video via YouTube.But it is Stephanopoulos s business because he is a journalist. It s also the American people s business because they deserve all the information before going to the polls in November. Trump can claim all he wants that he doesn t have secret overseas accounts or that he pays low taxes, but the American people won t know if he s lying or not until he releases the returns to the public. And since Trump is playing this game of hide and seek with his returns, the only conclusion we can assume at this time is that he has something to hide and he is doing everything he can to keep it hidden until after the election.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Internet Trolls Zimmerman, Top Bid Of $65 Million From ‘Racist McShootface’ Derails Gun Auction","Quick thinking trolls have taken a novel approach to shutting down George Zimmerman s disgraceful gun auction for the weapon he used to murder 17-year-old Trayvon Martin: Bid absurdly high and make it all but impossible for Zimmerman s racist fans to get a legitimate number.Enter user  Racist McShootface , who took it upon him or herself to  pay  a whopping $65 million for the murder weapon. Only he or she never intended to actually pay. Instead, Zimmerman s auction has gone haywire. After Mr. McShootface was deleted, another user named  Tamir Rice  after the 12-year-old boy who was killed by Cleveland police, jumped into the fray. Others have joined in as well.screengrab via GawkerZimmerman has had an extremely difficult time selling the gun he used to shoot Trayvon with. His initial auction was suspended after major outrage swept nearly every corner of the internet. His second auction was also deleted. Now his third is being systematically destroyed from within by trolls hoping to make it impossible for  real  bidders to get the gun.Sadly, it s not for lack of trying. As Gawker notes, at least one bidder appears to be legitimate and he has already tried to pay $485,000 for the gun Zimmerman sickly refers to as  American history.  That paragon of morality angrily lashed out at the trolls who kept derailing the auction, at one point saying that he hoped their children got murdered. A desire which, for a man prepared to spend $500,000 on a gun used to kill a child, seems believable.Since being acquitted for the murder of Trayvon Martin, who was walking home with a bottle of iced tea and a bag of skittles when he was accosted by Zimmerman who assumed he was up to no good, Zimmerman has had nearly endless run ins with the law. At times nearly broke, Zimmerman has quite literally cashed in on the murder that made him infamous, by selling anything he can to his disturbed supporters. While appalling, it was almost inevitable that Zimmerman would get around to selling his murder weapon to the highest bidder.Thankfully, the internet has a nearly endless capacity to troll assholes like George Zimmerman.Featured image via Joe Burbank-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s Why Conservatives Are Silent About 2016 Cop Killer Data,"Police in this country had a great run. Let s face it   if you remember the 1970s, 1980s   anytime before 600 million cameras went online nationwide, a policeman s word was gold. Now, with an increasing number of people filming nonstop and the introduction of mandatory body cams for more conscientious departments, police can t simply corroborate with each other, sign a report and move on with their day. They re beginning to be held accountable for their actions. Ironically it all began with the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, which wasn t recorded. Multiple witnesses said they saw Brown shot while he was standing a safe distance away and unarmed. A grand jury failed to indict Officer Darren Wilson for Brown s death.Thus sparked the #BlackLivesMatter movement, as more and more it became evident that the narrative, pretty much nationwide, plays out differently for black men than for anyone else in society. They are killed more often. Murdered in cold blood in many cases, black men are routinely beaten after they submit if they aren t shot for looking scary and black first. Conservatives fired back with #BlueLivesMatter and started talking about all of the cops killed by black people ever.And so here we are. Politics has managed to take yet another issue all Americans should be behind and turned into a political circus. Conservatives, who are the political ideology that inspires standoffs with federal agents and wildlife refuge occupations, suddenly believe that if you don t conform with the law and do whatever a police officer tells you, you should be executed on the street. Why? Because the issue is black people. Make it about white people and all of a sudden they re holed up in their bunker with 24,000 rounds of ammunition and a pallet of canned peaches.Conservatives have been awfully quiet this year about cop killings, however, even though they are up substantially. At this time last year there were ten police officers killed in the line of duty, this year there have been 17. Certainly we should hearing about the  thugs  who murdered these public servants? No? 71 percent of the cops killed this year were killed by white men. Not scary black guys wearing bandanas, shooting at them with Uzis from the blacked out windows of an Escalade on 24-inch rims. White guys. Nutjobs, psychopaths, career criminals; come to find out white men are pretty darned dangerous   and they don t need Uzis.So where s the news coverage of the major increase in cop killings? Where s the outrage? Where is #BlueLivesMatter? Do blue lives only matter when they re killed by black men or do they matter all the time? The double standard is so easy to see it s ridiculous. #BlackLivesMatter isn t about cops or all lives. It s not about being an equal part of something when you re not treated as equal. Black men are routinely treated as dangerous, often at the end of a young, hair-trigger finger.Featured image by WP/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Desperate Republicans Are Begging Documented Liars From Fake News Network To Testify On Benghazi,"Congressional Republicans are so pathetically desperate to harm Hillary Clinton that they are now turning to Fox News in order to secure more  witnesses  to testify at yet another Congressional investigation into the Benghazi attacks.On the May 11th edition of Special Report, Fox host Adam Housley brought on  anonymous  sources that swore there were military assets that could have been used to save our diplomatic compound in Benghazi on the night it was attacked in 2012. There was absolutely zero evidence given by Fox during the broadcast, other than shadowy figures reading off a list of what Fox wanted them to say. This apparently was good enough for Republicans.On the May 12th edition of Special Report, host Doug McKelway reported that Trey Gowdy   who is the failed ringleader of months and millions of dollars worth of Benghazi busts   actually contacted Fox News and urged these witnesses who spoke to Fox News to talk to his committee.Gowdy did this despite the fact that Housley, the one who miraculously found these fake witnesses, has a documented history of using admitted liars and fraudsters as  expert witnesses  about the events that happened that night in Libya.One of Housley s worst actors was Dylan Davies, who played a central role in Housley s journalistic fraud. Davies claimed he personally scaled the wall at Benghazi that night, and engaged in one-on-one combat with terrorists. Later he admitted that he completely lied about the entire thing. Housley has also used unnamed sources (liars) to push similar fake stories about Benghazi in the past, all of which were debunked by literally every relevant governmental agency, as well as every previous Republican-led Benghazi hearing.You can understand, in a way, Fox s desire to talk about anything other than Donald Trump and the impending self destruction of the Republican Party. Congressional Republicans, though, have no excuse.Think about it like this. The exact same Republicans on the exact same committee are using the exact same  witnesses that their own investigations proved to be liars, as witnesses in another Benghazi investigation. What the hell do you even say to this? Illogical? Insane? Both?Featured image via YouTube screen capture",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 HILARIOUS: Seth Myers Exposes Trump’s Racist White Power Pals (VIDEO),"Late Night host Seth Myers had a fun segment recently, pointing out the blatant support presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has received from racist white supremacists. Myers used a segment on his NBC talk show to lay out the fact that Trump s racist support hasn t just been a one-off, but in fact has been a series of the worst people imaginable backing the candidate.Myers discusses William Johnson, who was selected and approved by the Trump campaign as a delegate from California to go to the convention, even though he is a public white nationalist and paid for robocalls on Trump s behalf. In those robocalls, Johnson said Trump was a candidate who would defend against so-called  white genocide.  After the controversy blew up, Johnson resigned his position.Another Trump backer profiled by Myers is a KKK Grand Dragon who got caught pretending to be a Clinton supporter, but instead had a history of writing online promoting Trump and attacking Democrats.Myers also used his video to point out how incompetent the Trump campaign has been in responding to the negative press from these incidents, and despite Trump s claim to be a smooth operator, he is more likely to build a wall surrounding New Mexico than he is to build his beloved border wall in the south.The conservative movement has historically had problems with white supremacists, as they are torn by the need to pander to those voters who often exist in their base and the desire to distance themselves publicly from racist speech and actions. At the same time, that same Republican Party works in the states on laws singled out by civil rights organizations as blatantly designed to suppress the black and latino votes, and also often dismisses the concerns of protests like  black lives matter,  instead choosing to ally themselves with odious figures like George Zimmerman.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Wants You To Vote So Badly He’s Ready To Make History To Do It,"President Obama has officially endorsed the idea to make a national holiday set aside just for voting, in order to ensure that more Americans have the free time to exercise one of their greatest freedoms and responsibilities.A Rutgers student journalist from The Daily Targum was at the White House as part of a college journalism program. While he was there, he requested a one-on-one interview with President Obama and the president was happy to oblige.During the interview, Obama was asked about the relatively dismal voter turnout in America, compared to other countries.President Obama s response was nothing short of historic. A portion of the interview is below:THE TARGUM: You have pointed out many times that voter turnout in the United States is very low, especially compared to other developed nations. But in many other countries, the government automatically registers voters and holds elections on days that are weekend days or national holidays. Do you think it s time for the U.S. to follow their lead?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Absolutely. We are the only advanced democracy that makes it deliberately difficult for people to vote. And some of it has to do with the nature of our history and our Constitution, where we allow individual states to determine their own processes for structuring elections within certain boundaries.I think that we know some states like Oregon are doing a much better job at extending mail-in voting, increasing tools like online voting that are safe and secure, give people flexibility over a long period of time, (and) early voting. And so everything we can do to make sure that we re increasing participation is something that we should promote and encourage. Our democracy is not going to function well when only half or a third of eligible voters are participating.The single most dramatic political change that could occur in this country and the best way for us to relieve the frustrations that people feel around the political process would be if we had greater participation that was more reflective of the day-to-day concerns that people have.Source: SlatePresident Obama has made it clear for a long time now, that he would really like to do some things to increase political engagement among Americans. He s already said he was on board with making voting mandatory, but this was his first yet endorsement of a national holiday to facilitate it.Featured image via Getty",News,"May 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch A GOP Senate Candidate Threaten To Harm A Reporter (VIDEO),"A Republican United States Senate candidate in Colorado was caught on video appearing to threaten a reporter with bodily harm. Jon Keyser was confronted by reporter Marshall Zelinger of Denver 7 at a fundraiser and asked questions about suspicious signatures on petitions Keyser had submitted in order to get on the ballot.After initially responding with talking points assuring that he would be on the ballot against Democratic Senator Michael Bennet, Keyser apparently recognized Zelinger for having recently knocked on his door in order to get a comment on the record from the candidate. That s when he relayed his threat.Keyser told Zelinger,  My dog is bigger than you are. He s huge. He s a big guy. Very protective.  Zelinger, obviously surprised by the statement, asked Keyser to clarify. In response, Keyser pointed out that his dog weighs 165 pounds.Watch the video of the tense and odd exchange here:https://www.facebook.com/MZ7NEWS/videos/1313426775337589/Keyser has been under fire because he initially failed to meet the standards for the 10,500 signatures needed to be listed on the ballot in Colorado   1,500 signatures in each of the state s 7 congressional districts. A news investigation also found that several of the signatures were apparently forged:Denver7 has talked to several people whose names appeared on petitions for Jon Keyser in the first congressional district who claim their signatures were forged.  Many of those signatures were collected by a woman named Maureen.A sympathetic judge overruled the Secretary of State s ruling keeping Keyser off the ballot, but now a progressive group in the state is petitioning for an investigation.ProgressNow Colorado sent a letter to Mitch Morrissey and Peter Weir, the District Attorneys in Denver and Jefferson County, respectively. We ask that you pursue a criminal investigation of Jon Keyser and his campaign immediately. Colorado voters must have full confidence in the integrity of the election process,  wrote ProgressNow Colorado Executive Director Alan Franklin.Under a cloud of suspicion like that, it certainly doesn t look good for Keyser to try to intimidate the press.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 MSNBC Host DESTROYS Marsha Blackburn For Pretending To Play Dumb About Trump (VIDEO),"When it comes to Donald Trump, it sure as hell seems as though a lot of Republicans are playing dumb when it comes to how ill-prepared the presumptive GOP nominee actually is to be Commander-in-Chief. Many seem to be just falling in lock-step without considering how dangerous a person like Trump would be as president.Not giving Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn any wiggle room for bullshit, MSNBC host Tamron Hall grilled the Tennessee Congresswoman about certain things she s been saying regarding Donald Trump.After several questions where she just avoided answering at all, and giving generic answers like she hadn t yet  had a conversation with him,  Blackburn argued that she s  curious  about what he has to offer, being that he s an outsider.Hall didn t let her get away with being so mind-numbingly vague and said: I m wondering about the curiosity. There seems to have not been curiosity about the person who has been leading in the votes for a very long time. Donald Trump did not happen overnight. You have yourself, and Speaker Ryan, all trying to get to know him now. Backpedaling, Blackburn said: I ve known Mr. Trump for several years. This back and forth went on for a bit, with Hall finally saying: But a few minutes ago you said you still need to get to know him and sit down and talk to him. Which is it? You re either familiar with his policies and where he stands Blackburn, not liking being caught floundering, came interrupted with: That is not what I said and you know that. I said that let s give him and Speaker Ryan they ve had a good statement. They are going to develop these policies and it s going to be a great campaign in the fall. Mr. Trump has wonderful people working with him. They are working very quickly. Bear in mind, he has not been in the halls of Congress. He has been out running companies. Which still wasn t an answer, so Hall stated the obvious: He s been on the campaign trail for months speaking to your base. It was at this point that Blackburn seemed to struggle with her earpiece and told Hall that she couldn t hear her. Convenient timing, to say the least. Truth is, Trump doesn t have solid policy proposals and GOPers like Blackburn know this. They just don t care.Watch the interview here:Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Eric Trump: Hispanics ‘Can’t Wait’ For My Dad To Win The Election (AUDIO),"Donald Trump s son Eric recently claimed that the Hispanic population is basically fawning over his father and counting down the days until Trump moves into the White House.Earlier this week, Eric appeared on Irish radio s RTE Radio1 s Drivetime to spew false information about one of the groups of people that Trump has insulted and offended the most. Spreading lies about Hispanic people approaching him to tell him just how badly they want his father to be the next President of the United States, the younger Trump said: People often talk about Hispanics. You know, I have more Hispanics come up to me telling me,  Listen, I can t wait for your father to be president. He s going to bring jobs back to the United States. He s going to end the nonsense. He s going to create good trade deals. He s going to create better education. He s going to create a better family structure. Eric also assured listeners that they can t believe everything they see on TV. Despite what the news is reporting, Eric insists that Hispanics are overwhelmingly supportive of The Donald: I see so little of the divisiveness, which is interesting. You watch it on TV, but you see so little of it out in the field. You can listen to this idiotic interview below:I m not sure what world Eric is living in, but it can t be this one. According to current surveys, Trump has basically no chance with Hispanics   a poll by America s Voice and Latino Decisions discovered that 79% of Hispanics do NOT like Trump. And who could blame them? Trump is the candidate that kicked off his presidential campaign with one of the most racist statements ever made when he claimed that Mexico was sending  people that have lots of problems.   They re bringing drugs. They re bringing crime. They re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. And that was just the beginning. Since then, Trump has made several more outrageous, anti-Latino statements, threatened to deport all immigrants in the country illegally, and even p*ssed off Mexico s most prominent leaders with his ridiculous border wall comments. Trump s made it perfectly clear that he has extreme prejudices against Hispanics and all of his words and actions back this up. Eric should probably spend some time educating himself, because more Hispanics than ever have registered to vote in this election   so they can vote AGAINST Trump. Republican media consultant Lionel Sosa explained this phenomenon perfectly when he said: When you take a whole group of people and you call them murderers and rapists, it s a personal affront. Sure, they are going to register, and it s going to be an anti-Trump vote. Sorry Eric, but Daddy can t fix this.Featured image via Ethan Miller / Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Gun Dealer Backs Out Of Selling Zimmerman’s Murder Weapon, Closes Social Media Accounts","George Zimmerman, the infamous neighborhood watchman/violent wannabe cop who murdered unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin is in the news again, and as usual, it is for nothing good. Showing once more that he has absolutely zero remorse regarding the fact that he killed an unarmed teenage boy who was carrying nothing but Skittles and a can of iced tea, Zimmerman is now auctioning off the gun he used to kill Martin for more fame and money.However, Zimmerman s efforts to sell the murder weapon have been quite rocky. First he tried to use a gun dealer called Gunbroker.com to sell the Kel-Tec PF-9 that he used to gun the teen down in cold blood, but the site has now removed the advertisement, in which bidding for the gun started at $5,000. Don t be too happy with Gunbroker.com just yet, though. This is the same website that allowed targets that strongly resembled Trayvon Martin available when the controversial shooting was still in the news. The social media sites of Gunbroker.com are now down, including their Facebook and Twitter, because they know how wrong they are for allowing Zimmerman to list this gun in the first place. The listing on the site now reads, Sorry, but the item you have requested is no longer in the system. As if this cowardice isn t bad enough, another gun dealer has taken up the cause of allowing George Zimmerman to continue to profit from his murdering without remorse of an unarmed child. A site called United Gun Group has taken up Zimmerman s fame-whoring, murderous, money-making cause, and they have released the following statement regarding the listing of Zimmerman s weapon, via TMZ: A spokesperson for unitedgungroup.com says he got in touch with Zimmerman through a mutual friend once the initial listing was removed. He tells us unitedgungroup.com s stance on the controversial item is if it s legal, they have no objections and it  comes down to a moral decision for George to do what he wants with his property. But, as we are all well aware, acquittal and/or legality does not always = justice. Then again, we really can t expect gun nuts to know or care anything about these simple facts, or about the crazy and unjust law that allowed this goon to literally get away with murder. George Zimmerman is a murderer, and he has profited without remorse for being a murderer, and these events show that he continues to do so.Shame on anyone who helps this despicable excuse for a human being continue to get rich quick and rub salt in the wounds of Trayvon Martin s grieving family.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Joy Behar And Trump Supporting Audience Member Go Head To Head (VIDEO),"While many in the United States have come to the logical decision that Donald Trump is stark raving mad, there are still those who apparently have made him their choice for president. One of those people was just in the audience for a taping of ABC s The View and was questioned by host Joy Behar after the show.When the woman who supports Trump (yes, woman) is asked why, she refuses to say why   which if I may add is very Trumpian, because Trump always makes claims with nothing to back it up either   he then explains that she voted for President Obama, but said that it was the biggest mistake of her life. Then she said she works in a hospital and hates Obamacare, even though moments later she said she s been unemployed for a year. She somehow thinks that Trump would actually be better for healthcare and the unemployed. When asked if maybe she should support Bernie Sanders, who wants to provided single payer and a better safety net, she adamantly refused.Now, not to speak ill of a woman who clearly doesn t understand how the parties operate and who stands for what, but it seems she wants to go back to a system that will harm her more than help her. And I think a lot of the blame for her misunderstanding comes down to misinformation and even lack of information being spread by not only candidates, but the media.This woman wants change. Sure. That s great. However, what she wants she s not going to find in Trump.Watch the back and forth here: Watch what happens when @JoyVBehar questions an audience member s support for Donald Trump: https://t.co/kQ9dGmHJ1O  The View (@TheView) May 12, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Hints At Making The Crypt Keeper His Vice President,"Six years ago a little-known governor from Arizona skyrocketed to fame in the Republican Party by attacking immigrants and now Donald Trump is hinting that she may be his vice presidential pick   it d be a match made in Hell.Former Governor Jan Brewer signed SB 1070, the  Show Me Your Papers  bill, into law in the state and the GOP base fawned all over her. When she signed the xenophobic bill into law she said that she was doing it because she had to keep her state safe: We cannot sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of drug cartels. We cannot stand idly by as drop houses, kidnappings, and violence compromise our quality of life. We cannot delay while the destruction happening south of our border   our international border creeps its way north. We in Arizona have been more than patient waiting for Washington to act, but decades of federal inaction and misguided policy have created a dangerous and unacceptable situation. Just like Trump, she lied and demonized the immigrant community in order to appease her hateful supporters. Just like Trump, she used some of the most vulnerable people in the country as a political stepping stone. So, with that in mind, it isn t very surprising that Trump hinted at Brewer being his running mate during an interview with Fox s Greta van Susteren. The On the Record host the Republican presidential candidate if any women were on his list and he said, yes : Jan Brewer has been fantastic. She has been so fantastic. You know I won so big, her territory, we won so big. And she is a fabulous woman. Fabulous? Fantastic? Not even.Jan Brewer is a vile human being and there is nothing  fabulous  about her. The only thing that she has going for her is that she was the governor of a red state and she is as big a fear-monger as Trump. I almost hope the billionaire loudmouth does pick Governor Crypt Keeper as his running mate, his chances of winning the election will plummet even further.Featured image via Andrew H.

 Bill O’Reilly Pathetically Defends Trump: ‘Jesus Never Put Out His Tax Returns!’ (VIDEO),"Fox News host Bill O Reilly and Fox Business host Lou Dobbs made a pathetically lame attempt to defend Donald Trump s hesitance to release his tax returns. In doing so, they made a disgraceful comparison between the presumptive Republican nominee and Jesus Christ.Succeeding in making himself look even more suspicious, Trump has recently broken his previous promise to release his tax returns before election day. Announcing the news on Wednesday, Trump said his sorry excuse was that a federal audit needed to be completed before he could release them   which is an absolute lie that O Reilly and Dobbs failed to call him out on.On O Reilly s show, Dobbs came to the business mogul s defense: Why should he turn over his tax returns when he s being audited? [H]e is facing a hostile national media that no matter how pristine those returns, it s going to find something to pick at and blow up. And then use it as some shiny object to distract from the issue. O Reilly pointed out that releasing those documents would be a  good move  on Trump s part, considering that his honesty was questioned by partisans.  It would not only be a good idea   it would be standard practice. Trump is now the first nominee not to disclose his tax returns since 1976. Even former President Richard Nixon, who was under audit, didn t hesitate to release his tax returns   a fact that makes Trump s secrecy look more shady than ever.Dobbs pushed logic aside and said, After the first billion, I lose interest.  He also failed to answer O Reilly when he asked if there was anything that Dobbs hadn t liked about Trump s campaign. Dobbs refused to give him a straight answer, because you d be just like the rest of those guys in the national media, you just focus on it. O Reilly pushed back and said, I m asking you as an analyst. You are not willing to say one thing.  When Dobbs continued to dance around the question, O Reilly yelled: If he is Jesus, how can you analyze him? Dobbs said, How can I analyze him? Because I have a superior mind that competes at least fairly favorably with your own. O Reilly giggled and replied with something truly idiotic: Okay. Let s just recap. According to Dobbs, Donald Trump is Jesus. And Jesus never put out his tax returns! Ever! Dobbs completely threw all intelligence out the window when he said,  That s a line that I can actually agree with.

 Congressional Republicans Might Cause This Deadly Virus To Overwhelm U.S.,"There has been a minor war brewing in Congress since February that the media has not received as much attention as it needs to. Many Republicans are refusing to support President Obama s plan to prevent millions of deaths from the Zika virus, an epidemic that has swept through South America and could enter into the continental United states any day now.In February 2016, The World Health Organization officially declared the Zika virus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. That s when President Obama announced a plan to spend $1.9 billion dollars to halt the spread of the virus before it reaches the United States and the rest of North America.Below is a map released by the White House that shows how the virus can spread throughout the United States.The Zika virus is spread through mosquito bites. Specifically, Aedes mosquitos. which are often found in urban areas, are to blame for the spread of the virus. When a person contracts the Zika virus, the symptoms are usually fairly mild. Those who are infected experience pain in their joints, headaches, and pain behind the eyes. Symptoms usually persist for a few weeks and then go away. Usually, a person who becomes infected with the virus becomes immune to the disease in the future. There is no cure for the disease. Historically, there have not been any incidents of the Zika virus being a fatal. However, since the outbreak, deaths have been linked to the virus   one of which was in Puerto Rico.Even though symptoms are mild for the average person, everything changes if a pregnant woman contracts the virus. That s where the disease reveals its true power to destroy lives. The Zika virus can cause a fetus to develop what is called fetal development disruption sequence. What happens is that the brain of the fetus stops growing, or is severely scared, which leads to brain damage and conditions such as microcephaly. A condition where an infant s head is much smaller than it should be, sometimes  as small as an orange  according to NPR.As it was pointed out in an opinion piece published in the New York Times, the fact that Republicans are willing are not willing to take immediate action to stop the virus is incredibly hypocritical when you consider they tried to blame the 2014 Ebola outbreak on the president.It should be noted that not all Republicans are willing to risk the nation s health over petty budget squabbles. Senator Marco Rubio has publicly lambasted his fellow Republicans for stalling.  Rubio was quoted as saying,  The money is going to be spent. And the question is, do we do it now before this has become a crisis, or do we wait for it to become a crisis?  Rubio has good reasons to plead for urgency on the matter. Gulf states will be among the first and hardest hit by the Zika when and if it reaches the continental United States, including Rubio s home state of Florida. If only, Rubio had the same mentality when it came to other crises such as climate change.So once again, we find ourselves with a Congress controlled by neoconservatives who have neither the compassion to do what is right and act to save lives, as well as the lack of fiscal wisdom to understand that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. These types of battles are what are what legitimizes Brand New Congress s mission to scout out and support Democrats and progressive Republicans (Yes, they do exist. It s pragmatic to accept that there are seats Dems are never going to be able to take.) in elections to make a Congress that functions. Or at least one that functions well enough that they can decide that the future of the United States shouldn t look like an episode of The Walking Dead.Featured image from (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Tom Brokaw And Morning Joe BURN Sarah Palin For Threatening Paul Ryan,"The legendary newsman appeared on MSNBC to slam the media for not holding Donald Trump accountable for what he says and does, but also had time to laugh at Sarah Palin.As a guest on Morning Joe on Monday, Tom Brokaw criticized the media for not doing their jobs when it comes to Donald Trump, whose violent and hateful rhetoric has helped him become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. In the course of the campaign, [Trump has] said some things that were just blatantly not true. He s never been held accountable for it, so many of them, and the things that he s said. Having said all of that, he did touch a big nerve out there and he ran a campaign that no one at this table or in the political world expected him to do as well as he has. But all factors in life are about how do you adjust to the reality of where you are next, how you re going to deal with the next phase of this. And we re now in the next phase. And if he keeps punching out the people in his own party in the way that he has, I don t see how that s going to help him. I just don t. But earlier on in his remarks, Brokaw talked about how Donald Trump has been treating House Speaker Paul Ryan and mentioned how Sarah Palin declared that Ryan s career will be over if he doesn t support Trump. Brokaw s mentioning of Palin immediately drew laughter from Joe Scarborough, who made a hilarious observation of his own that caused the rest of the panel to laugh as well.BROKAW:  For him to just punch out Paul Ryan the way that he has. To have Sarah Palin to be saying that Paul Ryan has no career now, that it s over for him SCARBOROUGH:  Says someone who has no career now. Here s the video via Media Matters.Sarah Palin just got burned by Joe Scarborough and Tom Brokaw and it was hilarious because what they said is true.Indeed, Sarah Palin has no career of her own. The closest she came was as governor of Alaska before she quit halfway into her term. Ever since then, she has become a professional grifter who swindles gullible supporters out of money in any way she can, including jumping on the Trump bandwagon to get more attention. Make no mistake, Sarah Palin is a joke and people should laugh at her.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Sends A Loud And Clear Message On Why Trump Will NOT Be President (VIDEO),"Over the last few months, Donald Trump has been able to garner enough votes to make him the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency. Unfortunately, his message has been based on divisiveness, consistently attacking minorities as the cause of the country s woes. Not since the America when it was perfectly fine to discriminate against women has there been a candidate whose views on women have been so repulsive. Not since Jim Crow America, when it was perfectly fine to use the language of racism, has there been a candidate who has openly called for the oppression of minorities, specifically Muslims and Mexicans. It s taken a long time and America continues to be a work in progress, but there has been improvement and Americans continue to work hard to move the country in the right direction.Trump s America is not the America that we ve all worked so hard to better. His election would lead us to a regression rather than a progression for a better society. Thus, our values are inconsistent with that of this demagogue.Bernie Sanders reminds us of this fact in this touching video that lets Trump as well as the world know that the American people are a great people and it s our diversity that makes us so great. When we are inclusive as a nation, when we help each other rather than divide each other, we are great. Bernie s message is the message of hope and love and in the end, it will overpower the demagoguery and racism of Donald Trump.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmAimxt0GaU]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump’s Longtime Butler Calls For Obama To Be Killed In Unhinged Facebook Rant,"If a man s character really is about the company he keeps, then what does it say about Donald Trump that his longtime butler (yes, he has a longtime butler) and newly appointed  in house historian  for the Trump family just called for President Obama to be killed?Anthony Senecal, who looks like a cross between Batman s butler Alfred and the monopoly guy, took it upon himself to post a lengthy, unhinged rant on Facebook. It s safe to say he is not a fan of Obama or basic grammar.To all my friends on FB, just a short note to you on our pus headed  president  !!!! This character who I refer to as zero (0) should have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term !!!!! Instead he still remains in office doing every thing he can to gut the America we all know and love !!!!! Now comes Donald J Trump to put an end to the corruption in government !!!! The so called elite, who are nothing but common dog turds from your front lawn are shaking in their boots because there is a new Sheriff coming to town, and the end to their corruption of the American people (YOU) is at hand !!!! I cannot believe that a common murder is even allowed to run (killery clinton) OR that a commie like bernie is a also allowed to also run !!!! Come on America put your big boy pants on this election you have a choice GET YOUR ASS OUT AND VOTE !!!! Thank you !!!!To summarize, Senecal wanted Obama to be kidnapped by America s own military and executed in his first term. He seemed to desire similar fates for both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as well.And having won a second term, Senecal decided Obama alternatively needed to be  hung [sic] for treason. via FacebookMother Jones couldn t believe that Senecal would actually write that, and called him up to ask if his Facebook account had been hacked. Instead, he tersely confirmed,  I wrote that. I believe that. In other posts, Senecal has agreed with his boss that Obama is not a U.S. citizen and routinely only refers to Obama as  zero (O)  or creative epithets. When asked why he was calling for Obama to be killed, Trump s close friend replied: I cannot stand the bastard. I don t believe he s an American citizen. I think he s a fraudulent piece of crap that was brought in by the Democrats. Like many of Trump s closest associates, Senecal appears to be a complete and utter lunatic. These friends are now expecting a place for themselves in Trump s White House. Trump, who once flatly stated that he would make an exception in his Muslim ban for his Middle Eastern business associates, is clearly the type of guy who doesn t mind throwing a bone to his yes-men.In a gushing piece on Senecal published by the New York Times a few months ago, Trump s butler tellingly referred to Donald as  the king.  And this chilling anecdote:Mr. Senecal s admiration for his longtime boss seems to know few limits. On March 6, as Mr. Trump made his way through the living room on his way to the golf course, Mr. Senecal called out  All rise!  to the club members and staff. They rose.Perhaps Senecal knows better than anybody what Trump wants: Executions of his enemies and the royal treatment.Featured image via Facebook/Mother Jones",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Harry Reid Storms The Senate, UNLEASHES On GOP And It Was F*cking AWESOME (VIDEO)","On Thursday, while Republican leadership was meeting with Donald Trump, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid unleashed on the GOP for pandering to their atrocious nominee. The first thing Reid did when he spoke was to make sure that every American who watched his speech knows that the right-wing is  marching lock-step with Donald Trump  and their policies are perfectly aligned: So, McConnell has fully embraced Donald Trump. As he said last week when Trump secured the Republican nomination, I quote, I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters,  closed quote. While speaking with reporters earlier this week the Republican leader sounded enthusiastic about Trump s chances in the general election. I guess he should be giddy about a Trump presidency, Donald Trump is everything that the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nomination. That is absolutely, 100 percent spot-on. We have been saying the same thing since the beginning. The Republican base is filled with racist, misogynistic, Islamaphobic xenophobes who hate everyone who isn t a straight, white, Christian male. After explaining how much the GOP loves Trump, he hit them about their Supreme Court obstruction. Then Senator Reid pointed out how much the GOP hates women: Let s talk about Trump and women. When they get together, they can talk about their policies about being anti-woman. Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, we can only assume he agrees with Trump s view that women are dogs and pigs. We can only assume that the Republican Leader is not repulsed by Donald Trump s vulgar behavior towards women. Look at his New York Times story yesterday on his cavorting with Howard Stern and how they talked about women. After all, the Republican Party has spent years blocking every substantive bill for American women. Equal pay for equal work. The Senator has tried to undermine women s health at every turn. Trying to turn Planned Parenthood into a punching bag, even though millions and millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood. The minority leader went on to say that McConnell must also agree with Trump s views on immigrants; after all, the GOP has been saying the same thing about them for years. He hit Republicans for claiming they care about immigration control, but came within hours of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security. The senator said that he  can only assume  that Mitch McConnell and the leadership are okay with Trump s  shady business practices  and  ripping off  hardworking Americans.Reid slammed the GOP for Trump s bankruptcies, their climate change bullshit, their horrible fiscal policies, Trump wanting to default on America s debt and a number of other things. He spent more than eight minutes ripping Republican leadership and it was amazing. It was also terrifying. If Donald Trump is elected in November, this country is screwed. Our children will be left with a mess of epic proportions and our older kids will probably be sent to war. There is literally nothing good that could come with putting a member of the GOP in the White House. So, remember to vote blue, no matter who.Watch Reid rip the GOP apart:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Donald Trump Vows To Place Anti-Abortion Judges On Supreme Court,"Back in March, Donald Trump made it clear that he wants to outlaw abortion, but he also conceded that overturning Roe v. Wade would force women to seek unsafe back-alley abortions that would lead to a rise of of unnecessary deaths. You go back to a position like they had where they would perhaps go to illegal places,  Mr. Trump said.  But you have to ban it. And then Trump said women should be punished for choosing to have an abortion.  There has to be some form of punishment,  he remarked.Now Trump has taken the next step toward outlawing abortion and depriving women across the nation of a medical procedure that must be available to them as an option.During an interview with Bill O Reilly on Fox News on Tuesday, Trump promised to nominate anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court to guarantee that Roe v. Wade will fall and women will lose their reproductive rights. I will protect it,  Trump said after O Reilly asked the presumptive Republican presidential nominee what he is going to do about the  sanctity of life. The biggest way you can protect it is through the Supreme Court and putting people on the court,  Trump continued.  Actually, the biggest way you can protect it, I guess, is by electing me president. In short, Trump intends to strip women of their constitutionally protected right to choose by stacking the Supreme Court with hostile anti-abortion extremists. And Trump went on to remark that up to five Justices could be replaced in the next four years, which means anti-abortion extremists would keep the Supreme Court an anti-women s rights institution for decades if Trump is not defeated in November.Here s the video via YouTube.In response to Trump s remarks, Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow issued a statement of condemnation. Donald Trump doesn t want a Supreme Court nominee who can be an objective umpire; he wants a nominee who s picked a side already,  Stabenow said.  And the side he wants them to pick is against women and their health care. Indeed, Republicans are already blocking a Supreme Court nomination made by President Obama precisely because they are hoping it will be filled by a Republican in 2017 after Obama leaves office. That means Trump would be be able to pick an anti-abortion nominee right off the bat to replace recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia.70 percent of women across the country already have an unfavorable view of Donald Trump due to his past remarks on abortion and the rampant sexism he has displayed on the campaign trail and during debates. Now they have even more reason to enthusiastically support Hillary Clinton or whoever ends up becoming the Democratic nominee. Because at this point, any Democrat is better than Trump.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Donald Trump Is An Imbecile Who Doesn’t Understand How Executive Orders Work (VIDEO),"The more a Trump run for the White House as a major party candidate sinks in, the more his blatant incompetence stands out. In this recent interview with Greta Van Susteren, Trump is discussing possibilities for the vice presidency, which Trump has announced will be unveiled at the GOP convention. The convention, already guaranteed to be the circus the sideshows have been building up to, will definitely have the highest viewer ratings of all time. Trump then hints that his VP pick will most likely be a person with a political background because he believes passing legislation is more important than using executive orders to get things done.Then it happened. The thing that will bring Donald Trump to his knees. He pretended to know what he was talking about and said something incredibly stupid. As the race goes on, more people with a little bit of knowledge about something are going to hear something like this and realize immediately that it s amazing that Donald Trump ever graduated high school. He s a showman who built a movement of stupidity on social media and reality television. His remarks to Van Susteren about executive orders prove that he is completely incompetent to hold the office that issues them:  We re not gonna do the executive order thing like Obama. He couldn t get anything passed You re not gonna do executive orders?  asked Van Stern,  No executive orders? Well, we ll see,  says Trump,   It depends on what, but President Obama has been signing a lot of executive orders nobody s ever heard of an executive order before. I mean, I know Bush signed them and other people have signed them, but all of a sudden it s like this major event to get things done. It would be nice to go back to the old-fashioned way   it s called passing legislation; having people get together to pass legislation. You can just hear Joe Pesci doing a scene from Goodfellas.  Hey, yo What the hell is dis  zecutive order bullsh*t. At ain t The way we do things in Hell s Kitchen.  It s ridiculous. President Obama and a team of lawyers combed the laws and precedents of our country, being fully qualified and empowered to do so, and imposed directives to the agencies under the purview of the executive branch, like the INS, as any chief executive of any company would do to those under him. When the president signs an executive order it doesn t become a law, it becomes the current policy of the federal government in its own dealings.That certainly can have a profound effect on shaping federal law, as it sends a profound statement, but as for the bulk of executive orders, they cover the mundane to the ridiculous and have been signed by every single United States President. President Obama has signed fewer than either of the Bush buffoons or Uncle Ronny Reagan. Donald Trump doesn t even need to be prompted to Palin himself. He just does it by complete instinct at this point.",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Paul Ryan Backpeddles After Trump Meeting, Covers His A** For Endorsement","For a time, it seemed that House Speaker Paul Ryan was no fan of the now-presumptive GOP 2016 presidential nominee Donald Trump. After all, Ryan has largely kept his opinions on the GOP primary to himself, but some of Trump s statements and actions were outrageous enough for Ryan to speak out. When Trump refused to out-and-out disavow an endorsement from infamous Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, Ryan spoke up and condemned the idea that the Republican Party could have a presidential nominee who flirted with the endorsements of white supremacist groups. The same thing happened when Trump came out and said that he wanted to ban all Muslims from entering the United States.One would think that these positions would mean that Ryan could not support Trump s nomination; in fact, he recently said that he was  not ready  to go all in for Trump. All of that changed on Thursday morning, though, when Ryan held a closed meeting with Donald Trump. Afterwards, Ryan made a statement to the media that seemed designed to walk back his earlier condemnations of the The Donald. He s talking about  party unity,  and says that he is  very encouraged  by Trump s remarks in their meeting. Ryan would not, however, speak on specifics of what he talked about with Trump. Instead, Ryan and Trump gave the media a joint statement that said that they want GOP leaders to   unite around our shared principles, advance a conservative agenda and do all we can to win this fall.  The statement went on to say: With that focus, we had a great conversation this morning. While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground. We will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal. While speaking to the press after the meeting, Ryan said: This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification. It s very important that we don t fake unifying, we don t pretend unification, that we truly and actually unify so we are full strength in the fall. I don t want us to have a fake unification process here. While Ryan didn t flat-out endorse Trump, it seems that he is preparing to do just that in the not-too-distant future, while just a short while ago, we saw him show a bit of common sense and call Trump out for his bigoted rhetoric. But, once a Republican, always a Republican. No scruples whatsoever, so nobody should be surprised at this at all. It seems that Speaker Ryan is just another  party first  GOP shill who doesn t give a damn how absolutely dangerous a Donald Trump presidency would be for this nation and he is clearly preparing to stand behind this narcissistic blowhard as he aims to become America s next dictator president.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: North Carolina Governor Wants To Kill Civil Rights Act To Bring Back Segregation,"In 2013, conservatives used their 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court to kill a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Now Republicans are aiming at the Civil Rights Act to bring back segregation.During an interview on CNN with Jake Tapper, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory actually argued that Congress should  revisit  the Civil Right Act of 1964 to make segregation legal again so that the state can make accommodations for transgender people. I think we ought to make special circumstances for those individuals,  McCrory said when asked how we should treat transgender kids. He suggested that the federal government is preventing the creation of unisex bathrooms and that we should segregate by forcing transgender kids to use those bathrooms.Of course, many businesses have already added unisex bathrooms without a problem so McCrory seems to pretending that the federal government is blocking him.He whined about the Justice Department taking issue with North Carolina s HB2 law, which allows business owners to discriminate against LGBT customers and employees under the guise of religious liberty. And he blamed  the left  for the discriminatory laws Republicans have been passing across the country. I think that this was an argument that we didn t need to have,  McCrory said. But this is an agenda by the far left. And for some reason, the national media is saying the far right brought this up. I had no interest in this subject. But the Justice Department is basically making a civil rights claim that every private sector employer in the U.S. and every university in the United States must have gender expression or gender identity bathroom choices for individuals. 17 states and over 200 cities have simply passed laws or ordinances protecting transgender people allowing them to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity free from discrimination.It s the Republicans who made this a problem by passing laws overriding local ordinances and legalizing bigotry against LGBT people.However, McCrory would like the Republican-controlled Congress to go another step further and gut the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that segregation can once again be legal in the United States. I think there s a time where the Republicans and the Democrats in this Congress need to revisit the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and revisit all this issue. Because these are complex issues and North Carolina for whatever reason politically has become the target by the left on this agenda. Here s the video via YouTube.If McCrory had his way, we would not only see transgender people get segregated from from the rest of the population, we would see many southern states segregate black people as well. We would once again have bathrooms for whites and blacks, separate water fountains, separate schools, and businesses could signs outside that say  whites only. Basically, McCrory made the Justice Department s case by admitting that he wants to segregate transgender people into  separate but equal  bathrooms, which is going to be pretty difficult to enforce unless you put a perverted cop in every public bathroom. Segregation has been illegal since 1954 for a reason. It goes against our constitutional values and divides Americans when we should be united.The very fact that McCrory even suggested killing a key part of the Civil Rights Act should make it clear to every American that Republicans are just itching to attack the landmark legislation to take the country backward. And if voters allow a President Trump along with a Republican majority in Congress, McCrory could very well get his wish.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here’s Why 2016 Will Be The Year Of The Woman,"Go back to 1991. Anita Hill accuses Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment just as his confirmation hearings are wrapping up. Republicans, still sour about the failed nomination of Robert Bork, decide to turn the confirmation into a media circus in an attempt to smear Hill and save their ultra-conservative zealot from being held accountable for his actions.Women in America were disgusted with what they saw   old, Republican men turning their backs on a respected women who was sexually harassed and instead blindly taking the word of their ideologue for purely partisan reasons.It was this repulsive circus show that led to the 1992 election, which was dubbed the Year of the Woman. In that very important election, as not only was President Bill Clinton elected over George H.W. Bush (who appointed Thomas), but some of the most influential women of the Senate were elected   Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington, and Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois.According to the House s record:In 1992, women went to the polls, energized by a record-breaking number of women on the federal ticket. The results were unprecedented; the 24 women who won election to the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time that November comprised the largest number elected to the House in any single election, and the women elected to the Senate tripled the number of women in that chamber.Women had one simple message for the GOP: they were sick and tired of sexist, old Republican men.And that is why 2016 will be the Year of the Woman. With Donald Trump as the clear cut nominee for President of the United States, there is no doubt women will come out in full force   with a clear hatred for him and his rhetoric   and send liberal women to Washington in droves.Look at the facts:According to a CNN poll from April 2016, a whopping 73 percent of women have a highly unfavorable view of Donald Trump, and it only continues to grow. Almost 40 percent of Republican women have an unfavorable view of the frontrunner. He s now the nominee for the Republican Party. The man who has referred to women as  bitches  and  dogs  is now the de facto leader of a major American political party.There are a historical amount of strong and competitive women running for the Senate this election season:Republicans fear that the Trump nomination could cost them the Senate. And with women as the Democratic nominees for many of the most competitive races this season, things are looking good for another Year of the Woman.If Democrats vote down ticket (which thy usually do in presidential elections), Democrats take back the Senate with the help of eight qualified ladies.With dozens of House races being ran by progressive women, Congress could and will look vastly different   of Democrats want it to be. All they have to do is vote. They just have to get out and vote.And with Hillary Clinton inching her way to the presidential nomination, it looks as though women will have more control than ever before, and that s absolutely a good thing.Women have one of strongest voices in the American electorate. In 1992, they were pissed and rightfully so. In 2016, the sentiments are the exact same. Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren are taking Donald Trump to task everyday for his sexist, dangerous rhetoric. Women are fired up, and they won t be quiet or sit this one out.I want women to decide this election. They ve been picked on enough.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 George Zimmerman Is Selling The Gun He Used To Murder Trayvon Martin In Cold Blood (VIDEO),"***UPDATE***The listing has been removed, and Zimmerman almost assuredly feels like a victim.George Zimmerman is terrible. A habitual woman abuser and child killer-turned-terrible-painter, the man who sparked national controversy by stalking and murdering Trayvon Martin in 2012 just proved that he has absolutely no shame. None at all. Not even the teensiest little bit. Zimmerman has said that he feels no regret for gunning down Martin, despite that police told him to stay in his car and not to engage when Zimmerman called 911 to report that someone walking through the neighborhood looked a little too black for his taste. Not even the fact that Martin was armed with only a can of Arizona and a pack of Skittles phases the right-wing hero. In fact, Zimmerman genuinely believes he is the victim in all this.Given his rather disturbed mentality, it is unsurprising that George is doing the most despicable thing he has done since the night he murdered an unarmed African-American child who was simply walking home: He s selling the gun he used to murder Trayvon Martin. I m a free American. I can do what I like with my possessions,  Zimmerman told WOFL on Wednesday night.  It s time to move past the firearm. And if I sell it and it sells, I move past it. Otherwise, it s going in a safe for my grandkids and [is] never to be, you know, used or seen again. Zimmerman s auction is running on GunBroker.com, where bidding begins at $5,000   the price he is attaching to Trayvon Martin s life. In his posting, he says that he is  honored and humbled  to announce the sale of  the firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin on 2/26/2012.  Zimmerman says that numerous people have offered to buy the gun, but that the prospective purchasers wanted to use the gun in a  fashion  that even he  did not feel comfortable with. He says the firearm is fully functional despite the efforts of  B. Hussein Obama to render the firearm inoperable,  noting that the purchaser may  do with the firearm what they wish. Zimmerman says that he will use the proceeds to fight against Black Lives Matter, to end the political career of the prosecutor who handled his murder trial, and to attack Hillary Clinton. Now is your opportunity to own a piece of American history,  he concludes.Asked what he thought about the opinions of those who would oppose the sale of the gun he used to kill a child, including Trayvon Martin s parents. Zimmerman explained that he doesn t care much: They re not going to be bidding on it so I couldn t care less about them.

According to a new report from Oxfam America, some of these employees are being denied bathroom breaks and have resorted to wearing diapers while processing the food you eat.Three of the biggest companies are named in the report.The report cited unnamed workers from Tyson Foods Inc., Pilgrim s Pride Corp., Perdue Farms Inc. and Sanderson Farms Inc. who said that supervisors mock them, ignore requests and threaten punishment or firing. When they can go, they wait in long lines even though they are given limited time, sometimes 10 minutes, according to the report. Some workers have urinated or defecated themselves while working because they can t hold on any longer, the report said. Some workers  restrict intake of liquids and fluids to dangerous degrees,  Oxfam said.The poultry companies deny the allegations, but Oxfam says they have heard similar stories before from industry employees, and allege that supervisors ignore established company policy.Oxfam has put together an online campaign with the hashtag #GiveThemABreak to highlight these horrific business practices. They also point out the contradiction in how workers are being treated versus company profits. I was stunned when poultry workers in Arkansas told me that people regularly wear diapers to work in the plants,  says Minor Sinclair, Director of Oxfam America s US Program.  They feel they have to put up with this, to keep their jobs. The supervisors do whatever they can to keep the line running at breakneck speed, and the companies turn a blind eye, as they re racking up record profits. It feels like something out of  The Jungle,  from a hundred years ago, but it s happening right now. It just isn t right. This is nothing short of despicable, and the labor board needs to investigate immediately.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mitt Romney Thinks Trump’s Tax Returns Will Show Mob Ties (VIDEO),"In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mitt Romney discussed the fact that Donald Trump has vowed that he won t release his tax returns before the election. Romney insists that Trump must have a  bombshell  in his tax returns and that they might reveal something really nefarious and  disqualifying. This statement was in response to the bombshell Trump dropped on voters on Wednesday, in which he said he wouldn t release them. Trump has previously said that he would release his tax returns once the IRS is done auditing them. This claim is bizarre on its face. Here s Trump during a debate talking about the alleged audit:Tax experts are dubious:An audit by itself would not prevent Trump from releasing his tax returns, said David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer prize winning tax author. It is up to an individual whether to disclose his or her tax return to the public, a lender or anyone else who wants to see it.Audits are rare. Overall, fewer than 1% of all individual returns are audited, although the rate is closer to 10% for tax filers with incomes over $10 million. The IRS says it expects to conduct 1.2 million individual audits this year, the lowest level in 11 years.Source: CNN MoneyThe IRS agrees: Federal privacy rules prohibit the IRS from discussing individual tax matters. Nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information,  the IRS said in a statement released to NBC News.Source: NBC News Originally, the speculation was that Trump s tax returns would show that he s worth far less than his claim of $10 billion (or whatever he s saying today), but apparently Romney feels that it could be something much, much worse, and that Trump might have ties to the mob. Of course, that s not a huge leap to make, especially since Trump is in the construction business and in the casino business. Both industries are known for mob connections. That doesn t mean he has the mob connections, or more importantly, that he benefits from the mob connections, but it s not surprising that Romney could draw that conclusion.The irony, though, is that the tables have done a complete 180 from 2012 to now. Four years ago, Romney hadn t yet released his tax returns and it was Trump calling for transparency. Here s Romney being asked about his tax returns:Trump did eventually endorse the multi-millionaire, but not after saying this about Romney s tax returns:I think Mitt was hurt really very badly by this whole thing with the income tax returns. I believe he should have given them April 1, but I didn t think going into a little bit of detail without going into a lot of detail was positive thing. He ll come back. He has proven to be very resilient guy. He has been hurt a number of times by number of different things, he comes back. He really seems to be very tough and resilient. You have to hand it to him.Source: Fox NewsIt s somewhat surprising that Trump won t release his tax returns. He has famously said that he could shoot someone from the middle of Fifth Avenue and his followers would still love him. Sadly, that s probably true. A few billion less on his tax return can t make a difference, right? It s doubtful that even mob connections could damage him politically. Even white supremacist connections make his followers say  meh.  It could be that Trump s tax returns have something much worse, for him. They could point to illegal activity. This could be mob related, or it could be something else.Featured image via Ethan Miller/ Getty Images.",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Target CEO Tells Anti-Transgender Boycotters To Drop Dead (VIDEO),"Brian Cornell, the CEO of the Target chain of stores, is not backing down to the demands of the religious right. The chain prompted backlash from the far right after it said it would allow people to use whichever bathroom in its stores that correspond to their gender identity.Conservatives, including national figures like Senator Ted Cruz, insisted that somehow sexual predators would take the store s policy to be a green light for assaults on women and young girls. The idea that this would happen is a complete myth, but has been used to pass anti-transgender laws in states like North Carolina and Mississippi.When Target announced their policy, some figures on the religious right called for the store to be boycotted until they changed their minds, while others have engaged in weird protests, blocking access to Target bathrooms.In an interview with CNBC, Cornell stood his ground. We took a stance, and were going to continue to embrace our belief of diversity and inclusion and just how important that is to our company,  Cornell said.He also pointed out that much of the anti-transgender sentiment on the right is similar to racist claims from the recent past.Cornell said Target is familiar with choosing to stand on the right side of social issues. Decades ago, Target was one of the first major companies to cast black models in its ads, provoking similar backlash, he said. We had a lot of tough feedback,  Cornell said,  But sitting here today, I know we made the right decision. Recent polls have shown that the rabid anti-transgender sentiment is a minority of people. Most Americans are open and welcoming, and believe that the government really shouldn t have a role in policing which restroom people go to (some might call that big government).As a sign of just how out of touch the  religious  right is here, several mega-corporations have pulled their money from states with anti-transgender laws, echoing the boycotts that rose up after some states passed anti-gay  religious freedom  laws. It doesn t pay to be a bigot in America anymore, at least not like it used to.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This North Carolina High School Just Made It So Trans Students Can Be Pepper Sprayed For Peeing,"It s hard to believe that so many people are so remarkably stupid and bigoted in North Carolina, but alas, they really seem to be. Of course, not the entire state, but there does seem to be a rather large group of the population that believes transgender individuals are out to cause harm. When in reality, those who are transgender are actually just living their truth and should be treated with dignity and respect for doing so.With the passage and signing of HB2, better known as the now infamous  bathroom bill,  it s basically given citizens of the state permission to be the bathroom police. To be clear, HB2 has nothing to do with bathroom safety, and everything to do with being discriminatory bigots to the transgender community.Now, because of this legislated discrimination, the Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education is now allowing students to bring pepper spray into school bathrooms. You know, to  protect themselves,  which in all honesty just gave permission to every bigoted child in that state to use this allowance as a  get out of jail free card  to those they want to physically abuse by means of pepper spray. Think about it, you can already hear the  I thought they were going to attack me  excuses piling up, and administrators being like,  well, in that case Board member Chuck Hughes, who is in favor of the pepper spray and referenced HB2 in his argument, said: Depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues, it may be a pretty valuable tool to have on the female students if they go to the bathroom, not knowing who may come in. Keep in mind, this also means that students will seemingly be able to have pepper spray on their person at all times while in school. Surely there will be no complications with such a thing (sarcasm).This school board just made it perfectly fine for students to openly harm transgender individuals. Individuals who just need to use the restroom like everybody else. It s outrageous and should be illegal, but instead, it s openly condoned by even the highest office in the state. Chances are, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory would approve. Disgusting.Featured image via THV11",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Has A New Nickname For Bernie Sanders, But It Works Better On Him (TWEET)","With Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic Primary in West Virginia, it s left Donald Trump in quite a quandary. It seems as if he s a bully with no direction. Now he doesn t know if he should keep making up nicknames for Hillary Clinton, who is the Democratic frontrunner, or Bernie Sanders who is still putting up a mighty fight in the race.Although, it looks as though he s playing his cards very carefully, because he has still put in the time and effort to give Bernie his own nickname. You know, just in case he needs it for later.Trump took to Twitter in yet another sophomoric hissy fit after the West Virginia primary, and said: I don t want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come! I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2016So, it seems he s making sure to keep  Crazy Bernie  in his back pocket, all the while still hitting Hillary Clinton with the ever- genius   Crooked Hillary.  Although, it seems his voters are doing more to hurt Hillary than Bernie in West Virginia, with four out of ten voters who voted for Bernie saying they d vote for Trump over Clinton in the fall.Nonetheless, pretty much every nickname Trump s handed out to people have been nicknames better suited for himself: Tiny Marco, Lyin  Ted, Crooked Hillary, Goofy Elizabeth Warren, and now Crazy Bernie. Maybe he believes if he projects his insecurities onto others, people won t notice it about himself. Or is that too sound of a piece of logic?Trump truly seems to believe that he can bully himself into the White House and no one will notice that he s not at all qualified for the job of Commander-in-Chief. He needs to realize that foreign policy and diplomacy are a lot harder than getting a clothing line into Macy s.Featured Photos by Chip Somodevilla, Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jeff Daniels Returns As Will McAVoy To Blast Trump As Only His ‘Newsroom’ Character Can (VIDEO),"When The Newsroom was canceled almost at the height of its popularity, a hole was left in the world that none have yet filled. Will McAVoy, the lead character on the show, was fictional   but that didn t stop him from becoming one of the most popular  news  figures in the country. Clips from the show have repeatedly gone viral, with one video from the first episode of the show going viral repeatedly because of Jeff Daniels  character s blunt and honest statements about whether or not America is the  greatest country in the world. People are drawn to McAvoy because he represents something that is missing from American media: someone who is willing to tell the truth no matter what anyone else thinks about it. The world has missed Will McAVoy, but Daniels resurrected the character so that his beloved character could give his take on the 2016 election. While Trump is sure to respond by calling Daniels a  loser,  he tells it like it is. Bloomberg Television hosts Mark Halperin and John Heilemann ask  McAvoy  what makes Trump the  best-case scenario  for Hillary Clinton, but the fictional newscaster (drawing on the energy from the widely-shared  greatest country  segment) dropped a truth bomb   he s not: He s not the best-case scenario, John, that s my answer. Donald Trump is a fact-bending loose cannon who alienates mainstream voters with everything he says. But he gets constant media attention for free. There won t be a day from now until November when Trump isn t on every TV channel. Sure, she beats Trump in some categories: like millennials, who don t even show up to vote. She also leads in number of messages deleted on her personal email server,  McAvoy continues.  But that aside, when you ask what makes Trump the best-case scenario for Hillary, I don t know what the f*ck you re talking about. His tiny hands?

 Heidi Cruz: Ted’s Failed Campaign Is Just Like The Fight To End Slavery,"Being the wife of failed Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is no easy task, but Heidi Cruz has just proven that she s a nut job in her own right. Either that, or Ted damaged a few brain cells when he elbowed her in the face after suspending his campaign.Although Ted s disaster of a campaign ended a week ago, Heidi s not ready to give up just yet   and why would she, considering that Cruz s family spent months claiming God wanted him to run for president, and he failed?! To try to save face, Heidi portrayed her husband s failure as just one part of a longer, bigger journey   you know, just like the fight to end slavery! During a conference call with the Cruz campaign s National Prayer Team, Heidi made this baffling comparison between her husband s campaign and the abolition of slavery when she said: I don t want you to feel like any of this was in vain. I believe in the power of prayer. This doesn t always happen on the timing of man, and God does not work in four-year segments. Be full of faith and so full of joy that this team was chosen to fight a long battle. Think that slavery   it took 25 years to defeat slavery. That is a lot longer than four years. Heidi also spoke on Ted s decision to end his campaign after Trump crushed him in the Indiana primary   a win that marked Trump as the GOP s presumptive nominee. Heidi said: I want to assure all of you that this was not a race we gave up. This was a race that no longer had a viable path to victory, and it would ve been very demoralizing for you all and the troops to go through nine states of losses. We left on a high note. We left when there was no possible way that we were going to win. Mrs. Cruz also repeatedly said that this (failed) campaign was  just the beginning  for Ted   although it s unclear what that actually means. Completely forgetting that Cruz is one of the most hated Republicans by fellow Republicans and many of his conservative colleagues wanted NOTHING to do with him, she said: We have changed the Republican Party. This is no longer about the establishment and the old way of doing things versus the Constitution. This party is now being deceived, but the old battles are behind us, the new ones are before us. It was our first national race, but we have changed the Republican Party by Ted being in the Senate and Ted running this race. Heidi tried to assure callers that her husband was planning an  enormous agenda  for when he got back to the Senate. We are not only keeping this band together, we have been having meetings five hours a day since the time we dropped out. Every single person in our leadership team in our campaign, Ted and I will probably be working with on a weekly basis in the next four years. The failed candidate himself joined the call later, expressing his disappointment that he was out of the presidential race but urged his fans to continue supporting him.Ted and Heidi are in for a rude awakening   just like the outcome of his presidential campaign has proven, Ted is too unlikeable to gain a significant following and support for his ideas. It doesn t matter that God wanted him to be the president   America s voters clearly don t. And certainly, comparing a presidential campaign to an emancipation movement probably isn t winning over anyone.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Senator Elizabeth Warren Laughs At Trump’s Pathetic Attempt To Insult Her,"Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren continued to throw haymakers at Donald Trump on Wednesday.In response to her relentless slams against him on Twitter, the only counter punch Trump could muster was to refer to Warren as  goofy. I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate,  Trump tweeted.  I will defeat them both. He also demanded to see proof of her Native American heritage. Let s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren s records to see if she is Native American,  he wrote.  I say she s a fraud! And he used  goofy  a third time in yet another tweet. Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie,  he continued.  She is not Native American. That little Twitter-tantrum came three days after Warren called out the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday.Trump literally waited until Friday to respond and Warren noticed. I called out @realDonaldTrump on Tuesday. 45 million saw it. He s so confident about his  counter punch  he waited until Friday night. Lame. I called out @realDonaldTrump on Tuesday. 45 million saw it. He s so confident about his  counter punch  he waited until Friday night. Lame.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016Warren absolutely buried Trump on Twitter and she continued piling it on during an interview with Policy Mic on Wednesday when she was asked about Trump calling her  goofy. Really? That s the best you could come up with?  Warren quipped.  I thought Donald Trump said he was a guy who was good with words. She then went on to describe what the economy would be like under a Trump presidency. I think it will be more of a government that works for a thin slice at the top, and a government that leaves everyone else behind. And the problem with that is it s not just government. Government becomes the tool then to have the economy work that way. So increasingly we live in a world where the economy works for a narrower and narrower slice of America. Here s the video via YouTube.Warren is right to laugh at Trump. After all, he s the biggest joke in American politics right now. But, he s also dangerous as Warren pointed out. And not just to the economy. Trump has no foreign policy experience and has indicated that he would use the military and torture rather than diplomacy to achieve American goals overseas.Furthermore, Trump is also a threat to civil rights and a free press and brings no real substantive ideas to the table. He is nothing more than hateful warmonger who would create an economy to help himself and his wealthy friends at the expense of the rest of us.That s why we need people like Elizabeth Warren in the Senate and on the presidential ticket to offer Americans a real choice.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NRA Board Member Ted Nugent Just Encouraged His Violent Fans To Shoot Hillary Clinton (VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS),"Stochastic terrorism is a term that means to use mass communications like Facebook to incite a seemingly random person to do violence against someone or something. For instance, leading up to Robert Dear s bloody assault on a Planned Parenthood facility, the Right   spurred on by David Daleiden s fraudulent and heavily-edited  baby parts  videos   conservatives regularly informed their mindless followers that the women s health organization kills babies and sells them in pieces for profit. All across the Right, including from presidential candidates, a single message resounded across the Stupid Part of America: someone somewhere needs to do something about this. Someone needs to be a hero.And someone stepped up. Robert Dear killed multiple people in his quest to unilaterally stop Planned Parenthood s evil acts. The system, for our frenemies on the Right, worked.In what can only be viewed as an attempt to incite violence against Clinton, Nugent posted a video to Facebook that depicts 2016 hopeful Bernie Sanders shooting Clinton during a debate. The photo was captioned,  I got your guncontrol right here bitch! The graphic video shows blood spouting from Clinton s chest after Sanders  shoots  her   a very pleasing sight for Nugent s immensely stupid and bloodthirsty followers.          It is obvious through a perfunctory glance that these people would love to see Clinton dead. Sanders too, though many made it clear that he would  earn their vote  by actually shooting Clinton, even if he is a dirty Communist bastard (they don t know what Communist means). Obviously, no one has taken a shot at Clinton yet, but the more right-wing figures encourage such a thing, the higher the chance that someone, somewhere is going to take them up on their suggestion.After all, as Robert Lewis Dear demonstrated, it only takes one crazy person listening to the violent rhetoric who decides that he wants to make a difference.Ted Nugent once adopted a 17-year-old girl so he could have sex with her without difficulty, intentionally sh*t his pants to get out of going to war, and has made numerous racist remarks about Barack Obama and other notable African-American figures. This has no relevance to the situation at hand, but we thought it important to note whose opinion these people consider important.Watch the disgusting video below:Featured image via Getty Images/David Livingston (modified) ",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Nancy Pelosi Blasts Republicans For Hypocritically ‘Denouncing’ Trump,"There s an old saying: pot, meet kettle. Republicans have become renowned for their absolute hypocrisy in recent years, especially their vile, hateful rhetoric towards anyone who isn t a white, straight Christian. But now that Donald Trump is the party s de facto leader and presidential frontrunner, Republicans all across the country are now distancing themselves from him and his hateful remarks.But Nancy Pelosi is not letting Republicans get away with their pathetic  softer image  shtick. Saying there isn t a  dime worth of difference  between Trump and the other Republicans, Pelosi blasted the GOP leadership for stoking racial demagoguery: Some Republicans, including members of their leadership, have said they cannot support the vile rhetoric and radical proposals of the Republican front-runner. Today, we have gathered to ask, since when? Since when have the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant statements and discriminatory ideas? She then added,  Year after year, Republicans have enthusiastically turned their intolerance and their discrimination into legislation.  Pelosi then lambasted the GOP for their constant attacks on women s reproductive health, which has become synonymous with Trump s call to  punish  women who get abortions.Along with Reps. Jim Clyburn and Xavier Beccara, both Democrats, the minority leadership went all in on the GOP, and rightfully so.Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer echoed the Minority Leader s words, saying: The Republicans have created an environment in radicalism, fear and exclusion. The presumptive nominee is the result of their work, and what they have sowed is what they are reaping. Pelosi and Hoyer, as usual, are on the money.While Republicans are working overtime trying to soften Trump s vile image, the Democrats are doing their job of reminding the American people that there really is no difference between the new leader of the GOP and those in current power.With Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi revving up their attacks on the GOP frontrunner (and indeed the whole party), 2016 may be the year of women in politics.And if that s the case, Donald Trump and Senate Republicans should be very afraid.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 It’s Happening: Trump Says Rudy Giuliani Will Head ‘Commission’ To Figure Out How To Ban Muslims,"As the creeping realization that Donald J. Trump is, in fact, the Republican nominee slowly dawns on conservatives, there has been a new push to re-frame the candidate as more  presidential  and more  serious  than people had originally thought. This requires a level of mental gymnastics that would qualify for the Olympics. While Trump s backers   and some in the media   continue to insist Trump is  shifting  towards maturity, he keeps emphatically insisting that he really is the racist, xenophobic blowhard he originally postured himself as.Consider this: Just one day after the newly elected mayor of London publicly humiliated Trump over his abhorrent plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Trump was on increasingly pro-Trump Fox News to announce his latest Big Plan for when he s president: A tribunal run by Rudy Giuliani with the sole purpose of working out what to do about the Muslim  problem. We have a president that won t even use the term  radical Islamic terrorism.  He won t use the term. He refuses to say the term, even after Paris where 130 people were killed or San Bernardino or any other place. It s a real problem. So we ll figure it out, and we will get it going. But we have to be extremely careful. In fact, I m thinking about setting up a commission perhaps headed by Rudy Giuliani to take a very serious look at this problem. But this is a worldwide problem, and we have to be smart.Giuliani, famous for his handling of New York City s response after 9/11, has spent the last decade and a half growing increasingly fanatical. In recent years it s not uncommon to see him on Fox News complaining about black people and Muslims in ways that sometimes even make the conservative hosts blush.Giuliani is now Trump s go to guy on Islamophobia. When the candidate spuriously claimed that  thousands  of Muslim Americans were cheering on 9/11, Giuliani quickly rushed onto CNN to describe, in vivid detail, one such example. We had one situation in which a candy store owned by a Muslim family was celebrating that day, right near a housing development. And the kids in the housing development came in and beat them up.And, I think both facts were corroborated to be true. Because they were celebrating that the towers were coming down, some of the kids got really upset about it and they came in and did a pretty good job of beating them up. Except those  facts  were not true. What Giuliani was referring to turned out to be an anti-Muslim hate crime. Here s what really happened that day:Yesterday I saw first-hand how anger over the World Trade Center attack turns on Muslims who call New York home. At 4:30 p.m. on 116th St., five black teenagers stopped in front of the American Muslim Community of East Harlem site   a closet-sized candy store with a make-shift mosque in a back room. Tiny store owner Muhammad Chaudhry stood in the doorway. One of the teenage boys asked him,  Do you feel sorry for America? The kid then gave Chaudhry a knock-out punch in the face that sent him reeling backwards and onto the floor.This man, whose hatred for Muslims made him misremember a hate crime to fit his warped view, will now be tasked with solving Trump s fabricated Muslim  problem.  That is a very scary thought.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Gene Simmons Just Said Something Truly Horrible About Prince,"When iconic musical artist Prince died last month, the music world and anyone who cares about music suffered an unspeakable loss. Well, most of the music world. Kiss frontman Gene Simmons had some choice words on Prince s death, and they really only point to what a despicable human being Simmons is. Bowie was the most tragic of all because it was real sickness. All the other ones were a choice,  Simmons said.  Drugs killed [Prince]. What do you think, he died from a cold? I think Prince was heads, hands and feet above all the rest of them. I thought he left [Michael] Jackson in the dust. Prince was way beyond that. But how pathetic that he killed himself. Don t kid yourself, that s what he did. Slowly, I ll grant you   but that s what drugs and alcohol is: a slow death. Source: Consequence of Soundattends Relativity Media s  Movie 43  Los Angeles Premiere held at the TCL Chinese Theatre on January 23, 2013 in Hollywood, California.Before we tear apart Simmons, let s dissect his comments. As Lorraine Berry of Raw Story noted, Prince did not die from drugs (the coroner s report has not yet come in   the cause of death is still speculative), he died of chronic pain, which is epidemic in itself. Prince had had double hip surgery. Nearly everyone takes pain pills after major surgery like that. It s the job of his doctor to monitor the pain and the drug use.As for drugs being a slow death, yes, they are, but so is eating too much, drinking too much, and sometimes, even exercising too much. Everyone dies and many people, if not most people, had done things in the past that might have led to their deaths, so let s stop stigmatizing people who mistreat their bodies in what s considered the wrong way. Besides, addiction is a disease. Blaming the addict for becoming addicted to a drug his doctor told him to take is like blaming a dog when its owner doesn t teach him how to act.As for Simmons, well, he s a Trump supporter. He loves that Trump says obnoxious things and that people don t care. He doesn t want your money. This guy funds his own campaign, and he is going to say things that tens of millions of people actually say quietly because politically it s  incorrect. Source: BreitbartHe claimed to have voted for Obama in 2008 (trolls say that also), but he is now ashamed. In 2012, he backed Romney. He also voted for George W. Bush, who tried to slowly kill our country.This was not the first time Simmons opined about drugs and even about depression. I don t get along with anybody who s a drug addict and has a dark cloud over their head and sees themselves as a victim,  Simmons said.  Drug addicts and alcoholics are always:  The world is a harsh place.  My mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. I don t want to hear f k all about  the world as a harsh place.  She gets up every day, smells the roses and loves life. And for a putz, 20-year-old kid to say,  I m depressed, I live in Seattle.  F k you, then kill yourself. He added:  I never understand, because I always call them on their bluff. I m the guy who says  Jump!  when there s a guy on top of a building who says,  That s it, I can t take it anymore, I m going to jump.  Are you kidding? Why are you announcing it? Shut the f k up, have some dignity and jump! You ve got the crowd. Source: Radio.comYep, he s an ass.Featured image of Prince by John Sciulli with Getty Images.

 AZ Man Tries To Be A ‘Hero’ By Shooting At Shoplifters (VIDEO),"An Arizona gun nut has been charged with  multiple crimes after he decided to shoot at two men who shoplifted some stuff from a Chandler, Arizona Walgreens location in March.According to John Haag, 25, he was at Walgreens when he saw two men running from the store. Haag asked the store employees if they d been robbed and they told him yes, so he decided to take the law into his own hands. Instead of calling the police like an intelligent human being, Haag got into his car and chased the suspected robbers. ABC15 news obtained a video that shows Haag pulling up to the U-Haul the men were driving and firing his gun at the vehicle. After shooting at the suspects, he drove away.According to officials, the people who Haag shot at weren t robbery suspects at all. Instead all they had done was shoplifted from the store. Police said that this crime would not justify the level of force  used by a man who said he wanted to  be a hero. Cops were able to find the idiot after he posted  just witnessed a robbery at Walgreens again, this time, I had my gun true story  on Facebook.Speaking to ABC15, Haag said: I feel I had good intentions. I meant the best. I meant to disable the vehicle. First of all, he completely missed the vehicle that he was firing at   clearly he should not be shooting a weapon when his aim is that bad. Secondly, he discharged the firearm in the middle of traffic and that bullet could have ricocheted and killed someone. Haag went on to say that he thinks more people should try to be heroes: Most people are scared. Tons of people nowadays are in fear of what will happen to them and that s not cool. That s why we have more crime. He s right, I do fear what will happen to me, my family and my friends, but not because of shoplifters. I am way more concerned that I or someone I love is going to be killed by a dumbass like him who thinks it s okay to fire a gun in traffic. I worry that my son is going to be Second Amendmented to death by gun nuts. I worry about things like that because it is obvious that we have millions of gun owners in this country and many of them do not have the common sense given to a squirrel.Haag has been charged with aggravated assault, unlawful discharge of a firearm and drive-by shooting. Hopefully a judge rules that he can never own a gun again.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ann Coulter: Trump Doesn’t Need GOP’s Support – ‘He IS The Party’ (VIDEO),"Conservative columnist Ann Coulter took her vomit-inducing support of Donald Trump onto MSNBC yesterday to argue that the presumptive Republican nominee shouldn t even bother trying to convince prominent GOPers like House Speaker Paul Ryan to support him. She said it was a complete waste of the business mogul s time because he pretty much owns the GOP and represents the  heart and soul  of the Republican party now.As the discussion about Trump s Thursday meeting with Ryan was being discussed, host Chris Matthews wondered what might actually convince Ryan to support a presidential candidate that he was clearly having reservations about   and who could blame him?! Coulter shrugged this off and laughed, asserting her opinion that Trump was only having this meeting with Ryan out of the goodness of his heart. Coulter told Matthews: It shows that Trump is being unbelievably gracious. He doesn t need to have this meeting [with Paul Ryan]. He is the party. He is the heart and soul of the party. Pointing out just how incredibly  gracious  this stunt by Trump is, she told Matthews that he could have just said,  hope he comes aboard, we re gonna have a lot of fun, but if he doesn t, oh well  after Ryan withheld his endorsement.To make Coulter s appearance on the show even more outrageous, she made sure to promote her new book, In Trump We Trust. She said that in the future, she hoped that Trump wouldn t waste any more of his precious time convincing the GOP to back him. The people are with him, and there s no point in meeting with all these generals without armies. According to Ryan, his meeting with Trump will be centered around  how to unify the Republican Party.  Ryan said: It s been a bitter and divisive primary. It s going to take more than one week just to repair and unify this party. Apparently, Trump thinks he s got this one in the bag.TwitterFeatured image is a screenshot",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Anti-Trumpers Have A Hail Mary Idea To Stop Trump That Just Might Work,"As Donald Trump makes the downhill run to Cleveland this July, those loyal to the Republican party who see it as a viable political entity for the next century rather than the cesspool of racism, hypocrisy and hate run by the wealthy that it is are trying desperately to save their beloved sham. America is divided. Politically we are either in favor of progress and societal evolution or we re with the rich guys who couldn t care less, but all life matters and poor people are stealing your paycheck.It really is that simple. You don t hear about plans to save and revive the Democratic party; our numbers grow as people learn to read and use Google. How many times can a person with any intelligence land back on a  pants on fire  designation for yet another conservative  news  crock of sh*t before they figure out the GOP is a scam?? Anyway, those people who are tried and true Republicans who know that Donald Trump is about to be the laughing-stock of the nation when actual debate issues come up and the Republican party will pay dearly.As he alienates more and more groups of people, trying desperately to get elected exclusively by angry white males, the establishment Republicans charged with seeing their party into the future can t endorse it. Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse are kicking around the idea of a third-party run, not by them of course, but the inevitable result of splitting the conservative vote is a Clinton win. It looks like the inevitable result of a straight Trump versus Clinton matchup ends with a Clinton win as well, so those still interested in seeing anyone but Donald Trump represent the Republican party in November are beginning to think of longshot last plays. The #NeverTrump movement has come up with one, and if properly put into place, it could change electoral history.In order for someone to win the White House, they must receive 270 electoral votes. Democrats have a distinct lead in electoral votes before polling begins, so the GOP always faces an uphill battle to begin with. If you want to see a third-party candidate in the White House you don t have to run one in the election, you just have to make sure neither of the candidates from the major party gets to 270. What happens then? According to the Constitution, the House of Representatives will then appoint Paul Ryan or Mittens or Jeb Bush or whoever else they feel works best for their political agenda, by a simple majority vote.So how do you keep the candidates from getting enough electoral votes? The idea from #NeverTrump is simple enough in theory: Run an influential person in each state and only in that state. Take enough electoral votes that way and nobody gets to 270. Think about it What if enough people in Florida decided that they would vote for Jeb Bush because neither of the major party candidates appealed to them. They know Jeb; they trust him. If he s on the ticket there s a darned good reason. In 2000 that by itself would have sent the presidential election to a vote, not restricted to the candidates on the ballot, in the congressional lower chamber. If that happens this year, Speaker Ryan will get to appoint his first president.The #NeverTrump movement is more than likely futile because in the end the Republicans are gonna batten down the hatches and ride the Trump wave all the way to historical comedy.Featured image by Matt Mills McKnight/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Bribed An Author To Hide These Facts About How Cruelly He Divorced One Of His Wives,"In 2005, Robert Slater wrote a book called No Such Thing as Over-Exposure: Inside the Life and Celebrity of Donald Trump. It was a biography but eventually it turned out to be an example of how Trump resorts to bribery to rewrite his own public history.Donald being Donald, his own ego demanded he get involved personally in the book s creation once he was made aware of it. He had to ensure that it was nothing but a positive story about him.Slater described what happened when Trump saw the book: He asked me to take out an anecdote that he had told me on the plane flying to Chicago about how he had informed his second wife that he was going to divorce her by announcing it first to the New York Post. Greatest anecdote anybody has ever told me. He put the newspaper down in front of her door that said,  Donald is Divorcing Marla.  That s how she learned about the divorce.Donald was not even enough of a man to tell his own wife that he wanted a divorce. He was such a coward and bully that he announced it to a tabloid trash  newspaper,  while publicly shaming her for literally the entire world to see. How the hell will he ever deal with Vladimir Putin if he can t deal with talking to his own wife?Then there s that bit about the bribe: Trump promised Slater that if he liked the book he would buy a huge number of them. This is how Trump operates. He s so ashamed of his past that he offers money in order to whitewash his own history.Slater said that his publisher saw nothing but dollar signs, so despite his inclination at first towards integrity and truth, they gave in and whitewashed the biography of those facts to ensure a big payday directly from Trump s wallet.At the end of the day, Trump is the longest term case study for  affluenza.  He was born a rich a-hole who just spent years growing bigger. Given his celebrity, he literally globally shamed his wife at the time, then used money to avoid some of the consequences of his actions.Featured image via Getty",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Top Trump Aide Admits He Sees The Presidency As ‘The Ultimate Reality Show’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a reality television star and we ve heard from numerous people, including President Obama himself, that this is not a reality show like he thinks. Jeb Bush repeatedly hammered Trump for not being a serious candidate. Enter his top strategist, Paul Manafort, who spoke to Chris Matthews on MSBNC Tuesday night, where he directly reinforced the serious joke that is Donald Trump and his campaign.Manafort and Matthews were discussing just how exciting the GOP convention will be. Manafort insisted that, since Trump is already a TV star, he understands the media, and he can make the convention and everything else very entertaining. It s just absolutely, fantastically frightening that we have a candidate with a strategist who thinks this is all just entertainment.The kicker in this interview came when Matthews and Manafort got into this exchange:MATTHEWS:  You re going to have to break some eggs, though, right? MANAFORT:  I don t think we have to break any eggs. MATTHEWS:  Reince Priebus is going to give us an exciting convention? Come on! MANFORT:  Donald Trump is going to give you an exciting convention. MATTHEWS:  Okay, how? Do you have some movies or- MANAFORT:  We re going to have a program put together, it s not put together yet- MATTHEWS:  A reality show of some kind? MANAFORT:  Well, this is the ultimate reality show, the presidency of the United States. This made us facepalm our eyeballs into the backs of our heads. Watch the whole bizarre exchange below:So there it is. Manafort himself admitted that the Presidency of the United States is, in his view and probably Trump s view, a reality show. That is the most incredible, and unbelievable, position a candidate can take. A Trump presidency will literally make us the world s biggest punchline, whatever Trump himself thinks.Featured image via screen capture from MSNBC video",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Is Proof That Donald Trump May Be The WORST Money Manager In The Campaign (VIDEO),"While there have been what seems like dozens of Republican debates, one stands on its own as the one Trump didn t attend. That debate happened in January, and in lieu of attending, Trump held a rally that was supposed to raise money for veterans. Unfortunately, though, half the $6 million raised never got to the veterans and no one knows where it is.The Trump campaign said the event raised $6 million for different veterans groups, with Trump himself contributing $1 million, but details released by the campaign Thursday show only about half of that money has been dispersed so far.The campaign did not provide specifics earlier this week, but after a CNN report aired Thursday morning questioning the contributions, a spokeswoman shared a list in the afternoon showing 27 veterans organizations that have received a total of $2.9 million to date.The campaign promised that it was no big deal and that the veterans would get the money as soon as they figured it out. Well, several months have passed, and the missing $3 million is still missing. All they have now is deflection. If the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our veterans have been so mistreated, rather than trying to disparage Mr. Trump s generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation, we would all be better for it,  (campaign spokeswoman Hope) Hicks said Thursday.When asked about the money by CNN s Chris Cuomo, the network s Drew Griffin said:We found the same thing that you found Chris, a lot of promises and not a lot of answers and it just shouldn t be that hard, number one in the big scheme of things it s just not that much money and the accounting is not that difficult to do.Here s a video from CNN:Some experts say that this isn t that unusual, that it often takes a few months before large donations make it to their destination, but others say that the veterans organizations should have been paid by now. The bigger question, though, is where the hell is the money?Whether this is an innocent mistake or something much worse, it doesn t bode well for the Trump campaign, but few are covering this. Trump is a terrible money manager. He has filed bankruptcy a whopping four times and he promised to do the same with the United States. Of course, even if every one of Trump s supporters were to read this, they wouldn t care. Hell, he could steal money right out of veterans  hands, and they wouldn t care. It s just like Obama Derangement Syndrome (and Clinton Derangement Syndrome), only the exact opposite.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SC Man Uses ‘Stand Your Ground’ Law As Reason For Bail After He ‘Slow Cooked’ Murder Victims,"Stand your ground laws are reasons for legalized murder, literally, and here South Carolina has given you proof. This is no murky case a la Michael Brown or Trayvon Martin (though, to sane people, those weren t murky, either). But no   one 39-year-old James Edward Loftis of Goose Creek, South Carolina, is using the state s  Stand Your Ground  law to literally get away with cold blooded, pre-meditated murder. It looks like it could work, too.Reports say that Loftis had called a cab to take him home from a strip club, but failed to pay the fare. That s when all hell broke loose. The cab driver, 46-year-old Guma Oz Dubar, along with his friend who was present at the time, 32-year-old Cody Newland, insisted that Loftis make good on the money they owed him for the cab ride. Loftis has provided many different details regarding what transpired next, but his story is the only ones the police have, as Newland and Dubar are dead, by Loftis  hand. The only thing the defendant will confess to is shooting both victims before burning their bodies in graves he dug in his own yard to hide his crimes.Deputy Solicitor Bryan Alfaro said of Loftis s actions: They were essentially just slow-cooked inside the grave site. After that, Loftis s attorney decided to use the state s so-called  stand your ground  law to try to get the defendant off. The law says you can kill people invading your property. However, these people were not invading. They had picked this dude s drunk ass up from a strip club, and he didn t want to pay for the ride home. Doesn t sound like much of an  invasion  to me. This defense, however, got the judge to decide that Loftis is not a flight risk, and, despite his cold-blooded commission of a double murder, Loftis is now out on $250,ooo bail.Loftis s lawyer, Stephen Harris, continues his ludicrous defense, saying: He s a human being. He freaked out and thought he was going to prison, so he tried to hide the bodies. Nobody knows how you re going to react when you kill two people.Well, Mr. Harris, most folks would just pay the cab fare and go in, instead of stiffing the driver and then killing him and his friend. But I suppose that is irrelevant to you and your client, right? Two innocent people are dead over this insanity, and you re going to use South Carolina s insane gun laws to get your client off when he should clearly rot in prison for the rest of his life.I wish there were a Hell so you and Mr. Loftis could burn there. Condolences to the families of the victims your client murdered.Featured image via mugshot/screen capture via Raw Story",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Added A White Nationalist To His Official Convention Team,"Donald Trump s presidential campaign has enlisted an avowed white nationalist racist in order to be a delegate at the Republican Party convention in Cleveland, Ohio this summer. The announcement comes as Trump has begun holding meetings to integrate his presidential campaign with the national Republican Party.William Johnson s connection to white nationalism is not incidental to his political activism. It is central to it.On Monday evening, California s secretary of state published a list of delegates chosen by the Trump campaign for the upcoming Republican presidential primary in the state. Trump s slate includes William Johnson, one of the country s most prominent white nationalists.[ ]Johnson leads the American Freedom Party, a group that  exists to represent the political interests of White Americans  and aims to preserve  the customs and heritage of the European American people.  The AFP has never elected a candidate of its own and possesses at most a few thousand members, but it is  arguably the most important white nationalist group in the country,  according to Mark Potok, a senior fellow for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups.In an interview with Mother Jones magazine, Johnson said,  I can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of Donald Trump and be a good example to everybody. This is not Johnson s first work in service of the Trump campaign. He was the money behind white power robocalls promoting Trump in seven states.Trump has based his campaign on blatant racist appeals to white, conservative-leaning voters, in the hopes that they power him to victory. His campaign and party chairman Reince Priebus have indicated that they hope to appeal to rust belt voters who have gone Democratic in the last few elections in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio.The risk of that strategy is that it also motivates key elements of the coalition that elected President Barack Obama twice   women, Latinos, and blacks   as well as moderate and liberal white voters.Enlisting the aid of white nationalists may provide some form of temporary boost to Trump, but it is likely to be an albatross that can be hung around his neck in the fall election by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Back In 2006 Trump DEFENDED Hillary On Her Iraq Vote Knowing She Was Lied To,"One of the biggest talking points being used by the Donald Trump campaign against Hillary Clinton is that she voted for the Iraq War. Which, technically she did. She approved of the authorization to use force if necessary after an inspection and investigation into the use of weapons of mass destruction, an investigation that was manipulated to get us into war, but then later found no such weapons.According to CNN, the Center for Public Integrity and its affiliated group, the Fund for Independence in Journalism, reported: The Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19, 2003. Let s recall exactly what Clinton said back in 2002 in regards to the vote: Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first   I take the president at his word that he will try hard to pass a United Nations resolution and seek to avoid war, if possible. Because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the United Nations more likely and war less likely and because a good faith effort by the United States, even if it fails, will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause I have concluded, after careful and serious consideration, that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation. If we were to defeat this resolution or pass it with only a few Democrats, I am concerned that those who want to pretend this problem will go away with delay will oppose any United Nations resolution calling for unrestricted inspections. Adding: This is a difficult vote. This is probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make. Any vote that may lead to war should be hard, but I cast it with conviction.   My vote is not, however, a vote for any new doctrine of preemption or for unilateralism or for the arrogance of American power or purpose.Arguing, that her vote: Is not a vote to rush to war; it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our president. And we say to him: Use these powers wisely and as a last resort. Her position was clear, and back in 2006, Trump knew that Hillary s vote to authorize force was  horrendous,  but told New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd: Don t forget that decision was based on lies given to her. Adding: She s very smart and has a major chance to be our next president. When one makes a decision based upon lies, one must still be held accountable, but others must remember that lies were told. Back in 2006, Trump seemed to understand that while, yes, her vote wasn t ideal, she made the decision based upon information given to her at the time and she made clear war was to be used as a last resort after all diplomatic means were exhausted.For Trump to now use this against her is either willful ignorance or pure political pandering. He s a man with no policy experience and knows Hillary will be able to crush him at any debate and is far more qualified than he could ever dream of being, so he s grasping at popular mudslinging straws that he sees others use, because they work. Yet, facts will prevail, and the internet will uncover his opinions from the past. He s got nothing on Hillary, and he knows it.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" NRA Tried To Attack Hillary, Accidentally Proves We Need Better Background Checks (VIDEO)","The National Rifle Association recently made a pathetic attempt to attack Hillary Clinton   and it backfired horribly.The NRA thought it had released a clever video bashing Clinton s record of approving arms exports when she served as Secretary of State, but instead they validated what gun control advocates have been asking for all along: better background checks.In the video, Conservative host Dana Loesch accuses Clinton of letting the decision about whether or not to export arms to foreign nations be based on what countries had made donations to the Clinton Foundation. These were, of course, false accusations   but the NRA still tried to shame Clinton for something she didn t do. In actuality, the U.S. has the highest standards in the world for deciding whether to approve gun sales to foreign nations. But the NRA was apparently so focused on bashing the Democratic front runner, that the right-wing organization completely missed the fact that they d made a great case for background checks when Loesch said:Brilliant. The video also makes another important point   that countries approved for export permits are at least investigated to ensure that countries receiving guns from the United States will be using them  to promote our national security interests and foreign policy objectives.  But in America, that s a different story. Guns are not only available to our military, but to nearly anyone who can clear just a few legal/safety requirements.And it gets better. Loesch continued to spew nonsense, once again unintentionally making a case for women in other countries and completely ignoring the fact that America has a huge issue with guns and domestic violence: When Hillary Clinton isn t trying to disarm women and prevent us from the equal opportunity exercise of our pro-choice right to self-defense, she is approving billion-dollar arms sales to countries with horrendous human rights records. Countries where women have little to no rights, countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and others. According to gun reform group Everytown Research, domestic violence and gun deaths are very closely linked, but the NRA is choosing to be ignorant. Domestic violence in America is to a significant degree a problem of gun violence. Over the past 25 years, more intimate partner homicides in the U.S. have been committed with guns than with all other weapons combined. And people with a history of committing domestic violence are five times more likely to subsequently murder an intimate partner when a firearm is in the house. This attack ad implies that women in other countries could and should be kept safe with strong background checks and rigid gun ownership laws. And by making no mention of protecting American women in the same way, the NRA s video suggests that women in this country should suffer the consequences that come with more relaxed gun laws. We could make the argument that in America, we need gun control the most   the United States leads other developed countries  in gun violence by a landslide.Clinton, on the other hand, is passionate about reducing gun violence   so while the NRA tried to soil Clinton s record, they instead revealed a huge hypocrisy in their own argument.

 Mexico’s Former President UNLOADS On Trump With A Brutal ‘F*ck You’ To The ‘Hated Gringo’ (IMAGE),"Donald Trump has p*ssed off so many people, it s really hard to keep track (unless you re The Donald himself, in which case you ll never let it go). One person he s irritated arguably more than others is Mexico s former president, Vicente Fox,  who has being railing against Trump since the very day the disgraced presumptive GOP nominee made his horrifically offensive  rapist  and  drug dealer  comments about Mexican immigrants.Fox reminded everyone that he still hates Trump with a passion, and has even come up with some creative nicknames for the business mogul. In an interview on the Kickass Politics podcast, Fox told host Ben Mathis: He is the ugly American. He is the hated gringo because he s attacking all of us. He s offending all of us. Fox also reaffirmed the fact that Mexico would have nothing to do with Trump s idiotic proposed border wall. Restating his opposition to Trump s wall just as strongly as he did the first time, Fox said: I m not going to pay for that f*cking wall. And please don t take out the  f*cking  full word. Here s the Facebook post with Fox and Mathis, sending a brilliant message to Trump for all of us:During the interview, Fox also had some other amazing choice words for Trump   such as  crazy  and  false prophet.  He also compared Trump to Latin American demagogues who  destroy economies  and warned that Trump s proposals could start another war.While many of Trump s opponents have eventually cozied up to the candidate (cough cough Ben Carson) and learned to be somewhat civil with him, Fox is making no apologies and wants to make sure that everyone knows where he stands when it comes to the reality TV star.It s clear that Trump has f*cked with the wrong guy   and Fox wants to make sure that Trump knows it. Fox warned: Don t play around with us. We can jump walls. We can swim rivers. And we can defend ourselves.

 One Crucial Detail On Budweiser’s New ‘Patriotic’ Beer Cans Will Really P*ss Conservatives Off,"The country woke up to confusion today as Budweiser beer company abruptly announced that  America s No. 1 full-flavored lager  will be replacing its name with  America  on its cans and bottles until the election in November. Why? Who knows. But that s not all. The company will also pack in even more patriotism per can (PPC) by adding a potent mix of quotes from the Pledge of Allegiance and lyrics from  The Star Spangled Banner  and  America the Beautiful. If that seems like something conservatives would be all over, then they are about to be very disappointed. As Hemant Mehta over at the Friendly Atheist noticed, the cans have opted to replace  In God We Trust  with  E Pluribus Unum    the original, albeit unofficial, motto of the United States. Out of many, one.The Latin phrase, which was widely used from the country s inception, and has only recently taken a backseat to America s later  official  motto putting the country s faith in God, is a reminder that from America s outset, the founders put a lot of stock in the concept of national unity and strength in togetherness. The lesson: God is great and all, but a country full of varied and immensely multi-cultural backgrounds needs to unify around itself, not any particular god.For some, that may be some bitter beer to swallow. Given the nearly endless capacity for conservative Christians to get offended, this motto change will likely prompt a strong backlash from the people who brought you the  Starbucks red cup  boycott. Suddenly, a watery beer will become ground zero for the ever expanding  war on Christianity  that conservatives assure us is really, definitely, totally happening.Ironically, the fact that a beer can emblazoned with  America  on the front will now be heavily politicized along party lines and highly controversial kind of says it all, doesn t it? America, indeed.Featured image via Budweiser",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 An Increasingly Unhinged Bundy Family Begins Preparing For A THIRD Standoff,"Cliven Bundy and his unstable group of family and followers have been refreshingly quiet in recent months in the aftermath of their ill-conceived hijacking of an Oregon wildlife refuge and subsequent arrests. It s hard to  occupy  anything behind bars except, perhaps, a 6 10 slab of concrete. However, Cliven is already jonesing for yet another stand-off   and as his mental state deteriorates, the risk of danger grows.Bundy, currently jailed for his instigation of the previous armed standoff in 2014, has hooked up with crazed anti-Obama right-wing  lawyer  Larry Klayman, who has filed lawsuits against people ranging from Obama to Iran s Supreme Leader to, as the Southern Poverty Law Center points out,  his own mother.  The pair   which a judge ruled couldn t legally work together, but appear to be doing so anyway   have concocted a new lawsuit claiming Sen. Harry Reid and President Obama sent  federal storm-troopers  to attack what they referred to as a gathering of  peaceful cowboys. Peaceful. Cowboys.Other parts of the lawsuit include accusations that Reid wants to sell the land to the Chinese and that the judge in the case should recuse herself because she s Latino.But even more troubling than the frivolous lawsuit is the fact that the Bundy family has made no secret about wanting to kickstart yet another showdown with federal agents. The Bundy family is still illegally grazing their cattle on federal lands, and the Bureau of Land Management is getting pretty fed up with it. Environmental groups are also urging the BLM to act, because Bundy s cattle   often times half-starved and neglected   are destroying the wildlife in what was meant to be protected land.Angie Bundy, wife of the currently locked up Ryan, said her husband and his family being locked up is a conspiracy to make it easier to seize their land. In response, she said she and the family are prepared to face another standoff. She even sees a silver lining in the men being locked up. Putting women and children in danger, she reasoned, would encourage other  patriots  to join the cause. Just like last time, they plan on using children as shields. We re not afraid,  Angie added.  If you have a bunch of women and children standing out there and protesting, it ll probably get more people out. What started as an inane property dispute over one man s right to ignore the law and enrich himself at the expense of the American taxpayer has increasingly become a sad spiral into some of the most toxic right-wing conspiracy theories around. The heavily armed  patriots  that flock to Bundy s side whenever he feels like pointing some guns at federal agents have detached themselves from reality. They quite literally believe they are at war with the United States government, and that means the odds that they react violently has skyrocketed. A third standoff almost guarantees tragedy   and the Bundys are rushing headlong into it.Featured image via David Becker/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Well It Happened, Trump Gets Desperate And Goes Full BENGHAZI On Hillary (TWEET)","It would appear that Donald Trump knows his base of voters don t pay attention to facts and reality, so he s going to keep perpetuating myths and propaganda to anger these people into voting for him even though his claims hold no basis in reality. And in the world of politics and mudslinging, it doesn t much matter as long as your message sticks and you get votes. However, these lies will get debunked, and there s nothing to stop that either.It s become very clear at this point that the presumptive Republican nominee has switched into attack mode against Democratic front-funner Hillary Clinton. If he s not going after her for what her husband did, he s going after her for literally being a woman.Now, knowing how much many conservatives can t wrap their heads around the fact that the Obama administration, including then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, did no wrongdoing in regards to the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, he s going to keep pushing the issue anyway. Never mind the fact that there has been probe after probe after probe.Trump tweeted this out to stir the pot, yet again:Hillary has bad judgment! https://t.co/LhcIU6kmxs  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2016Which then leads you to this: Hillary has bad judgment!A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 10, 2016 at 10:25am PDTLet s be clear on this. There is a very strong likelihood that before all this happened, Trump thought Libya was a female body part, so he s clearly just using this as an attack plan and may not even understand all the details of the event in question. He s a bully though, and being a bully he s going to keep ripping at old scabs even though they re all dried up.When every poll shows Hillary Clinton wiping the floor with Trump among women, minorities and the youth vote, he s got to do something. He s desperate, and this is likely just one of many desperate moves to come out of the Trump campaign.Bringing up Benghazi again after Clinton has been cleared again and again and again. C mon now, Donald. That s just pathetic, and clearly a distraction tactic away from the fact that you are most certainly not prepared to be the leader of the free world.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Facebook Hits Back, Responds To Allegations They’re Hiding Conservative Opinions","There have recently been allegations claiming that Facebook is purposefully keeping conservative news and topics out of the  trending  news section of their website. However, Facebook has released this statement in response: We take allegations of bias very seriously. Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. Trending Topics shows you the popular topics and hashtags that are being talked about on Facebook. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another. These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics. According to an article put out by Gizmodo, it was claimed that  news curators  for Facebook would purposefully pick and choose which topics should be put into trending. And while sure, depending on who is curating the news at any given moment their may be some underlying bias, it appears Facebook s algorithms do not allow such bias to rule the roost. In fact, according to Facebook s VP of search, Tom Stocky, it s  not feasible  and if guidelines are violated it is a  fireable offense. Here s the full statement by Stocky: My team is responsible for Trending Topics, and I want to address today s reports alleging that Facebook contractors manipulated Trending Topics to suppress stories of interest to conservatives. We take these reports extremely seriously, and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true.Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another. These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics.Trending Topics is designed to showcase the current conversation happening on Facebook. Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.We are proud that, in 2015, the US election was the most talked-about subject on Facebook, and we want to encourage that robust political discussion from all sides. We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically: reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources. Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we ve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible. At the same time, our reviewers  actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.There have been other anonymous allegations   for instance that we artificially forced  # BlackLivesMatter  to trend. We looked into that charge and found that it is untrue. We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so. Our guidelines do permit reviewers to take steps to make topics more coherent, such as combining related topics into a single event (such as  # starwars  and # maythefourthbewithyou ), to deliver a more integrated experience.Our review guidelines for Trending Topics are under constant review, and we will continue to look for improvements. We will also keep looking into any questions about Trending Topics to ensure that people are matched with the stories that are predicted to be the most interesting to them, and to be sure that our methods are as neutral and effective as possible. Many have been bringing up the fact that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a liberal, so he may purposefully promote liberal content and trending topics. Now, while the company claims this isn t true, what s to honestly keep them from doing this anyway. The irony in all of this is that conservatives are for freedom within a capitalist society and if a company were to operate in a way that they see fit, that is their freedom. They are not bound to not be biased except for their own rules they put in place. With that being said, Facebook is adamantly denying the claims that they are being biased, and maybe, just maybe, liberal opinions are the more popular opinions and thus trend more often.

 North Carolina Republicans Panic As Bathroom Law Makes Them Fear Their Political Doom,"North Carolina Republicans should have listened when they were told there would be a backlash if they passed HB2. Now they are learning the consequences of being bigots.As soon as the anti-LGBT bill was jammed through the state legislature and signed by Governor Pat McCrory, outrage ensued.Corporations such as Paypal and Deusche Bank cancelled projects that would have meant new jobs. Entertainers cancelled concerts that would have boosted local economies. Conventions were cancelled.HB2 has become the last straw for many North Carolina voters. Ever since Republicans took control of the state government for the first time since 1896, they have let the power go to their heads by passing every wet dream piece of legislation conservatives have ever wanted.In just the last six years, Republicans have used their power to turn a state that had been traditionally moderate into one of the reddest states in the nation. The list is incredibly embarrassing, but it includes looser gun laws, highly restrictive and insulting anti-abortion laws, attempts to turn North Carolina into a declared Christian state, a war on food stamps, voter suppression laws, education funding cuts, and tax cuts for the wealthy.Perhaps no other state has been transformed as much or as fast as North Carolina, but that s exactly what happened once Republicans gained control. And North Carolina has paid a heavy price. The progress it has made since the Civil War and Jim Crow is being erased as conservatives take the state backwards.But voters are now fed up, especially since they are now facing terrible repercussions from a single law that demonstrates once and for all that Republicans are not the  small government  advocates they claim to be. Along with being ridiculed for trying to be the bedroom police, Republicans are now being slammed for trying to be the bathroom police.It also doesn t help that they passed this law on a lie by claiming that it was needed to protect women and children from being sexually assaulted in bathrooms. As it turns out, the only men who have gone into a women s restroom were actually sent in there by a conservative  Christian  group as a stunt in order to scare people when, in fact, there have been zero real instances of transgender people doing anything but using the facilities. In 17 states and over 200 cities that have transgender protections, there hasn t been a single instance of a person using the protections as a shield to excuse preying on women and children in bathrooms, a fact that even Governor McCrory was forced to acknowledge during an interview with Fox host Chris Wallace on Sunday.And now North Carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding and perhaps more as tax dollars are spent by Republicans in their effort to defend their bigotry in court.All of this has put targets on the backs of every Republican in the state legislature and state Senate as well as Governor Pat McCrory. Voters are angry and if Republicans continue to defend HB2 they will be fired in November and replaced with lawmakers who are not insane bigots.Republicans are already beginning to panic over the prospect of losing power for another 120 years. The reality is that HB2 hurts,  GOP state Rep. Charles Jeter told Politico.  It doesn t matter that I m opposed to it or that I ve called for its repeal   because the mailer to voters [in my race] is going to say that I was a part of the Republican majority that passed the most discriminatory bill in the state. HB2 is going to have reverberations for our party no matter what we do, in November and probably beyond that. A Republican strategist surmised that the GOP could very well lose in November over the passage of HB2. The question that will be answered in November is whether the Republicans in the General Assembly overplayed their hand, after feeling empowered by impressive gains in the last three election cycles. Republicans could lose their veto-proof majority in one or both [legislative] chambers, with a cloud of uncertainty surrounding the governor s race. And one Republican even compared what could happen to Republicans in November to the devastating 2010 midterm election when conservatives successfully vilified Democrats over the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. It s like Obamacare with Obama, which so defined everything about Democrats who were in office when it passed in 2009. And you saw what happened to them in 2010. I think you always have concerns if perception boils down to one thing equaling another. In short, political doom is looming over the heads of Republicans across North Carolina and let s hope voters keep the GOP from having power for at least another 120 years. After all, it could take that long to fix what Republicans broke.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Gay Cyclist Shuts Down Hate Preacher With One Epic Comeback,"A street preacher in Glasgow, Ireland decided to dedicate at least part of one of his sermons to spreading fear and hatred towards LGBT people. He would have gotten away with it interrupted too, if not for the bravery of one cyclist who stopped to take a stand against the man s intolerance.The exchange was filmed by a passerby who posted the video online by a person named Emlyn Pearce. Pearce says that they found the man who stood up to the preacher and that his name is Ryan Vance and that he is a writer and designer. Though, Pearce writes that Vance shall forever more be more widely known as  Mystery-Gay-Cyclist-Hero-Man.  Pearce went on to write: I walk through Glasgow holding hands with my boyfriend all the time, and we have never experienced any homophobia. So to walk down the main shopping street and hear a man shouting that  the 99%  need to stand up to the  1%  who are gay was very sad and very scary.  Pearce continues, saying  Ryan Vance, as a gay man and a human being, I salute you: you made the world a better place. Thank you, sir   your pint awaits! Vance appears to be hesitant to adopt his new title. Don t worry Vance, if the title fits, rock it like no one else can, and be assured that it most certainly is befitting for a person like you.At what point do you think it's hubris to change my twitter description to ""mystery gay cyclist""?  Ryan Vance (@rjjvance) May 9, 2016In the video, you can here Vance tell the hate preacher I m gay, I m gay, so say that to me. The preacher responds saying  God still loves you. That s when drops the mic with a response that makes the entire street applaud for him. Vance turns to the man and says  I love me, I don t need a f*cking god to do it.

 Samantha Bee: N.C.’s ‘Numbnut’ Anti-Gay Law Is Due To Dems Not Voting (VIDEO),"We all know what an absolute shitstorm is happening with regards to LGBT rights in North Carolina right now. Everyone is focusing on the idiot Gov. Pat McCrory and his bullshit lawsuit against the Department of Justice over his anti-LGBT hate bill, HB2. However, there is another side to what brought this on, and Full Frontal host Samantha Bee is pointing it out. You see, when an election has high voter turnout, Democrats win. When it s a low turnout, we get imbeciles like Pat McCrory elected. Bee began her tirade: Boycotts are a powerful tool   but you know what is a more powerful tool? Not electing a bunch of transphobic numbnuts who are going to wreck the state economy to catch a nonexistent criminal. Bee is right, of course. Thanks to the homophobic and transphobic HB2, bunches of businesses and musicians have pulled out of North Carolina. Bee insists that what we are seeing right now is a direct result of Democrats not voting in the 2010 election. She continues, referencing times prior to that fateful election night: It was a blue-state dream. Democrats controlled the Governor s mansion and legislature, welfare checks grew on trees and there was an abortion in every pot. But all that changed on Election Night 2010. Bee then went on to show tape of references to the newly-GOP controlled North Carolina legislature slashing education funding and said, You know North Carolina s world-class public university? F*ck that place. Bee then goes on to remind everyone that it could be progressive college students who would vote these morons out, but there s just one problem with that: right-wingers have used their time in office to suppress the votes of college students by making laws that take polling places off campuses and deny students the right to use their student identification cards to vote: I bet UNC students can t wait to vote those right-wing boobs out of office. Well, sorry, those boobs are actually way ahead of you on that. The host then points out the fact that the GOP now controlled more states than they have since 1928, and as a result, their insane laws have swept the nation in more than just North Carolina. She goes on to say: After the 2010 landslide, policies started happening to states the way sex happens to people who drink with Bill Cosby. No wonder Democrats are so hung up on appointing the next Supreme Court Justice. They need him to strike down all the sh*tty state laws that might not have passed if they d bothered to vote in 2010. Bee s closer is absolutely brilliant, and oh so true: Look, I know state elections aren t fun. They don t have cool concerts or dank memes. But, voting in them is important. Just think of it like a mammogram. It s painful and inconvenient, but you gotta do it. Because early prevention prevents a lot less than late stage treatment. Samantha Bee is spot-on with this one. Liberals didn t vote in midterm elections, and therefore the GOP has been able to go on a nationwide right-wing tear the likes of which we have not seen for many decades. Listen to this wise woman, people. When Democrats don t vote, this dangerous, regressive nonsense is what we all must suffer through. Remember   vote blue, no matter who.Watch the video below, and please heed the advice:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trevor Noah And The Daily Show Correspondents Collapse With The Giggles Over This GOP Nightmare (VIDEO),"The Republican Party is busy with a pitted civil war between those who are willing to jump on Trump s crazy train, and those who realize the party has to be saved from the ultra-conservative extremism which handed a trust fund tycoon the party leadership. But as the Daily Show attempted to report events this week, things were so crazy, the team couldn t keep a straight face.Noah begins by outlining the GOP dilemma. Now the voting is over, and Republicans have chosen a mutant from a carrot juicing accident. As the party wakes up to that devastating reality, the GOP is splitting along the Trump fault line. Noah describes their plight with typical relish: You ve got the people who support Trump. You ve got the people who aren t ready to support Trump. And the most interesting people are a group who spent the whole race throwing sh*t at Trump. And now, they re picking it back up, spreading it on a sandwich, and taking a big bite. The host then shows clips of come-lately Trump supporters railing against the candidate in the most personal and vivid terms earlier in the race. Bobby Jindal calls Trump  weak  and a  narcissist,  and claims he would not back him in the event of his becoming nominee. But the real gold comes from Rick Perry, who refers to Trump as a  cancer  on the party and America, then chooses to back him. But even more insane, is that Perry now even wishes to become Trump s running mate! This left Noah almost tearful with laughter: So wait  he says.  You want to be running mates with cancer? That s what you re saying? I mean, I guess it has a pretty sturgeon history of winning .but still! Noah goes on to compare the GOP split like that of commuters waiting for a subway train. The doors open, and there s some crazy guy screaming. For some they think, well, it s my train, I m just going to have to  get on board the crazy train.  While others simply refuse, and to hell with the consequences.But when Noah reaches out to his correspondents for their take on the situation, no one can keep a straight face. Jordan Klepper collapses laughing, saying: They were all such assholes for so long and they completely did this to themselves! Noah turns to Hasan Minhaj in hopes of getting more sensible commentary, but he also falls apart when comparing the GOP to  a dog that chewed its own balls off.

 Watch Rachel Maddow Troll Trump With A List Of Things That Poll Higher Than Him (VIDEO),"Rachel Maddow always brings us the most entertaining bits of political news, and we love her for it. Her latest segment is no disappointment in that regard.Rachel had an exclusive report on the latest PPP poll, which listed a comprehensive group of unrelated items. All of these had one common theme among them; Which do you have a higher opinion of? _____ or Donald Trump?You can probably tell where this is going already, but the list of things that beat him are funny as hell.Lice, traffic jams, used car salesmen, hipsters, the DMV, jury duty, NICKELBACK, and root canals  When you ve lost to Nickelback, where do you really go from there?Watch Rachel s full segment below:Despite all the negative reviews, which Trump deserves (to say the least), there is one thing that s a bit troubling. Republican voters don t seem to care.Another part of the poll asked registered voters if they were uncomfortable with the three remaining candidates as the nominee of their party. Here s where it gets weird. With all of the things people had a higher opinion of than Donald Trump, Republican voters are only 21 percent uncomfortable with him as the nominee.In context   Hillary Clinton, who has in no way said the stupid, asinine, offensive, racist, bigoted, misogynistic, or otherwise bad things that Donald has is viewed as favorably to Democratic voters as Trump is to Republican ones. That isn t saying Hillary is very unfavorable either. A 21 percent margin is very respectable for any nominee of any party, especially this early in the primary process.The popular theory that there is a huge fracture happening within the Republican party simply is not true. Yes, the Republican maintsream was afraid of an outsider like Trump usurping their party, while exposing it for the cesspool it really is. However, they will still be able to rely on their voter base, as the poll shows. Anecdotal accounts of a few Republicans changing parties are not matching with the national numbers, and now that the rest of the party establishment has reached the 5th stage of grief   acceptance   it is business as usual heading into November.In the end, with the survey being among registered voters as a whole, Trump probably still stands no chance of attracting swing voters   who, all things considered, are generally pragmatic and not seduced by racism. However, it s still worth remembering that the Republican party really is unifying behind the court jester and a progressive victory can t be taken for granted.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Here’s The Democratic Plan To Destroy Trump, And It’s Starting Soon (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has left a slime trail across multiple decades as a public figure, reality TV star, serial misogynist and now presidential candidate. During the Republican primaries, many wondered why his fellow candidate pulled their punches, often until it was too late and he had already secured the nomination.By contrast, Democrats don t seem as if they plan to let Trump get away with the same sort of shenanigans he did within the GOP. Hillary Clinton has already begun promoting web videos taking on Trump and his racist, sexist, misogynist comments. But the real advertising power is expected to come from the super PACs, who are able to accept an unlimited amount of money (thanks to the Citizens United decision).Priorities USA, who supported President Obama s re-election and produced ads attacking Mitt Romney s record at Bain Capital, will be up on the air in June with ads hitting Trump. Our job is to be as prepared as we can to take him on in any particular instance and that s why not only will we be up on June 8, as previously reported, but we re actually going to go on the air earlier,  Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA, told Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on Bloomberg Television s  With All Due Respect. Of the $91 million of air time the super-PAC has already reserved, Cecil estimates that roughly one quarter to one third of ads will be positive, with the rest painting Trump in a negative light.Cecil also estimated that about $40 million will be dedicated to online outreach targeting blacks, Latinos, the Democratic base and millennials.Cecil told Bloomberg that Priorities will be attacking Trump will highlight his smears of women, veterans, as well as his shady business dealings. The group will also be able to look at what worked and didn t work for Republican ads that went after Trump in the primaries for an idea of how best to attack him.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Jon Stewart Comes Out Of Retirement To Warn America About Trump,"Comedian Jon Stewart has never been shy about his absolute disdain for Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But since he left the Daily Show, he has been mostly silent on one of his most frequent targets as he achieved unprecedented political success.That just ended. Stewart appeared on a podcast with former Obama confidante David Axelrod, and as usual, was not shy at all about how much he can t stand Trump.Stewart criticized Trump during an appearance on  Axe Files,  a podcast hosted by David Axelrod, a former top advisor to President Obama. The former  Daily Show  host questioned Trump s ability to run for the White House as a  man-baby. He is a man-baby.  Stewart said, as flagged by Politico.  He has the physical countenance of a man, and a baby s temperament and hands. Stewart went on to call him a  narcissistic asshole. Trump has demonstrated over the years that he is extremely thin-skinned, and Stewart s repeated mockery on his Comedy Central show clearly got under the reality TV star s skin. In a 2013 tweet, Trump whined that he was  much smarter  than Stewart and described him as  totally overrated.  By now we that as Trump s extremely predictable attack pattern, from which he rarely deviates because he just isn t imaginative enough.I promise you that I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz   I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow. Who, by the way, is totally overrated.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 24, 2013But this old attack on Stewart also gave a hint of the path Trump was soon to follow. In the tweet, Trump refers to Stewart as  Jonathan Leibowitz,  which is his legal name. Trump was signaling something about Stewart s Jewish ethnicity, three years before his campaign became a favorite of racists, bigots and anti-Semites.A reporter for GQ was recently pushed into filing a police report about online abuse she has suffered at the hands of Trump s fans after writing a profile of his wife Melania. Among the most common attacks   the writer was slammed for being Jewish.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Sorry, Trump! Hillary Says ‘A Lot’ Of Republicans Are Practically BEGGING To Help Her Win (VIDEO)","Throughout Donald Trump s entire campaign cycle, many conservatives have spoken out against the business mogul/reality television star and expressed their opposition to his candidacy. However, now that his competition is out of the race and Trump is the Republican party s presumptive nominee, right-wingers are desperately seeking a way to make sure Trump doesn t further ruin America. For many of them, this means supporting Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton by any means possible.On CBS  Face The Nation, Clinton revealed that over the past few days   basically ever since it became clear that Trump will likely be representing the GOP in the general election   she s been getting  a lot  of Republicans asking to help her campaign. Many of these conservatives are passionate #NeverTrump voters who would rather abandon their party and vote blue in the election than vote one of the most terrible people in the United States into the White House.During the interview, John Dickerson asked Clinton how she plans to handle conservatives who are still  skeptical,  but embracing the idea of voting for her.Clinton simply replied that she is not only more than qualified to be the next President, but has a  track record of getting results.  The former Secretary of State said: I am asking people to join this campaign and I ve had a lot of outreach from Republicans in the last days who say they are interested in talking about that. You can watch the interview below:The speed at which Trump has pulled the Republican party apart is impressive to say the least. We could have predicted that some conservatives would be jumping ship by the party s reaction when Trump was first announced as the party s presumptive nominee. The sheer rage from conservatives was priceless   many of them not only burned, tore up or destroyed their voter registrations cards by other measures, but many changed their party entirely. So while Trump has risen amongst his own supporters for being more vulgar and offensive than ever, he is only helping to unify the rest of the country   against him.Featured image via Justin Sullivan / Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary’s Latest Challenge To Progressives Is One That Needs To Be Taken Very Seriously (VIDEO),"Appearing on Face the Nation this past Sunday, Hillary Clinton was posed a question by host John Dickerson surrounding voters and how many want what they want, even when it comes to their candidate of choice. Dickerson insinuated that Hillary may be trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the race. However, when it comes down to who is going to win the nomination, many voters are undoubtedly going to be disappointed, because their candidate was not the one chosen. Yet, those voters will still have a voice, a voice that needs to be heard, and a message that needs to be spread far and wide.Hillary s response was honest, clear, to the point, and one that needs to be heard by every progressive everywhere who doesn t want to see the nation fall into the hands of Donald Trump. She said: I m three million votes ahead of Senator Sanders, nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of him. He has to make his own mind up.But I was very heartened to hear him say last week that he is going to work seven days a week to make sure Donald Trump doesn t become president. And I want to unify the party. I see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party, to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share.We both want to raise the minimum wage. We both understand you have got to rein in bad actors on Wall Street and in corporate America to make sure they don t wreck Main Street. We have a lot of the same goals. And I hope we can unify around them. And she s absolutely correct. While the means to achieve some of the goals are different, the goals, nonetheless, are pretty much the same. While Bernie wants to overhaul health care and education in one fell swoop, Hillary wants the same things, but done over time. It s all about unifying behind the message and making sure we get there somehow, because if Donald Trump is to become president, or we can t manage to turn Congress blue again, honestly, it won t really matter who is president. Everything that needs to get done would be virtually impossible (see also: President Barack Obama with Republican Congress).No matter who the Democratic candidate for president is, it s time to unite behind them with the common goal of progress for the greater good, not just the few on top. Let s do this, progressives.Watch the whole segment from Face the Nation here:Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 AG Loretta Lynch Just Eviscerated NC Governor Pat McCrory For ‘Right To Discriminate’ Lawsuit (VIDEO),"North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory (R) announced he would be suing the Obama administration for stopping his state s ability to discriminate against transgender people. Attorney General Loretta Lynch just hit him back. Hard.In a press conference scheduled just hours after McCrory decided he would order millions of dollars to be wasted fighting a hopeless battle to prevent trans people from using public bathrooms in North Carolina, Lynch spoke firmly about the rights of all people to be allowed to enjoy public spaces free of harassment or bans.Lynch carefully, and forcefully, demolished the  state-sponsored discrimination  inherent in the  bathroom bill  known as HB 2. The law, she said, is patently illegal and the Department of Justice would continue opposing it, despite the lawsuit.In a spine tingling moment, she spoke directly to the trans community in North Carolina and across the country who have watched in horror as Republican officials have legalized their persecution. She said that her colleagues at the Department of Justice and the Obama administration have their backs and would fight for them every step of the way. We see you. We stand with you, and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward. And please know that history is on your side. Lynch also has very powerful personal reasons to abhor what is happening in North Carolina   she was born there. She also grew up in a time when North Carolina was known for other forms of discrimination. She reminded America that not too long ago, people on the wrong side of history put signs over bathrooms saying African Americans could not enter. Even as things change, things stay the same.AG Lynch to transgender community.  We see you, we stand with you, and we will do everything we can to protect you.  https://t.co/fYLR8AlcNR  ABC News (@ABC) May 9, 2016In her statement, Lynch also reminded North Carolina that very soon they will have more than just millions of dollars in lost revenue from boycotts to worry about. Being found in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws would mean the state could lose federal funding for things like the Department of Public Safety and the state s public university system. In rushing to harass trans people, state Republicans have not only sliced off their nose to spite their face, they are cutting themselves to pieces limb by limb. It s not pretty.Lynch s powerful defense of the LGBT community serves as a stunningly clear example of how far apart the two major political parties has grown in the last decade. The Obama administration has made it clear that the LGBT community will not be victimized on his watch. On the other hand, many of the Republican candidates for president just weeks ago were running on the premise that transgender individuals were nothing more than sexual predators dressed up as women as a way to gain access to women s bathrooms. Indeed, that appears to be the entire premise of North Carolina s  bathroom bill.  No actual instances of sexual assaults on women or girls from trans women has ever been recorded.

Trump Distances Himself From Sarah Palin After Paul Ryan Tirade (VIDEO),"After Sarah Palin appeared on CNN on Sunday with Jake Tapper, talking about how much she despises Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) for having his own opinion about her beloved Donald Trump, it left many wondering if Trump also felt that way about Ryan.But wonder no longer, because during Trump s interview on Monday morning with CNN s Chris Cuomo, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee seemed to distance himself from Palin s comments.Cuomo said: Sarah Palin came out and said  Paul Ryan is done. I m calling on the supporters of Donald Trump to go after Paul Ryan and make sure that he gets Cantored.  As in Eric Cantor, you know, that he loses his seat. Do you want that? Do you want Sarah Palin going out there and trying to turn people against Paul Ryan? You re supposed to be unifying the party. Trump responded: Well, Sarah has endorsed me, and I like her a lot, I think she s a terrific person  but I have nothing to do with that. I mean, that s her. You know, Sarah is very much a free agent. She s a terrific person, but she s very much a free agent and I didn t know about this until yesterday, I guess she s been fighting or she s endorsing somebody that s running against Paul Ryan, and I didn t know about it until yesterday when I read about it. It seems when he says  free agent  he means  loose cannon  but that can t be confirmed.Trump then went onto say how he s had a good relationship with Paul Ryan, albeit he does feel a bit stabbed in the back by his refusal to get behind Trump s presumptive nomination.It looks as though Trump, as much as a loose cannon as he is himself, has learned the valuable art of not attaching himself to everything Sarah Palin says. Wise move.Watch the clip here:Donald Trump tells @NewDay he has  nothing to do  with Sarah Palin s comments on Paul Ryan https://t.co/uJUxnp5ZxW https://t.co/UUKqiBrpaK  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 9, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 See How Trump Wants To Screw Over Minimum Wage Earners In Red States,"First he said wages were too high, then he said he d work to raise the minimum wage, and now Donald Trump seems to be implying that he wants to abolish the federal minimum wage altogether. Appearing on Meet the Press, Trump advocated allowing the states to set the standard, not the federal government: I like the idea of  let the states decide.  But I think people should get more. I think they re out there. They re working. It is a very low number. When asked if the federal government show play a part in establishing a  floor  of where to start with in regards of the minimum wage, Trump said no, and that: I d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other. He went on record saying  I don t know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say: let the states decide. So he admits people are suffering on poverty wages, but he wants to allow Republican-led states like Wisconsin and Kansas to decide their fates.And, in typical Trump fashion, he admitted he didn t have a plan in place about what to do with the people struggling to make ends meet, saying  I haven t decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more. Like everything else, he hasn t thought anything through, and has relied on talking points to get him attention and votes.While running an analysis of his core supporters, the Atlantic found: Full-year employment rate of men without a bachelor s degree fell from 76 percent in 1990 to 68 percent in 2013. While real wages have grown for men and women with a four-year degree or better in the last 25 years, they ve fallen meaningfully for non-college men. Uneducated men, a serious chunk of Trump s supporters (who also mostly live in red states), are seeing their wages decrease. And yet their messiah doesn t want to raise their minimum wage or takes the copout argument of  state s rights  to oppose it.No wonder Trump loves the poorly educated.With Trump you never know who you re getting. One day he doesn t want to raise it, then the other day he does and then the very next day he doesn t again.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Al Sharpton Catches John McCain Acting Exactly Like Donald Trump Toward Immigrants,"Senator John McCain just got outed as a hypocrite with a damning video that shows him acting just like Donald Trump   even though he blames the presumptive GOP nominee for hurting him among Hispanic voters.Last week, the Arizona Republican complained to private donors that Donald Trump s rhetoric against Hispanics is making his re-election bid difficult. I do not take my primary opponent lightly,  McCain said. He continued: But have no doubt that if it is Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona   with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote   I have no doubt that this may be the race of my life. People are angry. They re upset. They feel that there s this disconnect and all of that and frankly there s an element of nativism in it as well, as you know. McCain is all of a sudden worried about the Hispanic vote because Trump has accused Hispanic immigrants of being rapists and murderers, all while promising to build an expensive wall along the entire southern border to keep immigrants out of the United States.But as it turns out, McCain is apparently pretending that he is totally different from Trump.Because in 2010, McCain used the exact same rhetoric in a campaign ad that makes it clear that he should blame himself for any troubles with Hispanic voters he will experience in November.MSNBC host Al Sharpton caught McCain being a hypocrite, so he played the video during an interview with McCain s Democratic challenger Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick.In the ad, McCain is walking along the border with a local sheriff.  Drug and human smuggling, home invasions, murder,  he says. The sheriff uses the term  illegals  to describe desperate undocumented immigrants fleeing violence in their countries of origin for a better life in America. John McCain then concludes by calling to  complete the dang fence. Here s the video via YouTube. Blaming immigrants for murder, for home invasions, vowing to, quote, complete the fence. I mean, this is John NcCain,  Sharpton said. Is there that much difference that you see there between what he s saying and what Trump is saying about building a wall?  he asked Kirkpatrick.Kirkpatrick agreed, saying that John McCain changed his position again as he often does  depending on who he is talking to. He s not a straight shooter,  she continued.  He s not a maverick. He doesn t stand for anything. Here s the video via YouTube.Looks like John McCain has some explaining to do.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Whines That Mitt Romney Was ‘Ungrateful’ For Trump Helping Him Lose The Election (VIDEO),"The more we get to know Donald Trump, the more we realize that he s just a big orange version of Kim Jong-Un. He s childish, petulant and thin skinned, and anyone who has wronged him had better watch out. Mitt Romney wronged Donald Trump. He refuses to endorse the billionaire and well, it appears that Trump is holding a grudge against Romney from 2012. Trump wants credit for helping him lose the election, or something like that.On Sunday s Meet the Press, Trump talked about the feud that appears to be happening between the 2012 nominee and the 2016 presumptive nominee. Every single robocall I made, he won that state. Every single speech I made, he won that state, in terms of the primaries. I believe I won him, or helped him win five states that he was going to lose in the primaries,  Trump continued.And that support came with personal cost to Trump. I raised a lot of money for him. I ruined the carpet in my apartments   I had so many people come. We actually had to have two fundraisers because there were so many people. Here s the video:It is true that in 2012, Trump endorsed Romney. As for Trump s argument that he would have taken Romney over the victory line if he accepted more help, well, probably not. At that time, the Trump revolution (or whatever you want to call it) had not yet started. Polls at the time showed that Trump would have been a negative on Romney s campaign.Romney hasn t always been so sour on Trump. After receiving his endorsement, Romney sung Trump s praises in a way that almost sounds like a presidential endorsement.In an interview in March, Trump said that Romney begged him for his endorsement in 2012. Mitt is a failed candidate   he failed horribly,  Trump said.  I backed Mitt Romney. You could see how loyal he is. He was begging for my endorsement. I could ve said,  Mitt, drop to your knees,  and he would ve dropped to his knees. He was begging. He was begging me. It s doubtful that Romney actually begged Trump, but the former candidate does claim that if Trump acted the way then that he does now (he did), then he wouldn t have accepted it:If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) March 3, 2016If Romney had any of your sympathy, this is where he should lose it. He knew what Trump was about long before 2012. As you recall, during the Arab Spring in 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was persona-non-grata in the United States, Trump rented him a piece of land. His racism was clearly evident in his birther stance and with this tweet in response to Baltimore riots following the death of Freddie Gray. Our great African American President hasn t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 28, 2015His views on immigration are hardly new:Stop the EBOLA patients from entering the U.S. Treat them, at the highest level, over there. THE UNITED STATES HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2014And of course, we know that Trump is sexist. None of that is what matters to Romney, though, although Romney does enjoy the illusion of decorum. What matters to Romney is that Trump has no core beliefs. He even flip-flops on how he ll treat his and Romney s own kind, but he does seem to be settling on raising taxes for the wealthy, sort of. That might be just a bit too far for Romney.Featured image via video screen shot.

 Trump: We Should Default On Our Debt Because We Can Just ‘Print The Money’,"A lot of time people ask the question: why can t we just print more money to get rid of our debt? The answer is simple. If you just print more money, you will be completely devalue our currency, thus sending our nation into a destructive economic tailspin, much like Germany in the early part of the 21st century.And if you re Donald Trump, you re A-OK with doing just that.The self described business  genius  just showed the American people how truly stupid and inept he is today when he gave a reason as to why America should default on its debt: just print more money, and buy it back. Appearing on CNN s New Day, Trump told host Chris Cuomo: People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and I mean, these people are crazy. This is the United States government. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK? Trump s plan basically consists of this: we don t raise the debt-ceiling, thus defaulting. But we won t default because interest rates will go up and we will use our liquid assets such as cash (which we ll print more of) to buy back bonds at a discount that will cover the debt.According to the Washington Post:The items in the federal budget that are the overwhelming drivers of long-term deficits wouldn t really be helped if the government were to unleash massive inflation. The federal government has pledged to pay for medical care for the elderly (through Medicare) for the poor (Medicaid) and provide basic retirement income (Social Security).But for each of those programs, inflation wouldn t solve the government s financial problems. It would make them worse (to put it in the technical language, they are real obligations, not nominal obligations).So, in other words, medical costs would skyrocket and social security payments would have to freeze, etc. The country would be in chaos.This comes after Trump touted himself as the  debt king  who  loves debt  and would use his  experience  in debt to solve all our problems and make us great again and that means printing more money to give us a faux impression of economic security, the same impression that brought many nations to their knees.This is the man who is supposed to be the economic genius and the one who will make America an economic powerhouse?The level of stupidity is maddening.Featured image via Mark Lyons/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Sue Federal Government For ‘Right To Discriminate’,"The North Carolina  bathroom law  is heading to federal court because the state s governor is suing the government for the right to discriminate against the transgender community.On Monday, Governor Pat  Bigot  McCrory filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice (DOJ) and has asked the court to rule that HB2 is not discriminatory. The governors complaint cites letters sent from the Department of Justice last week threatening to sue the state for violating the Civil Rights Act. McCrory s complaint is seeking  declaratory and injunctive relief against the United States of America  the DOJ and Attorney General Loretta Lynch because of: their radical reinterpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights of 1964 which would prevent plaintiffs from protecting the bodily privacy rights of state employees while accommodating the needs of transgendered state employees. Apparently,  protecting the bodily privacy rights  of their employees can only be done if they deny those same rights from the transgender community. I m not sure if McCrory has any idea what a woman s restroom looks like, but it s not a bunch of open stalls where we are all holding hands and peeing. Each person has an individual and private stall to do their business   our  bodily privacy  is already protected.The complaint goes on to claim that the by protecting all of its citizens from discriminatory laws like the one in North Carolina is  baseless and blatant overreach : This is an attempt to unilaterally rewrite long-established federal civil rights laws in a manner that is wholly inconsistent with the intent of Congress and disregards of statutory interpretation by the Courts. McCrory is claiming that the Civil Rights Act doesn t protect the transgender community, but it absolutely does. It says that he is not allowed to discriminate  against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion.  Sexual identity falls into the category of  sex, therefore, McCory is not legally allowed to pass a law that discriminates against his employees based on their sex. It s not a  radical interpretation  unless he considers using common sense  radical,  but then again we are talking about a Republican so .What this all boils down to is bigotry and hate. Republicans fight tooth and nail against protecting any class of people who are not white, straight, Christian males. The transgender community is just their latest target. Unfortunately for them, it is 2016 and President Obama s DOJ doesn t not put up with that kind of bullshit.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images ",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Thin-Skinned Trump Had A CRAZY On-Air Meltdown After Chris Cuomo Asked Him A Tough Question (VIDEO),"Trump s been known to dodge difficult questions during interviews, but what happened Monday morning on CNN was pure madness.Less than a minute after the presumptive Republican nominee started his interview with Chris Cuomo on New Day, Trump was attacking Cuomo and the network. After immediately criticizing the way Cuomo was questioning him, Trump took aim at CNN, claiming that the network favored Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and purposefully did not air favorable coverage during his campaign.This chaos erupted right after Cuomo asked Trump why he would choose to attack Clinton for the actions of her husband. He asked Trump: You are attacking Hillary Clinton for the sexual past and indiscretions of her husband. What is your thinking on this line of attack? Well, Trump didn t even come close to answering that question. The presidential hopeful got super-fiesty with Cuomo and snapped,  Well this is a nice way to start off the interview.  In all seriousness, Trump threw a temper tantrum and sounded like a child as he continued his pathetic attempt to shame Cuomo and CNN: First of all, you should congratulate me for having won the race. I thought, you know, at least there would be a small congratulations but I m not surprised with CNN because that s the way they treat Trump. You know, they call it the  Clinton Network,  and I believe that. So, uh, let s start off right there. Cuomo fired back and reminded the dense business mogul,  I said congratulations the last time we spoke! What followed next was completely unbecoming of a presidential candidate   but perfectly expected from Trump. The presidential hopeful bickered with Cuomo over what was said and when, and then Trump had the nerve to say to the show host, I understand CNN perhaps a lot better than you do! Then, continuing his obvious plan to avoid answering Cuomo s question about his attacks on Clinton and her husband s marital infidelities, Trump went on a bizarre rant about pretty much everything except what Cuomo asked him. All the while, he continued to attack CNN for not giving him the kind of coverage he wanted. Trump said: Nor does CNN ever show the crowds. I could be making a speech for an hour and they ll never show the crowds! The interview was completely awkward, but shows perfectly that Trump s main strategy for getting through debates and interviews is to distract the interviewer and audience with his hissy fits and over-the-top bragging. You can watch Trump have his meltdown below:Featured image via John Sommers II / Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Cruz Campaign Blames Rubio For Loss: A Cruz/Rubio Ticket Would’ve Been ‘A Blowout’ (VIDEO),"Now that the side-show is essentially over and the Republicans have committed their party and resources to a delusional lunatic, those left ion the rubble of hurricane Trump are desperately seeking answers. Those answers came from the Cruz Campaign, who informed us that Carly Fiorina wasn t Ted s first choice for VP. They say that had Marco Rubio warmed up and showed any interest at all in working with Uncle Ted that a Cruz/Rubio ticket would have changed the course of history.They felt that strongly because in the course of doing their job, they polled in five upcoming states and found that if Rubio were on the ticket there would be a  blowout,  according to a source inside the Cruz campaign. The states polled included Illinois, Arizona and Wisconsin. The numbers were as high as 65 percent to 35 percent over Trump and if true, that means that Ted Cruz owes his demise to himself because that puts Rubio on a growing list of people who just refuse to work with Ted Cruz:That s fairly consistent with the general consensus about Ted Cruz. There came a turning point in Ted s career; a  come to Jesus  if you will. After he failed to get his way about defunding Planned Parenthood over a series of cleverly edited videos, Cruz went on an infamous rant on the senate floor that cost him whatever small amount of political capital he had left in Washington. He called every member of the Republican leadership out for betraying God and the party. He claimed that Republicans no longer cared about what mattered and he called them out by name. It s just not something you do, especially if you re a United States Senator and you need to work with these people to do your job effectively.Cruz now has to head back to Washington to sit in his chair alone in the corner of the congressional lunchroom. With little left but shattered dreams and still enough ego to blame someone else for it, Cruz has a long way to go until his next election in 2018. Rubio, on the other hand, has already decided not to run, so he gets to sit in the private sector wondering if he would have been happier with an office in the West Wing a little more rectangular than the one he was hoping for.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox News Posted A Photo Of Two Gorillas, So Their Racist Fans Trashed The Obamas (SCREENSHOTS)","Once again, conservatives have gone above and beyond to prove that quite literally anything will send them into a racist tirade against the President of the United States.On Mother s Day, Fox News posted photos on Facebook of a gorilla who had recently given birth unexpectedly. The pregnancy was a bit of a shock to the staff at Prague Zoo, who say they had  given up hope  that Shinda, the 24-year-old primate, would ever have a baby. The gorilla had experienced numerous miscarriages, so staff simply assumed she was overweight. But late last month, Shinda gave birth successfully. After suffering several miscarriages, Shinda was expected to remain childless,  Fox News posted.  But the 24-year-old gorilla surprised everyone at the Prague Zoo in April when she gave birth to a healthy baby! Almost immediately the nigh-predictable screeching began, with Fox News fans reciting effortlessly their favorite lines, like  If Obama had a son.  Others decided that their hateful screeds should be directed at Michelle and Malia Obama.                      Unfortunately, this is the sort of thing sane people are forced to tolerate. Recently, upon hearing that Malia Obama had gotten into Harvard, the Stupid Part of America spewed their hatred in a similar manner. Fox News fans swooped in, calling her a  n*gger, an  affirmative action parasite,  and suggesting that  Little Ape  (that s their cute little nickname for her)  go to college in Africa. In December, Fox News posted a photo of an orangutan in a Santa hat. You can guess what happened.It s easy to be shocked by Donald Trump s popularity. But the secret of his appeal   his racism, his narcissism, his Islamophobic hate speech, the (I assume by now) gold-plated, 1,000-foot wall with mounted machine guns every 27 1/2 feet and f*cking lazers, and the fact that he probably wants to f*ck his own daughter  is equally simple. He has a built-in audience.For years, Fox News has been catering to the very worst in society. For years, they have been shaping the opinion of the distressingly large percentage of Americans who are unable to use a fork without adult supervision, and for years they have been perpetuating lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie about President Obama.Fox News built Donald Trump s audience for him, and he harnessed that hate. It s easy to look at this and say  so what,  but remember: these people will be voting in November. Be sure to head to the polls, because anyone they would put in office could not possibly be good for America.Featured Image via screengrab",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative Christians Sob Into Their Coffee Over Trump’s Nomination – ‘There’s Nobody Left’,"Right after Ted Cruz suspended his presidential campaign, evangelical Christians went nuts, pouring sadness and fear all over social media about their own fate now that their personal government crusader was not going to make it to the White House. Now, it seems they ve gone into complete, total and utter despair, crying that there s nobody left to represent them and their dominionist ideals.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Pastor Gary Fuller had a Sunday service planned around Ted Cruz remaining in the race. Instead, he had to tell his congregation to vote according to their convictions because he didn t know what else to say. He also said: In a sense, we feel abandoned by our party. There s nobody left. Honestly, B-O-O H-O-O. Religion needs to be left out of government, and if they have to learn that lesson the hard way, tough bananas.The Post notes that evangelicals tend to vote according to social and moral issues, and Ted Cruz ran his campaign on those issues. Candidates that run on social issues tend not to do well, though, because there are far more pressing issues on which to vote than who s screwing whom, who s marrying whom, and what women are having done in their doctors  offices.These people have a problem with Trump s being married three times to three different women, and the fact that he doesn t have much interest in fighting for their ideals on social issues. He s a hardliner on immigration, and his main focus has been on that, plus jobs and the economy, however crazy and unworkable his ideas actually are. Social issues are non-issues to Trump right now, which, if the GOP unifies behind him, makes them non-issues for the entire party.Russell Moore, of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, whined to the Post: This year the Republican Party has not just surrendered on the culture wars, they ve joined the other side. And that s a unique situation. Many evangelical Christians don t seem to believe in the 1st Amendment   some, like disgraced Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, even think religious protection only applies to Christianity. Anything else is infringement on their beliefs, even if it doesn t directly affect them.Ted Cruz was their savior, and now he s out.To this, we say our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for them and their dashed hopes for turning us into a Christian nation this year.Featured image by Richardlwelsh.

 Trump’s America? What This High School Did To A Muslim Girl Is No Joke,"A Muslim high school student in Rancho Cucamonga, California, received an apology from officials at her school after she was misidentified as  Isis Phillips  in her yearbook. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is slamming the school, is calling for an investigation of the incident, and plans to send a legal team to meet with the school district.The incident fits in with a pattern of recent events in America.Bayan Zehlif, a junior at Los Osos, was photographed for the yearbook wearing a hijab. She posted the photo from the yearbook with the incorrect caption on Facebook and Twitter, according to the Los Angeles Times. I am extremely saddened, disgusted, hurt and embarrassed that the Los Osos High School yearbook was able to get away with this,  Zehlif wrote on Facebook.  Apparently, I am  Isis  in the yearbook. The school reached out to me and had the audacity to say that this was a typo. I beg to differ, let s be real. One of her fellow students told the NY Daily News that Zehlif was overreacting, and that it was simply an innocent mistake. But it is quite a coincidence for that name to be attached to a Muslim student.In recent years conservatives have led efforts to attack Muslims across America, to the point where leading officials like President Obama have had to intervene to make it clear that Muslims have and will continue to be part of the fabric of America.In a similar case, a Muslim student who made a clock and brought it to school was accused of making a bomb. President Obama invited him to the White House, pointing out that children should be encouraged to be interested in fields like engineering, not demonized.At the same time, presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has opposed allowing Syrian war refugees into the United States, and favors a ban on Muslim immigration to the country   a proposal supported by a majority of Republican voters.Recent attacks on immigrants have also traced their inspiration to speeches and comments from Trump, including high school students who yelled racial epithets at Latino students. That is the sort of atmosphere Bayan Zehlif is growing up in, so it might be hard for her to believe this ISIS incident was just a mistake.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Right-Wing Blogger: Trump Is GOP’s ‘Sociopathic Maniac’ (VIDEO),"More and more traditional Republicans are coming out against the inevitable presidential candidacy of the trainwreck that is Donald Trump. The latest is Ben Stowe, of the ultra-conservative blog Red State. Stowe appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources, and host Ben Stelter asked him about Trump   specifically about the  Hillary you know  and the  Trump you don t know.  Stowe didn t mince words on Trump, though. He said of the reality star and business mogul turned clown car politician: No, I think I know exactly who I m getting. I think I m getting a sociopathic maniac. And not only do I feel like that s who I m getting, I think that if Donald Trump was president we have four years of him defining conservatism. Stowe seems to be worried about Trump s redefining of what it means to be an American conservative, and about Trump s clear and inevitable destruction of the Republican Party as we know it. He referenced the other idiot GOPers who are clearly on the wrong side of history when it comes to cultural differences regarding social issues, and continued to express worry regarding Trump s outrageous and destructive positions. He continued: It s been bad enough with some of the people we ve had define conservatism over the last several years. To have Donald Trump be our standard bearer I think would be so destructive, I don t know if we can recover. This is going to be a third party situation if we can t get him to lose the election. The thing is, though, there are some conservatives who are falling in lockstep with support of Trump, including Fox News, who Ted Cruz referred to as the  Donald Trump network.  Howe isn t drinking the Trump Kool-Aid though, and warned his GOP compatriots: I think it s a matter of, he creates ratings. I want to address this idea that we were all missing in action when Obamacare came around, when the stimulus came around,  he said refuting that the right didn t attack the President enough.  I was out there marching with the Tea Party in 2009  the fact that I m now coming out against Donald Trump is actually very consistent. I m against liberalism in the destruction of conservatism and that s what Trump represents. Well, Ben Howe might be a hardcore right winger, but even he understands how dangerous Trump is for both his party and this country.Congratulations GOP, and thanks for the comedic material. Your party is literally imploding before our very eyes.Watch the exchange below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Adele Just Made A Beyonce Comparison That Has Conservative Christians Going Crazy (VIDEO/TWEETS),"Mega music star Adele took some time during a concert in Denmark to offer some words about American music queen Beyonce  and her album Lemonade. Adele had nothing but good things to say about Beyonce , calling her  the sickest artist around.  But, she went a step further in a statement that has earned the ire of conservative Christians. Here s what Adele said: She is Jesus f***ing Christ. It s unbelievable. I ve been listening to her for 17 years, and she s still making music that blows my mind.

Her talent, beauty, grace and work ethic are all in a league of their own. I appreciate you so much! Thank god for Beyonc . Although the comparison was harmless, many people felt a personal affront and made their feelings known on Twitter. One person went so far as to pray for Adele s soul when she  meets Jesus.  Others accused the star of losing her mind (see below).In the end, it s simply one musician expressing admiration for another. @shaykimberlyy ikr  Satan (@allhailsatan_) May 8, 2016Adele calling Beyonc  Jesus Christ makes me kinda not like her anymore  Alexvnder (@alexanderdaname) May 7, 2016@Adele Comparing @Beyonce to Jesus Christ is very offensive on every level.

" For The 7th Year, Every Urban Prep Graduate Accepted To College (VIDEO)","Chicago s Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men is one of the only high schools in the United States to boast a 100 percent rate of college acceptance for graduates.The nonprofit school, which has a mission of  providing a strong, college-preparatory high school option for boys in under-served African-American communities,  first began enrolling students during the 2005   2006 school year.Urban Prep was created in response to a 2006 study published by the University of Chicago which showed that just one in 40 Black male students enrolled in Chicago s public school system would go on to graduate from a four year college or university.Urban Prep, which now has three separate campus locations in Chicago, was the first all male charter school in the United States. According to wikipedia, the overwhelming majority of students, 85 percent, are from economically disadvantaged households.In 2010 the students of Urban Prep made national headlines after every single graduate was accepted to a college or university.That amazing achievement has been duplicated by Urban Prep students every year since 2010.This year is no different. The 252 graduating seniors received more than 1500 college acceptance letters in 2016, many from prestigious schools such as Yale and Georgetown.Urban Prep graduates also received more than $15 million in scholarships and grants.School officials cite small class sizes, a rigorous curriculum and devoted teachers as reasons for the unprecedented rate of student success.More than that, though, Urban Prep Academy founder Tim King stresses that everyone working with students strives to empower them to believe in themselves and their own potential.King says: Urban Prep students will not fall into the trap of negative stereotypes and low expectations. Instead students believe in their potential and believe in their ability to exceed that potential.

 SNL ‘President Barbie’ Commercial Jokingly Highlights Progress Of Feminism (VIDEO),"The May 8 episode of Saturday Night Live featured a spoof commercial for Mattel s new  President Barbie. The commercial and the product are both fictional creations from the SNL team, who used the mock ad to highlight how far feminism has come in the 21st Century.As the video opens the narrator proclaims in a sing-song voice: We know our little girls can go as far as their imaginations will take them. As cheerful music plays in the background viewers are entertained with scenes of pre-teen girls playing with things like rockets and engineering sets.The narrator goes on, saying: To show just how far we ve come, Mattel is proud to introduce President Barbie, the first Barbie Commander In Chief. After this exciting build up, the scene shifts back to the girls, who just don t seem that into the doll. Oh, neat,  one of them replies half-heartedly, before putting the Barbie down to return to the construction set in front of her. Don t you want to play with her?  the narrator asks, adding,  She s a girl, just like you. The girl responds by saying,  Ya, but girls don t have to play with dolls. We can play with whatever we want. The narrator replies,  That s true, you don t have to play with dolls, but it would be great if you played with this doll right now. To this, one of the girls replies,  I like Legos. The mock spokesperson tries to boost the kids  interest in the doll by saying: Oh but look, President Barbie even comes with sunglasses and a smart phone with Snapchat. Do you like her now? The girls remain unimpressed. One of them replies,  It feels like she s trying too hard. The narrator explains: She is trying hard because there was a time when Barbie couldn t even be president. In response one of the kids sums it up by saying: I wasn t alive then.

 Sarah Palin’s Pick To Replace Paul Ryan Wants To Challenge The Speaker To An Arm Wrestling Match (VIDEO),"The media has been telling us for months now that the Republican party is in a civil war. It is. The war, though, is not between those who care and those who want to take food from the mouths of babies. No, they all want to take food from the mouths of babies. It s not a war between those who want the world to treat those who aren t white, male, Christian and cis equally. None of them want that. The war is between those who pretend to be good people and those who let their anti-intellectual a**hole flag fly.Sarah Palin is the queen of the a**hole flag branch of the GOP. She wears that flag proudly and with all the maturity of a bully who s flunking out of fifth grade. Before Palin hit the stage, we suspected, but we never knew for sure, that the base of the Republican party was bigoted macho mouth breathers. Imagine our feigned surprise when Palin came out in support of this macho mouth breather in Wisconsin, who is hoping to replace Paul Ryan in the House. Watch to the end of the video, when he challenges Ryan to a debate, but if Ryan refuses to debate, he d be happy to arm wrestle the Congressman.Here s the video:Well, Paul Ryan does do P90X, so it could be an interesting match.The man who wants to arm wrestle Ryan, presumably from the backs of Harleys, is Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, whose main issue is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. There s just one problem with his entire beef with Ryan. Ryan didn t endorse the agreement.The video is titled  Truth Resurrection,  but its portrayal of Ryan as a supporter of the trade deal is false. Ryan s been critical of the actual deal, but helped pass a separate measure called Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), a pro-forma congressional action that makes it easier for the executive branch to negotiate a proposed treaty that must still be ratified by Congress. Lawmakers have granted presidents that authority as a routine matter of course going back decades and across party lines. Ryan even hammered some unusual concessions to GOP ideology into this edition of TPA.Source: Think ProgressThe real issue, though, at least for Palin, is that Ryan, at least so far, has refused to endorse her candidate, Donald Trump. Now, she has set her sights on replacing the Speaker. I think Paul Ryan is soon to be  Cantored,  as in Eric Cantor,  Palin said, referring to the former Republican House majority leader who was ousted in a shocking upset in 2014 when challenger Dave Brat ran to his right in a Virginia primary. His political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people, and as the leader of the GOP, the convention, certainly he is to remain neutral, and for him to already come out and say who he will not support is not a wise decision of his,  Palin continued.Source: CNNNaturally, Palin didn t consult policy experts before landing on a candidate. She saw a tattooed, muscled man s man on a Harley and her little squirrel brain said,  that s the man!  That, and Nehlen endorsed Trump.Palin told Tapper that although she hasn t yet informed Nehlen that she s endorsing him,  I will do whatever I can for Paul Nehlen. This man is a hard-working guy, so in touch with the people,  Palin said.  Paul Ryan and his ilk, their problem is they have become so disconnected by the people whom they are elected to represent. She added:  They feel so threatened at this point that their power, their prestige, their purse will be adversely affected by the change that is coming with Trump and with someone like Paul Nehlen, that they re not thinking straight right now. It appears that this is a year in which Palin is ready to let her social conservatism take a backseat to her xenophobia. Both Nehlen and Trump are anti-immigration, but their stances on reproductive rights and LGBT rights are tough to pin down. Of course, you could also say that this proves that Palin has no principles, other than somehow staying relevant with the ignorant masses. Or, maybe she likes the Harley and the tats.Featured image via YouTube video screen capture.

 Witness Trump Tell A Room Of Cheering Morons That Women Have It Better Off Than Men (VIDEO),"In the world according to presumed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, women apparently have it better than men. Who knew?Trump told his band of merry morons: All of the men, we re petrified to speak to women any more  the women get it better than we do, folks. They get it better than we do. If by  get it  he means  understand  then maybe he s on to something, but if he meant it in terms of have it better off in life, well, then he s absolutely just full of shit.Women earn, on average, only 79% of what men make. This isn t due to men s greater ability, or being smarter, or having more training. It s based upon the fact that they have an extra appendage between their legs that women don t have. And the pay gap is even worse among women of color. Not to mention the fact that many women are treated with far less respect in the work place. Often times their opinions are treated as  hostile  or  bossy  compared to a man s  assertiveness  and  drive to succeed. Trump is a bully, and he thinks that he can belittle women by saying how much they have it  better  than men. He says this because he gets in trouble for belittling them. He doesn t think people should call him out on his misogynistic bullshit. That s what he means by  women get it better,  because women these days are finally being heard, and he hates it. Absolutely despises it.Honestly? Any person who votes for Donald Trump, a man with zero policy or diplomacy experience, is an idiot, but women who vote for Trump? Seriously? Have a little more respect for yourself than that.Watch Trump s remark here: All of the men, we re petrified to speak to women any more  the women get it better than we do, folks.

 WATCH: Jehovah’s Witnesses Create Cartoon To Indoctrinate Kids Into Hating Gay People,"Apparently tired of people slamming doors in their faces, Jehovah s Witnesses have found a new way to indoctrinate children.Rather than accept that most parents do not want their children to be brainwashed into hating people, the religious sect is creating cartoons meant to teach them to be anti-gay  Christians  who can act as advocates for their cause.The cartoon begins with a child at school looking at the drawings her classmates made of their families. Gazing at one image of a child holding hands with her two moms, the child goes home and presents her mother with a picture she drew of her family, which features what conservatives call a  traditional  family featuring a mother and father.She mentions that one of her classmates drew two mommies, who are married to each other, and that her teacher says that it doesn t matter as long as they love each other and are happy.The girl s mother, however, has an anti-gay viewpoint and promptly goes about trying to teach her child how to hate and that gay people aren t  normal. The mother picks up her Bible and tells the girl that marriage is a union between one man and one woman and uses the example of an airport security scanner to demonstrate that gay people are not going to be able to go to paradise if they keep being gay. In other words, gay people are going to hell.The girl s mom goes on to claim that  people can change,  which is code that means gay people can just stop being gay and become straight. She then encourages the girl to tell her classmate all about Jehovah and that her parents are going to hell if they don t stop being gay.Here s the video via YouTube:Jehovah s Witnesses even proudly gave their stamp of approval after the video ends.This is part of the reason why I started telling Jehovah s Witnesses that I m not a Christian instead of just waiting for them to give up and go away. Their persistence at trying to preach to people at their homes is one of the most annoying things about them but now they are literally trying to indoctrinate children via social media with a cartoon that teaches them to be bigots homophobes who spew hate and condemnation instead of decent human beings who practice love, acceptance and tolerance.Children should not be subjected to this kind of backward thinking and creating a cartoon to do it is about as low as it gets.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Oliver Exposes Shocking Reality Of Money In Politics (VIDEO),"Activist groups across the U.S. have been raising the alarm about the disastrous impact of money in politics for a long time.While the majority of Americans take issue with the massive amount of money that flows into the political system, most have no idea just how absurd the situation has really become.Leave it to John Oliver to shine a light on the problem.In this segment of Last Week Tonight the comedian/talk-show host goes behind the scenes of Congress to examine how fundraising activities have all but replaced activities related to policy-making and governing in Washington DC.One the most startling revelations from the segment is the fact that most Washington officials now spend at least two-thirds of their time in office raising money for reelection.Oliver reports that elected officials spend at least four hours out of every work day inside Washington call centers. This time is entirely devoted to calling wealthy donors to solicit funds.Toward the end of the segment Oliver sits down with New York Congressman Steve Israel who recently announced his retirement from office, saying: I don t think I can spend another day in another call room making another call begging for money As John Oliver points out in the segment, every elected official in Washington is expected to raise a certain amount of funds for their respective political party.The amount of money a member of Congress is expected to bring in varies according to their position in Washington. An ordinary member of Congress might be expected to raise $125,000, for example. On the other hand, a representative with a greater amount of power and influence, such as Nancy Pelosi, is expected to raise as much as $800,000 for the DNC.During the interview Rep. Israel described how the current system skews the political system toward the rich.Describing what goes on inside a congressional call center, the congressman said: You have a bunch of cubicles set up, and those cheap fabric dividers, and you sit at a little desk, and you have a phone, and you have an assistant next to you, and you have a call book, and the call book has sheets of every donor, uh, past donors and their records, and your assistant gets a supporter on the phone and gives the phone to you and you engage in polite conversation and then you get to the point and then you hang up and then you flip the page to the next donor and then you make another call After John Oliver points out that it sounds like he s describing a  shitty telemarketing operation,  Rep. Israel responds by saying that he views it as  a form of torture.  He then points out that the real victims in all of this are the American people.He notes that the average American citizen believes that  they don t have a voice in this system. Because of the absurd amount of money that federal legislatures are forced to raise, elected officials can t afford to waste time on people unable to donate at least $1,000 to their campaigns.What this means is that if you have large amounts of money to donate to your Senator or Congressman, that money buys you access to an elected official. If you don t have that kind of money to contribute, you re basically out of luck.Watch the segment below, via Last Week Tonight on YouTube:Image credit: video screen capture via Last Week Tonight on YouTube",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chris Wallace Gets NC Governor To Admit That There Have Been No Crimes Committed In Bathrooms (VIDEO),"Fox host Chris Wallace pinned bigoted North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to the wall on Sunday.In response to the Department of Justice slamming his state for violating the civil rights of transgender people, the Republican governor appeared on Fox News Sunday to whine about it instead of staying at home to keep North Carolina from getting hit with the loss of federal dollars.North Carolina currently faces the loss of nearly $1 billion in education funding and millions of dollars in transportation funding if the state continues to defend the discriminatory law known as HB2, which allows business owners to discriminate against LGBT customers and employees for alleged religious reasons.Wallace asked how McCrory would respond to the letter sent to him by the DOJ earlier this week since he has until the end of business on Monday to either refuse to comply or tell them that North Carolina will repeal the law.McCrory complained that the federal government didn t give him enough time and claimed that the Justice Department is trying to make law because gender identity is not covered by the Civil Rights Act.Pressed on whether of not he will take the federal government to court to defend the law, McCrory blamed Democrats for the law by saying that they started the bathroom laws in the first place. But that simply isn t true. Democrats did not legalize discrimination against transgender people. In 17 states and over 200 cities across the nation, lawmakers pass transgender protections allowing them to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.Republicans, including McCrory, claimed that anti-trans bathroom laws are necessary to protect women and children from being sexually assaulted in bathrooms by someone using transgender protections as a way to get into women s restrooms and locker rooms. The problem is that there is not a single example of a predator doing that, unless you count the men that a conservative  Christian  group purposely sent into public restrooms to create a problem that doesn t really exist.In fact, Chris Wallace even managed to force Governor McCrory to admit that there is no evidence of transgender people committing crimes in bathrooms. Why not then just let it go,  Wallace asked,  if there s not a case of transgender people going in and molesting little girls? McCrory claimed that he hasn t made any such claims that such crimes would be committed, only to be called out by Wallace. McCrory then tried to frame the issue as a privacy issue. Again, Wallace reminded McCrory that transgender people just want to use the restroom and they aren t interested in violating a person s privacy.Wallace then addressed the boycott affecting the state s economy, bringing up that one study found that HB2 has cost North Carolina $77 million and 1,750 jobs. Rather than accept blame for this negative economic impact, which could get worse if the federal government pulls money from the state, McCrory launched into an attack on Paypal.Here s the video via YouTube:It sounds like North Carolina s Republican governor is preparing to wage a costly court battle with the federal government on the taxpayer s dime instead of just repealing the discriminatory law that caused all the outrage in the first place. Clearly, North Carolina residents should prepare themselves for further repercussions. And it s all because they elected bigots to control the state.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox Panel Glorifies This Vile Poverty Shaming Assault At Walmart,"Fox News recently aired a panel discussion over one of the right s new favorite videos online. Conservatives are falling in love with a viral video that shows a woman harass a man at a grocery store for buying food with benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).The woman accosts the man and  angrily states that she is not a  bleeding heart f*cking liberal  before she says that he must be a  Bernie supporter.  This woman embodies all that is wrong with the current generation of conservatism.The man defends himself, saying that he works 60 hours a week but still needs the extra support to help provide for his child. I put in 50, 60 hour weeks. Just because you see me doing this right now I m trying to provide for my family. Jonathan Hoenig, a hedge fund manager who is famous mostly for being a rich a**hole was on the Fox News panel, defended the woman s attack saying: I m proud of this woman. This is the producers and the looters. And you know what, she s absolutely right. You have every right to keep every cent of your money. It should be pointed out that this all happened at a Walmart. Walmart costs the U.S. about $6.2 billion dollars a year providing benefits such as SNAP to their employees because they refuse to pay their employees a higher wage. It s very likely that any Walmart employee who was working at the time of the incident would be using SNAP, or some other form of government assistance. In Hoenig s mind. those people are  looters  as well as everyone else who has ever struggled in their life.That s just a small taste of the hate and ignorance to come out of this particularly horrible Fox News panel.You can watch the Fox News panel segment below.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: SNL’s Church Lady Returns To Hilariously Mock Ted Cruz And Donald Trump,"Fresh off of being compared to Satan by John Boehner and dropping out of the 2016 presidential race, Saturday Night Live piled on by bringing back a familiar character to mock Ted Cruz.Dana Carvey returned for a special appearance as the Church Lady and the first guest was none other than Ted Cruz played by Taran Killiam, whom the Church Lady introduced as Satan.Cruz corrected the Church Lady, claiming that Boehner always has nicknames for him like  buster  or  son of a gun. I believe the phrase was  Lucifer in the flesh,  Church Lady responded.  A little bit different than  buster.' Church Lady then asked why the 2016 race didn t work out for him. I suppose the American people weren t ready for a candidate with strong Christian values,  Cruz explained.  Someone like me who follows the righteous path and lives his faith every blessed moment. Has anyone ever told you that you re just a little preachy,  Church Lady pointed out before noting that Cruz loves himself too much.  There it is,  Church Lady said noting Cruz s face.  That s that happy superior face because we love Jesus more than anybody. Cruz said that he believes everything that happened is part of God s plan. Was it part of God s plan for you to get humiliated by an orange mannequin? That s an odd plan for God to have for you,  Church Lady replied.Killiam s Cruz then mentioned that he s been told to go to hell so many times that he s thinking about turning evil and going there to check it out before letting out a creepy and awkward laugh. As he left, Church Lady told him that she would see him in hell.Church Lady then introduced Donald Trump as her next guest and promptly asked him if he ever reads the Bible.Trump, as played by Darrell Hammond, launched into how he enjoyed reading Corinthians Part Deux and Too Genesis, Too Furious. He then attempted to quoted from the Bible.  Love thy neighbor as thyself and like a good neighbor State Farm is there,  Trump said. He also said he loved the part where Game of Thrones character Jon Snow comes back from the dead.  That s great Bible,  Trump declared, leading the Church Lady to say her famous line,  Well, isn t that special. Here s the video via NBC.The way Republican candidates have obsessed with religion over the course of this election, it was definitely an appropriate time for the Church Lady to return.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Incoherent Lady Goes On CNN To Inform Paul Ryan She’ll Destroy Him For Bashing Trump (VIDEO),"If there s one thing politicians should be terrified of, it s the power and influence of Sarah Palin. You know, because her guy always wins. Oh wait, no, that s wrong. She s a joke and tries to stay relevant by grabbing onto the nearest coattails of anyone who will thrust her back into the spotlight.The failed former vice presidential candidate and reality television star is apparently furious Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) isn t backing Donald Trump, and she s hellbent on ending his career. Although, the only political career she s been great at destroying is her own.Palin told CNN s Jack Tapper, using  Cantored  as a verb, you know, like Eric Cantor,  I think Paul Ryan is soon to be  Cantored.'  Of course, Cantor was ousted in his primary back in 2014. A man who, as House Majority Leader, everyone assumed would be a shoo-in for Speaker of the House, a job that eventually went to Paul Ryan.I m sure Paul Ryan is trembling in his penny loafers.Watch Palin ramble on here about Ryan:Sarah Palin: Paul Ryan s  political career is over, but for a miracle  https://t.co/peFwtPCwKy #PalinOnCNN https://t.co/NxEo9lH0If  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 8, 2016 She wasn t done, though, Palin said:  His political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people, and as the leader of the GOP, the convention, certainly he is to remain neutral, and for him to already come out and say who he will not support is not a wise decision of his. No no, your political career is over, Palin. You. But she believes Ryan s ultimate goal is a White House run in 2020:  If the GOP were to win now, that wouldn t bode well for his chances in 2020, and that s what he s shooting for. Palin also insinuates that she ll be backing Paul Ryan s primary challenger in Wisconisn, Trump supporter Paul Nehlen, stating:  This man is a hard-working guy, so in touch with the people. Paul Ryan and his ilk, their problem is they have become so disconnected by the people whom they are elected to represent.

 WATCH: Sarah Palin Was Just Asked If She’ll Be Trump’s VP And Her Response Will Scare You,"Just when we thought that Sarah Palin was out of our lives, she seems to have found a way to creep back in. The self-described conservative and the vice presidential running mate of Republican senator John McCain in 2008 was asked whether she would be presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump s running mate. Palin said that she would be ready to serve but she worried about being a  burden  to the presumptive nominee. Palin said: I think I m pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country could be vetted. I think there are so many other great people out there in American that could serve in this position.I think if somebody wanted to choose me, they already know who I am, what I stand for. They wouldn t be in for any surprises.Palin did acknowledge that she came with lots of baggage. She said: I want to help and not hurt, and I am such a realist that I realize there are a whole lot of people out there who say,  Anybody but Palin.  I wouldn t want to be a burden on the ticket and I recognize that in many, many eyes, I would be that burden. So, you know, I just want the guy to win. I want America to win. Burden  is an understatement. A Trump/Palin ticket already sounds like a clown show but the thought of a Trump/Palin presidency is a terrifying prospect for America. As President Obama has warned, the presidency is not reality television or entertainment. It s the most powerful position in the world where important decisions must be made. Trump and Palin do not qualify to hold these positions.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BjYkd98_tc]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s First Major Lie About Hillary Clinton Fires Up His Ignorant Supporters,"If Donald Trump has proven one thing it s that he is a master of control. He learns keywords that keep simple people focused on him like kittens to a shiny object. He s figured out that ANY question can be answered with,  We re gonna do it better.  He doesn t need to provide explanations to people who don t understand the federal government outside of the guy they contract with to deliver the mail.Trump s carefully crafted message full of 4th-grade vocabulary appeals to ignorant bigots, uneducated racists and angry xenophobes. Those people all happen to be, or are now registered as, Republicans. Trump chose the Republican party because you don t need facts to win with their base. His campaign was a joke at first and spun into the colossus of stupid that it is now, all built on bullying and lies. Now that it looks like Clinton is going to be his opponent, Trump has begun selling what will turn out to be an effective lie for the conservative base: Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment.The Hill reports that at an event in Washington, Trump officially appealed to the gun nuts of America with a preposterous lie that, if his record is any indication, he will NEVER retract: Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to abolish it. Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to take the bullets away. Trump went on to tell the crowd how much we should all cherish the 2nd Amendment. By moving the conversation from racism, xenophobia and fear directly to guns, Trump is making a dangerous connection for some very stupid people. If the idiots who believe the right to beat up protestors you disagree with is in the Constitution, what are the chances they won t show their support for Trump s favorite amendment and show up armed? They won t get in, but they could engage in some friendly banter outside and maybe shoot someone.

 ‘You Are Donald Trump’s Worst Nightmare’: John Kerry’s Inspiring Message To Graduates (VIDEO),"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry delivered a rousing and inspiring commencement speech to the graduating class of Northeastern University on Saturday, defining the diverse and educated Americans as  Donald Trump s worst nightmare. Kerry addressed the students as they prepare to go out into the world and truly begin their adult lives, finding the careers, the friends and the partners that will form the focus of their lives. They will be America s next doctors, educators, carers, scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and yes, lawmakers. Standing before the, Kerry described what he saw as the basic failure of the Trump campaign   why the politics of hate and division cannot win the whole of America today, and certainly not tomorrow. You are the most diverse class in Northeastern s history.  he said.  In other words, you are Donald Trump s worst nightmare. The room broke out into massive applause, the students signaling clearly that they have not been dragged into the gutter politics fomented by the Trump campaign.The Secretary of State hit out at Donald Trump s bizarre and basic plans on immigration and foreign policy too   the sum total of which seem to be a) insult people and  b) build a wall. There are no walls big enough to stop people from anywhere, tens of thousands of miles away, who are determined to take their own lives while they target others,  Kerry reminded the GOP candidate.Kerry also had something to say about exactly what makes America great, and that it involves more than simply repeating it over and over again while parading about in front of a flag. We re not exceptional because we say we are.  he said, adding. Greatness isn t about bragging, it s about doing! It s about never being satisfied, it s about testing the limits of what we can achieve together. The speech totally lit up the graduating students, and serves as a reminder of the stark choice facing Americans come Election Day 2016. Whomever the Democrats choose as their candidate, the offer to America will be one of hope, progress, building America from the ground up   every child, every school, every hospital, every road, every bridge   to invest in a nation fit to face the challenges of the 21st century.The GOP will be offering the grim prospect of American regression. The blending of church and state, the withdrawal of women s reproductive rights, backward steps on understanding and prosecution of rape and sexual assault, a disrespect for education, science and technology which could push America even further behind in the most important fields of our time. A hollowed out, asset-stripped shell of a once great nation   stripped of all value, its people left to pick up the pieces.It is a serious choice, and it will be life and death   not only in terms of Trump s likely disastrous foreign policy, but because of what will happen to Obamacare, Medicare, and Medicaid if he comes to power. Make the right choice America.Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" 40,000 MA Drug Cases Could Be Thrown Out Because Of Drug Stealing Lab Scandal","A Massachusetts crime lab scandal could result in tens of thousands of criminal convictions being overturned. It s not the first time this has happened in the state either.As Addicting Info reported in May of last year, up to 60,000 drug cases were impacted by a scandal that rocked the Hinton Drug Lab, located in Boston, MA.In that case, a chemist by the name of Annie Dookhan plead guilty to 27 criminal charges, including  tampering with evidence, violating the state witness intimidation statute, multiple counts of lying to a grand jury, falsely claiming to carry a degree and others. Over a 14 year period, Dookhan forged documents, testified falsely in criminal cases and tampered with test results while employed as a chemist at the state crime lab.After Dookhan s confession thousands of convictions were overturned and hundreds of cases, which were still pending, were dismissed.The state of MA conducted a 15-month-long investigation into the crime lab, finding  a pattern of neglect, mismanagement, and poor standards. In spite of the state s findings, no other employees faced criminal charges. The Hinton lab was eventually closed down.Now another MA drug lab is facing a massive backlash, after court documents revealed a separate scandal involving drug use, evidence tampering and a series of other crimes earlier this week.As the Boston Herald reports, Amherst state lab chemist Sonja Farak was convicted in 2014 of tampering with evidence, theft and drug use inside the crime lab, where she was employed for more than eight years.At the height of her criminal activity, Farak was smoking crack ten to twelve times a day inside the crime lab, as well as using a host of other drugs which she obtained through the lab.Farak confessed to using the drugs at her work station, where she also tested samples submitted by law enforcement.She also confessed to being high while giving testimony in criminal cases and during interviews with police.While she was convicted of multiple crimes in 2014, officials did not disclose important details about how Farak s criminal activities had likely compromised tens of thousands of cases that she worked on.It took an order from the state Supreme Court to finally bring the extent of her misconduct to light.The ACLU released a statement on the Farak case, saying: The magnitude of the Amherst Lab misconduct rivals the similar scandal at the Hinton Lab, involving disgraced chemist Annie Dookhan, and the twin Massachusetts scandals have no known parallel elsewhere in the country. Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, went on to state: There is only one sensible response to these revelations: promptly notify the people who were denied due process, undo their wrongful convictions, and rethink the unjust war on drugs. The Boston Herald reports that Farak may have tainted the results in as many as 40,000 cases during the eight years she worked as a state crime lab chemist.Combined, the Dookhan and Farak scandals in MA alone could easily have caused more than 100,000 innocent people to be wrongfully imprisoned.If rampant corruption in just two state crime labs can result in the destruction of so many lives, we have to ask ourselves what is the impact when combined with corrupt law enforcement, corrupt courts and a corrupt penal system that thrives on profit?As the ACLU states here, fighting the failed war on drugs has only served to undermine the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.It s time to end the failed drug war, once and for all.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Desperate Republicans Meet With Romney To Discuss Independent Run,"On Thursday, failed 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney met with William Kristol. Kristol, considered an influential voice on the right, is leading the effort to draft an independent candidate to challenge the party s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.According to The Washington Post, Kristol and Romney met privately at the J.W. Marriott hotel in Washington to discuss the possibility of Romney entering the race as a third-party candidate.Kristol confirmed the  little meeting  during a phone interview with The Washington Post on Friday, saying: He came pretty close to being elected president, so I thought he may consider doing it, especially since he has been very forthright in explaining why Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton should not be president of the United States. The Washington Post reports that Kristol has been desperately seeking  a prominent political or military figure who could be drafted into the general-election contest,  in hopes of stopping Donald Trump.Kristol previously attempted to draft retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, who turned down the proposition.According to statements made by Romney later on Thursday, the former candidate said he is not interested in launching an independent run, however he appeared to wholeheartedly support the idea.The Washington Examiner reports that Romney said: I m certainly going to be hoping that we find someone who I have my confidence in who becomes nominee. I don t intend on supporting either of the major-party candidates at this point. He continued, saying: I am dismayed at where we are now, I wish we had better choices, and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better, and I just don t see an easy answer from where we are. No Republicans, there really is  no easy answer  from where you are. Where you are is totally screwed.There is no super-hero Republican  political or military figure  who is going to save the GOP from the monster it created. Even if there was, it certainly wouldn t be Mitt Romney, who was already trounced by Democrats in 2012.Lest we forget, the 2016 primary season began with 22 Republican candidates.The candidates included a long list of Republican  all-stars : Rick Santorum, Ben Carson, Bobby Jindal, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Jim Gilmore, Rand Paul, George Pataki, Lindsey Graham, Scott Walker, Jack Fellure, Andy Martin, Dennis Michael Lynch, Mark Everson, Jimmy McMillan and of course, Donald Trump. Needless to say, none of the other 21 primary candidates managed to stop Donald Trump.The fact that Republicans are now hoping against hope that somehow Mitt Romney can save the Republican party from certain death is almost comical.The Republican base clearly doesn t want another candidate. If they did, they could have picked any one of the 21 other morons who entered the 2016 primary race.Sadly, they want Donald Trump. Sadder still, they want Trump because his politics of hate aptly represent the dregs of society that the right-wing has been recruiting into the party for decades.Image credit: John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton Ties With Trump In The Very Republican State Of Georgia,"It s no secret has built a national coalition of minority voters. In the Democratic Primary, black and Hispanic voters came out and brought a sweep of the south for Clinton, thus edging her closer and closer to the nomination.It is this same minority population that might flip the southern state of Georgia in the November general election, and could tilt the electoral college in favor of Democrats for the first time since 1992. Before that, Democrats won in 1976 and 1980, when Jimmy Carter was president.A new poll from WSB 2 in Georgia shows a surprising result: Clinton and Trump are tied, 41 percent to 41 percent, with Trump winning whites and men and Clinton clinching women, African Americans, and Independents.Clinton is no fool. She knows perfectly well where she stands with Georgia. While appearing on ABC, the Democratic frontrunner pointed out that the state s demographics are growing in the Democrat s favor:In the last decade, Georgia s minority population has gone from 37%-44%. Eighty-one percent of the state s population growth has come from minorities. Blacks and Hispanics account for Georgia s population growth, and those two groups of voters are why the Clinton campaign seems to be gearing up to make a serious push to win Georgia.The only thing that could tip the scales in favor of Clinton is Independents. Although she leads Trump with them 36 percent to 28 percent, 38 percent remain undecided.If Clinton can tap into the Independent voters, and highlight just how crazy and destructive Donald Trump is, not only would Georgia turn blue, other southern sates could follow.And that s what Clinton is aiming to do:And I particularly want to support Democrats in states that have been voting against Democratic candidates for awhile now to rebuild the Democratic Party. We re going to try to make Georgia competitive, and we re going to fight hard in North Carolina and Virginia and Florida.Could there be a southern uprising in favor of Clinton? As the frontrunner looks towards the general election, stops in Ohio and Appalachia may also turn other red-leaning states blue.If Clinton keeps up her appeal to all (instead of just angry, white men), Democrats could have a great year. Georgia s latest poll is just one of more to come.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 8, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Newt Gingrich Just SLAMMED Romney, Dubya And His Daddy For Being Hypocrites And Babies (VIDEO)","The actors and actresses of Fox News have received their marching orders and the run to November will officially be the propaganda machine for Donald Trump. That s how it seems, at least, as hosts align themselves with people like Newt Gingrich, and other hard-core party liners who will vote for whomever has an (R) next to their name. Gingrich vowed his support for Donald Trump as well as his contempt for some party heavy hitters.After a shot at Mitt Romney for trusting the party voters to deliver the candidate they want, he turned his attention to the two former presidents, George W. and George H.W. Bush. Both of those historical failures have decided that they refuse to support Donald Trump, and nor will they attend the convention to initiate the Fourth Reich. Little brother Jeb has also chimed in that he ll be on the sidelines as well, as though he had a choice. Jeb was Trump s first real target. When it worked and Jeb dropped out, pundits everywhere were shocked. Then one by one they fell. All of the party elite; all of the establishment favorites.The money from the Koch brothers never appeared, because as evil as they are, they aren t stupid. Donald Trump ran the most effective underdog campaign in history by loaning himself money and going out and getting free press. Trump used the Republican Party and the agenda of fear and hate they ve fostered for far too long against them like a champ. The uneducated bigots crawled out of the woodwork to demand the country be great again and (insert required amount of rhetoric and lies).As the stupidity gained steam and made its way towards a downhill run to Cleveland, the party began to fracture. The pledge they made Trump sign now makes them look like massive hypocrites. What they re left with are fights of the magnitude of Gingrich versus Bush:Gingrich: ""When [HW, W & Romney] were the nominees they expected all of us to support them."" https://t.co/0dzSQiMZjfhttps://t.co/7cYf30HPLf  Fox News (@FoxNews) May 7, 2016Congratulations, GOP.

 Experts Warn This Trump Plan Would Cause ‘Global Financial Meltdown’,"Reality TV star and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump  has convinced thousands of people that he s an expert on business, finance, and commerce. There isn t much evidence of those claims, and as he consolidates his power at the head of the Republican Party, his words reveal a dangerous lack of knowledge about global economics.In an interview with CNBC (on the phone, of course) Trump proposed a radical idea. He told the interviewer that he would reduce the national debt by having the United States fail to pay back on the money it owes. I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal,  he told CNBC.  And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can t lose. Trump doesn t seem to understand that the United States economy isn t one of his many, many casinos and other ventures that he sent into bankruptcy at the expense of his investors (and rarely himself). To set him straight, Gene Sperling, who was an economic adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama, released a statement lacerating Trump s insane proposal: For Donald Trump to casually announce he would consider defaulting on our debt for the first time in our history shows a stunning lack of responsibility and understanding of the global economy,  he said.Sperling also pointed out that Trump s plan  would risk a global financial meltdown, drive up interest rates for Americans for decades, and seriously harm middle-class families. In case anyone might think that this is simply a case of a Democrat hitting Trump, Republicans and business experts also think his idea is bonkers:Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury Department under former President George W. Bush and a vocal member of the  Never Trump  movement, called the comments  dumb as a bucket of rocks.  Fortune Editor Alan S. Murray called them  scary. In Trump s first week as the Republican standard-bearer, he s revealing just how ill-prepared he is to govern, more than even your average modern Republican.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Rep. Ellison Predicts Rise Of Trump Almost A Year Ago,"This week, Senator Ted Cruz lost the Indiana primary and just days after picking his vice presidential candidate, dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination for the White House. Less than 24 hours after Cruz threw in the towel, Ohio Governor John Kasich gave up too, and there was one dumbass left standing: Donald Trump. Suddenly, a scary realization hit Americans across the country: A reality star is one step away from becoming president and we have no idea how this happened. Well, not everyone is surprised; in fact, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) took Trump seriously from the very beginning.A video of ABC s This Week With George Stephanopoulos from July 2015 is making the rounds on the internet in the wake of Trump s candidacy and it shows Rep. Ellison warning a panel about the rise of Drumpf. During the show s segment Ellison says: All I want to say is that anybody from the Democratic side of the fence who thinks that uh who s terrified of the possibility of President Trump, better vote, better get active, better get involved because this man has got some momentum and we better be ready for the fact that he might be leading the Republican ticket. Maggie Haberman of the New York Times and George Stephanopoulos laughed out loud and George said, I know you don t believe that  Ellison reasserted his warning explaining that Jesse Ventura won Minnesota and said,  I m telling you, stranger things have happened. Crooks and Liars named others who predicted his rise as well:It s not surprising then that among the folks that got it right last summer were liberals like Ellison:Digby, June 2015:  Donald Trump has the potential to be a serious 2016 player. And that says everything you need to know about the Republican presidential field and the state of our politics today.Michael Moore, December 2015: Donald Trump is absolutely going to be the Republican candidate for president of the United States. It s going from being a joke to being a serious reality.Robert Creamer at Huffpo, August 2015: Trump is not going away. He is, in fact, a real contender for the nomination.And we also predicted it, way back in August of 2015 with our article  These 16 Quotes Explain Why Trump Will Be The Republican Candidate. It s really shocking that so many people are surprised that Trump is the GOP nominee; I mean, this guy is the walking embodiment of everything right-wing. He, like many members of the Tea Party, does not believe that President Obama is American. He hates immigrants, but only the Hispanic and Muslim ones. He doesn t like black people. He disrespects women. He wants to send our kids to war. He hates the government, loves his tax breaks, has been endorsed by the KKK and lies ALL THE TIME. There is nobody more perfect to represent the Republican party and if you are shocked, frankly you haven t been paying attention.The only thing left to do, for the sake of this country, is put our infighting aside and vote blue   no matter who our candidate is.Watch Ellison s predictions:Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images ",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mexico’s Ex-President Mercilessly Trolls Trump For His ‘I’ll Bring Our Jobs Back’ Mantra (TWEETS),"Former Mexican President Vicente Fox already cemented his disdain for Donald Trump when he jumped on the business mogul for his border wall idea, saying Mexico would not pay for that f*cking wall. Now he s getting a kick out of trolling Donald Trump over other policies. The one he s attacking now? Trump s repeated claims that he s going to bring back all the jobs China supposedly stole from us.It s fairly well known that Trump s clothing line is made in primarily China, making him the king of hypocrites when he says we need to take our jobs back from there. Vicente Fox actually went on Twitter not just to point out that hypocrisy, but to bluntly slam Trump for it with a pic of himself wearing one of Trump s ties, and showing the label on the tie:Hey @realDonaldTrump, bringing jobs back to US   does that include your ties & shirts? #MadeInChina pic.twitter.com/e5SkBJC42b  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) May 6, 2016But wait! There s actually more to this. That tie might have been made in China, but Fox pointed out that other clothes in Trump s  Signature Collection  were made right next door in Mexico: Donald you are a cheat, again fooling US workers. V. Fox pic.twitter.com/QYcvfEVKEV  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) May 7, 2016In another tweet with the same photo as the above, he all but said he will be Trump s personal poltergeist for lying to the American people:Donald now manufacturing in Mexico.why you lie to American people? V. FOX YOUR SHADOW pic.twitter.com/crZZId1zB5  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) May 7, 2016And finally, Fox s pi ce de r sistance: A question about how much more expensive Trump s clothing line will become if he does manage to institute those heavy tariffs he keeps threatening for countries that  steal  our jobs: How expensive your suits & ties be if you tax them, @realDonaldTrump? It s insane to tax products made in China or Mexico #MadeInChina  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) May 7, 2016Fox went on CNN recently to criticize Trump s xenophobia, as well as the fact that he s taken advantage of outsourcing for his own profit. Trolling him on Twitter now seems to be a continuation of that, considering he told CNN: He s cheating the American people. It s lie after lie after lie. Does The Donald ever think about any of this? It s not likely. He s shown that he likes to just say whatever seems popular at the time, even if it means flip-flopping his positions. How s about he actually be an example to the rest of the country and bring his own manufacturing back first? Oh, wait, that would mean he has to stop taking advantage of a lot of things he s called  good business.  Scratch that.

 Former GOP Senator BLASTS Trump: ‘I Think He’s A Sociopath’,"The list of establishment Republicans who are refusing to support Donald Trump as the 2016 presidential nominee just keeps on growing. The latest is a former GOP senator from New Hampshire, Gordon Humphrey. Sen. Humphrey says that he will not be getting behind the billionaire for the presidency for one simple reason: he believes the man is a  sociopath.  When asked about supporting Trump during efforts to get the party to unite behind the presumptive nominee, Humphrey said: Unequivocally, I am not supporting Donald Trump. I think he s a sociopath. Now, these are strong words coming from within the GOP, but they are also most likely correct. Humphrey isn t the only one in the anti-Trump camp, either. Paul Ryan has yet to get behind Trump, and he is currently the highest ranking Republican in Congress. Further, GOP consultant Michael Biundo said the following via Twitter: By not supporting Trump, I am supporting our country. These statements are not, of course, stopping Trump s people from trying to get GOPers to get behind the business mogul s plans to become America s facsist dictator president. Trump has a chairman in New Hampshire, Steve Stepanek, who is urging people to get behind his man. He says: I am focused on bringing the party together. I m not going to be asking for any Republican s resignation at this point in time. I m asking Republicans to unite behind Donald Trump and the entire Republican ticket here in the state of New Hampshire. The thing is, though, Trump is the most divisive force that the GOP has seen in many years, possibly ever. He is the same for the country. His violent rhetoric, unhinged supporters, and irrational, mean-spirited behavior have made all sane people run as far away from this goon as possible, regardless of political persuasion. It doesn t matter at this point who you are   if you have one iota of decency or sense, you don t go anywhere near Donald Trump, and you work to stop his takeover of this great nation, no matter what it takes.Good going, Donald. You are literally destroying the Republican Party before our very eyes.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Starbucks And Barnes & Noble Joining Target In Saying FU To Haters,"While there has never been a confirmed instance of transgender people as child predators, this year s Republican pearl clutching is directed toward transgender people and their rights to use bathrooms. States are even passing laws trying to ensure that somehow, people s bathroom habits match up to their birth certificates.Yes, it s absurd, and some retailers are telling their customers exactly that by opening their bathrooms to any shopper, regardless of genitalia. Target was the first major retailer to do that and now, Starbucks and Barnes & Noble are joining them.Starbucks, Hudson s Bay Co. parent company to Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue and Barnes & Noble have all come out in support of trans people s rights to use the bathrooms that best align with their gender identities. HBC respects and affirms each person s right to self-identify and access facilities that reflect their gender identity,  said spokeswoman Tiffany Bourr .Starbucks spokeswoman Jaime Riley stated that the company is  looking into additional opportunities to have more gender-neutral signage in our restrooms where jurisdictions allow it. As a company, Barnes & Noble treats all employees and customers with dignity and respect,  spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating said.  For our transgender employees and customers, that means that they are allowed to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. Source: NewNowNextOf course, whiny conservatives are, well, whining.Thanks to Starbucks s idiotic gender neutral bathrooms, I won t be going there anymore.  Maggie Holmes (@magselizabeth15) May 1, 2016 Hey #BoycottTarget peeps, #barnesandnoble and @Starbucks have the SAME policy on bathrooms. That needs more attention.  DJ (@formadeo) April 30, 2016@InGodIDoTrust / Target bathrooms are fast rivaling starbucks as a libtard safe haven  CLAYVIS (@HAMnEGG_WILLIE) April 26, 2016For most Starbucks shops, this is little more than thumbing their noses at right-wing nut jobs. Most Starbucks bathrooms are single stall, so privacy is kind of a given.If you recall, it was just a few months ago when Starbucks was being boycotted by presumably some of the same people   people who objected to the fact that their Christmas cup didn t have Jesusy images like snowmen and Christmas trees. It was just blank.Here s the video:And still, Republicans don t get it. They don t get the point of our government. Young Conservatives, for example, said this, which sums up much of the argument against gender neutral bathrooms.It is very strange how many large companies are willing to completely ignore the safety of their customers just to pander to less than 1% of the population.Ironically, this is the argument used every time liberals suggest equality for everyone. It s true that transgender people are a tiny minority, but that s why they need legal protections. We have never been a true democracy. We don t bow to the tyranny of the majority. When African-Americans were legally integrated into society, the majority of citizens were white and the mouth breathers objected to their little girls being in a stall next to a little African-American girl. Obviously, integrated bathrooms didn t cause problems then and they cause no problems now. They are just the latest desperate grab at an ugly past when the only people who counted were white, male, cigenders and Protestant.Featured image via Getty Images.

 Bill Maher Shows America Why Donald Trump Must NOT Be President (VIDEO),"Bill Maher is not shy about what he thinks of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Maher unleashed a 6 minute destruction of the billionaire demagogue, at one point calling him a pu**y and a whiny little bit*h, saying that Trump fit  American stereotypes about 1950 s housewives. Maher said: Never forget, Lady Trump, that Hillary Clinton was born a woman. But you chose to live your life as a whiny little b*tch. Which is why, if Hillary is the Democratic nominee, I ll be voting for the only one who has balls. Maher continued: And like a  daffy  housewife of the  50s, Trump can t balance a checkbook. In a skit where Maher appeared to voice bewilderment and frustration that someone like Donald Trump actually has a shot at the presidency, Maher pointed to his personal experiences with the GOP demagogue, including the time Trump sued him for  challenging  him to prove he was not the son of an orangutan in response to Trump s  birther  rhetoric about President Barack Obama.Maher also criticized Trump s business dealings, pointing to his failures: Trump Airlines, Trump Casinos, Trump University, Trump Steaks. He s got the Midas touch   if every time Midas touched something it exploded. Maher is able to sum up the absurdity that is Donald Trump.

 Thousands Of Doctors Agree: Single-Payer Is The Way To Go,"Despite recent assertions from certain Democratic presidential candidates, the dream of a single-payer national healthcare system in the United States is alive and worth fighting for   even if it may not be implemented tomorrow. Thousands of physicians have recently endorsed a proposal to make that dream a reality.On Thursday, the Physicians for a National Health Program released their final proposal for creating a single-payer or as it is commonly referred to a  Medicare-for-all  national health care plan. The proposal was crafted by 39 top physicians and released in an editorial titled  Moving Forward from the Affordable Care Act to a Single-Payer System,  which was published in the American Journal of Public Health. The proposal also came with a political punch. At the time of the proposal s release 2,280 physicians and 168 medical students endorsed the plan. If you are a physician or work in the healthcare industry, you can endorse the proposal on PNHP s website. Our nation is at a crossroads,  said Dr. Adam Gaffney, a Boston-based pulmonary disease and critical care specialist, lead author of the editorial and co-chair of the Working Group that produced the proposal.  Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act six years ago, 30 million Americans remain uninsured, an even greater number are underinsured, financial barriers to care like co-pays and deductibles are rising, bureaucracy is growing, provider networks are narrowing, and medical costs are continuing to climb. PNHP notes that their proposal would  save about $500 billion annually by eliminating the high overhead and profits of insurance firms, and the massive paperwork they inflict on hospitals and doctors.  Furthermore, since there is only one health insurance plan, there would be no bars in place from insurers that prevent individuals from seeing whichever doctor they choose. That has been a major talking point for conservatives over the past few years that would be immediately invalidated. Going back to the cost savings benefits of the program, since there would only be one major healthcare provider, the cost of medications and other medical devices would almost instantly decline, due to strengthened negotiating power.It almost understandable why some progressives might think that a serious push for a single-payer healthcare system might be a waste of resources, and instead advocate for small reforms. However, I don t think that there has ever been a better time to go all in for a single-payer healthcare system.Republicans have been fighting the Affordable Care Act tooth and nail since its implementation. During this time, they have not been able to come out with any real alternative proposals or ways to improve the system. Instead, right-wing politicians and pundits have programmed their supporters to hate the ACA, or Obamacare, without question. Despite having an outright hatred for the concept as a whole, conservatives actually tend to have fairly high favorable attitudes towards specific elements of the plan.This gives progressives an incredible talking point to make   that they, too, want to end Obamacare. That may sound like a heretical statement to make considering the all-out rhetorical war that has raged over keeping the healthcare reforms in place for over half a decade. However, progressives shouldn t shy away from such a statement. The ACA was meant to end one day. It was created with the intention of being a stepping stone towards a single-payer system. That doesn t mean that the successful aspects of the law would need to be done away with if we switched to a single-payer system; if anything, the last few years have taught us much about how such a system would need to work in order to be successful.

 You Need To Hear What President Obama Just Said About The Importance Of Voting BLUE (VIDEO),"In case you have been living under a rock, Democrats got slaughtered in the 2014 midterm elections. That year featured voter turnout that was at its lowest since World War II. Unfortunately, Republicans thrive on low turnout   especially when they can take advantage of the Supreme Court s monumentally stupid decision to gut the Voting Rights Act. Already, we are seeing an impact. In 2016, GOP voters have been flocking to the polls to support their favorite KKK-endorsed bigot, Donald Trump. Democrats, however, have largely been staying home, especially in southern states.On Saturday, President Obama addressed the graduating class at Howard University, where he dropped a truth bomb on the crowd: if you stay home, we lose. Obama acknowledges that Republicans have managed to not only keep barriers in place even after the many decades since the Voting Rights Act was passed in the first place, but that they are also erecting  new barriers to vote  like nonsensical voter ID laws they claim will combat almost nonexistent voter fraud. But he also pointed out a harsh truth with which we need to come to terms: Democrats have a bad habit of not showing up to the polls. This is the only advanced democracy on earth that goes out of its way to make it  difficult for people to vote,  the President said, referencing the  legacy  of white supremacists attempting to limit the black vote.  But let me say this: even if we dismantle every barrier to vote that alone would not change the fact that America has some of the lowest voting rates in the free world. In 2014, only 36 percent of Americans turned out to vote in the midterms.  Obama told the students.  [It was] the second-lowest participation rate on record.  He particularly urged black voters to get their behinds to the polls. Noting the low African-American participation rates, President Obama reminded them that Democrats staying home  made a difference in what [he s] gotta deal with.  In other words, Democrats who stay home elect Republicans. People wonder,  how come Obama hasn t gotten this done  How come he didn t get that done?  he continued.  You don t think that made a difference? What would have happened if you had turned out at 50, 60, 70 percent all across this country? People try to make this political thing really complicated,  the President said pointedly, but it s actually quite simple: It s mad   If you have more votes than the other guy, you get to do what you want. It s not that complicated. And you don t have excuses. You don t have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar or bubbles on a bar of soap to register to vote. You don t have to risk your life to cast a ballot. Other people already did that for you. Then, he reminded us of what happens when we don t exercise our right to vote: When we don t vote, we give away our power, disenfranchise ourselves. Right when we need to use the power we have. Right when we need your power to stop others from taking away the voting rights of those more vulnerable than you are: the elderly, the poor, the formerly-incarcerated trying to earn their second chance. You need to vote all the time   not just when it s cool, not just when it s time to elect a President, not just when you re inspired. It s your duty. The President clarified that it s not just national elections that matter. It goes beyond who you put in the Oval Office, or with whom you fill the seats in Congress. It s important to vote for progressive policies at  every level. It is not that complicated,  the President said.  Don t make it complicated. In November, remember Obama s words   and do your duty.Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Dan Savage Destroy Ann Coulter For Her ‘Bullsh*t’ Obsession With Trump (VIDEO),"Ann Coulter is one of those blatantly offensive conservatives that most of us wish would just go away, but she continues to find a way to make herself seem somewhat relevant by spewing inflammatory remarks and hate speech on news shows.On Friday, Bill Maher had Coulter on Real Time, where she probably thought she was going to succeed in spreading her ignorant views and praise for Donald Trump. But Maher s show took another turn   instead, Coulter was mercilessly bashed by one of Maher s other guests, sex columnist Dan Savage.Savage, being more than familiar with Coulter s anti-immigration stance (which basically makes Trump her political soulmate), called Coulter out and brutally exposed the stupidity behind her beliefs. He asked: Why do we want to throw these 11 million people out of the country? They contribute more to our economy than they take out; they pay more in taxes than they receive in services; illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes per capita  Coulter cut Savage off, interrupting him with made up  facts  even though she claimed that his points were  untrue  and  false facts.  She added: Not only are they false facts, but if they are true facts then you need to go and elect people who will change the laws. Savage didn t let up. Referring to Trump s obsession with building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, Savage fired back and took Coulter s smug smile right off her face when he said, But your rationale for building this wall is bullsh*t. Coulter argued, No, the rationale is that he [would be] the commander-in-chief, he protects the borders. Those are the laws. Savage also made sure to rip the GOP as a whole just as hard as he railed against Coulter. Earlier in the conversation, Coulter made a comment that Savage  should be the spokesman for Hillary Clinton  because he was so judgmental and critical of the Republican Party. She   once again passing off lies as facts, said, That s gonna be a big hit with the American people   who are overwhelmingly voting for Trump. Savage didn t sugarcoat the truth for Coulter. He countered: No, the GOP base   which is overwhelmingly rubes, idiots, sexists, racists   are overwhelmingly voting for Trump. Truer words have never been said.You can watch Savage and Coulter s tense exchange below:Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Judge Lets Trump Postpone His Fraud Case Until Three Weeks AFTER The Election,"Thanks to an absurd legal ruling, Donald Trump won t have to answer to charges of defrauding people of tens of thousands of dollars until after the election. A federal judge decided it would be unfair to make him testify while he s running for office   presumably because it could give people the impression that he s a conniving huckster who fleeces gullible rubes in order to line his pockets. Heaven forbid.Trump s lawyers were extremely satisfied that they managed to convince a federal judge to schedule Trump s trial   including his appearance on the witness stand   after a previous judge had scheduled the hearing for June. It could have seriously hurt his political career. Instead, a San Diego judge told Trump s legal team that the law could wait until late November   three weeks after the election.Donald Trump will testify after the presidential election on a class-action lawsuit that accuses the billionaire businessman and his now-defunct Trump University of defrauding people who paid up to $35,000 for real estate seminars.It seems likely that, should Trump win, the lawyers will change their mind about Trump attending the trial, however. He ll be busy organizing his transition team and preparing to move to the Oval Office (or moving the Oval Office to Trump Tower, perhaps).It would seem that getting to the bottom of whether or not Donald Trump willfully defrauded eager students of non-existent  real estate seminars  of $35,000 would be very important for voters who are deciding whether or not to put that man in office. As it stands, most voters will likely have no idea of the pending litigation against Trump come Election Day.As if to highlight the baffling favoritism, the FBI recently announced that despite not finding any evidence that Hillary Clinton committed any crimes with her emails, they are asking her to come into conduct a series of interviews with them just to be sure. The meetings will be sure to be covered wall-to-wall on the news networks and will lend further credence to spurious claims that she had done something wrong. Fair and balanced.So there we have it: One candidate who has never been charged is subjected to endless scrutiny and legal harassment. Another who has more pending and settled lawsuits than any presidential candidate in U.S. history got a federal judge to do him a solid and postpone justice for the people who he ripped off before he decided he d move onto bigger scams. If the moral arc of the universe does indeed bend towards justice, than we are still clearly behind the curve.Featured image via Tom Pennington/Getty Images",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Alabama’s Homophobic Chief Justice Roy Moore Kicked Off Bench For Ethics Violations,"Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore is finally facing the music for his refusal to follow the law. The notoriously bigoted justice has been suspended from Alabama s Supreme Court for ethics violations. HALLELUJAH!If you recall, earlier this year, Moore made national headlines when he ordered the state s judges to refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The Chief Justice s order said: Until further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect. His actions were in clear violation of the Supreme Court of the United State s Obergefell v. Hodges decision which granted gay couples equal protection under the 14th Amendment and legalized marriage equality. Moore, believing that he was more powerful than the SCOTUS decided that he didn t like their decision, so he wasn t going to allow his state to abide by it. This decision has cost him his seat on the Alabama Supreme Court. According to a the Montgomery Advertiser:The Judicial Inquiry Commission Friday charged Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore with violating ethical rules, over his attempt earlier this year to stop probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses. The six charges led to Moore s immediate suspension in the role.Unfortunately, Moore will still be paid during his suspension, but the charges could lead to him losing his seat on the bench permanently. When the complaints were first levied against the bigot, he claimed that they were  politically motivated  and said he was just listening to the people of his state. AL.com reached out to Moore on Friday and he said that he is ready to fight the LGBT agenda: The Judicial Inquiry Commission has no authority over the administrative orders of the chief justice of Alabama or the legal injunctions of the Alabama Supreme Court prohibiting probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses. The Judicial Inquiry Commission has chosen to listen to people like Ambrosia Starling, a professed transvestite and other gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals, as well as organizations that support their agenda. Like most ignorant Republicans, Moore doesn t seem to comprehend the fact that he is not above the law. The Supreme Court has more power than he does and they ruled on this issue already. That means that when he refused to abide by their ruling, he was violating the law and the Constitution. That s not an  agenda,  it s the reality of the laws of our land. If Moore s personal beliefs prevented him from carrying out the duties of his position, he deserved to be removed and anything less would have been a violation of the rights of the citizens of Alabama.Featured image via Gary Tramontina/Getty Images",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 American Airlines Throws Ivy League Economist Off Plane For Doing Math,"Ivy League economist Guido Menzio has reportedly been removed from an American Airlines flight and interrogated after being found in possession of algebra.Menzio had been seated next to a female passenger on the plane who became suspicious that her dark-skinned fellow traveler was writing in a script with which she was unfamiliar. The female passenger then reported Menzio immediately and secretly to cabin crew as a suspected terrorist. She left the plane, citing illness as her excuse. Meanwhile, other passengers began to grumble at the delay. A short while later, Menzio was also escorted from the plane on grounds he would only be made aware of later.When security began to interrogate him about the woman who had left   so far as Menzio knew   due to illness, he believed he was playing a role in supporting their inquiries as to her condition. But they then revealed it was Menzio who was under suspicion and being interrogated as a suspect terrorist.As the Washington Post reports:Had the crew or security members perhaps quickly googled this good-natured, bespectacled passenger before waylaying everyone for several hours, they might have learned that he  Guido Menzio is a young but decorated Ivy League economist. And that he s best known for his relatively technical work on search theory, which helped earn him a professorship at the University of Pennsylvania and stints at Princeton and Stanford s Hoover Institution.They might even have discovered that last year he was awarded the Carlo Alberto Medal, given to the best Italian economist under 40. That s right: He s Italian, not Middle Eastern, or whatever heritage usually gets racially profiled on flights these days.The suspicious scrawl which so perturbed the female passenger and flight crew was nothing more than math. Algebra to be precise.The renowned economist said of his experience in a Facebook post:It s a bit funny. It s a bit worrisome. The lady just looked at me, looked at my writing of mysterious formulae, and concluded I was up to no good. Because of that an entire flight was delayed by 1.5 hours.Trump s America is already here. It s not yet in power though. Personally, I will fight back.Manzi becomes the latest among a litany of Muslim and non-Muslim people to have their lives interrupted and they character made suspect by the sort of casual racism and fear promoted by not only Donald Trump, but much of the mainstream media and conservative political class. After the horrors of McCarthy era America, we would hope the nation would have learned a valuable lesson on restraint. It appears not.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons/Penn Arts and Sciences",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Senate Republican Says Dumpster Fires Are More Popular Than Trump, Calls For Third Party Run","Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse seems to be fed up with his party, and there s no way in hell he s going to vote for Donald Trump. In a lengthy Facebook post, the Nebraska Senator called for a third party run to stop Trump. While he was certainly none too kind to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, he made it clear that his sights are set on stopping Trump from getting anywhere near the White House. Here is the embed of the post:Now, anyone with any sense regarding how our political process works knows that there s no way in hell a third party candidate can win in the current climate. In other words, if others jump ship like Senator Sasse has, the GOP throws the election to Clinton. Yep, you read that right. There is at least one senator in the Republican Party who is already openly willing to pursue a track that goes against his own party s nominee. That is how much he hates Trump.He isn t the only one, either, most likely. House Speaker Paul Ryan has already come out and said that despite the fact that Trump is his party s presumptive presidential nominee, that he cannot support him at this time. Further, there are plenty of Republicans who are struggling with the idea of supporting a nomination where Donald Trump is at the top of their ticket. It s about time   finally, there are Republicans who are at last somewhat sane who have drawn a line in the sand to show that they value their country over their party. There was a time when this would never have been the case. That is how bad Trump is.Now, again, Sasse was no friend to Democrats in this post, but his response to the idea of a Donald Trump nomination is quite telling. The guy is no friend to Trump as the GOP nominee.Featured image via Bill Clark/Getty Images",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Failed GOP Candidates Remembered In Hilarious Mocking Eulogies (VIDEO),"Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee, it s time to remember all those other candidates who tried so hard to beat him in the race to the White House. After all, how can we forget all the missteps, gaffes, weirdness, and sheer idiocies of such candidates as Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina?There s a video making the rounds on Twitter that does just that, and eulogizes three of these failed candidates as though they re dead (and the GOP itself might as well be dead at this point anyway). Appropriately titled,  A Eulogy for the GOP,  people make short speeches about each of these candidates.Once past the man who actually says Jeb Bush was qualified to be president, there are fake tears, with journalist and comedienne Francesca Fiorentini saying: Dearly beloved, we re gathered here today to commemorate the candidates that are no longer with us. One man, speaking to an amusing, circus-y rendition of Chopin s Funeral March, remembers Jeb this way: Jeb, we hardly knew ye. It s too bad that your policies couldn t find their way out of the Republican morass. Indeed, it was like Jeb and his policies were invisible sometimes, although many felt that he would win the nomination early on. His best performances often came during debates, when he d get into out-and-out fights with Donald Trump over virtually everything under the sun. He also had a bad habit of defending his brother s actions in Iraq, memorably saying,  As it relates to my brother, there s one thing I know for sure: He kept us safe. Moving on to Marco Rubio, Fiorentini herself says: He was called so many things:  Young, charming, Lil  Marco.' That last nickname is, of course, a reference to Trump s penchant for name-calling. Then, a man speaking Spanish remembers Rubio this way: Marco, why aren t you a normal boy? Another said that his involvement in the Gang of Eight immigration bill killed him as a candidate, to which Fiorentini replies: Some people die of gang violence. He died of Gang of Eight violence. The makers of this video saved the absolute best for last, of course, which is Ben Carson. On our dear Dr. Carson, one of the speakers says: He would gently rock me to sleep with his monotone voice. Carson was especially well known for seemingly being asleep half the time. If we saw his eyes open wide, it was surprising, and likely because he was surprised himself. His voice is soft, his speech is slow, and it really can be hard to stay awake while he s talking. Imagine him giving a State of the Union address!To see the whole video, especially the spectacular ending after Carson s eulogy, watch below:Take a moment to say your g byes to these GOP candidates. ? https://t.co/6O70bl9zV8  AJ+ (@ajplus) May 7, 2016 Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"May 7, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Liberal Redneck Completely Demolishes Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"Yesterday, Trae Crowder, otherwise known as the Liberal Redneck, released an awesome YouTube comedy segment celebrating the demise of Ted Cruz.After his devastating loss in Indiana on May 3, Cruz solemnly resigned from the republican presidential primary race. While a few of his supporters booed at the announcement, the overwhelming majority of Americans were anything but sad to see Cruz drop out.Crowder devoted a short segment to the topic, beginning his monologue by announcing that  everyone s favorite murder-lizard has dropped out of the race. He goes on to recite the story of how Ted Cruz came to run for president, explaining: The Cruz family spent hours praying about about whether or not he should run, until god came down and spoke to his wife directly and said he should. Continuing with the story, he says  and so Ted hit his knees and offered himself up and said  I m your servant lord, use me in this as you see fit. Now that Ted has admitted that there is no possible way he can ever become president, Crowder surmises what this means, saying: To Ted, the use that his lord picked out for him was to completely destroy the republican party as we know it, while getting dusted by a carny-handed mango man. It s comedy, but the Liberal Redneck makes some great points in the segment, honing in on the message that Cruz s abject humiliation sends to right wing Christian extremists.That message is clearly  ya ll have lost. Crowder points out that Cruz could not beat a guy  who could come out tomorrow and announce Hulk Hogan as his running mate. But the ultimate message sent to the Christian right by Cruz s butt- spanking is that we re done with this. Crowder sums it up by saying: We re done with you wasting our time on trivial bullshit like laws about who uses what bathroom and how gay a cake s allowed to be before you gotta call a prayer circle. We re done. Watch the video below, courtesy of Liberal Redneck via YouTube.

 Whoops: VA Gun Shop Employee Accidentally Shoots Herself,"An employee of Safeside Tactical in Roanoke, Virginia accidentally shot herself in the leg on Thursday, May 6 during a private event being held inside the gun store. According to local station WDBJ7, the shooting took place just before noon, while the business was closed to the public.Roanoke City Police Department and Roanoke Fire EMS were called to the scene. The shooting victim was transferred to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where she is being treated for non life-threatening injuries.According to a statement released by the company, the injured employee works in an administrative position.The company stated: All of our employees undergo required firearm safety training upon hiring, and this unfortunate incident shows that even experienced firearm owners must be ever-vigilant and aware of the responsibilities associated with safe handling. According to the NRA, guns make for a safer society. Following that line of reasoning, a gun shop should be the safest place in the world. This is just one of many incidents where people have been accidentally or purposely injured by a firearm while surrounded by guns.On January 9, 2015, for example, four people were shot inside a gun store in Shawnee, Kansas.A few months later, a Fayetteville, NC man shot himself in the leg while attending a gun show.In November 2015, two men were shot at a gun show in Idaho when a vendor  accidentally fired a rifle. In January of this year, somewhere between one and three people were shot at a gun show in Ohio. Authorities were unable to determine the exact number of people who were shot at that event.Also in January of this year, two people were killed and two others injured during a father-son shootout at a gun store in Mississippi.All of the people involved in these shootings were surrounded by guns when they were injured or killed. Contrary to what the NRA says, being surrounded by guns does not make a person less likely to get shot. In fact, the opposite is true. The more guns that people have access to, the greater their risk of being injured or killed by one.Featured image via Ratha Grimes via Flickr cc 2.0 ",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Open To Being Clinton’s V.P. (VIDEO),"Hillary Clinton is on the path to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. As the convention nears, Clinton and Sanders are still battling for every last vote, and rightfully so. But as the contest continues, supporters of both sides have descended into a fighting match over who would be the better option.But what if they both joined forces to take down Donald Trump?Well, while appearing on CNN with Wolf Blitzer, Bernie Sanders left the door open to being Hillary Clinton s vice presidential running mate. When asked, Sanders responded: Right now, we are focused on the next five weeks of winning the Democratic nomination. If that does not happen, we are going to fight as hard as we can on the floor of the Democratic convention to make sure that we have a progressive platform that the American people will support. Then, after that, certainly Secretary Clinton and I can talk and see where we go from there. Imagine if Sanders and Clinton joined forces to take down the xenophobic blowhard Donald Trump. Uniting liberals, progressives, moderates and independents with two strong candidates could bring a landslide election that Democrats need to cement a longer lasting legacy.While Republicans are jumping ship at the prospect of Trump being their nominee, Sanders decides to keep the greater good in sight.Sanders has already pledged to work with Democrats on building a progressive party platform, as has Clinton. The prospect of a Clinton-Sanders ticket would push the frontrunner further to he left, a move her campaign says will not continue. Should Clinton continue to move left, her campaign fears, would turn off moderate and independent voters who might be swayed by Donald Trump s impending  softer  image.Media outlets have listed an impressive group of progressive leaders to be Clinton s V.P. pick, including Senators Sherrod Brown (OH), Tim Kaine (VA), Elizabeth Warren (MA) and Bernie Sanders. Others include Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Health and Human Services Secretary Julian Castro, and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick.Senator Sanders hasn t named off any potential V.P. picks yet, considering his climb to nomination is steep. Clinton hasn t come out with any selections yet, but that doesn t mean outlets aren t itching to guess.Some say Clinton shouldn t pick Sanders, saying Vermont is not strategic, and could be seen as a pander and a power grab.But we say it could be a powerhouse of progressive values that would resonate with the majority of Americans.Watch the Senator s remarks, courtesy of CNN: Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Elizabeth Warren Strikes Back At Trump After He Responds To Her, And It Is EPIC (TWEETS)","When dealing with a candidate who has the maturity level of an elementary school student, you re going to have to expect name-calling, and now Donald Trump is now using this tactic against Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren. Two very powerful women, but two very powerful women that aren t about to put up with his horseshit tactics. They may have worked against his ridiculous Republican competition, but no, not now.

 78 Year Study BLOWS AWAY Republican Lies About Raising Wages,"It s been about seven years since minimum wage employees have gotten a raise, at least on the national level. Few workers would settle for that, but for some reason, giving minimum wage employees a boost would crash the economy   or at least that s what billionaire CEOs tell us. A new study, though, proves that raising the minimum wage doesn t hurt the economy at all.When conservatives talk about the minimum wage, it s always about  burger flippers  and about somehow, they aren t entitled to a living wage. They also like to compare minimum wage employees to the military, who also deserves a raise, but has many of their living expenses taken care of.The whole minimum wage thing is ridiculous, you shouldn t get paid $15 an hour to flip a burger. That doesn t take much skill.  Evan (@Evvaaannnn) May 5, 2016 @Allen33Devin @hannahc3rvantes if they raise minimum wage the next thing you know a burger at the same place will be like 8 bucks lol??

Dennis Beaudo (@Bodowned) April 30, 2016Minimum wage is minimum wage. A burger flipper that burns burgers should not make more than an EMT that saves lives in the back of a truck.  Johnny Iceman (@TEbron35) April 26, 2016Republican politicians are slightly kinder in tone, but not much: Oftentimes when you have the federal government or others step in and start to raise minimum wage, what happens is you take away or reduce some people s opportunity to grab the bottom rung of the economic ladder to get the opportunities and the skills that you need to move up that economic ladder.    Kevin Madden on CNN s State of the Union When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it. Why do we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?    John Boehner I think it is inflationary. I think it actually is counterproductive in many ways. You end up costing jobs from people who are at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.    Paul Ryan We re telling small-business owners that not only are we going to raise their costs by a buck and a quarter, but we re also going to raise it with these cost-of-living adjustments. Here s what s going to happen: They re going to have to lay people off.    Gov. Chris ChristieIt s easy to be smug and dismissive about the people who serve our fast food. Fast food isn t about people, or really even food. It s about jamming the most calories into our mouths in the shortest period of time.While food service accounts for a large portion of minimum wage workers, there are many other industries that also pay minimum wage and only about a quarter of the people making minimum wage are teenagers. Many are single white women, often single mothers. With the exception of some of the teens, every single minimum wage worker is struggling to pay their bills and Republicans reading this (and unfortunately, some Democrats) are still shrugging their shoulders. After all, the poor aren t really people, are they? Besides, cheap burgers and made in China Walmart clothes are far more important.Well, the National Employment Law Project just proved, through 78 years of research, that increasing the minimum wage does not increase prices. In fact, during that 78 year period, whenever the minimum wage was increased, employment increased 68 percent of the time.In those industries most affected by the minimum wage, employment increases were even more common: 73% of the time in the retail sector, 82% in low-wage leisure and hospitality. These basic economic indicators show no correlation between federal minimum-wage increases and lower employment levels,  the authors write.In fact, if anything, the data suggest that increases in the federal minimum appeared to encourage job growth and hiring.Perhaps even more striking, of the only eight times that total or industry-specific employment declined after a minimum-wage increase, the US economy was already in recession (five times), technically just emerging from recession (twice), or about to head into recession (once).Source: Business InsiderWe would have about 11 million more jobs today if Congress had allowed a minimum wage increase when President Obama began asking for one.Featured image via Kena Betancur at Getty Images.

" FBI Turns Up No Evidence, Says Hillary Clinton Committed No Criminal Wrongdoing","Sorry Republicans, but your newest vast right-wing conspiracy against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has officially fallen flat. The newest rounds of interrogations began in the fruitless  Email Gate  against the former Secretary of State, and as expected, she has not been found to have engaged in any criminal wrongdoing or willful violation of the law.According to CNN:The interviews, we re told, are focused on whether classified information was mishandled, and the security of the server. So far officials tell us, no, there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing at this point in the investigation, but, again, the investigation is not over.Yes, the investigation is not over, but it certainly isn t going anywhere. After poring though thousands of documents, countless interviews with aides including Clinton s personal assistant Huma Abedin, and immunity offers on the table:CNN has previously reported that another former Clinton employee, Bryan Pagliano, who helped set up the server has provided documents and other materials as well as interviews to the FBI, under an immunity agreement. FBI officials overseeing the probe now expect to complete their work in the next few weeks and then turn over the findings to the Justice Department, which will make a final decision on whether to bring charges against anyone.There still has not been a smoking gun. And like every other  scandal  in Clinton s life, there won t be. And considering that the Justice Department has been aiding the FBI in the investigation, and the FBI has turned up nothing, it s highly improbable the DOJ will.Even though it isn t over, CNN s Pamela Brown has word that it will be wrapping up soon, once a date to interview Hillary Clinton is scheduled and done in secret, as to not attract any unnecessary media scrutiny. However, due to Clinton s crunched campaign schedule, the FBI is having a hard time sitting the frontrunner down for said interview.Donald Trump and other Republicans (and even some left wing voters) are anxious to see Clinton go down for something as silly as emails. However, it isn t going t0 happen. Time to focus on the issues.Featured image Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Dick Cheney Just Did The Most Disgusting Thing Since Lying About WMDs In Iraq,"What could Dick Cheney, engineer of the wars that will go down in history as criminal at best, possibly do that is worse than lying to the American people about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in a fraudulent ploy to gain public support for a war we had no exit strategy for? Cheney told CNN Friday that he would be backing Donald Trump just like he would back anyone else who was on the Republican ticket.That s a stark difference of opinion from Cheney s old Oval Office Puppet, George W. Bush or his brother and daddy, all of whom have vowed not to support Trump in the general election and to skip his nomination at the convention this summer in Cleveland. Mittens Romney has also openly stated that he wouldn t support Donald Trump along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and a slew of other high-ranking establishment Republicans.So why is Cheney sticking around while the party goes about the business of trying to hand our nuclear codes to an idiot? Because he s done it already. In 2001, a complete moron walked into the White House, unqualified to order a sandwich, and somehow Dick Cheney gave him a legacy. Sure it s a legacy of poverty and despair; war and death. Financial collapse isn t such a bad way to end an administration, is it?Cheney knows full-well that Donald Trump, if elected, will be looking back at everyone who abandoned him and you can bet your bottom dollar that Dick Cheney will be listed as adviser in some capacity. That s the kind of West Wing we ll be looking at. Whoever will take the job will be the number one contender for almost every position of power. If you re looking for a career in politics that will come to an abrupt end in four years or less, take a spot in the Trump Administration. Not that it will really matter. The cabinet will fill up with people we ve never heard of to whom Donald Trump owes a special favor.One thing is certain: Cheney has definitely hit the low spot in his life if he s reduced to supporting The Donald.Featured image by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Listen To Reaction Of U.S. Troops When David Letterman Suggests Obama/Biden Third Term,"While speaking in front of United States servicemembers at a recent USO event with both President Obama and Vice President Biden, David Letterman made a joke that many of us would really like to be a reality. He played off his age and said that his mind seemed to be playing tricks on him. He claimed that by listening to the two men speak, he thought the president and vice president were running for a third term.Letterman told the USO crowd: I don t know, sometimes the mind plays tricks on a person, especially when you get to be my age. I was listening to the president speak. I was listening to the vice president speak. And, for a split second, my mind said to me,  oh, that s nice, they re running again.' Which at first was received by laughter, and then uproarious applause and cheers.And while it s true that President Obama cannot run for a third term, if he could, he would likely win. History will be very kind to Obama as all of his accomplishments make him one of the greatest leaders in the history of the republic.Watch the clip here: USO Crowd Roars As David Letterman Jokes About  by DailyPoliticsFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: President Obama Issues Warning About Trump Nomination And Every American Should Listen,"It s still hard to conceive that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party and, although in the past the GOP has produced bad candidates   like George W. Bush   capable of doing serious damage to the country, a Trump presidency could certainly finish the disastrous job Bush started.President Obama has tried to fix the damage Bush and the GOP caused America and he will be leaving with a stronger country than when he came into office. No one knows more than President Obama what had to be done to fix the economic, social, and political damage Bush caused the American people. No one knows more than President Obama that the most powerful and critical position in the world is no laughing matter. That s why the president s statement about Trumps  presumptive nomination came with a warning. The President said: I think it s important for us to take seriously the statements he s made in the past. But most importantly, and I speak to all of you in this room as reporters as well as the American public. I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job. Obama went on to add: This is not entertainment, this is not a reality show. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States. And what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny. While many in the media and the public have found Trump s antics entertaining, the joke will be on all of us if this man, who many never believed would get this far, becomes president. It s important that America goes out and votes this November. We can t go back to the Bush years of war and recession.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALku3gpLnSw]Featured image via video screenshot.

 Moms With Transgender Kids Have A BRILLIANT Message For Anti-LGBT Conservatives (VIDEO),"Moms of transgender children have just sent every fearmongering transphobic conservative a message that is going to make them furious. In response to the massive amount of hatred and bigotry that has been thrown at the trans community over the last few months, these amazing mothers have given anti-LGBT bigots a brilliant   and sometimes heartbreaking   look at the people who are on the receiving end of the attacks.The video, entitled  Meet My Child , was created by the Trans United Fund for the many transgender adults and children who have been discriminated against and attacked by politicians in 20 states via initiatives like  bathroom bills  in North Carolina. These lawmakers have made it their personal mission to strip trans people of their basic human rights and have Attempted to advance over 50 pieces of legislation attacking transgender people. These policies are a real danger to transgender people and hurt the most vulnerable, including America s transgender children. Meet My Child features three mothers sharing amazing stories of acceptance and love, as well as the process their families when through when their child expressed that they were transgender. The moms in this video want every anti-trans person to know the full extent and consequences of the bigotry they re promoting, which often ends in violent attacks on transgender people. In one particularly emotional moment, a mother with a trans daughter can hardly hold back tears as she says, She s my heart and I don t want to lose her.  The film also leapt at the opportunity to blast conservatives like former Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz for spewing bigotry that puts these children in harm s way.You can watch the amazing message below: What these mothers have shown is exactly what brilliant parenting looks like. Conservatives claim to be so concerned about babies and family values, but only when families and children fit into their narrow-minded view of what a family unit  should  look like. These moms have done an incredible job showing the world what real love and support looks like, and the GOP could certainly learn a thing or two from them.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Michael Moore Tells Fox News The Only Way He’d Get ‘Behind’ Trump, And It’s Hilarious (VIDEO)","Now that the Republican choice for president is presumably Donald Trump, many are being asked who they ll support in the general election and if they could actually get behind a Trump presidency. So, when Megyn Kelly had documentary filmmaker Michael Moore on her show, she asked him just that.Kelly knew that Moore is a Bernie Sanders supporter and it s looking like Hillary Clinton will be the nominee. There have been some Sanders supporters who say they ll switch to Trump, because they can t support Hillary. These are the same people who would seemingly cut off their nose to spite their face. It s also the epitome of privilege, because these folks clearly have nothing to lose if Trump wins.Fortunately, Moore is not one of those people. When asked by Kelly,  Let s say it is Trump-Clinton. A guy who understands the working class, has made some films involving them, from Flint, Michigan. Could you get behind Donald Trump?  Moore sarcastically responds: Only to help push him somewhere. Then he stops short, and says: Wait a minute, he has Secret Service protection now, I shouldn t say that. And Kelly hilariously, and accurately responds: You d be the one getting pushed. Moore then says: I would push him to a more gentle place away from everybody. Clearly, Moore knows that we cannot have Trump as President of the United States. He also makes it clear that Trump is not who he makes himself out to be and is conning his conservative supporters just to get votes. Hopefully, more people follow Moore s lead and err on the side of making sure Trump never becomes president, instead of taking their ball and going home by declaring a moral victory by voting against Hillary if she is to become the nominee.Trump is a con artist and a crafty businessman who has built his career by manipulating people into giving him want he wants. Don t fall for it, America. Please.Watch Kelly interview Moore here, with the question regarding if he could support Trump beginning at the 4 minute mark:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAekxrKhFCgFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Black Woman SHUTS DOWN Hundreds Of Marching Neo-Nazis With One Powerful Message (VIDEO/IMAGES),"Never underestimate the impact a single person can have. Just last weekend, one of the most powerful stands against racism we ve seen this year was performed by a lone black woman.Tess Asplund, who is a 42-year-old anti-racism activist in Sweden, took a courageous stand against hundreds of neo-Nazis from the far-right group Nordic Resistance Movement. As she saw the group of 300 white men marching down the street, Asplund protested by standing in front of the advancing group of men, looked them dead in the eyes and raised her fist in an act of defiance. The group pushed her out of the way, but not before the iconic moment was captured on camera. This photograph has now been shared around the world.Twitter#TessAsplund sfida i nazisti svedesi con un pugno chiuso. Immagine simbolo dell antifascismo. pic.twitter.com/vQ7X3nb4Sm  Antonio Sicilia (@siciliantonio) May 5, 2016Even famous author J.K. Rowling was inspired by Asplund s message.TwitterTwitterWhat Asplund did was more than courageous, and the impact of her protest was felt around the world. In an interview with the Guardian, Asplund shared what inspired her to take such bold action: It was an impulse. I was so angry, I just went out into the street. I was thinking: hell no, they can t march here! I had this adrenaline. No Nazi is going to march here, it s not okay. Although Asplund said she s been  overwhelmed  and  extremely embarrassed  by the amount of attention the photo has gotten, she hopes that it will inspire others. Asplund said: I have fought against racism for 26 years. I am 42 now. And if this is a thing that makes people pay attention to the fight against racism and xenophobia, then that s very good. But I don t want people to see me as a symbol. There were a lot of others who were there against the racists in Borlange. Because of all the attention the photo has gotten, Asplund reveals that her friends are concerned for her safety, but it is a small price to pay if it gets more people to stand up to racism and hate. Now it s a circus. I am in shock. The Nazis are very angry, so I am a little  Oh shit, maybe I shouldn t have done that, I want peace and quiet.  These guys are big and crazy. It s a mixed feeling, but I am trying to stay calm. If this picture of me can get more people to dare to show resistance, then it s all good. The people must unite and show that it is not okay that racism is becoming normalized and that fascists are running around on our streets. The image was captured by David Lagerlof, who happened to be the only photographer at the scene. Even he was incredibly moved by what Asplund did. He said: I happened to be at the right place. What I think people are reacting to in this photo is that she can t really pose a threat to them, but she puts herself in a very dangerous situation, because this group is violent, and she stands there all alone and faces them. It s like David and Goliath. Although this incident with the Nordic Resistance Movement happened it Sweden, it might not be too far from something that could happen in the United States. With the rise of presumptive Republican nominee Trump and his massive following of racists and white supremacists, we can only expect that the bigotry and hate is going to ramp up as we get closer to the general election. Asplund is an inspiration to all of us, and a brilliant reminder that we should never let hate win. One person can have a massive impact, so there is no excuse not to stand up to Trump s divisive rhetoric.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Jon Stewart Makes A Room Full Of U.S. Soldiers Gasp As He Delivers A Dire Warning On Trump (VIDEO),"If you re someone who looks at the prospect of four (or eight!) years of President Trump with a mixture of depression and terror, imagine what it must be like to be a soldier who may have to serve in the military under him.Trump will have no problem, say, ordering you to commit war crimes. Or torture. Or to go to war. The possibility of Trump becoming president represents the likelihood that you will be made to do something that will not only dishonor your country, but yourself as well. Needless to say, the prospect makes for some very worried soldiers in the United States military.As part of a USO tour with President Obama, Jon Stewart stopped by to emcee the Joining Forces 5th Anniversary Event at Joint Base Andrews. Most of his jokes were good-natured, but the former Daily Show host couldn t help but addressing the very large, very orange elephant in the room.While speaking about Vice President Joe Biden, who joined Stewart on stage, the comedian noted that many people criticize Biden for  [saying] whatever he thinks of, whatever comes into his mind.  But it reminded him of someone else: Who would have thought that now, that gets you the Republican nomination? So, um  (laughter) Don t worry, Trump s gonna keep you busy when he s the Commander-in-Chief. You re gonna have to paint all the planes with  Trump  in big gold letters. You re gonna be busy. During the extended punchline on Trump, the audience went from laughing, to uncomfortable gasps and groans, to dead silence. It was a good joke, but the nugget of truth at the center of it was deeply unsettling.Donald Trump has shown absolutely no ability to control himself during his campaign. His half-hearted stabs at being more  presidential  have ended   without fail   within 24 hours. Often these forays into  seriousness  end spectacularly. After the press had lauded Trump for being more mature, he attended a rally in which he floated the idea that Ted Cruz s father was linked to the JFK assassination. He s about to have the most powerful military in the history of mankind at his beck and call.Painting  Trump  in gold on airplanes isn t the only thing Trump might have these soldiers do. Given his temperament, his thin skin, and his ability to contradict himself endlessly, Trump could wake up one morning and just  decide  to go to war. And to defend his bruised ego, he would be willing to send the very same men and women standing in front of Jon Stewart into battle. Their silence speaks volumes.They ll be busy alright.Watch Jon Stewart give his brutal prediction about Trump below, via Mediaite s Tommy Christopher: Jon Stewart Tells Troops  Trump s Gonna Keep  by DailyPoliticsFeatured image via Daily Motion screengrab",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox News Host Flies Off The Handle At Republicans For Not Supporting Trump,"Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president and many in the GOP elite have a serious problem with this reality. They don t have a problem with Trump because he s a racist, a chauvinist, or an advocate of violence.  Let s keep in mind that many Republican politicians have shown those tendencies, all be it veiled with civility. Rather, today s  GOP elite have a problem with Trump because he s got a big mouth about what the GOP stands for and because he s not a part of the elite Republican establishment.Well, Fox host Sean Hannity, a whack job in his own right, wasn t having it with the Republican establishment and quickly came to The Donald s rescue by becoming unhinged on his Fox News show. In an interview with Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, Hannity appeared emotional and frustrated because of the lack of support coming for Trump from the heavy weights of the Republican Party, including Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush.  To me it seems selfish,  the whiny Hannity told the RNC chair.Priebus gave a measured response, telling Hannity that  it s gonna take some time for some people to come to grips and to get to know Donald Trump and to get on board. This has been going on a year!  Hannity pouted.  What do they need to know? At one point Hannity went on the attack against House Speaker Paul Ryan saying,  I m not ready to support Speaker Ryan anymore. I m thinking maybe we need a new speaker. To his credit, Donald Trump has done one thing that has made many people happy. He has the Republican Party in shambles and that bodes well for democracy come November.Watch video here:Feature image via video screenshot.",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

But Drumpf is unashamed. That s right, bigly. And I m gonna be the bestest, most fantasticest President ever. It s gonna be yuuuuugical.

 Trump Outlines How He’ll Treat America Like A Bankrupt Business And It Is TERRIFYING,"There s a furniture company in Southern Maine called  Chapter 11 Furniture.  The name and the entire concept of the company is to invoke the feeling of a fire sale. They have 4 or 5 stores that they only sign short leases on, so at any given time they can advertise,  Chapter 11 Furniture is losing its lease in (enter town or street name here) and EVERYTHING MUST GO!  It s a brilliant tactic for a company who will probably never resort to its name because it understands how to build from American greed at its very core. Someone is going our of business or declaring bankruptcy? It s a free for all!That s the American mentality surrounding bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is there to help people in severe financial situations put their debt behind them and move on. It s also a way for sheisters to get a bunch of free stuff, make a bunch of money and work the system. Donald Trump qualifies as the second type; working the system   and openly admitting it   4 times now. Trump s idea to  fix America  has taken a turn toward this mentality and the very thought of it is frightening,The New York Times reported that in an interview Thursday, Donald Trump talked about how he would approach the national debt. Thinking like a failed businessman, he insisted we should simply go to our creditors and ask them to take less. Yes, in one idiotic statement, Donald Trump exposed just how little he knows about the economy or how the debt works. As The Times points out, there is no credible evidence suggesting that our debtors would reduce we owe them by a nickel. Trump thinks he s dealing in people with real estate they can t move selling bad debt for more bad debt until one day so much of the debt is paper   bad paper   that there s nothing left to do but fail. Sound familiar? It should; it s what Wall Street and the Dubya administration did to us in 2008.Let s assume for a moment that our creditors would take less. The bulk of the national debt is money we owe to ourselves. Is Trump going to ask the Social Security trust fund to take pennies on the dollar because we had a couple of wars that were too expensive and some handouts to fix the mess? How much less should those people who won t be able to retire when the fund is wiped out take? They ve been putting 6.2 percent of their paycheck into that fund since they started working. How much less should they settle for?As for our other creditors, We re not defaulting on rented furniture. We owe other countries a great deal of money, plus interest, that they provided to us in cash. We use that money to fund the government. If creditors start seeing those kinds of tactics we ll have our credit rating lowered and lose credibility as a country. There s also a good chance the dollar would be removed as the world standard currency. Ask Donald Trump what he ll do when we can t just print more money.The bottom line is, Trump has no idea what he s talking about. The national debt is one of the most misunderstood components of the federal government. For someone to seek the office that holds much influence over how that debt shrinks or grows without understanding it is preposterous, but then again   we are talking about Donald Trump.Featured image from billingsgazette.com",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Maddow Mocks GOP By Turning Their Freak Out About Trump Into Poetry And Performing It,"MSNBC host Rachel Maddow found the perfect way to simultaneously report and mock the conservative movement s collective freak out that they saddled themselves with Donald Trump as a presidential nominee. She looks their actual words, turned them into spoken word poetry and performed them live on-air.Maddox introduced the segment by claiming she was taking a moment to honor the concerns  of Republicans across the country who, after several years of swinging to the right, landed there with Trump. The Sarah Palins, Rick Perrys and Chris Christies of the party might well be happy to pump Trump, but far greater numbers have simply refused.It speaks volumes about how far the GOP has fallen, that George W. Bush, considered at home and abroad one of the worst and extremist Presidents in US history   is now looking like the moderate wing of the party. Both George W. Bush and his father and former President George Bush Sr have announced their refusal to back Trump in his campaign to be the next President of the United States.Not only does Dubya appear moderate next to Trump, he appears articulate too. Explaining his reasons for rejecting the Trump campaign, he said: I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated. But we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration. The former presidents have since been joined by Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, and Benn Sasse   with other big names in the GOP yet to make their position known.It was all too much for Maddow, who decided to turn this unholy mess into art   and make a seriously hilarious skit out of it all. She takes verbatim quotes from Republicans freaking out about Trump and performs them with all the sincerity of a performance poet.

 Sacramento Police On The Hunt For Right-Wing Terrorists That Distributed These Racist Flyers,"Denise Calderon, a local community activist in midtown Sacramento, awoke to find white supremacist leaflets distributed on vehicles and local buildings in her neighborhood this week. The violent flyers include an ending statement advocating for mass murder: If you have not secured a body dump-site, do so now! Kidnap, rob, torture for information and execute all Muslims and Latinos. Leave no survivors. The papers were printed so they appeared to be signed by an individual named Greg Winthrow, who is a co-founder and president of the Aryan Youth Movement White Student Union. The organization has been around for a long time, and it ended up getting him kicked out of college when he tried forming a school-based chapter of it in the 1980s. It was so bad that the school had to get a restraining order to keep him off campus. I ve been living here six years. We have all kinds of crazy, but this is a different level of crazy,  Miss Calderon said, regarding the hateful flyers that advocated for the most heinous crimes imaginable towards Latino and Muslim residents of the neighborhood.Winthrow, who is the alleged source of the flyers, was unable to be reached for any comment. An old phone number listed under his name was disconnected. Police are taking the incident seriously; however they have not indicated that they have any evidence as of yet to tie Winthrow directly to them.The flyers seemed to be distributed overnight, as they were discovered first thing in the morning. Reports were that some of the neighborhood children saw the threats as well on their way to school.Efforts are underway in coordination with the local police to obtain surveillance video from the areas affected, in an effort to identify the person or people who covered the neighborhood with them.Featured image via sacbee.com screen capture",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Is About To Get Secret Intel Briefings, And Spies Are Terrified He’ll Leak","One of the perks and duties of becoming the presidential nominee for one of the major parties is that you get access to daily intelligence briefings from the current administration. Unfortunately, a candidate like Donald Trump has never come along, and spies are worried about what he ll do with the sensitive information he will receive. My concern with Trump will be that he inadvertently leaks, because as he speaks extemporaneously, he ll pull something out of his hat that he heard in a briefing and say it,  said a former senior U.S. intelligence official who has participated in the process of briefing presidential candidates.Unlike his presumed rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who would receive the same briefing if she s the Democratic Party nominee, Trump has never sat across the table from U.S. intelligence analysts and been given updates on the latest machinations of ISIS, or efforts by foreign governments to penetrate American computer networks. He also has selected a team of largely unknown advisers who might have trouble helping him to contextualize what he might hear and know what questions to ask.Trump has already demonstrated a habit of regurgitating whatever information comes across his desk or from his team of sycophants. So far he s accused the father of one of his rivals of being involved in the JFK assassination thanks to a sketchy tabloid story, as well as claiming that a member of ISIS threatened him, based on a YouTube parody.The presumptive Republican nominee has not shown that he is of sound enough mind to receive sensitive information about American intelligence, but the Obama administration will be having daily meetings with him and likely the Clinton team anyway, out of sense of tradition.It is up to President Obama to determine how much data can be given to the candidates, and it is doubtful Trump will be given more than the bare minimum necessary to meet the voluntary requirements. Considering Hillary Clinton served as his Secretary of State and was even in the situation room as the Bin Laden raid occurred, it s doubtful there are any reservations about giving her the information.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"May 6, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Great Job, GOP: White Supremacists SO HAPPY Their Guy Won The Nomination","One of the most well-known white supremacists in American history just had his chosen candidate, Donald Trump, become the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. Notorious former KKK Grand Dragon David Duke is letting the entire world know how happy he is to have Trump leading the ticket.On his radio show yesterday, white supremacist David Duke celebrated Donald Trump s victory in Indiana, which made him the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Duke also used the show as yet another opportunity to promote his virulent brand of anti-Semitism, blaming Jewish  neo-cons  for trying to destroy Trump s candidacy and for allegedly controlling the country.Duke asserted that  Jewish extremists have made a terribly crazy miscalculation, because all they re going to be doing by doing a  Never Trump  move ment is exposing their alien, their anti-American, anti-American-majority position.   They re going to push people more into an awareness that the neo cons are the problem, that these Jewish supremacists who con trol our country are the real problem, and the rea son why America is not great. Duke has been on the so-called  Trump Train  for months, expressing pride that for the first time in decades a candidate for one of America s two major parties was openly expressing some of the ideas that the white supremacist movement does.The hate leader loves that Trump has been demonizing Latinos as criminals and  rapists,  while the former Klansman also agrees with Trump s plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and his idea of limiting Muslim travel into the United States.It isn t just Duke. Trump has attracted backing from anti-Semites and other bigots, who he has often amplified on social media. Those bigots have also often gone after journalists whose reporting on Trump they find problematic with rape threats, racist and sexist epithets, and worse.A group of white supremacists have even put together pro-Trump robocall efforts in multiple states.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 It’s Now Official: Democrats Are Beginning To Vote On Doing Away With Superdelegates,"Democrats in the state of Maine appear to be on board with a sentiment that s been floated around by a lot of progressive voters and media personalities in 2016. They are now going to be voting on whether or not to do away with having superdelegates be involved in their primary process starting in 2020.State Rep. Diane Russell introduced the rule. Russel gave comment to the Bangor Daily News, saying: We have a system of government where you have one person, one vote, by and large. The primary system is not when that happens. And I think that we need to start moving toward a system that s more fair, that s more democratic and more reflective of the popular vote. Russell s amendment would change things in the state to where all delegates   including people who are currently superdelegates   were awarded proportionately based on the caucus results of the state.Complaints about the superdelegate aspect to the Democratic primaries have arisen in many election years, but in 2016 they ve been particularly strong due to the fact that there is a perception they are having a disproportionate effect on the primary voting process.As more voters have become aware of the concept of superdelegates, and the fact that they are unelected individuals many of whom are not known to the public and don t necessarily have to represent the people s will  there has been increasing push-back towards the idea of the  progressive  party having what many are calling a partial rigging of primary elections.This issue goes well beyond just the 2016 election. Some voters see the superdelegate issue as a party establishment that is increasingly out of touch with it s voter base, following a recent history of extremely questionable moves made by DNC leadership which are more Republican than Democratic.Rep. Russell is also including a non-binding but  strongly suggested  statement with the rule that Maine delegates vote proportionately in 2016 to better reflect the popular vote results. She chose not to include a mandatory change for 2016, because it would put Maine out of compliance with the rules set by the Democratic National Committee.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Hidden Camera Footage Reveals A Disturbing Fact About Kids And Guns (VIDEO),"New footage from a hidden camera reveals that this country greatly needs to embrace gun reform, despite what the National Rifle Association and right-wing gun nuts would like to have the rest of America believe.Just this year alone, toddlers have shot 23 people. When small children stumble upon a gun, accidental shootings can easily happen, and have become far too common because part of this country is severely underestimating just how ineffective current gun safety measures are.The NRA has insisted that its Eddie Eagle program, which attempts to educate children about firearms, satisfies gun safety requirements for children   but that couldn t be further from the truth. Many parents also believe that while it s unfortunate that some kids get a hold of guns, it couldn t possibly be *their* child.To investigate this, local Charlotte station Fox46 set up a scenario that gave a group of children the opportunity to pick up a gun. With the help of Mecklenburg County Sheriff Irwin Carmichael, several unsupervised toddlers were placed in a playroom with a realistic-looking BB gun and several other toys and games. The only thing Carmichael told the children before he left them alone to play was, So if you find a gun do you touch it? No. No, what should you do? Tell and adult go tell an adult.  Simple enough, right?Some of the children s parents who d volunteered their kids for the experiment were very confident that their child would be smart enough to follow instructions or leave the gun alone. Some parents admitted that they d never even had a conversation with their child about gun safety. What happened next shocked them: Basically proving that guns can be dangerous no matter how clearly you warn a child, the footage showed that a toddler s short attention span and desire to play will often override the safety measures adults try to teach them   especially if they know they re not being watched. While not every child engaged with the fake firearm, it only took 60 seconds of unsupervised playtime before a little boy discovered the BB gun. Just a few minutes later, many of the children were firing the gun at each other.Unfortunately, this is exactly how so many accidental gun deaths happen, and it s time that the NRA and gun-loving conservatives that are against gun safety measures embrace this reality.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Israeli Military General Compares Israel To Nazi Germany At Holocaust Remembrance Day Event,"Israel is in a class all by itself when it comes to perpetuating some of the worst human rights violations of any country on earth today. For decades, Israel has had a policy of ethnically cleansing and robbing the indigenous Palestinian population of its lands and resources and killing them when they resist the atrocities committed against them under the guise of self-defense. Now, an Israeli military general, someone who is one of the leaders of Israel s killing machine, has come out and admitted that Israel today shares many of the same elements as Nazi Germany.Addressing an audience at Tel Yitzhak in central Israel on Holocaust Remembrance Day, Israel Defense Forces Major General Yair Golan dropped a bombshell on the Israel s racist establishment when he said: It s scary to see horrifying developments that took place in Europe begin to unfold here. The Holocaust should bring us to ponder our public lives and, furthermore, it must lead anyone who is capable of taking public responsibility to do so. Because if there is one thing that is scary in remembering the Holocaust, it is noticing horrific processes which developed in Europe   particularly in Germany   70, 80, and 90 years ago, and finding remnants of that here among us in the year 2016. The general was immediately attacked by Israeli government officials. Justice minister Ayelet Shaked told local media that Golan was  a little confused  and that he showed  a lack of understanding, if not a disrespect of the Holocaust.  Yet, it is Shaked who has shown disrespect for humanity when she advocated for the genocide of Palestinians. Here s what she posted on her Facebook page two years ago:   They are all enemy combatants, and their blood shall be on all their heads. Now this also includes the mothers of the martyrs, who send them to hell with flowers and kisses. They should follow their sons, nothing would be more just. They should go, as should the physical homes in which they raised the snakes. Otherwise, more little snakes will be raised there. The next day, Palestinian teenager Muhammad Abu Khudair was kidnapped and burned alive in Jerusalem. Neftali Bennett, leader of one of Israel s right-wing parties also called on General Golan to retract his statements. Bennett is at the forefront of Israel s genocidal and war mongering saber-rattling. He has said of Palestinians: I already killed lots of Arabs in my life, and there is absolutely no problem with that. We should keep in mind that these are not two government ministers with fascist tendencies in the midst of a normal government. Israel today is inherently driven by beliefs that makes the general correct in comparing Israel with Nazi Germany. Zionism, which drives Israel, is an ideology whose adherents advocate for a pure Jewish state. In a land where the majority of the population was not Jewish (97%) in the early 20th Century, Zionists have always advocated for the destruction of the inferior non-Jewish Palestinians to create and maintain their Jewish state. 100 years later, with 2/3 of the Palestinian population ethnically cleansed and not allowed to return to their ancestral homeland, the Israelis see the remaining Palestinians in the Occupied West Bank, Gaze Strip, as well as those inside of Israel, as a demographic threat.The rhetoric of Shaked and Bennett is not the exception to the rule of the state of Israel: It is the norm. For the Palestinians, this will continue to mean their oppression and gradual destruction. It is up to the American people to say no to the billions of dollars a year we send to a country that is thirsty for the removal of an entire people in order to achieve its pure state.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 BREAKING: Highest-Ranking Elected Republican Says He Won’t Support Trump,"The GOP implosion we have been waiting for has finally come full circle. Now that John Kasich and Ted Cruz have bowed out of the GOP race for the 2016 presidential nomination, Trump pretty much has it in the bag. There s just one problem though: not all avowed Republicans are supporting him. In fact, there s an active #NeverTrump movement, and even a #RepublicansForHillary movement. In other words, sane conservatives are willing to do all they can to stop Trump. Now, we can add another name to the list of prominent republicans to the list of those who cannot find it within themselves to back Trump: House Speaker and GOP Convention Chair Paul Ryan.The New York Times reports that Speaker Ryan insists that the GOP establishment needs a  standard bearer  and Trump is not that. Ryan goes on to say, I don t want to underplay what he accomplished.  That being said, though, Ryan believes that the GOP needs a nominee who  appeals to a vast majority of Americans.  He also said: We hope that our nominee aspires to Lincoln and Reaganesque. I think conservatives want to know does he share our values and our principles. There s a lot of questions conservatives are going to want answers to. Well, Mr. Ryan, sane people, be they liberals, conservatives, or somewhere in between, definitely want nothing to do with the bigotry that Trump is spewing. He is not a man we need anywhere near any position of power. however, you and your GOP compatriots have spent eons playing to the bigotry of the Stupid People of America, and this is your result. You created this monster. Now, you handle it. Get rid of Trump at all costs, unless you want your party to die a slow and painful death sometime between now and November. You are already more than well on your way.Trump is dangerous. Your job is to put country before party, not the other way around. Perhaps your speaking sense today, Speaker Ryan, will rub off on your fellow republican politicians. We can hope and dream, right?Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Newspaper Cover Perfectly Demonstrates What Will Happen To Trump And GOP On Election Day (IMAGE),"Trump and Republican Party are f*cked on Election Day, according to an Orange County newspaper cover published on Thursday by editor-in-chief Gustavo Arellano.OC Weekly s cover features a nude Trump being mounted by the Democratic donkey. The donkey urges readers to  Check out our Trump coverage  as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee yells  It s yuuuge! Here s the cover via OC Weekly:Image via OC WeeklyThe cover is the perfect demonstration of what will happen on Election Day if the Republican Party makes Trump their nominee.While Trump is leading Democratic rival Hillary Clinton 54-41 among white voters, a CNN poll reveals that the GOP is in for a historic defeat among non-white voters who back Clinton 81-14. Women are also backing Clinton in eager anticipation of seeing the first woman occupy the White House and, you know, the fact that Trump is anti-women and believes women should be punished for having an abortion.Hispanic voters in particular have every reason to vote against Trump in November considering how much he has been denigrating them over the course of his campaign. For more than a year, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has peddled all sorts of nasty myths against Mexicans, from painting undocumented immigrants as rapists and Typhoid Marias to insisting a massive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border will make America great again,  Arellano wrote explaining why the cover was chosen. Besides, Democrats violating Trump from behind is what he can expect when he faces Hillary Clinton come November. Enjoy our package, and don t forget to register to vote!  he concluded.If Republicans seriously think they can win in November with Trump as their candidate they are delusional. The fact of the matter is that Trump s campaign appeals to white racists who are whining about an imaginary persecution by society because they aren t allowed to discriminate against people they hate.For now, at least we get to watch how angry Trump gets after he sees this cover. That reaction should be priceless.Featured Image: Getty Images/Mark Wilson",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s First Stab At Hispanic Outreach Is Tweeting This Awful Picture Of Him Eating A Taco,"Trump s first week as the Republican nominee is off to a hilariously bad start.Perhaps reading the latest polls that found a staggering seventy-seven percent of Hispanic Americans have a negative opinion of Trump (and that s putting it lightly), Trump did the only thing a man of his unchecked narcissism could think of: He bought a taco from the lobby of Trump Tower.

 Seth Meyers Breaks Down The Scary Reality Of Trump’s Inevitable Nomination (VIDEO),"During a segment of Closer Look, Seth Meyers examined the reality that is an inevitable Donald Trump GOP presidential nomination.After Trump s win in Indiana, The Zodiac Killer Ted Cruz dropped out of the race. Meyers spent the beginning of the segment recounting Cruz s final moments before the fall of his campaign. That fall was partly literal. In a last ditch effort, Cruz had announced Carly Fiorina as his VP pick and running mate for the campaign. During a campaign event, Fiorina fell while on stage. Meyers played a clip of Trump roasting Cruz over his lack of effort to try and help Fiorina out during the event. Trump said that even he would have helped her.Meyers commented on Trump s statement saying: Even I would have helped her.  Not only does Trump know he s an asshole, he knows that we know he s an asshole.  Even I would have helped her and watching women fall down is basically my favorite thing,'  Meyers said while impersonating Trump.Later in the segment, Meyers gets savage with this one question for the GOP: This should be a serious moment of introspection for Republicans. How did they get to the point where they re handing their nomination to a race-baiting, xenophobic serial liar who peddles conspiracy theories? It probably has to do with the GOP s southern strategy. After the fall of the old Jim Crow, Republicans took advantage of southern white people s racism. They invented a coded language that would allow them to say and do incredibly racist things while in public. How else would the GOP get poor whites to vote for the interests of the rich?The reason that the GOP is about to have a race-baiting, xenophobic serial liar who peddles conspiracy theories is because they have spent the last 40 years crystallizing a public that will consent to such rule. When working class white people are confronted with hyper objects such as income inequality or other concepts hard to personally conceptualize, they default to a leader who gives them the answers they were taught to accept as reality.You can watch the segment below, in full.Featured image from video screenshot ",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Duggar-Linked Ministry Building A ‘Retreat’ Where Christian Dads Can Trade Their Teen Daughters,"It s becoming increasingly clear that when TLC decided to promote a story of the fundamentalist Christian Duggar family, they weren t just idolizing right-wing anti-gay bigots, they were legitimizing a toxic cult that for years had lived in the shadows and now   thanks to increasing exposure   has begun to fester and grow. Quiverfull,  the fundamentalist movement run by a man named Vaughn Ohlman, works to silence and control women in ways that wouldn t seem entirely out of place in regions controlled by the Taliban. Its  pitch  is that women should be subservient to their husbands, and relied on primarily for household chores and churning out babies. (The  full  quiver in the name is a nod to the number of children each family is encouraged to have   as many as possible.)But if mature women are reduced to home- and baby-makers, then girls are seen as less than that.Enter Ohlman s brand new  retreat  designed specifically for Christian dads to meet up and plan who they will give their daughters to, particularly troublesome ones who may be nearly out of high school and haven t found a husband yet.Called the  Get Them Married!  retreat, the group s announcement is deeply disturbing.We at Let Them Marry Ministries are excited to finally be able to announce our plans for the Get Them Married Retreat. We ve set our plans and are accepting applications. Pending sufficient signups and barring unforeseen contingencies, we will be hosting the first Get Them Married Retreat this fall. Unforeseen contingencies  might include the fact that nowhere in Let Them Marry Ministries  lengthy post is the consent of the children ever acknowledged.  Let them marry  really means  let us marry them off. This is made explicit in the  rules :For the purposes of this conference we ask that a young man who is interested in a young woman approach her father (mother, brother, etc.) before approaching her. In the case where he is interested in a young woman who is not accompanied, we ask that the young man speak privately to one of the retreat staff members.As Raw Story points out, Ohlman is very big on the idea that children should be married as soon as possible. His criteria for when a girl is  ready  is between the ages of 13 and 20 (they claim they take a hard stand against 12-year-olds getting married. That is their red line). The specifics are even more disturbing:How much will this retreat set you back? Depends. If you want a family sized cottage, be prepared to spend around $1200. If you just want to send your  older, marriageable kids  to a gender-specific bunkhouse with other older, marriageable kids, they can stay for as low as $130.That gets you a bed, meals, and a schedule full of lectures, activities and what they call  intentionally blank spots for networking. So the next time you come across a Duggar (and yes, they re back on TLC, despite everything), remember that the  family values  and longing to return to the good old days means this sort of theocratic nightmare. They have a very specific vision, and it s not pretty.UPDATE: The Salvation Army, which had originally agreed to host the retreat on their property in Wichita, Kansas, has reportedly backed   and quite possibly ran   away from this incoming disaster. The group will now have to find a new place to hold their child marriage swap.Featured image via YouTube screengrab",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Colbert Asks God Why He Let Trump Be The GOP Nominee And The Response Is Hilarious (VIDEO),"Not many people would have guessed that a racist, misogynist, billionaire demagogue would be the nominee for the Republican Party for president of the United States. To the surprise and disgust of many, including the GOP establishment, (which by the way is quite funny to watch), Donald Trump today is the king of the Republican Party. But in all seriousness, how could such an individual now be so close to the most powerful position on the face of the planet? Stephen Colbert posed this question and looked to God for an answer. Colbert asked: God, I have a difficult question for you. God why did you let Donald Trump become the Republican nominee? God:  What? Shut the front door no way! You mean Trump the guy with the weird hair who sold steaks at the Sharper Image? Colbert: Yes  Haven t you been following the election? God:  Oh my god he s the worst. Stephen, I ve been pretty  busy to follow the election. I ve been dealing with a supernova, I have to decide who wins the NBA finals. What happened to Jeb? I thought he was a sure thing. What is with you people? Come on, I give you free will and you nominate a guy who looks like a microwave circus peanut? That s it, I m taking away your opposable thumbs. While this skit is hilarious, it also has a clear message: If God were watching, he would be shaking his head at how the greatest country in the history of the world would consider electing a guy who not only lacks the experience for the office of the presidency, but who is also dangerous to the long fought for democracy of this country.Let s all go out and vote this November to ensure this man does not attain power.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJIllWIRx-M]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Right-Wing Mom Beats Her Kids To A Bloody Pulp To ‘Lead’ Them To God (VIDEO),"The right-wing mom who forced her children to sing songs to the Bundy terrorists after they seized a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon experienced a revolt of her own when her children took away her guns and fled the house in search of help from law enforcement.The five kids escaped the home because they wanted the beatings they constantly endured to end.Authorities arrested Odalis Sharp on Friday for beating the children bloody with a rod in the name of God in what she called her way of leading them to Christianity. We need to turn to God, because the system is corrupt,  Sharp said before accusing the government of waging a vendetta against her.  They lie, they twist, they make false charges, they abuse people, and then they turn around and put people in prison, and then they accuse them of abuse. But it isn t the government accusing Sharp of abuse, it s her own children.They testified on Wednesday that their mother mercilessly abused them most days of the week by calling them names, forcing them to eat soap, and beating them bloody with a belt or rod as well as slapping them and hitting them in their private parts. They said it s typical to always receive some type of bruising and other times have bled from the swats,  a social worker told the court.  The children told me they were fearful. They did not want to return to their mother. The sheriff also described how one child told him that one of spankings  consisted of 47 swats,  and that after 27 spankings the abused child began bleeding. Sharp s 15-year-old son fled the home to escape constant beatings as well and Sharp explained it by saying the boy rejected  the right, wholesome and pure path in which I was leading him   in which God was leading us. And the kids don t have to go back to their mother either because the judge removed the children from Sharp s custody and placed them in the custody of the Kansas Department of Children and Families.Here s the video of Sharp s rant via YouTube.This is yet another case of how conservatives twist and use religion to excuse horrible acts. This woman dragged her kids to the center of a standoff between the FBI and a bunch of gun-toting right-wing terrorists and that s on top of the constant beatings they suffered at the hands of their mother who actually thinks she is doing God s work by bloodying up her kids.That probably makes televangelist Pat Robertson smile, but is hardly an acceptable way to treat children in modern society. If you have to resort to beating religion into kids, your religion is truly weak.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Promises To Destroy The USA During Interview With Lester Holt (VIDEO),"A lot of people have said that Donald Trump would start sounding more  presidential if he managed to secure the Republican nomination. This meant that he would tone down his rhetoric, maybe try to bring the country together inside of dividing us and attempt to gain the support of Independent voters by sounding like an intelligent human being. Trump, however, has proven that he has different plans and he doesn t give a f*ck about uniting this country.On Wednesday evening, the presumptive nominee for the GOP sat down with NBC Nightly News host Lester Holt for an interview and promised more of the same.Holt asked, As you try to appeal to the whole country, do you stand, for example, by the idea of a ban on foreign Muslims coming into the country?  Trump responded: I do. We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. We have to see what s going on. There s a big problem in the world happening with the migration in Europe, you look at Germany, it s crime riddled right now. LIES! Germany is absolutely not  riddled  with crime. Trump is so full of shit. Last year the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation studied crime rates in the country to see if there was a rise due to the Syrian refugees fleeing to the country and found:Crimes committed by refugees stood at the same level as those committed by native Germans. These findings are the result of an initial evaluation conducted by the BKA in cooperation with all federal states and commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior.Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi re said that based on the numbers presently available, he would forecast refugees to be as prone to committing crimes as native Germans are. He explained that he had ordered the report in early October in order to provide proof to  dispel rumors about an increase in criminal acts in Germany. This another lie just like the one about only  bad  Mexicans coming to the United States. The interview with Holt proved that 1) Trump has not plan to tone down his hateful rhetoric and 2) he has no plans to start telling the truth. There is no way he is going to win over the voters he needs if he continues down the path that he is on. Unless he wakes up one day and starts talking about equality, inclusiveness and apologizes to all of the people he offended, he has no chance in hell of EVER sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office. But if a miracle happened and he somehow won, he would absolutely destroy our country   he just let us know.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" President Obama Restores Consumer’s Rights To Sue The Big Banks For Misconduct, Cracks Down On Tax Evasion","This is something you won t hear on Fox News anytime soon: President Obama is making the lives of honest, hardworking consumers a little better by allowing them to, again, sue big banks for misconduct.Working through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Obama Administration quietly pushed for new regulations that force the biggest financial institutions to backtrack on a secret clause hidden in contracts that hinders arbitration from consumers who feel they are victims from credit and banking misconduct.Meaning, if the big banks and credit card companies screw you over, you can take them to court and make them pay (finally) for their mistakes. No more stonewalling. No more  too bad, so sad. The new rule clearly states:Pursuant to section 1028(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is proposing to establish 12 CFR part 1040, which would contain regulations governing two aspects of consumer finance dispute resolution.  First, the proposed rule would prohibit covered providers of certain consumer financial products and services from using an agreement with a consumer that provides for arbitration of any future dispute between the parties to bar the consumer from filing or participating in a class action with respect to the covered consumer financial product or service.  Second, the proposal would require a covered provider that is involved in an arbitration pursuant to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement to submit specified arbitral records to the Bureau.Night and day. No more B.S. Once again, Elizabeth Warren s brainchild is swooping in to protect the people most preyed upon by greedy conglomerates.And it only gets better.The Obama Administration is also directing the Treasury to crackdown heavily on U.S. companies that take advantage of tax inversions, where they buy a company in a foreign country for a lower tax rate and then use those foreign resources to skip out on paying their fair share back here in the U.S., which costs our economy billions.According to Vox:The new rules announced on April 4 are different because they specifically target the most lucrative part of an inversion    earnings stripping  tactics, whereby the strategic use of debt and interest payments are used to transfer profits from a US-based subsidiary to a foreign-based one.Both of these new rules, at the behest of a Democratic administration, will put a dent in the money making machine of big banks who skirt the rules and screw over the people for an extra buck. Economist and tax expert Robert Willens told the Wall Street Journal that this new rule will take  all of the juice out of inversions. These new rules already are threatening the mega-merger of pharmaceutical conglomerates Pfizer and Allergan, which stands to make over $150 billion, the largest merger of its kind.Still think both parties are the same? While the GOP just picked a liar and a financial cheater as their nominee, the Democrat s two-time picked candidate is working to bring money back to the Treasury and the pockets of the people.Thank you, President Obama!Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Rob Reiner Accurately Describes Trump Supporters On Morning Joe, All Hell Breaks Loose","Some people just can t handle the truth, even if it s handed to them on a silver platter. So, when legendary filmmaker Rob Reiner told Joe Scarborough to his face that Donald Trump supporters are racist, it did not go over well. You see, Scarborough has pretty much given Trump an open platform to spew his fallacies and propaganda on his MSNBC show Morning Joe practically any time he wants. Reiner clearly kicked the hornets  nest by being so honest directly to Scarborough s face.After being asked why people may support Trump, Reiner said: There are a lot of people who are racist. Which got the reply,  Oh my God! Did you just say that? But Reiner didn t back away from the obvious truth. He added: That s true. They re not all racist  there are a lot of people who are. There is racism in this country that has been submerged for a long, long time. And all of a sudden there s a man speaking He s then interrupted by Scarborough who tried to say Trump supporters may just be angry working class Americans, so Reiner responded: Let me say this to that. There are those that are following Bernie Sanders that feel the same way. Then when Mika Brzezinski insinuates Reiner is calling them racist too, Reiner says: No, do you see any racist people at the Bernie rallies? Do you see any skinheads?  You can see when somebody s got a tattoo with a swastika and stuff. C mon Joe, be honest here. Reiner is then continued to be dismissed by pretty much everyone, because apparently the truth is too much for them to bear. He also makes the very good point that Trump is not doing a good enough job of dismissing his very racist base of voters. For goodness sake, he s been endorsed by white supremacists! Instead, Trump embraces support from pretty much anyone who tosses it his way, racist or not, and that s become very evident.Let s just put it this way, not all Trump supporters are racist, but if you re racist, you re probably voting for Donald Trump.Watch here:WATCH: How does director Rob Reiner explain the millions who voted for @realDonaldTrump?

 The White Vote Can’t And Won’t Save Trump – Republicans Are Screwed,"Donald Trump is now the unofficially declared Republican nominee. Congratulations, Republicans, you went from Abraham Lincoln, to Dwight D. Eisenhower, to George W. Bush, and now Trump. We didn t think it could get much worse, but it did.Thankfully for the Democrats and other sane Americans, both Clinton and Sanders stand to beat Trump in a landslide in a general election. The math favors Clinton to be the Democratic nominee, for she only needs roughly 180 more delegates out of the 1,100+ left in the rest of the contests. No matter who you support, this is a good thing.So, unless there is a divine intervention (on both sides), it s going to be Trump v. Clinton.Anti-establishment Republicans are elated though for some weird reason   their candidate is screwed.Take a look at the numbers: CNN has Clinton beating Trump 54-41 percent, a thirteen point lead. That s pretty sizable. And what s even more remarkable is the fact that Trump leads Clinton with white voters by only nine points (52-43). Remember, white voters are supposed to be Trump s saving grace in this election   the angry white voter, new-age Southern Strategy  is supposed to carry the xenophobic buffoon, and he is only leading by nine points.In 2008, McCain garnered 55 percent of white voters to Obama s 43 percent   12 point difference   and still lost.In 2012, Romney nabbed 59 percent of whites to Obama s dismal 39 percent   a 20 point difference   and still lost.Projections show that Trump will have to win 70 percent of white voters if he wants to take the White House. And why is that? Because Clinton is absolutely crushing him among non-white voters. In CNN s poll, 81 percent of nonwhite voters are backing Clinton, while 14 percent are backing Trump, a 67 point difference.That s not even taking into consideration the entire female vote, which Trump is losing in historic proportions.And it certainly doesn t help that Republicans have lost ground with white voters (and white men) while Democrats have picked up the Republican s slack. Reuters found:Among whites under 40, the shift is even more dramatic. In 2012, they were more likely to identify with the Republican Party by about 5 percentage points. In 2015, the advantage flipped: Young whites are now more likely to identify with the Democratic Party by about 8 percentage points.Bottom line: the white vote cannot and will not save Donald Trump. The face of the nation has changed, the demographics have shifted, and it s no longer going to be the white man calling the shots. And no matter how many races and religions Trump wants to ban, the rhetoric will not be enough for his racist base. Of course never say never. There is always a chance he could win   if Democrats get too comfortable and stay home. But if Democrats get out and vote, Trump will lose, and lose huge.Let s put the final nail in the white dominance coffin and send a message to the bigots on the Trump train.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘The Lord’ Told A Trump-Loving Tow Truck Driver To Leave A Disabled Woman Stranded–So He Did,"Shupee Max Towing in Traveler s Rest, South Carolina apparently has some rules if you re looking to actually be towed somewhere. At least that s what Cassy McWade found out when she was in an accident and her family called for a tow. Her regular mechanic wasn t available, so they called Ken Shupe, who arrived on the scene in about an hour.McWade, most likely relieved to see the car being cared for and the incident behind her, was stunned when Shupe came around the car, told her he couldn t help her because of who she supports, got in his truck and drove away. Yes, that just happened. According to WLOS News 13: He goes around back and comes back and says  I can t tow you.  My first instinct was there must be something wrong with the car. And he says,  No, you re a Bernie supporter.  And I was like wait, really? And he says,  Yes ma am,  and just walks away. This Bernie sign and a message from the lord were all Ken Shupe needed to be an ignorant jerk   screen captureShupe claims it was a moment of clarity. He says he thinks the Lord came to him and told him to get in his truck and leave. With his backwards-thinking head held high and his ignorance on his sleeve, this idiot left a disabled woman sitting on the sidewalk. McWade, 25, suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, psoriatic arthritis and early-onset Crohn s. All of which she said made the waiting by the side of the road with no restroom nearby  terrifying.  McWade Told WLOS: I personally don t believe that you don t have to agree on anything just to be kind to one another. I was like, what did I do to you? You know, I do believe I try to do right by people. So I was offended, and I don t know what exactly he thinks I would have done to him directly by being a believer in Bernie. Shupe s claims that it was all about his convictions and a message from God came crashing down when he got to the real reason he doesn t want to do business with Bernie Supporters: I ve had some horrible experiences in the last six months with towing cars for this mindset individuals, in that I don t get paid. They want to argue about a $50 tow bill, and it turns into just a drama and a fuss. And I said, you know, I m not going to associate with them, and I m not going to do any business with them. I m really not interested in doing business with that clientele, In other words,  I believe Bernie supporters are socialist commies who want stuff for free because internet memes tell me so, so my ignorant self just wasted a bunch a gas and made myself look like an imbecile in public.  It would be highly doubtful that anyone could corroborate this guy s stories about all of his terrible misdealings with Bernie supporters. Should have stuck with God; at least the zealots will give you GoFundMe money.Watch the report from WLOS below:Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Nobody Can Make Sense Of What Donald Trump Is Saying In This Video — Is It Even English?,"By his own admission, Donald Trump screwed up his answer in an MSNBC town hall meeting hosted by Chris Matthews. In the event, Trump said he believed abortion should be banned, and that if such a law had come to pass, women who had abortions should be  punished. Trump was immediately condemned not just by pro-choice groups, but by conservative Republican groups, who push for making abortion illegal but don t like to deal with the unpopular fallout that would come with making those laws (if abortion is murder, both women and their doctors would be committing a crime).Trump walked back the statement soon after. Perhaps he was too intoxicated with wrapping up the nomination on Wednesday morning, but MSNBC s Willie Geist asked him about the abortion question and his response, and absolute gibberish came out:TRUMP: He was asking me a theoretical, or just a question in theory, and I talked about it only from that standpoint. Of course not. And that was done, he said, you know, I guess it was theoretically, but he was asking me a rhetorical question, and I gave an answer. And by the way, people thought from an academic standpoint, and asked rhetorically, people said that answer was an unbelievable academic answer. But of course not, and I said that afterwards. Everybody understands that.He would have probably been better off with his deeply unpopular answer in the first MSNBC interview, or even the subsequent apologies and tapdancing. Instead, as he so often has during the campaign, Trump tries to sound smarter than he is and gets tied up.Of course, especially 0n the very Trump-friendly Morning Joe, he wasn t asked to clarify his comments or even tell viewers what planet he beamed them in from in order to make heads or tails of it.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 5, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: These Videos Will Make Trump The Most Toxic Candidate EVER,"As John Kasich became the last rival to pull out of his campaign, ceding the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton welcomed her opponent to the adult table and released a pair of web videos designed to define the candidate and make it so no sane voter could pull the lever for him this fall.With the release of the new material, Clinton began to answer one of the biggest questions of 2016: How hard and how strong will Democrats go after Trump, and what will the difference be between those ads and ads released by the so-called #NeverTrump groups on the right?Unlike many of the conservative ads, who claimed Trump was a fake member of their movement, the Clinton videos just attack Trump for his unpopular conservative ideas while also pointing out his historic unpopularity.In addition to a biting video highlighting conservatives attacking Trump, the web videos showed that Clinton is going nuclear, making Trump s right wing positions toxic in the general election.The first video takes Trump at his word, and shows a montage of the reality TV star making promises on the campaign trail. These include unpopular ideas like getting rid of gun free zones at schools, defunding Planned Parenthood, building his silly wall at the U.S.   Mexico border, banning Muslim travel, and pushing waterboarding.""Everything I say, I'm going to do, folks.""

 Wait Until You See The Insane Tweet The Official GOP Twitter Account Just Sent Out,"It appears that someone has possibly hacked the GOP s official Twitter account. On Wednesday evening, they sent out an absolutely crazy tweet that simply cannot be real. The account, @GOP, tweeted that  the party is better  with a pretty much guaranteed Donald Trump nomination. Considering the massive fracturing and panic going around in GOP circles right now due to Trump s divisive bid for the presidency, one would think that the GOP establishment wouldn t be too happy that he seems to be in it to win his way to Pennsylvania Avenue in November. Here is the tweet:Thank you to the entire Republican field for a hard fought race. The Party is better for your efforts.

" Missouri Republican Calls Getting Pregnant The ‘Silver Lining’ Of Rape, Pushes Abortion Ban","If Republicans had hoped to escape 2016 without pulling a  Todd Akin  and costing themselves yet another election over idiotic abortion comments, they just lost it.In Missouri, a contentious fight over giving  personhood  rights to fetuses (and therefore legally defining abortion as murder), has given rise to one of the most horrific pro-life arguments made so far. Tila Hubrect, a state representative arguing in favor of  fetal personhood  claimed that abortion should be outlawed even in cases of rape because getting pregnant is the  silver lining  of the  bad  situation.Her comments were captured by Progress Missouri:It is not up to us to say  no, just because there was a rape, they cannot exist.  Sometimes bad things happen   horrible things   but sometimes God can give us a silver lining through the birth of a child.Many conservative pro-lifers think it, Hubrect just said it out loud: Women are baby factories and if they happen to get pregnant while being raped, then look on the bright side.The sickening conclusion is that women should be given absolutely no choice in who they conceive with.Missouri s Republicans are currently trying to make that conclusion fully realized with a particularly egregious pro-life bill that would define  personhood  at the moment of conception. This would allow fetuses to be given  due process  and possibly assigned state lawyers to file suits against their mothers if they tried to seek an abortion. Taken to its logical conclusion (which the Supreme Court would certainly take issue with), women could be held accountable for murder if they were to exercise their right to an abortion.Rep. Jay Barnes (R) recently bragged to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that this bill would make Missouri the most  pro-life state in the country  over night. He and people like Hubrect aren t messing around.Even in conservative Missouri, however, there seems to be limits to how far people are willing to let lawmakers control their bodies. Coincidentally or not, Missouri is also the home of former Rep. Todd Akin, who infamously floated the bogus theory that if there is a  legitimate rape  then the female body has ways to shut down her uterus and avoid a pregnancy. Akin went on to get positively demolished in his election to Democrat Claire McCaskill.It seems likely that Hubrect, perhaps overly giddy at the implications of this bill, may have just given her fellow Republican lawmakers a lot of heartache on Election Day.Listen to Hubrect s comments below:Featured image via LinkedIn",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Rolling Stones Are DONE With Trump Using Their Music (VIDEO),"The Rolling Stones are now on a growing list of rock stars who have asked Republicans to stop using their music. This time it was Donald Trump, who has been playing the Stones  music at his rallies.Just one day after Trump unofficially sealed the GOP nomination, the band stated that they had not given permission for the billionaire to use their music and they asked that he  cease all use immediately. Ironically, the song in question is  You Can t Always Get What You Want,  which is about compromise   something the Republicans know little to nothing about and something that goes against everything Donald Trump has been campaigning against. The campaign has also played  Start Me Up. Trump, who will take anyone to court for virtually anything, seems not to care very much about artists  intellectual property rights.Trump, perhaps more than most candidates, uses music to energize his crowds. Here s just one small sample, although not with the song in question:TrumpTube, which is like YouTube for Donald Trump, posted his playlist and the Rolling Stones song is still at the very top, with an unofficial video, of course.Adele and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler both asked the candidate to stop using their recorded songs to fire up crowds. Neil Young also objected when the real estate mogul used  Rockin  in the Free World  during his campaign kickoff announcement last year. In those cases, the Trump campaign stopped using the songs.Source: CBS NewsTwisted Sister is also twisted up about Trump using their music without permission. Noted liberals R.E.M. were also fed up with being used by Trump.Trump is far from the only Republican to receive backlash from artists for using their music. FiveThirtyEight compiled this list last year, after Neil Young told Trump to knock it off. The list begins with Ronald Reagan, after Bruce Springsteen famously told him that  Born In The USA  didn t mean what Reagan thought it did. Both Bushes received cease and desist orders. John McCain made enemies of a whopping nine artists   as diverse as ABBA, Heart, Jackson Brown, Tom Petty and the Foo Fighters. John Cougar Mellencamp had to ask two GOP candidates, McCain and Reagan, to stop using  Pink Houses.  Again, they had no idea what that song was about.Whether Trump (or any others of the candidates) was really violating copyright law is up to interpretation. Most commercially marketed music is licensed through one of two organizations, ASCAP and BMI. Campaigns can buy licenses without the artists  permission in most cases, however, some of the more powerful and influential artists do have some say over what songs can be included in the licensing agreements.Trump s campaign hasn t yet commented.Featured image via YouTube screen shot.",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" After Trump’s Win, Conservatives Are Begging The Senate To Approve Obama’s SCOTUS Pick (VIDEO)","A lot has changed since Ted Cruz dropped out of the race for the GOP presidential nomination, leaving Donald Trump as the presumptive nominee. Well, perhaps not a lot has changed, but it was a bit of a shocker when, because of Trump s victory, the  ber conservative website RedState suggested that now would be the time for the Senate to approve the nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.Now, to be fair, RedState, which is published by Erick Erickson, a man once called the most powerful conservative in America, has never been a fan of Trump. Much of the blog s front page, as of late, has been dedicated to the #NeverTrump movement. Here is how badly RedState wants you not to vote for Trump:I say this without rancor, sarcasm or ill will. For anyone who wants to know what s next for the #NeverTrump movement, the answer is that we don t vote for Trump. Each person will deal with that differently   some will vote for third party or not vote. Some will vote for Hillary. #NeverTrump means different things to different people except for one thing   it means we will not vote for Trump, not ever. And nothing that s happened tonight has changed that.Over the course of the next few weeks and months and years, as a conservative movement we will spend a great deal of time in self reflection, examining the weaknesses in our movement that allowed a cancer like Trump to flourish in our midst. We will have hard decisions to make about our affiliation with the Republican party, and what we will do with our votes in November.But one thing and one thing only remains certain: Donald Trump will never have our vote. We said it, and we meant it.Yikes. But what does that have to do with the nomination of Merrick Garland? Well, RedState is convinced that there s no way on earth that Trump could make it to the White House, and that if Hillary nominates someone, she might nominate a *duh duh duh* liberal.Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee, this is not even a close call. There is absolutely no reason to drag this out any longer. Garland is not a great choice, but he is not a terrible one, either. And more than anything, he is old (for a modern Supreme Court appointment) and will be up for replacement in probably 10 years instead of 20 or 30.Republicans must know that there is absolutely no chance that we will win the White House in 2016 now. They must also know that we are likely to lose the Senate as well. So the choices, essentially, are to confirm Garland and have another bite at the apple in a decade, or watch as President Clinton nominates someone who is radically more leftist and 10-15 years younger, and we are in no position to stop it.Unfortunately, no matter how many Senators agree with RedState, there s little chance that Garland will see a confirmation hearing. Only one man stands between him and the hearing, and that man has vowed to never, under any circumstances, negotiate with terrorists President Obama. Even as of Wednesday, Mitch McConnell is standing resolute to obstruct.To be fair, RedState s article wasn t an editorial stance. Erickson himself hates Trump, probably as much as you or I, but he s not ready to go so far as to concede anything to the black man in the White House. Naturally, he didn t say that, but he is concerned that independents might vote for Hillary. From NBC News: If Republicans confirm Merrick Garland, in addition to further alienating the Republican base, they risk taking away keep arguments that can persuade independent voters to go with a Republican Senate. Ticket splitting is a rare phenomenon in the United States, but this is a rare election where ticket splitting is a real possibility,  Erickson wrote.Yes, ticket splitting is a real possibility, but 2/3 of Americans want to see at least a hearing, if not a confirmation. Perhaps going forward with a hearing could help solidify the fractured party.Featured image via Wikimedia.

 DOJ Tells North Carolina Republicans That Anti-LGBT Law Violates Civil Rights Act,"There has been a national uproar over HB2 ever since North Carolina Republicans passed it into law last month. The law allows business owners to discriminate against LGBT customers and employees under the guise of religious freedom, including transgender people, whom Republicans claim are a threat to women and children in bathrooms despite the fact that there have been no instances of a transgender person using protections to defend sexually assaulting a woman or child in a bathroom.What HB2 has done is cause an all-out revolt against the state by lawmakers, corporations, small businesses, activists, and entertainers. Business projects are being halted and concerts are being cancelled, causing a loss of potential jobs and needed boosts to local economies.And it is about to get even worse as North Carolina now faces the loss of millions of federal dollars because the Department of Justice has sent a letter to Governor Pat McCrory informing him that HB2 violates the Civil Rights Act.According to the Charlotte Observer, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta found that the bigoted law violated Title VII and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act. Title VII says employers may not discriminate against people. And Title IX says schools cannot discriminate against people based on sex.Gupta and the DOJ then gave Governor McCrory until May 9th to respond to the letter by confriming that the state will comply with federal law and dump HB2.Here s the letter via the Charlotte Observer: The Department of Justice has determined that, as a result of compliance with and implementation of NC House Bill2, both you and the state of NC are in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 0f 1964 Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual on the basis of sex and from otherwise resisting the full enjoyment of Title VII rights .Federal courts and administrative agencies have applied Title VII to discrimination against transgender individuals based on sex, including gender identity .Access to sex-segregated restrooms and other workplace facilities consistent with gender identity is a term, condition or privilege of employment. Denying such access to transgender individuals, whose gender identity is different from the gender assigned at birth, while affording it to similarly situated non-transgender employees, violates Title VII  HB 2 is facially discriminatory against transgender employees on the basis of sex because it treats transgender employees, whose gender identity does not match their biological sex, as defined by HB2, differently from similarly situated non transgender employees Based upon the above, we have concluded that in violation of Title VII, the state is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of Title VII rights by employees of public agencies Please advise the department, therefore, no later than the close of business on May 9, 2016, whether you will remedy these violations of Title VII including by confirming that the state will not comply with or implement HB2 .We further inform you that that today the department sent letters addressed to the NC Department of Public Safety and the University of NC similarly notifying them of our conclusion that they have engaged in violations of Title VII as well as violations of Title IX. If Republicans refuse to back down, they risk costing their state nearly $1 billion in federal education funding alone, which would be a devastating blow to North Carolina.Here s a helpful video about HB2 via the Charlotte Observer as well:Clearly, Governor McCrory and his Republican colleagues seriously need to repeal this discriminatory law or facs serious backlash on a level that will likely spur voters to throw them out of office during the next statewide election, and that s assuming voters haven t already decided to do so.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Gloves Are OFF: Hillary’s New Ad Uses Republicans To Absolutely PUMMEL Trump (VIDEO),"How does the old saying go?  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Which is exactly the strategy the Clinton campaign is utilizing to move forward against Donald Trump.Hillary Clinton just released a new ad throughout all her social media channels to deliver the message that not only do she and her fellow Democrats want to defeat Trump and believe he is bad news, but so does a majority of the Republican Party.As Trump likes to claim that he is a  unifier,  the opposite actually seems to be true. His divisive rhetoric is toxic, and any Republican who values their career, and any conservative voter who values human decency, would be wise to distance themselves as far away as possible from the real estate mogul/reality television star.The ones who have backed Trump have likely done so as a gamble that Trump will win and they can ride his coattails into his administration. What they don t seem to realize is, they re going to go down in history as backing the guy who called Mexican s  rapists,  told Muslims they shouldn t be allowed to enter the country, and calls women every name in the book.Trump cannot be allowed to step foot into the Oval Office, and many Republicans agree, as pointed out in this brilliant video put out by the Clinton campaign. If we re going to  unify,  we need to do so as a nation to prevent Trump from winning. For the good of all humanity.Here s the video:""President Trump"" is a dangerous proposition.Mitt Romney, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio agree.https://t.co/fUkISvgaXC  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 4, 2016Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservative ‘Christians’ Panic After Ted Cruz Defies God’s Wishes And Drops Out Of Race,"According to Ted Cruz and many of his staunchest supporters, God ordained him to be the next president of the United States.Back in August, an Iowa Republican literally claimed that God prepared Ted Cruz to be president. We need someone who will go to Washington and throw the money-changers out,  Iowa GOP Chair Matt Schultz declared.  God raises special men and women to protect his people, and I believe this is one of those moments in time.   Ted Cruz is that man who God has prepared for this moment in time. In addition, Cruz s wife claimed that God sent her a sign that her husband should run for president and Cruz s father Rafael declared his son the  anointed one. Of course, conservative  Christians  bought this hook, line, and sinker. And now they are devastated because Cruz defied God s wishes and dropped out of the race.American Family Association spokesman Bryan Fischer expressed his disappointment on Twitter and called for writing in Cruz s name on the ballot instead of voting for Donald Trump.Tonight is a bad night for Ted Cruz. But it is a terrible night for the United States, our children, and our grandchildren.  Bryan Fischer (@BryanJFischer) May 3, 2016 43 states allow write-in votes for president. Does the write-in campaign for Ted Cruz start tomorrow?  Bryan Fischer (@BryanJFischer) May 4, 2016Cruz supporters had the sads as well, expressing their condolences on his Facebook page.And one Cruz supporter blamed just about everyone except Cruz himself for the defeat.Right-wing talk show host Steve Deace threw a hissy fit after Cruz dropped out by immediately leaving the Republican Party and declaring that America wanted to be spanked by God by voting for Trump. The country missed an opportunity here with an imperfect vessel to try and take a step back towards the righteous path, but it is what it is,  Deace wrote.  And yes, there are things Cruz could ve done differently, but when you re up against a zeitgeist as well as a long overdue providential spanking, there s only so much anyone can do. America clearly dodged a bullet by Cruz dropping out of the race. While the debate continues on whether or not Trump actually believes what he has been saying, Cruz definitely believed every word that came out of his own mouth, including his intention to discriminate against non-Christians and gay people as well as outlawing abortion to the point where he would even force rape victims to carry pregnancies to term.But the bottom line here is that Ted Cruz literally believed that God wanted him to become president in November, yet he dropped out of the race anyway. Apparently, reality trumped faith on Tuesday night, and Evangelicals can t handle the truth.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" CNN Just Accidentally Aired Girl Flipping Off Trump Tower, And It’s Spectacular (IMAGE)","After Donald Trump won the Indiana primary on Tuesday and Ted Cruz dropped out, Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee. This means, that a reality television star and real estate mogul who puts down women and minorities, as well as also being endorsed by the KKK, is going to represent the GOP this November at the ballot box for President of the United States.This is a moment when satire becomes reality, and all you can really do is hold up hope that the Democrats will win.Trump as president is a horrifying prospect. He has zero public policy experience, no foreign policy experience, and is pretty much hated worldwide. The world is looking at the United States right now as if we have lost our ever-loving minds. How could such a vile person be a legitimate choice for leader of the free world?If you don t believe he is hated, because maybe you re a bigot yourself, or maybe you hate yourself enough to like him, or you are absolutely ignorant to reality, take a glimpse at what CNN just accidentally aired.Behind the CNN reporter speaking about Trump supposedly wanting to help the GOP raise money, there is a woman who is speaking for all of us in one united voice as she give Trump Tower the middle finger. Thus, flipping off Donald Trump.Here s the image that was captured as it happened:via CNNSome may think this is crude, but so is Donald Trump. If he can dish out insult after insult, and vile comment after vile comment, then he deserves to get a middle finger pointed in his general direction.Donald Trump should not and cannot be our next president.

 WATCH: Kimmel Humiliates Trolls Who Attacked Him Over Climate Science By Reading Their Comments On Air,"On Monday, Jimmy Kimmel mercilessly mocked Sarah Palin for denying climate science by literally bringing real scientists on his show. We ve had 15 of the 16 hottest years ever since 2001,  Kimmel told his audience. That s not an opinion. It s a fact. For some reason whether or not humans are contributing to this has become a left versus right issue. The politicians debate it. Our scientists don t. A huge majority of climate scientists say climate change is happening. They say we re causing it and we need to do something about it before it has a terrible effect on all of us. There s no debate about the greenhouse effect, just like there s no debate about gravity. It someone throws a piano off the roof, I don t care what Sarah Palin tells you   get out of the way. It s coming down on your head. Kimmel said that he expected right-wing trolls to attack him for his defense of science and his prediction became reality as many Palin fans flocked to social media to prove their stupidity.So, on Wednesday, Kimmel responded.Rather than respond by writing back to his haters on Facebook and other social media platforms, Kimmel chose to just embarrass the hell out of them instead by reading their comments on national television. It might seem I only picked comments from people whose grammar is bad, but the truth is, the vast majority of the comments came from people whose grammar is bad,  Kimmel began before reading a series of comments from people who clearly needed to pay more attention in school.Jim Jacob couldn t even get Kimmel s name right when he wrote,  Mr Kimble if you are so smart many you should get a real job like climate scientists I give up you!. Erik Simmy defended Palin by accusing scientists of  lying to teeth. Sarah Palin might not be a scientist what she is saying doesn t need to be science to be understood the very scientists who claim to be telling the truth about global warming they know they re lying to teeth to help the government control our lives in the name of global warming. There are more comments and they are just as ridiculously idiotic as the other ones.Here s the video via YouTube.These right-wing trolls had no idea that their stupidity would be aired for all to see. If they had known, perhaps they would have kept their mouths shut. Jimmy Kimmel just taught them a valuable lesson. Watch what you say on social media because you re not as anonymous as you think you are.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

These people are not just random GOP voters who don t like Donald Trump, they are very prominent, high profile voices of the party and they are so disgusted with the nominee that they are LEAVING the party.

 Calm Down! Democrats Are Going To Stomp Trump Into The Ground,"After Tuesday s semi-coronation of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, a lot of people, both liberal and conservative, took to social media to hyperventilate over the impending disaster of Trump winning the 2016 election.Donald Trump is never going to be President of the United States. Ever. Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic nominee and she s going to mop the floor with him.Here are a few facts to consider:There s more but you get the idea. Trump is toxic in every way imaginable. His message of hate combined with pretending to care about the middle class will not scale up to the national level.Despite what you may hear, Hillary is actually a strong candidate. As a former First Lady, former Senator and former Secretary of State that s spent her entire adult life fighting for one liberal cause or another (women s rights, universal healthcare, LGBT rights, etc.), Hillary Clinton is insanely prepared and qualified to be president. She s also smart. Really smart. Obama smart. Run circles around Donald Trump smart.Whether you like her or not, you cannot deny that Hillary Clinton has strong grasp on the issues. She can rattle off facts and figures faster than most people can google them. She has detailed plans that she is more than happy to explain at great length if you want. Compare that to Trump s 4th-5th grade grammar and flimsy grasp of any issue and you re looking at a series of debates that will be humiliating for  The Don. Something else to to consider is that while the GOP was hampered in its ability to attack Trump, the left will be under no such constraints. There are hours and hours of footage of Donald Trump saying horrible things about pretty much every group of Americans that are not white men. The ads write themselves and Trump s hate only sells with his chunk of the GOP s already racist base. Hillary will have an embarrassment of riches to choose from. Added bonus, she won t even have to play dirty to do it. While Hillary is no stranger to a down and dirty political fight (something else that will serve her well as president), she can take the moral high ground and let Trump fling mud at himself.Another useful Clinton fact is that she is the single most scrutinized and vetted politician on the planet. Yeah, yeah, yeah, she s  untrustworthy  and a  crook  but when you ask the people saying that what crime she s committed, you get vague comments about her emails or something about taking bribes as Secretary of State. They can t produce any evidence but, darn it! they KNOW she s guilty of .something!But after 20+ years of Republicans spending an unlimited amount of resources, manpower and time into digging up dirt on her, Hillary has yet to have a scandal stick. The  liberal  media has been trying to claim her scalp for just as long and have failed miserably. These are the people that uncovered some of the deepest, darkest secrets of the United States government but the best they could come up with on Clinton was rumors and innuendo.I don t know about you, but that suggests that maybe, just maybe, there s no real scandal to dig up. And let s be honest, the right has tried so hard, for so long, to pin something, ANYTHING, on her that the public has been inured to it by now. They overplayed their Benghazi hand so badly that it stopped being a campaign issue right when they needed it the most. The same thing will happen for all of their new  scandals.  They ll rush them out, the  liberal  media will breathlessly report them as total fact and then the  scandal  will crumble. Rinse, repeat.It didn t work on Obama and the public isn t biting anymore.And finally, this is what the electoral map looks like right now according to statistics genius Nate Silver:And it s only going to get bluer the more both Clinton and Trump speak.This doesn t mean we should get complacent. Quite the opposite, in fact! We have an unparalleled opportunity to take back the House, the Senate and several state governments. Trump will both energize the blue vote and seriously suppress the red vote and we should be swarming the polls to take back the country from the Tea Party idiots that made Trump the nominee in the first place.Stay calm and vote blue!Featured image via twitter.",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin Just Sent A Truly Idiotic Message to ‘Smart Democrats’ (VIDEO),"Now that Ted Cruz has dropped out of the presidential race and Donald Trump looks like he s going to be the Republican nominee, Sarah Palin came out in full support   and stupidity   for her favorite candidate.Taking to her Facebook page, Palin made a video where she praised The Donald and thanked his supporters for believing in the disgraced frontrunner. She said: To all of you who believed in making a real difference in our politics and in the way things have been done in the past that have put America in a pretty precarious position. Thank you so much for supporting Trump and believing in this idea of being able to make America great again. We re finally on the road to do so, but we do have to unite first. The former governor of Alaska, who is also the failed GOP vice presidential candidate of 2008, has decided that she s more than qualified to predict the success of a Trump presidency, and has a message for any  smart Democrats  that might be listening. Her advice to them? Unite behind Donald Trump. Addressing  GOP and independents and smart Democrats,  Palin said: Truly it is time to come together, pull together   remember that united we will stand, our country will stand united. Divided, we re going to fall. So now, after participating in some really healthy, kind of arduous competition, and now, more than ever, it s time to come together and put some differences aside. Stand on principle, that principle that, yeah, we have opportunity to make America great again. We ve needed a revolution, and we ve found our revolutionary. Thanks for all your hard work. Congratulations, Donald J. Trump   and here we go, on the road to make America great again. You can watch the video below:Sarah Palin is one of those GOPers that we wish would just go away, but she always seems to find a way to put herself back into the spotlight and remind us of her existence. When Trump decided to run for president, Palin had found her political soulmate and didn t hesitate to back him. The crazy thing is, she thinks the rest of us are stupid enough to follow in her footsteps.To ask Democrats to unite under a party that has built their values on hate and inequality is ludicrous   and you have to possess a special sort of stupidity to even suggest this. Most Americans   even many Republicans   know that Trump is in no condition to lead the country. So no matter who the nominee for the Democratic party is, the majority of the country will be voting blue in November. No one   not even the GOP   wants to see Trump in the White House.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Isn’t Going To Like This Fox News Reaction To His Victory In The Primaries (VIDEO),"While the Trump campaign and its candidate celebrate the surrender of his final real competitor for the Republican nomination, there will be no pleasure about this incredible situation from Fox News.Charles Krauthammer, a Pulitzer prize winning conservative journalist, and long-term Trump critic appeared on the O Reilly Factor to pour a bucket of ice water over the celebration   telling O Reilly that a man of Trump s temperament has no place in the White House, or anywhere near the nuclear codes.The interview began with O Reilly asking Krauthammer to give his view on how the GOP establishment felt about Trump becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the United States. His guest replied calmly: I have no idea what the so-called establishment, if it exists, is thinking. I can tell you what I m thinking.  And boy, he really did.O Reilly asks Krauthammer if he would vote for Trump, who responds that based on the campaign so far: I don t think I d be capable voting for Donald Trump. The Fox host then attempts to sell Krauthammer on Trump, as if all the racist, sexist, frat bro behavior from the candidate so far will all fade away once the race for President moves into it s next phase. Finally, after working up this fantasy version of Trump, he asks his guest why he wouldn t vote for Donald if he re-positioned himself as a practical-popular-conservative. Why couldn t you vote for him?  O Reilly asks, before Krauthammer delivers a killer deadpan response with: Populist conservative is a contradiction in terms. O Reilly takes his guest to task on the issue, claiming that he (O Reilly) is a traditional populist   to which Krauthammer replies that he wouldn t vote for Bill O Reilly for President either. And there s a second issue.  Krauthammer continues.  His fitness for office. It s matter of temperament and up until now he s not impressed me with his temperament. You have to ask yourself, do I want a person of that temperament, control of the nuclear codes. And as of now I have to say no. While O Reilly continues to run defense for the Trump campaign, his guest Krauthammer bangs the final nail into the coffin. He wins it by floating conspiracy theories that you know and I know are in the twilight zone. In the same way that he led the birther movement. That wasn t ancient history. That was five years ago. Playing with absurd and kooky conspiracy theories is way beyond being unconventional. It is disturbing. And that s when you gotta ask yourself. Do you want someone who does that, in control of the nuclear codes? It looks like Trump is going to be facing some blowback from conservatives who are sick of their party being hijacked by the lunatic fringe. It s great news for the Democrats and liberal America, as it means the 2016 election may well see the GOP tear itself apart   leaving the Democratic nominee to a landslide.Here s the video:Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Campaign Hits New Low With These Sexist Anti-Hillary Buttons (IMAGES),"Donald Trump s campaign has prided itself on launching every kind of dirty trick and bigotry in the book, and now wades into a further sexism row with these anti-Hillary buttons.Washington Post reporter Jenna Johnson was covering the Trump rally in Indiana this week, when she was astonished to discover the presence of campaign buttons designed to mock Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.One button read:KFC Hillary Special: 2 fat thighs, 2 small breasts, left wing.Another bore an image of Mrs Clinton, with the subtitle:Life s a b*tch Don t vote for one.A new batch of anti-Hillary-Clinton buttons popped up outside Donald Trump's rally tonight: pic.twitter.com/VxKkxSS2We  Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) May 3, 2016The buttons come as a reminder that Trump s campaign is a class free zone and no level to which he and his supporters will not stoop to score a political point.They will mock a person s disability View post on imgur.comThey will attack a person on the basis on their ethnic origin And of course, Trump and his supporters have zero issue with hitting out with violently abusive sexist language either. Whether it s Rosie O Donnell, or Megyn Kelly, or Hillary Clinton   any woman who fails to sufficiently kiss The Donald s ring is opening herself up to a world of abuse and threats.Trump has nursed his vendetta against Rosie O Donnell since 2006, because the comedian criticized him for deciding not to fire Miss USA Tara Conner after drug use, underage drinking and sexual activities were exposed. Ten years later, Trump still takes every opportunity to stick it to O Donnell whenever he can.  Nice years later, when O Donnell left The View after suffering a heart attack and stress, Trump said:I mean she s a total trainwreck, so let s see what happens and I hope it works out well.   I like the show a lot, but let s face it, Rosie is a loser. And when Megyn Kelly challenged him during a Presidential debate on describing women as fat pigs , dogs , slobs  and  disgusting animals,  Trump responded: Only Rosie O Donnell. But the fact that Kelly dared to call Trump on his abusive language towards women, meant she became his next target. In Trump s world, Kelly burned him on national television and he will continue to fire back at her until his dying breath. Some highlights of his interminable abuse in the year since include:While all this is morally repugnant, it really doesn t bode well for Trump s chances of securing the White House. He may well have mobilized the hardline of the Republican right   but when he gets up and tries to confront (most likely) Hillary Clinton in the Presidential debates, armed with nothing more than a few dog tired T&A jokes   he s going to be in serious trouble. And so is the Republican Party.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons/Flickr Creative Commons",News,"May 4, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Samantha Bee Tells Ted Cruz What He Should’ve Done With His Campaign, And It’s Beyond Perfect","Coming into Tuesday s Republican primary in Indiana it was pretty much do or die for Ted Cruz. He had to win or his campaign for the presidency was effectively over. And boy did he try. He put all he could into trying to win over the Hoosier state, but try as he might, he failed miserably. Donald Trump won with over 50 percent of the vote and Ted Cruz was left with a tough decision to make.By the end of Cruz s speech after his Indiana loss it was pretty damn clear that he was about to suspend his campaign. He spoke in broad, sweeping conservative analogies that had nothing to do with becoming president. And what seemed obvious became reality when he told everyone that he was pulling out of the race.One person, however, saw the delicious irony in Cruz quitting early, and that person was Full Frontal s Samantha Bee. She took to Twitter to tell Cruz what he should have done with his campaign.Bee wrote: Shouldn t Ted Cruz have been forced to carry his unviable campaign to term? Shouldn't #TedCruz have been forced to carry his unviable campaign to term?  Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) May 4, 2016Of course, this being a play on Cruz s ridiculous stance on abortion rights. The man claims he stands up for women, but apparently that means loving women so much that he s the person to make all of their health decisions. He s also been one of the key reasons the Planned Parenthood myth of baby body parts has gone on for so long.Ted Cruz is a liar and a smarmy salesman that just couldn t figure out how to sell himself to the American voting public. He was so bad, in fact, that he couldn t even make himself look good next to Donald Trump.Bee also tweeted:At least the #TedCruz campaign died as it lived under Trump's heel while Republicans looked on with indifference.

 Elizabeth Warren Did NOT Mince Words In Her Reaction To Trump’s Presumptive Nomination,"With Donald Trump s latest primary victory in Indiana, he s all but secured the Republican nomination for president and can be considered the presumptive nominee. What sealed the deal was also the fact that Ted Cruz suspended his campaign and will no longer be seeking the nomination. And with Kasich not even close behind in delegates, it s pretty much a sure thing for The Donald.Taking to social media after Trump s victory and presumed nomination was Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). She did not mince words, and got deadly serious letting us all know that it s on us to make sure Donald Trump doesn t get anywhere near the Oval Office.Warren wrote on Facebook: Donald Trump is now the leader of the Republican Party. It s real   he is one step away from the White House. Here s what else is real:Trump has built his campaign on racism, sexism, and xenophobia. There s more enthusiasm for him among leaders of the KKK than leaders of the political party he now controls.He incites supporters to violence, praises Putin, and, according to a columnist who recently interviewed him, is  cool with being called an authoritarian  and doesn t mind associations with history s worst dictators.He attacks veterans like John McCain who were captured and puts our servicemembers at risk by cheerleading illegal torture. In a world with ISIS militants and leaders like North Korean strongman Kim Jong-Un conducting nuclear tests, he surrounds himself with a foreign policy team that has been called a  collection of charlatans,  and puts out contradictory and nonsensical national security ideas one expert recently called  incoherent  and  truly bizarre. What happens next will test the character for all of us   Republican, Democrat, and Independent. It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man s narcissism and divisiveness. I know which side I m on, and I m going to fight my heart out to make sure Donald Trump s toxic stew of hatred and insecurity never reaches the White House. And reiterated her point on Twitter shortly after.I'm going to fight my heart out to make sure @realDonaldTrump s toxic stew of hatred & insecurity never reaches the White House.

 5 Reasons The Republicans Just Nominated The Worst Possible Candidate: Trump,"Donald Trump has cleared the Republican presidential field of all the credible (and not so credible) challengers, and is now the presumptive nominee for the same party that produced Teddy Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, and Ronald Reagan. It is amazing.But in picking Trump as their nominee, the Republican Party has chosen a candidate with a binder full of negatives, so many negatives in fact that it is highly unlikely he can overcome enough of them to win the presidency.Here are 5 of the reasons.70 percent of women in a recent Gallup poll have a negative view of Donald Trump. That s because Trump has a long record   including in this campaign   of attacking women. He s called them pigs, talked about their bathroom habits, complained about their periods, and on and on.Women are the majority of American voters, and Republicans have lost that demographic for years. Even when they have won the presidency, they ve lost with women.And while it isn t all she is, Hillary Clinton will obviously be the first major party nominee to be a woman. So far, Trump has not reacted well to this, accusing her of playing  the woman card,  with her candidacy, a sexist comment that echoed with millions of working women voters. The Clinton campaign was able to raise over $2 million just by highlighting Trump s comment and giving donors a  woman card  to mark the moment.Mitt Romney was pilloried over his comment that he had  binders full  of women, and he never was half as sexist as Trump has been on an average day.Donald Trump is most unpopular candidate for a major political party basically since polling was invented. Trump has an average of 60.6 percent disapproval!That is unheard of going into the party conventions, where candidates are usually a blank canvas before attack ads start to fly in the fall. But Trump is one of the most well-known people in America, and what America has seen   it doesn t like.President Obama nearly coasted to national electoral victories in back to back elections with a diverse, young, electorate. And while Hillary Clinton has had trouble connecting with younger voters in the Democratic primary, Donald Trump is the best positioned candidate to motivate the Obama coalition against him.He polls poorly with women, minorities, and in a recent poll younger voters indicated that despite their reservations about Clinton, they have near to no interest in Trump.At this point in the 2012 election, President Obama was 3.4 percent ahead of Mitt Romney in head-to-head national matchups. By comparison, Clinton leads Trump by an average of 6.2 percent, and that includes a poll from conservative pollster Rasmussen who got the 2012 election completely wrong.Most other recent polls show Clinton with leads of +11%, +7% and +11%.The New York Times  Nate Cohn explains why this is unlikely to change much:There have been 10-point shifts over the general election season before, even if it s uncommon. But there isn t much of a precedent for huge swings in races with candidates as well known as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. A majority of Americans may not like her, but they say they re scared of him. To have a chance, he ll need to change that.Unlike President George W. Bush in 2008, President Obama is unlikely to be a drag on the ticket. In addition to the unusual image of a sitting president campaigning for his party s nominee (Reagan was too ill to do it in 1988, the Gore campaign pushed Clinton away in 2000, and McCain did his best to hide from Bush in 2008), President Obama s approval ratings have inched back up over the last year, often above or near 50 percent.Additionally, the unemployment rate is at 5 percent, after hitting almost 10 percent in the Bush economy, and gas prices have come way down. Polls now show Americans feel good about the economy, after Obama s policies have gotten the country out of the Great Recession (without Republican help).That s good for the party in power, which means it s good for Hillary Clinton, and bad for Donald Trump.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The GOP Is Officially DOOMED As Cruz Drops Out And Trump Takes Command,"Ted Cruz has officially quit the 2016 Republican presidential race, according to a statement released by his campaign manager Jeff Roe. This brings an end to the last desperate hope that Republicans had to stop Donald Trump from leading their party directly into the 9th layer of Hell in the 2016 presidential election.Trump completely smashed Cruz, by approximately a 16 percent margin in the Indiana primary. John Kasich also technically still existed, coming in with less than 10 percent of the vote.Kasich has pledged to stay in the race until either he or Trump reach the required threshold of 1,237 delegates. Aside from most people saying  John who?  a reason this is a futile effort is that it s mathematically impossible for him to win enough delegates to beat Trump. To put it into context, Cruz needed fewer delegates and even he dropped out after Trump walked away with a gift-wrapped Indiana primary win.Cruz threw in everything including the kitchen sink to secure a win in Indiana. He colluded with John Kasich in a so-called  alliance  to try to swing a heavier vote count towards himself in order to take away from Trump s chances, he picked a VP candidate, even though she is universally reviled (what was he thinking?), and there was massive super PAC money doing ad-buys. He even netted the governor s endorsement.In the end, it was an embarrassing blowout that told him what everyone has been saying for months; The RNC is speeding towards the edge of a cliff, and Trump is in the drivers seat.Cruz issued some short remarks following his blistering defeat: We left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we ve got but the voters chose another path. So with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign. Sourece: CNNTechnically speaking, Trump still needs to gather more delegates in the remaining primaries before he will win the nomination hands-down, but with Cruz out and Kasich being relegated to obscurity as a GOP protest vote, there s really nothing stopping Trump from usurping control of the Republican party. Will you be watching as the Republican party has to smile and hand Trump his nomination in Cleveland?Featured image via Tombstone Generator",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Arizona Governor Blocks 31,000 Low-Income Children From Access To Life Saving Healthcare","As Arizona grapples with passing their Constitutionally required budget, its governor, Doug Ducey, informed legislators that he will no longer be supporting the extension of the state s KidsCare program. The program, which is a branch of the Children s Health Insurance Program (which Hillary Clinton lobbied for), serves over 31,000 low-income children, many of whom have chronic illnesses.Steve Farley, a Democratic Senator in the legislature, posted on Facebook:Such sad news. We just received word that the Governor is no longer supporting the extension of KidsCare healthcare to 31,000 low-income children, and is now saying those kids, many of whom are suffering chronic illnesses, will have to wait till next year. We remain the only state in the country that does not cover these kids.Gov. Ducey decided it would be too much trouble to overcome the opposition of extremist ideologues in the House, even though we had the Senate votes to win.There would be ZERO COST to the state to extend this coverage. Some of those kids will not be alive next year. This is a complete failure of leadership on the part of the Governor and the legislative majorityLet that sink in: if the Governor gets his way, Arizona will continue to be the only state that does not cover low-income children s healthcare services. Even Kansas, which is on the brink of near total financial collapse, extends this program.The program was cut almost in its entirety in 2011 thanks to Arizona s former governor Jan Brewer. Not only did she cut the program, she imposed enrollment caps on the Medicaid system to ensure that program would almost never return. Those actions caused 14,000 children to lose their healthcare. In total, with the caps put into place, over 300,000 lost their access.Reports released by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families found these startling facts about Arizona s heartless treatment of children:But don t worry, folks. In the Arizona budget, there s about  $18 million that will go towards private prisons. So while some kids face a totally preventable death, prisons will get their coffers stuffed with all sorts of monetary rewards.Hooray for pro-life Republicans!Featured image via Maury Phillips/Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Amnesty International’s Brilliant ‘Gay Turtle’ Experiment Mocks The Absurdity Of Homophobia (VIDEO),"Amnesty International recently put out a brilliant public service announcement in Turkey, with the hope that they will show people how absurd it is to hate the LGBT community.The video was filmed in a Turkish aquarium shop over three days and features a  gay  turtle. The organization put eight hidden cameras in the shop and caught a whole lot of dumbf*ckery. In the video, potential turtle buyers walked into the store and over to the tank where the turtles were held. They all seemed extremely eager to purchase one of the adorable reptiles, until the employee at the shop dropped a bomb: the turtle they were interested in was gay.As soon as the man made the announcement, the customers all reacted with disgust and disbelief. One woman asked, Is it contagious?  Another said the turtle can t be both gay and healthy. A few of them even got angry with the employee for mentioning homosexuality.After all of the homophobes leave the store, the screen turns black and a message from Amnesty International flashes across the screen: Homophobia and transphobia has reached absurd levels in Turkey. In last five years, it has caused hundreds of hate crimes and more than 41 hate murders. Love is love. Hate is a choice. Turkey has been in the news many times over the last few years for this very reason. In 2014, the Middle Eastern news agency Al Monitor reported about a rise in  honor killings  of homosexuals in the country and they told a story about an underage teenager who escaped his family s attempt to murder him: I was beaten by family members after they learned I was homosexual. After the beating, my father held a gun to my head, put a Quran in my hands and told me to repent. I somehow managed to run away the following day. My family stormed the homes of my friends and battered them, too. I have nowhere to take refuge. My life is in danger. .The teenager s story is heartbreaking, but he could still be considered lucky  for now   as many homosexuals in Turkey perish at the hands of their own relatives in  honor killings. The video does an amazing job at pointing out how stupid homophobes are. These people were so blinded by their fear and hate that they could not think logically, and that is a common theme among the anti-gay community. They never stop and consider that maybe their beliefs are misguided and based on bullshit; it is as absurd as it is terrifying.Watch:https://www.facebook.com/NDebzOfficial/videos/vb.245756372222073/789077954556576/?type=2&theaterFeatured image via video screenshot",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Ends His Campaign By Elbowing His Wife In The Face (VIDEO),"In case you haven t heard, God s chosen candidate, Ted Cruz, either disproved God s existence or showed the world that the Big-Guy-in-the-Sky REALLY hates smarmy, bigoted douchebags. Yes, the embarrassment to America that was Ted Cruz s campaign is finally over. Fate swallowed his chances up like that throat booger he ate on national television during a debate. You can all rest assured knowing that the Republican Party s destruction is finally complete in that Donald Trump is considered the most qualified candidate for the office of President.What better way to end his presidential campaign than to elbow his wife in the face? You may be staring at your screen wondering,  Did he just say what I think he said?  Yes, by punching and elbowing his wife in the face. While it was almost assuredly as much an accident as abstinence-only advocate Bristol Palin s multiple out-of-wedlock pregnancies, it actually happened.Still don t believe me? Watch:As Cruz was hugging his father, while his bigoted, homophobic, and hateful supporters looked on, the now-former presidential candidate accidentally did what most of America wants to do to him: he accidentally popped Heidi in the jaw then followed up with an elbow to the face.His campaign, which was built on catering to the absolute worst people in society s hatred and stupidity (the ones Trump had not already snagged up anyway), was truly an embarrassment to our nation   almost as embarrassing as the fact that his own daughter hates him just as much as the rest of us.But what will Cruz do now? Will he commit himself to the Senate, where he can continue to attempt to install a theofascist regime in America and fight diligently to take away the rights of anyone he thinks God tells him to hate? Will he come to terms with the fact that he, as the candidate he himself has stated God  chose  to lead America into the Promised Land, probably isn t the super-Christian he thinks he is? Will he continue his alleged career as the Zodiac Killer?No matter what Cruz does, one thing is for certain: he s probably going to spend some time in the  dog house  rather than the White House.Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" HISTORIC: Obama Working On Gay Rights Memorial, And The Right Can’t Stop Him","President Obama has of course made history as the first black president in American history, but one of the stories that is sure to be told about his presidency is the steps made to help bring LGBT Americans into the mainstream of the national dialogue. They have, of course, always been there, but they have an ally at the highest levels of the government unlike at any other time.Now President Obama, in what is supposed to be his so-called  lame duck  period, is working on a federal monument to the struggle for gay rights at Stonewall in New York City.President Obama is poised to declare the first-ever national monument recognizing the struggle for gay rights, singling out a sliver of green space and part of the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood as the birthplace of America s modern gay liberation movement.While most national monuments have highlighted iconic wild landscapes or historic sites from centuries ago, this reflects the country s diversity of terrain and peoples in a different vein: It would be the first national monument anchored by a dive bar and surrounded by a warren of narrow streets that long has been regarded the historic center of gay cultural life in New York City.Obama went from being tentative about same-sex marriage when he ran for the presidency in 2008, to being the first major party candidate to support it in 2012 (with an assist from Vice President Biden). Obama has gotten rid of the military s  don t ask don t tell  policy, advocated for benefits for same-sex partners, supported transgender service in the military and has refused to use the power of the government to obstruct other efforts to secure equal rights for LGBT citizens.Those fighting for LGBT rights still have some work ahead of them, especially with conservative Republicans often engaging in last-gasp efforts to attack full equality (like the mean spirited  bathroom bills  in the south), but under this president the march towards justice has had a reliable ally.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Anti-LGBT ‘Street Preachers’ Are Invading Target Stores Nationwide Threatening ‘God’s Judgement’ (VIDEOS),"Target stores are living up to their name by being the literal  target  of anti-LGBT, transphobic bigots and professionally-offended  Christians,  who are now showing up at their locations across the country. Their intent, it seems, is to frighten patrons into being afraid to use the bathroom. Walking up and down the aisles, and wearing shirts depicting stick figures having sex, they shout and scream about how God is the new judge of retail merchandise as they try to convince people the women s restrooms are loaded with perverts.Below are some videos taken in target stores, showing the  preachers  rebuking people for going to the bathroom. Target this is your wake up call. The Bible says that from the beginning God made them male and female. He didn t make them transvestites. He made them male and female Target, this is your warning. You will be judged according to God s standards. Not man s, but God s You need to repent You will be judged. And if there are Christians in here, supporting this abomination, shame on you!   But you justify this place. You have to stand by the bathrooms because perverts can go in there. Because transvestites allowed. Apparently, God can create a universe in 6 days but can t deal with the idea of someone peeing in a bathroom in a department store.One of these God Warriors, Michael Merichko, was charged with disorderly conduct following a disturbance inside a Target store in Illinois. His obnoxiousness, coupled with the fact he was an unhinged white guy, convinced an entire shopping mall to go on lockdown because they thought he was an active shooter.via towleroadLuckily he was not, but frankly it isn t a stretch to think that some unhinged individual will eventually walk into a Target store and start shooting because God told them it was a good idea.Below is another religious idiot in St. Louis who is too obsessed with the idea of people peeing for his own good.Part 1: Part 2: The Republican party can be thanked for this. If it wasn t for people like Ted Cruz using religion as a justification for hatred, Target would never have had to make a  bathroom policy.  Transgender people have been using public restrooms forever without God destroying the planet as a result. It took Republicans to make it a sudden problem for him.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Woman Who Made Viral ‘Naked Trump’ Painting Was Assaulted, Beaten Near Her Home (IMAGES)","Donald Trump s supporters are a violent bunch. All you have to do is go to one of his rallies to see how dangerous this man and his freaky fans are. They ve now taken it a step further, too   and dangerously so. The artist who painted a photo of a naked Donald Trump, Ilma Gore, was accosted and beaten by a Trump supporter near her home in Los Angeles. Gore says of the attack: Today I was punched in the face by a man who got out of his car and yelled,  Trump 2016!  in Los Angeles, just days after I returned home from London just down the road from my house. She posted absolutely disturbing photos of her bruised face to Instagram so people could see what those neanderthals did to her:Today I was punched in the face by a man who got out of his car and yelled,  Trump 2016!  in Los Angeles, just days after I returned home from London just down the road from my house. Though I encourage passion, opinion and emotion, especially though art, I think violence is disgusting. To live in a place where Facebook has given my address to an anonymous third party makes me feel like I am homeless again. This type of violence makes creatives feel like we live in a world where our individual creative input isn t safe. I am sad that this is the state of our America right now. I am sad that Trump, and many of his supporters, don t find words enough to express their opinions   they need walls, waterboarding and punches. @realdonaldtrump Please stop glamorizing and perpetuating violence.

 Crazy Republican Shames Dad At Walmart For Using Food Stamps (VIDEO),"Being on food stamps is no fun. In fact, for most recipients, it is a humiliating position to be in thanks to the public perception that only lazy people who won t work and want to live for free off the government use them. However, one admitted right-wing voter took food stamp shaming to a whole other level when she accosted a dad at her local Walmart who was paying for his groceries using his SNAP benefits. When the woman first confronts the man, he is nice to her, and explains: I put in 50 to 60 hour weeks. I m trying to provide for my family. The woman responds: You re not providing for it, I am. The government is. They take it out of my check. Bullshit they don t. Finally, the man loses his cool and tells this crazy lady to  vote Republican  if she has a problem with the government helping those in need. That s when things really get heated. The woman shoots back: Oh trust me, I am not a bleeding heart fucking liberal. Then the two start bickering back and forth while using copious amounts of profanity, all in full view of their own children and who knows how many other people. Finally, the man tells the woman what he should have said all along:  shut the fuck up. This is what happens when the public is ignorant about who receives SNAP and other benefits and why. See, it s not lazy folks who refuse to get a job who get these benefits. 83 percent of food stamp recipients are homes with children, the elderly, the disabled, and others who can t work. Notice I said can t not won t. Further, many of them, like the man in the video work full time jobs or even multiple jobs.Republicans are always talking about  small government,  but they and their supporters are the ones who are always all up in everyone s business. Who cares how someone pays for their groceries, just since they are paid for? Republicans, that s who, because they think they have the right to run everyone else s lives.Watch the insane video below:https://youtu.be/iwrNiRngMhcFeatured image via RJ Sangosti/Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Trump Fan Assaults Muslim Woman, Calls Her A Terrorist (VIDEO)","A recent hate crime in Washington, D.C. serves as a perfect example of just how dangerous Republican front runner Donald Trump s hateful, divisive rhetoric really is.On Monday, police released footage that captured a Trump supporter assaulting a black Muslim woman wearing a hijab outside of a Starbucks on April 21st. Although the incident has been classified as a simple assault, when you hear the story you will understand why it is now being investigated as a possible hate crime.According to the Muslim woman, who did not want to be identified, she had been sitting outside the Starbucks when a white woman with blonde hair approached her and verbally attacked her for no reason. The attacker allegedly said, F-ing Muslim. Trash, worthless piece of Muslim trash. You all need to go back to where you came from.  The white woman also revealed that she was going to vote for Trump so he could send  all of you terrorist Muslims out of the country. Although the surveillance tape itself didn t include audio, the attack is clear as day in the footage. The victim was smart enough to begin recording part of the attack on her cell phone, and she was able to get proof of the white women saying,  You re a terrorist. So stupid. The Muslim woman became frightened and tried to call the police   but they were of little help. When the officer arrived, he told the victim he couldn t do anything because the Trump supporter s hateful comments were considered  freedom of speech.  After the officer left the scene, the white woman attacked the Muslim woman once again by emptying a bottle full of an unknown liquid over the victim s head. The Muslim woman said the liquid didn t burn, but smelled strange.You can watch an interview with the victim below, where she describes the attack in detail:You can watch the surveillance footage of the attack, released by the D.C. Metro Police, below:Thanks to this incident, the neighborhood that the victim has happily lived in for the past six years now feels unsafe. Currently, police are encouraging the public to help find the attacker.Trump s vulgar, hateful rhetoric and his easily influenced supporters are incredibly dangerous to the rest of the public   and this incident is yet another example of how hate speech can have severe consequences. No one should blow off the horrible bigotry that Trump spews as simply entertainment or insanity   his words have tremendous power over his mindless followers, and they are more than happy to carry out his disgusting views.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 City Of Detroit Begins Punishing Poor People For Being Poor In The Most Inhumane Way (VIDEO),"Imagine your child was playing outside, runs into the house for a drink, turns on the tap and nothing comes out. Your baby is standing there sweating and thirsty all because the city you live in has decided that your family deserved to be punished for being poor and shut your water off. When you realize what has happened, you send your child to your neighbor s house to get a glass of water there, but their water has been shut off too, and thousands of other people in the city are facing the same dilemma. Elderly people, families with children, young couples, students, all without water   that s what s happening in Detroit, Michigan.Roughly 20,000 people are in danger of having their water turned off today, according to Detroit s ABC 7 News:The water is still on for Detroit residents behind on their bills, but not for long. Detroit Water and Sewerage announced they re shutting off service to those who owe them payments. About 20,000 people could see their water shut off, starting May 3rd at 8 a.m.Since 2014, the people of one of the poorest cities in the country have been fighting to keep their water on. The Detroit Water Crisis is so bad that experts from the United Nations have accused the city of violating human rights. In June 2014, the group put out a press release saying: Disconnection of water services because of failure to pay due to lack of means constitutes a violation of the human right to water and other international human rights Disconnections due to non-payment are only permissible if it can be shown that the resident is able to pay but is not paying. In other words, when there is genuine inability to pay, human rights simply forbids disconnections. Nearly two years later the fight over water is still going on and city officials are claiming that they don t  want  to turn the services off, but they have to if residents do not ask to be put on payment plans. Detroit Water and Sewerage Director Gary Brown said, We don t want to shut anyone s water off. Come in, ask for assistance, get on a payment plan.  Residents who have bills of up to $700 will have the balance frozen and be allowed to pay $25 a month.While it may seem like a sweet payment plan, clearly it is not working. In the two years since the city started to aggressively target residents who could not pay, they still have thousands of residents in the same situation. These are not people who are refusing to pay their water bills because they want to go out and party; these are people who live in extreme poverty   the likes of which should not exist in this country.It is incredibly inhumane for the city to do this. Water is a right, not a luxury and it should NEVER be shut off because someone cannot afford to pay. But capitalism   isn t it great?For more on Detroit s water wars, watch this video:Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John McCain’s 2008 Top Campaign Adviser Abandons GOP Over Trump: ‘I’m With Her’ Instead,"A lot has changed in just eight years. The Republican Party is witnessing a collapse that may destroy it entirely. And nobody knows it on a more personal level than Mark Salter, Sen. John McCain s former campaign adviser and long-time friend. On the eve of the Indiana primary, in which all signs point to Donald Trump shattering the last resistance to his nomination, Salter took stock of his party   and bailed.In a tweet that may signal the coming flood of political refugees pouring out of the Republican Party s sinking ship, Salter said that Trump s antics and the GOP s idiotic responses to them have finally settled the matter. In a bold move, he concluded he would be supporting Hillary Clinton instead.the GOP is going to nominate for President a guy who reads the National Enquirer and thinks it's on the level. I'm with her.  Mark Salter (@MarkSalter55) May 3, 2016Forget  loyalty pledges.  Forget standing with the party. Forget coming together to beat the Democrats. There is nothing redeeming about standing with Donald Trump.The last straw was Trump s use of a ludicrous story published by the tabloid (and Trump backer) National Enquirer, which alleged that Ted Cruz s dad was friends with Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who assassinated John F. Kennedy. The story was patently bonkers, but it didn t stop Trump and his supporters from  just asking questions  about it. This included Fox News.On the conservative network s Fox and Friends, the hosts remained silent and deferential as Trump suggested   quite seriously   that Rafael Cruz was somehow implicated in the JFK assassination. Apparently nobody at the network wanted to risk angering the Republican front-runner and potentially losing a ratings gold mine. The inmates are running the asylum.Cowardice and stupidity have become so entwined in the Republican Party that an entire day can be consumed by a false story printed by the NATIONAL ENQUIRER just because Donald Trump brought it up. It s no wonder some conservatives are looking at the wreckage of their party and deciding it s not even worth saving.Salter isn t exactly a bleeding heart liberal either. Having attached himself to McCain s campaign in 2008 as the senator s speechwriter and  closest aide, he s spent the last eight years bitterly attacking Obama and Democrats for the crime of beating his friend. The fact he s now saying  enough  must be terrifying for Republican operatives. If just a small fraction of Republicans abandon the party because of Trump, the general election may end in a landslide for Clinton.For months there has been questions about what the  Never Trump  coalition of Republicans would do if Trump won the nomination.

 Watch Ted Cruz Suffer An INSANE Meltdown After Someone Asks If He’ll Support Trump (VIDEO),"The battle between Republican presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Donald Trump continues to intensify, as both candidates keep fanning the flames by directing insults at each other.On Tuesday, Cruz s emotions seemed to get the better of him as he snapped on a reporter for simply asking him if he would be supporting his front runner rival if he became the GOP nominee. This public meltdown came just a few days after Meet the Press host Chuck Todd had tried to ask Cruz if he would keep his pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee regardless of who it was, and Cruz repeatedly dodged the question.Cruz had been busy insulting the business mogul at a press conference in Evansville, Indiana when NBC News correspondent Hallie Jackson tried to get a straight answer from the Texas senator on whether or not he would back Trump, hoping to get more of an answer than Todd was able to. Jackson asked: These are some of the strongest words you ve used against Donald Trump yet. You know I ve been with you, I ve heard you talk about him. Today feels different for you. So, I m going to ask you a question and you re going to say that I sound like a broken record    While it was clear that Cruz didn t want to answer the question, his rude response was shocking. Jackson was abruptly cut off by Cruz, who aggressively said,  You sound like a broken record. Someone else have a question? Jackson tried to object and get a straight answer from the candidate. She pressed, Why not say once and for all? Cruz continued to give Jackson a nasty attitude and angrily replied, You ve asked one already, Hallie. You ve asked already. Frustrated, Jackson continued to badger Cruz to answer her: Will you support him as the nominee? I don t understand why you won t answer the question, Senator. If you think he s a liar  If you say he s a pathological liar, and you say that you can t Cruz continued to scold Jackson and ignore her request, making the situation tense and uncomfortable. You can watch Cruz completely disrespect and ignore Jackson below:It looks as though Cruz doesn t want to accept the harsh reality that he might lose the Republican nominee to Trump. Anything that reminds Cruz that he s in second place will easily send him into a full-blown temper tantrum.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Look Out, Big Oil: ‘Job Creation’ No Longer An Argument As Solar Outpaces Oil","While jobs in the solar energy sector account for 39 percent of all world-wide energy employment (while oil accounts for 50 percent), Fortune magazine reports that for the first time in quite a while, there are more openings for solar jobs than oil.Think about that. While the world burns for the next barrel of oil, green energy jobs are outpacing the status quo dirty energy that pulled the United States into a massive war.As Fortune finds:This [trend] corresponds with a recent report by The Solar Foundation that highlighted the rapid growth of the U.S. clean energy sector. By the end of this year, the solar sector should have 240,000 workers under its wings, and currently employs around 77% more workers than the coal mining industry.So why is this happening? Well, since the price of oil has plunged by 60 percent in the last 18 months has caused the world s largest oil and gas companies to cut jobs at an alarming rate. BP has announced it will cut 9 percent of its workforce while Chevron says it will cut 10 percent.This comes as reports show that global investment in renewable energy, most of which has come from China and India, heavy polluters, was more than twice that of coal and gas combined from last year s numbers.Tara Sinclair, chief economist of Indeed, issued a warning to those in the energy industry: see out renewable jobs, not oil.The decline in oil prices has not just rocked that industry, but jobs linked to both fossil fuels and renewable energy. Whether or not solar overtakes oil on Indeed, energy workers would do well to position themselves for work in renewable fields such as solar, wind, and hydroelectricity.With Clinton s pledge to build 600 million more solar fields and a promise to rebuild ravaged coal country with renewable energy, the amount of green workers could surge within the next several years (should she win).Is the country, and the world, moving towards a greener economy? Hopefully, it does and will send a powerful and destructive industry packing.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Continues To PUMMEL Trump With Some Pretty Harsh Truths He Won’t Want To Hear,"While Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump can boast and claim he s going to win the presidency hands down, he s forgetting that he s only been in the Republican primary against some incredibly weak and equally as unappealing candidates. Sure, he s popular among his band of merry morons who want a wall to keep out foreigners and may not have learned how to use a fork yet, but when it comes to the general election, he s pretty much toast.No matter who the Democrats run up against Trump, whether it be the frontrunner Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, they both would kick his ass at the ballot box come November. Clinton is even ahead in the popular vote by millions against anyone running, if that s not already a clear indicator of what s to come later this year.Another person who knows Trump will lose is President Obama, and he s also very blunt in explaining that the real estate mogul/reality television star isn t qualified to be president, nor would he be able to actually fulfill the duties of commander-in-chief.During the White House Correspondents  Dinner the president quipped,  They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But in fairness he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. Then on Monday, President Obama said during an interview with WMUR in New Hampshire: I think that he is not somebody who even within the Republican Party can be considered as equipped to deal with the problems of this office, but look, we live in a democracy. Clearly indicating that people are more than allowed to vote for him, but he added: If in fact the Republicans nominate Mr. Trump, then it s going to be an interesting Fall season. I m confident that ultimately the Democrat in that circumstance will win. Which is absolutely correct. It would also be a rude awakening for the Republican party that clearly has let itself fall apart before our very eyes. Which honestly is very entertaining, but equally as terrifying.What it comes down to is this: Donald Trump is not only a dangerous choice for president, but him running is just absolutely ridiculous. He s not at all prepared for the role of President of the United States. He doesn t even talk the talk. He just goes around bullying his competition, women, minorities, and Muslims all while talking about a wall that is never gonna happen, nor does it even make logistical sense.Enough is enough, folks. Just remember, no matter who   vote blue.Featured Photos by Bill Pugliano/ Joshua Lott/Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Sorry, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz’s Dad Probably Didn’t Kill John F. Kennedy (VIDEO)","Donald Trump is an idiot. Ted Cruz is also an idiot. Ted Cruz s father, Rafael Cruz is an idiot who is responsible for the birth of an idiot. Now that that s out of the way, on Tuesday Donald Trump managed to say something so ridiculous that he makes Cruz and his father look like utter geniuses by comparison. In his desperation to attack the greasy, weasly, lying right-wing extremist, Trump actually blamed Ted Cruz s father for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Recently, the National Enquirer claimed that a photo unearthed from the Warren Commission s report on Kennedy s assassination depicted the elder Cruz handing out pro-Castro literature with Oswald just months before the latter shot and killed the president. Rafael Cruz was an open Castro supporter and a self-avowed  Marxist-Leninist,  but even if he was photographed near Oswald that doesn t mean he was responsible for murdering a sitting President of the United States or does it? (SPOILER: No. F*ck no).Asked about Rafael Cruz stumping for his son, Trump told Fox and Friends that Ted Cruz s father is responsible (at least, in part) for Kennedy s death. Citing the Enquirer story, he said: You know, there s a whole thing and, you know, his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald s being   you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody brings it up. They don t even talk about that. That was reported and nobody talks about it. But I think it s horrible. I think it s absolutely horrible that a man can go and do that. I mean, what was he doing   what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting?  Trump continued.  It s horrible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyeHlkNBtFUTed Cruz later responded to Trump s claims that his father was at least partially responsible for killing JFK. After calling Trump s assertion  nuts  and rightfully pointing out that is  not a  reasonable position,  Cruz had some fun with the situation: I guess I should go ahead and admit that, yes, my dad killed JFK, he is secretly Elvis, and Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard. Whether or not Cruz actually killed JFK, the Enquirer stands by its claim that the photo does indeed depict Cruz and Oswald together, though Cruz denies even that much. It s entirely possible that the photo may be legitimate, but there is as much chance that Rafael Cruz was involved in a presidential assassination as his son s likelihood of being elected President.Can we say for certain that Rafael Cruz didn t kill Kennedy? No   but I think it s a reasonable assumption that, if Cruz were involved, Donald Trump would not have broken the story.Watch Cruz mock Trump below:Featured image via Houston Chronicle/Getty Images (Scott Olson)",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Heidi Cruz Is Not Doing Her Husband Any Favors By What She Just Said On Camera,"While she has come out and defended her husband against the very serious allegations that he is, in fact, the Zodiac Killer, Heidi Cruz may have said something more damaging at a campaign stop in Indiana.The Cruz campaign misspoke, but some say it was a Freudian slip when Heidi Cruz said, on camera: Do you know that Ted has been winning the millennial vote in state after state. He s been winning the women s vote in state after state. Ted is an immigrant. He is Hispanic. We can unify this party. Heidi Cruz: #LyinTed  is an Immigrant, not eligible to be President Video:#TrumpTrain#Trump2016#MAGA#INPrimary pic.twitter.com/cvyx9MbC6M  The Loud Majority (@TheLoudMajority) May 2, 2016The campaign says she meant to say he is the son of an immigrant (who played a part in the JFK assassination, according to Donald Trump). Cruz just gave all the ammo in the world to the Trump campaign with that statement. Considering the fact they encompass a group of xenophobic bigots, there is no way in hell they ll consider voting for  an immigrant  and a  Hispanic  now, especially after the  alliance  between Cruz and Kasich.And of course Trump pounced on Heidi s comments, saying: Heidi Cruz   nice woman. She said this one:  My husband s an immigrant!  He s an immigrant! That s what I ve been trying to say   She was maybe trying to put a Latin turn on it. He was born in Canada, folks.I wonder when Republicans are going to accuse the Cruz campaign of playing the race card. While Fiorina accuses the Clinton campaign of playing up gender for support, maybe she should paying attention to what her running mate s wife is saying.Coupled with his  basketball ring  comment and now Heidi s  he s an immigrant  comment, Cruz s chances of winning in Indiana have plummeted. And if that s not bad enough, with an Indiana loss, there goes his chances of getting enough delegates to challenge Trump.The Cruz s comments are now synonymous with the Howard Dean scream and Mitt Romney s  47 percent.

 Uncle Tom CNN Guest Attacks Larry Wilmore: ‘What If Someone Called Sanders The K-Word?’ (VIDEO),"There s often much debate about the use of the n-word in any of its forms. You hear in rap music, or just among black folks as a term of familiarity in some black culture circles. This debate has been brought to light once again by Larry Wilmore s comedy routine at the White House Correspondents  Dinner. The comedian finished his bit by saying directly to President Obama: Yo, Barry. You did it, my n*gga. Well, there was one member of the black media who did not appreciate Wilmore s remarks, and he went on CNN with host Don Lemon to say so. SiriusXM host Joe Madison said of Wilmore: Can you imagine if the K word would have been used to describe Bernie Sanders?  The thing is, though that is not an accurate comparison. Most people don t even know what the K-Word is. For the record, it is an anti-Jewish slur. The word is  Kike.  Jewish people have never included this word in their own culture without it being a million percent offensive in any context. The same cannot be said for the n-word. Now, do I use it in any context? No. Absolutely not. I m black, but I despise that word for my own reasons. However, I do understand that there are contexts within Black circles where it is a term of endearment and is completely appropriate. This one of them.Madison went on to say that it was a sad occasion that after 8 years of this dinner, that s the last word that this distinguished group of people will hear in relation to this president. The second guest in the debate, April Reign, said that Madison was misguided on this one. She put it perfectly when she said that black folks need to stop worrying about the  white gaze  in response to such things. The thing is, worrying about what white folks think will get you far in life, because we live in such a racist society. However, playing that hand is, in and of itself, racist. Reign also went on to point out the obvious, which is that President Obama appreciated what Larry Wilmore said. I am sure he did. People do not like to admit it, but almost every minority you can think of has its own culture where its people are more comfortable. I know that I am, for example, much more comfortable in a gay bar than I could ever be in a straight club. Know why? Because those are my people. They get it. They get the experience. The same goes for how I feel with a bunch of black folks versus being with a bunch white folks. I am sure President Obama appreciated the cultural significance of what Larry Wilmore said, because for the last eight years he s not be able to be with his own people.Joe Madison and everyone else taking issue with Wilmore s routine really need to see themselves for what they are: Uncle Toms who want to distance themselves from black culture, which is seriously just a damn shame.Watch the video below:https://youtu.be/BK7k5kJEmxEFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jimmy Kimmel SHATTERS Sarah Palin’s Climate Change Denial Using Actual Scientists (VIDEO),"The topic of climate change is somehow still being debated even though it s fact vs. fiction. Climate change is very real, and when 97 percent of scientists agree, we should probably believe them. Yet, there are still people who like to push the narrative that it is a myth. People like former half-term Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin.Well, on Monday s broadcast of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel tore apart her denial in an absolutely brilliant way. He showed a clip of her denying climate change where she said, Oh, well, if 97 percent of all scientists believe that man s activities are creating changes in the weather, who am I to question that? This is when Kimmel was blunt and to the point: Exactly. Who are you to question that? Over the past few weeks Palin has been trying really hard to be relevant again and pushing the narrative that she knows better than scientists. However, Kimmel shuts her down in one sentence.Kimmel stated: We ve had 15 of the 16 hottest years ever since 2001. That s not an opinion. It s a fact. Adding: For some reason whether or not humans are contributing to this has become a left versus right issue. The politicians debate it. Our scientists don t. A huge majority of climate scientists say climate change is happening. They say we re causing it and we need to do something about it before it has a terrible effect on all of us. There s no debate about the greenhouse effect, just like there s no debate about gravity. It someone throws a piano off the roof, I don t care what Sarah Palin tells you, get out of the way. It s coming down on your head. He then shows a video of actual climate scientists telling us that climate change is, in fact, very real, and why would they make something like this up. Because seriously, what benefit does that do besides change human activity to respect the planet better? Those telling us it s not real are the ones who have more to lose, because big polluters derive profit from destroying the earth. They don t want us to believe climate change is actually happening, and they ve been paying big money to spread their false narrative so they can keep polluting.Kimmel means business, and simply states either you believe science or you don t. He also knows that he s going to get a massive amount of negative feedback by those who insist climate change isn t real because they re either paying to get that message out there or they re dumb enough to believe it.Climate change shouldn t be a left or right issue. The earth and its climate are not up for debate   it s science. Denying it exists only makes one look like a fool. Good on Kimmel for getting serious and getting real about this very real problem that we need to combat sooner rather than later before it s too late.Watch the clip here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Teen Girl Gets Murder Charges For ‘Killing Mom’s Abusive Boyfriend’ (VIDEO),"A teenage girl in Oklahoma is being charged as an adult for the murder of her mother s abusive boyfriend.Makayla Brown, 14, now has first-degree murder charges against her for shooting 45-year-old Mario Smith after she witnessed him pistol whipping her mother a few weeks prior. Makayla s mother Tysa was in Smith s house at the time of the shooting, along with several other friends and family members.According to Merill Carter, who is Smith s cousin and was a witness to the event, Makayla went into the kitchen to retrieve a gun and then shot Smith in the head. An Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation said: Terry and Tysa drove over to Mario s residence to check on Mario. Tysa had been in a relationship with Mario, but hadn t heard from Mario in quite some time. Terry reported that evening, she and Tysa both had a bad feeling about Mario, like something was not okay with him. Mario (the victim) was on the west side of the kitchen bar and was searching for his  stash.  Terry saw Mario bend down. At the time Mario bent over, Terry saw Makayla pull out the caramel-colored gun and shoot Mario in the head. Smith was found on the kitchen floor, lying in a pool of his blood two days later. He was killed just one day before he was due in court for 14+ felony charges of methamphetamine, marijuana, stealing, firearms, assault and battery.According to reports, it seems as though Makayla s mother was not involved in the shooting. The affidavit said: When Mario was shot, [the victim s cousin Merrill] Carter could hear Tysa yelling and crying and he saw she was visibly upse. Carter didn t think Terry had anything to do with Mario s death either. According to a report by an unnamed woman, Makayla was laughing and bragging about the incident two days later. The source said that Makayla had gone into her house and was  openly bragging about killing him. In speaking to authorities, Makayla admitted that the reason she shot Smith was because he had been abusive to her mother in the past. Alexis Terry, a friend of Tysa s, backed up Makayla s claim that Smith was abusive to Tysa.You can watch the report below:Makayla is now being held without bond in Payne County, and is being charged as an adult.This is truly a heartbreaking and difficult situation. It s uncertain what exactly took place right before Makayla shot Smith, but now a child is facing murder charges for trying to protect her mother, when she is not even been old enough to grasp the consequences of her actions. It s unfortunate that it was so easy for her to get her hands on a gun and take action. Now, she is facing the consequences that are meant for someone much older than herself.Should a child be thrown in jail for killing their mother s abuser?Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 3, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Karma Strikes Disgusting Voyeur At Target When Woman Confronts And Chases Him,"What would you do if you had a known video voyeur come up to you? Well, Candice Spivey of Jacksonville, Florida just laid a verbal smack down on one guy named Jeffrey Polizzi when he forgot he had approached her before. She took her own phone out, called him out on video and then proceeded to chase him right out of the Yulee, Florida Target.Spivey wrote in a Faceboo  post: When he approached me yesterday he did not remember who I was, until I called him out on it in this video. Adding: He starts out his conversation with the same punch line he uses here in the very beginning of this video saying,  Hey there I don t mean to bother you but I just bought this maxi dress for my wife at Ross and I was kinda worried about the sheerness of it. Spivey explains what happened the first time she got approached by Polizzi: Whiles he s asking these questions he s filming you with his cell phone, and I knew he was by the way he was holding his phone. I had this feeling there was way more to what he was doing than just asking questions, it was very routine for him like he s been doing this for a long time. So I went immediately to the front and reported him, they called the cops and he was banned from that publix. It was NOT illegal what he was doing. When Spivey was approached by Polizzi again in Target, she sprung into action. She confronted him, and as she was chasing him, shouted for someone to call the police. Unfortunately, he s still out there, so Spivey asks that if you run into him to contact the Nassau County Sheriff s Office, who is currently looking for possible victims.According to The Daily Mail: Police confirmed Polizzi has previously been charged with video voyeurism and issued an appeal last week for any other potential victims to come forward.Since then, scores of women have complained that they were approached by the man in similar scenarios. The biggest thing Spivey wanted out of this video and confrontation was to make sure this slimeball s face gets out there to the public to warn them. It s unbelievable, yet believable, that a man like this is free to walk around and not be taken into custody with several victims claiming it was him.Let s hope he gets caught soon by more than just Spivey, but by the police.Watch the confrontation here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Infuriates Women With Disgusting ‘Rape’ Comment (VIDEO),"Donald Trump can barely go a day without saying or doing something truly offensive to women. Further pushing away women voters (as he has been successfully doing during his entire campaign), Trump decided to make light of sexual abuse over the weekend by comparing the United States  relationship with China to rape.Trump made these misogynistic comments at a rally on Sunday, where he said: We can t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that s what they re doing. It s the greatest theft in the history of the world. Hardly an appropriate comparison; the  rape  Trump is talking about is the trade deficit between the two countries   and anyone could agree that a sexually violent act is a truly disgusting way to describe an economic relationship between nations. Nearly as soon as Trump spewed those shameful, disrespectful words, he began receiving massive backlash from advocates against sexual violence.Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who has been heavily involved in addressing rape on college campuses and introduced the International Violence Against Women Act, was one of the first to shut the Republican frontrunner down. She said: When you use a violent and heinous crime like rape as a metaphor, it is an affront to all sexual assault survivors. Donald Trump should find another way to express himself. Colleen Daly, a spokeswoman for the group End Rape on Campus, added: Using the word  rape  to describe anything other than sexual violence trivializes the experience of survivors. The statement perpetuates our cultural indifference to rape and desensitizes us to all forms of sexual violence. In just one sentence, Trump has disrespected 300,000 people   that s roughly how many people are sexually assaulted in the United States every year. This isn t even the first time Trump has been completely insensitive about rape. Trump has previously been accused of raping his ex-wife Ivana, and his lawyer defended The Donald by making the despicable and completely false argument that you cannot rape your spouse.  The truth is that over half of all women that report being raped say that their partner was the perpetrator   and Trump and his lawyer single-handedly tried to invalidate that reality.You can watch Trump make his disgusting  rape  comments below:It s no secret that Trump, with his long history of being a misogynist and disrespecting women, is having trouble winning over women voters. If his sexist comments about Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton  playing the woman card  didn t turn more female voters away, his comments about rape surely will. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) pointed out Trump s problem with women perfectly: Whether it s attacking women or minorities his vulgar remarks have no place in our political discourse. Women are watching and they don t like what they see. Hopefully women will continue to show Trump that misogyny will not be tolerated by refusing to vote for him.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"May 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Officials Caught Falsifying Records To Deny Food Stamps To Families With Less Than $100 (VIDEO),"Poverty is a problem in America. While most of us are not filthy rich or anything, we also generally don t have to worry about not having enough to buy even the basic essentials, including food. This is the horrifying reality for many people, though. That s why we have programs to combat hunger, such as food stamps. However, some human services workers in New Mexico have been doing something despicable in order to meet deadlines: falsifying documents in order to deny aid to families in need.Reports indicate that at least five workers in the New Mexico Human Services department confessed to fudging records and saying families had more than $100 in assets, and used that as an excuse to deny them aid for food. Now, anyone living in today s world knows that $100 is nothing, especially if you have a family with children.New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty s Sovereign Hager revealed the following to local station KTRK: It makes the state s numbers appear artificially high, as if they were processing things according to law. When in fact, they aren t. This disgusting processing falsification apparently was a result of the inability of workers to meet a deadline of seven days for expediting emergency food stamp applications. So, in other words, these people let babies go hungry in order to save their own asses at work. While we all know that social services in America is a mess, this is utterly unacceptable.Hager further revealed to the local station that she and other authorities were unaware of this tactic to skip out on deadlines: This is something we ve never heard before, but according to workers, has been going on for quite some time. Really now? I wonder how many people are literally starving because of what these workers did. No matter the reasoning, there is simply no excuse. Hopefully, those responsible face criminal charges, and that becomes a warning to social services workers around the nation.Watch a video news report on this story below:Featured image via Pixabay",News,"May 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Admits What He Would Have Done After Carly Fiorina Fell Off Stage (VIDEO),"By now, you ve probably heard that at a recent Ted Cruz rally, Carly Fiorina fell off the stage right after announcing the candidate and his family. She s fine, don t worry.Yet, leave it to Donald Trump to use this moment to his advantage in front of his band of merry morons.Trump told his crowd in Carmel, Indiana: Carly s perfectly nice. By the way, she fell off the stage the other day. Did anybody see that? And Cruz didn t do anything. Even I would have helped her, OK? Basically saying,  even I, the biggest jerk on earth, would have given her a hand. Then he just kept going with it, because you know, Trump: They just showed it to me coming in. I said,  No, I didn t see it.  They just showed it to me and I said,  wow, that s really cruel.  She fell off   she just went down. She went a long way down, right? She went down right in front of him and he was talking. He kept talking. He didn t even look like that was a weird deal. Man. And then they were both talking. She was talking from the back and he was talking from there. They re both talking. No, it was weird. Writing out a Trump transcript is very unique, because he will literally repeat himself over and over and over as though you didn t get it the first time.Of course, Trump is making a mountain out of a molehill. Cruz likely didn t even see her fall, and she was back to the stage within seconds. All that aside, it is still wildly bizarre that Carly Fiorina is a  running mate  of a person who likely won t come near enough delegates to secure the Republican nomination.Watch part of Trump s diatribe here:Trump: Even I would have helped Fiorina up: https://t.co/zsb3c5vlqO https://t.co/RLxk64Ae3o  POLITICO (@politico) May 2, 2016Featured Photo via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Trump Screams At The Top Of His Lungs About Hillary Talking Too Loudly,"Donald Trump hasn t even secured the nomination of his party yet and already his anti-Hillary Clinton misogyny is on full blast.While all but ignoring his own Republican opponents, Trump used an Indiana rally on the eve of the primary to once again criticize Clinton for talking too loudly. The painful irony: While describing how off-putting her  screaming  is, Trump was yelling his voice hoarse.It s almost as if there is a double standard here Just Donald Trump screaming his criticism of Hillary Clinton screaming pic.twitter.com/tupT6T3TgI  Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) May 2, 2016 And I would say that she started screaming at the teleprompter,  Trump yelled,  but I m not allowed to say that.  Breathing heavily into the microphone, he added:  You know why  now if she was a man I could say it. But as a woman, ladies, I m sorry, I m not allowed to say it. Which, of course,  as a man,  nobody will bother criticizing Trump for yelling at this rally or any other. Nor has Hillary Clinton s gender stopped Trump (or other conservative pundits) from feigning concern about how loudly she talks. Not only do they feel they are  allowed to say it    they say it all the time. Endlessly, in fact. At high volume.The general election hasn t even begun and already the battle lines are being drawn. Donald Trump is already signalling that his campaign is going to be one primarily based on sexist attacks. He has avoided going after her experience, her ability, and her accomplishments (none of which Trump can say he has a strong counterargument against), and instead has repeatedly hit her for playing the  woman card. If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don t think she d get 5 percent of the vote. The only thing she s got going is the woman s card. Is it working? It doesn t appear to be. For Trump s largely male crowd, it might elicit fist bumps, but the rest of the country is horrified. Trump s original  woman card  comments drove a record-setting $2.4 million in donations to Clinton s campaign. Meanwhile, Trump s popularity with female voters   not good in the first place   has been steadily tanking further.What Trump s sexist comments do accomplish, however, is to remind America of just how adrift the Republican Party is from our modern society. 2016 is awfully late to be arguing women shouldn t be allowed to speak passionately in public. Perhaps the party needs an update.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Kid In Texas Brings Gun To School, Promptly Shoots Himself (VIDEO)","The trend of tragic gun violence in America s schools continues, this time with a child from Dallas, Texas who brought a gun to school and shot himself. The kid was 15 years old, and he was at the school outside of school hours for a conference. According to Dallas Independent School District s police chief, Craig Miller, the reason the gun was not detected on the school s metal detector was because it wasn t being checked the way it usually is during normal operating times: The metal detectors are monitored differently after school starts. With this incident, perhaps they should rethink that policy. The lucky thing is that the kid s injuries are not life-threatening, and the shooting was accidental. The .22 caliber pistol was apparently on his person in his first period class, and it went off, shooting him in the arm and leg, causing  serious, but not life threatening injuries.  The school tweeted out the following statement regarding the shooting:The student was injured when he inadvertently shot himself with a single-shot revolver after the first class period had ended.The student arrived at school today with this for (an) unplanned conference with school administrators. Because of the circumstance, the procedures for the metal detectors was not applied.The school was then placed on lockdown, and everyone on the scene was ordered to  shelter in place.  According to local officials, that term means the following: Shelter-in-place  means to take immediate shelter where you are at home, work, school, or in between. The lockdown was taken out of effect that afternoon, but many questions remain as to why and how a gun got onto that campus and into that school. When asked for answers by understandably concerned parents, Craig Miller said: I really don t know right now. It s part of the ongoing investigation. Everyone involved was lucky this time. Next time, that may not be the case. Who the hell knows what kind of plans that kid had when he chose to carry that pistol into his school? Considering the history of that, this quite disturbing. It seems that Chief Miller and other local authorities need to update their policies. Further, this is just another incident that shows how much we need stricter gun laws.Watch a news report on the incident below:Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"May 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Idiot Donald Trump Supporter Confronts Ted Cruz And It Gets Ugly REALLY Fast (VIDEO),"It s a pretty well-known fact among those who use their brains to make rational decisions that both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are equally repugnant, but for different reasons (and some of the same reasons). They are both extremely bad choices for the United States, and neither should ever set foot in the Oval Office. Both are war hawks, both are anti-immigrant, which is ironic considering Ted Cruz is and immigrant and so is Trump s wife, and both men don t have any real plans to put in place that would actually be good for the nation.Trump is a bully with zero experience, and Cruz is a smarmy salesman with the bare minimum of experience. So, when watching a Trump supporter confront Ted Cruz in Indiana, it wasn t exactly a meeting of the minds. It was Cruz going after Trump, and Trump s supporter shouting short bursts of propaganda that have been continuously repeated by the Trump campaign.The video is extremely awkward to watch, but at the same time you can t look away. It truly is that much of a disaster.My favorite line from the whole skirmish is when Cruz says: With all respect, Donald Trump is deceiving you, playing you for a chump. It s funny, because it s true, but also ironic, since Cruz is also playing everyone for a fool as well. Cruz s remarks were met with a bunch of random  Lyin  Ted  shouts from the Trump minion, along with  Indiana don t want you  and  where is your Goldman Sachs jacket?  clearly unaware he s supporting a big money tycoon himself.Here s a quick highlight from the unsettling confrontation:.@TedCruz asks @realDonaldTrump supporter to name 1 thing he likes about Trump, debates: https://t.co/d9vqjyz05i https://t.co/Njey71niBN  CBS News (@CBSNews) May 2, 2016But if you really want to watch the whole thing, you can check out the near nine minutes here:All in all, it makes for great TV, but it s horrifying that this is what the Republican party has come down to.

" 8 Years After Housing Collapse, Banks Continue To Punish Wealthy Black Communities","Almost a decade after targeting the black community with subprime loans and economic ruin, the Big Banks are STILL punishing black homeowners because racism is totally dead in America:According to a new Washington Post analysis, the higher a Zip code s share of black residents in the Atlanta region, the worse its housing values have fared over the past turbulent housing cycle.Nationwide, home values in predominantly African American neighborhoods have been the least likely to recover. Across the 300 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, homes in 4 out of 10 Zip codes where blacks are the largest population group are worth less than they were in 2004. That s twice the rate for mostly white Zip codes across the country. Across metropolitan Atlanta, nearly 9 in 10 largely black Zip codes still have home values below that point 12 years ago.If you ll recall, subprime loans were supposed to be mortgages given to high-risk borrowers so they could take a stab at the American dream of owning a home. But then the financial sector figured out how to make a ton of money by pushing crap loans onto an unsuspecting public. Naturally, they targeted minorities because, again, racism is dead in America:Even well-off African Americans, like the ones in some South DeKalb subdivisions, were more likely to be given subprime loans when they should have qualified for better ones. Nationwide, black families earning around $230,000 a year, according to research by sociologist Jacob Fa ber, were more likely at the height of the bubble in 2006 to be given a subprime loan than white families making about $32,000. The problem, Faber argued, wasn t that professional blacks didn t understand that they qualified for better loans; they were targeted for bad loans. Subprime lenders viewed them, Faber argued, as particularly profitable targets.This is not the first time banks have targeted the black community. Redlining was the practice banks employed to keep  Those People  out of white neighborhoods. They literally drew a red line on the map to signify which areas blacks were allowed to buy homes in and which areas were off-limits. The subprime debacle was less overt but no less racist. But even now, the banks are not done screwing over black homeowners:In Atlanta and its suburbs, along with dozens of other cities, the National Fair Housing Alliance has also documented that banks have done a poorer job maintaining foreclosed properties in largely minority communities than in white ones.Properties that fall into disrepair are known as  blight  and drag down property values. And through the wonders and magic of systemic racism, it just  happens  to occur more often in black neighborhoods. But remember, racism is dead in America so it must be the fault of black communities.This ongoing assault on African-American homeowners is a direct result of white supremacy in this country. It doesn t matter if it s a deliberate act or just implicit racism, the result is the same:  The banks are hurting wealthy black communities because they know the system is rigged heavily against them. When white people complain, something gets done. When black people complain, they re just whining.And then we wonder however in the world did white people accumulate so much more wealth than black people and pretend it s because we re inherently superior.AmeriKKKa.Featured image via Getty",News,"May 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Cruz Trying To Hold Fiorina’s Hand Is More Awkward Than A Middle School Dance (VIDEO),"When Ted Cruz announced Carly Fiorina as his running mate last week, it left many, many people scratching their heads. It d be like a football team getting their finger sizes measured for Super Bowl rings after they ve already been eliminated from making the playoffs. It just didn t make any sense whatsoever. It was clearly a move to try to get media attention (which worked) and in hopes of helping him win the Republican nomination (which it won t).Add to this how awkward of a pairing Cruz and Fiorina make. They go together like orange juice and toothpaste, where the only thing left will be the bitter taste left in everyone s mouths after witnessing their desperation.If you don t believe how awkward they are together, then by all means, witness it for yourselves.Here s Cruz trying to grab Fiorina s hand in the typical politician power pose with their running mate.

 Christian Group Admits To Sending Men Into Women’s Bathrooms To Scare You Into Hating Trans People,"Across the country, conservative groups are working to pass anti-LGBT legislation that would bar transgender people the right to use public restrooms. The faulty logic at play is that transgender people are simply dressing up as the opposite gender to gain access to young boys and girls.This. Is. Not. Happening.But rather than take a moment of reflection and realize that what s really at work here is regular old transphobia and fear-mongering being used to hit back at the LGBT community for having scored a number of recent victories at the state and federal level, conservatives are trying to invent the problem to justify their barbaric solution. For an obvious example, look no further than designated hate group American Family Association, whose director of governmental affairs, Sandy Rios, just admitted that her organization has been sending men into women s bathrooms at Target in the hopes of eliciting a reaction.Why Target? The store recently outraged Republicans by publicly standing with the LGBT community and saying its customers can use whichever bathroom they feel most comfortable with. This set in motion the usual calls for boycotts, the usual right-wing smears, and now this  a movement to harass women in Target bathrooms so they are scared enough to demand the policy change. I think there s no question that when you say that there are no barriers in the bathroom,  Rios said,  and that if men or women feel like they are men or women, the opposition of however they are equipped, and you have no restrictions, the net effect will be that people will not be stopped. We ve already had people testing this, going into Targets and men trying to go into bathrooms. There is absolutely no barrier. And so the chief concern,  she continued,  even more than just, I think, trauma, certainly for little girls of having men dressed like women coming in their bathrooms, the chief concern of the American Family Association is the predators who will take advantage. AFA is correct in believing that having a right-wing Christian fundamentalist storm into a women s bathroom for no discernible reason would be deeply traumatizing. Unlike other women, whether transgender or not, these AFA volunteers aren t there to use the bathroom. They are there to scare people. It s unclear how that translates to a need to ban transgender people. Instead, the scariest people are   yet again   the ones who are actively pushing for discrimination.It cannot be overstated just how little evidence there is that transgender people pose a danger to young girls if they are allowed to use the gendered bathroom they identify with. No case has ever been found that demonstrates that this is a tactic child predators seriously use. It s so non-existent, in fact, that a right-wing hate group like the American Family Association has had to get male volunteers to do it themselves.Ironically, AFA s efforts have done absolutely nothing to show that transgender people shouldn t be allowed in public bathrooms. On the other hand, there seems to be mounting evidence to suggest employees of AFA should be kept as far away from Target bathrooms as possible. Who knows what they ll do.Listen to Rios brag about harassing women in the bathroom below, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via Crooks and Liars screengrab",News,"May 2, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Donald Trump’ Joins A Pro-Immigration Rally In LA And It’s Glorious (TWEETS),"On Sunday, thousands of protesters came together for the annual pro-immigration march in downtown Los Angeles, but this year it was as much an anti-Trump rally as it was an immigrant rally. The Republican frontrunner even joined the march and it was awesome.Protesters rolled out a huge balloon effigy of The Donald and marched through the streets chanting about inclusiveness:#MayDay rallies in Los Angeles carry strong anti-Trump theme for his anti-illegal immigration platform pic.twitter.com/xE7elZ8AAg  News18 (@CNNnews18) May 2, 2016 #MayDay Los Angeles pic.twitter.com/6X0isdKPAW  Mike (@mikemcgroarty1) May 1, 2016The march s organizer, Francisco Moreno told the LA Times that the billionaire frontrunner has  no heart :  He s plastic, he doesn t have a heart, he doesn t have a brain. We re not going to vote for Trump! Another protester, Gloria Carrasco, explained why she was at the rally, I m not a drug addict, I m none of what [Trump] says. I want immigration reform. In addition to the pro-immigration theme, protesters were also marching for LGBT rights, worker s rights, Muslims and against police brutality. One sign read, Stand with immigrants, black lives, Muslims, LGBTQ people and low-wage workers! Los Angeles wasn t the only city that held marches on Sunday. In Seattle, thousands of people held their own rally, but the positivity of that event is largely being ignored by media outlets. Instead of reporting about how amazing it was that so many people united for the rights of people across the country, they ve chosen to discuss a few protesters who clashed with police. Yes, nine people were arrested, but this is what the march actually looked like: Several thousand take to streets of Seattle for #MayDay immigration and labor rights details @KIRORadio pic.twitter.com/hKtVjj0Mej  Josh Kerns (@joshkerns38) May 2, 2016Several thousand take to streets of Seattle for #MayDay immigration and labor rights details @KIRORadio pic.twitter.com/hKtVjj0Mej  Josh Kerns (@joshkerns38) May 2, 2016Members of Seattle First Baptist Church giving water to passing marchers. #May1stSea#MayDaypic.twitter.com/LpztGSew4C  El Comit  (@ElComiteWA) May 1, 2016That s what May Day in Seattle actually looked like, not the videos of police violence that you will being played on a loop on the news today.What was clear from the marches in both cities is that the people of this country do not want the bombastic GOP frontrunner as their president. He does not represent us. He does not love this country or its people. The only thing he wants to do is divide us, and immigrants, workers, Muslims, etc. are the scapegoats he needs to appeal to his  poorly educated supporters.

 Watch Ted Cruz’s Disturbing Reaction When Carly Fiorina Takes A Header Off Of A Stage (VIDEO),"Carly Fiorina has decided to add her face to the sideshow known as the Ted Cruz campaign. Cruz, who can t possibility win the nomination unless there s a contested convention, would then not be picking his own VP, making this entire collaboration a lesson in futility. Nevertheless, Fiorina has spoken and she will be proud to maybe be on his ticket if hell freezes over and enough loons and zealots come out to vote. Her official position, it appears, is ring announcer. With a head bob that exuded all the confidence a woman with zero political capital could muster, Fiorina announced the  future first family  to the crowd.As the Cruz family heads down towards the stage, Fiorina suddenly disappears. A quick rewind revealed that she had, in fact, taken a header right in front of Ted And Heidi. How would they react? Would they look for her reaction first to see if she was OK and make a clever joke out of it like,  Carly just gets so excited to see Ted.  Or do you show immediate concern for your friend and hopeful future Vice-President of the United States? Here s how Ted Cruz handled the situation:Wasn t that classy? Both Ted Cruz and wife Heidi decide that the best course of action is to ignore her altogether.  Oh, she fell? Keep smiling. Wave over there. She had better get up or I swear to God I m calling Ben Carson.  All thoughts that wouldn t be out of the question in someone like Ted Cruz s head. Cruz has always been out for himself. If Ted Cruz wins the White House we re doomed to an onslaught of legislation and vetoes based on the man s personal religious beliefs. The fact that he just brought on Carly Fiorina, who will only be remembered for being so opposed to Planned Parenthood that she was willing to throw her whole campaign behind these taped that turned out to be edited, out of context lies that have already landed those responsible with an indictment.Carly is a fitting piece to the puzzle. She s irrational, annoying and has little actual clout with anyone. Congrats on the great find, Ted.

 The Amount Of People Shot This Year So Far By TODDLERS Will Make Your Stomach Turn,"An analysis by the Washington Post has discovered that in the first four months of 2016, there have been 23 people in America that have been shot by toddlers. Our gun obsessed nation has gotten to the point where deadly weapons in the hands of children too young for kindergarten actually has a body count.Last year, a Washington Post analysis found that toddlers were finding guns and shooting people at a rate of about one a week. This year, that pace has accelerated. There have been at least 23 toddler-involved shootings since Jan. 1, compared with 18 over the same period last year.In the vast majority of cases, the children accidentally shoot themselves. That s happened 18 times this year, and in nine of those cases the children died of their wounds.Toddlers have shot other people five times this year.The most recent instance of this problem grabbing national headlines was when a two-year-old Milwaukee child got ahold of a gun carelessly placed on the backseat of a car and shot his mother, 26-year-old Patrice Price, killing her.Despite these horrific incidents, unacceptable in so much of the advanced, modern world but treated in America as if there s nothing to be done, the will to do anything about guns at the federal level is almost nonexistent.Intimidated by the NRA flexing its muscles to oppose pro-gun safety political candidates, Republicans and a few Democrats in Congress have refused to bring up legislation about guns. If any action has occurred, it has been in the states, and largely in states with a large Democratic majority in the northeast   which leaves citizens in the rest of the country unprotected thanks to some strategically placed campaign contributions.Recently the NRA s media arm, NRA News, went after Hillary Clinton because she has argued in favor of legislation that the gun lobby opposes. More of that sort of behavior is to be expected in the general election, but they did the same against President Obama in 2008 and 2012, obviously unsuccessfully. Despite their bravado and paid political attackers, their bark at the polls is far louder than their bite. If politicians ignored the noise, gun legislation could actually pass despite the NRA s insistence.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Angry Cruz Kicks Young Boy From Rally For Being Disruptive, Suggests He Needs To Be Spanked (VIDEO)","Ted Cruz is just one night away from losing the nomination to Donald Trump and the pressure is clearly getting to him. At a truly unhinged last minute rally in La Porte, Indiana, Cruz, joined by his faithful supporter Glenn Beck, spoke to a half empty gymnasium and things went off the rails almost instantly.While telling the crowd that God had chosen himself and Carly Fiorina to be the next president and vice president, divine intervention or faulty wiring caused Cruz s mic to die mid-sentence, leaving the Republican candidate to shout for a new one then stand around silently while one was brought to him. Later, his attempt to pander to the Indiana crowd with quotations from the movie Hoosiers drew eye rolls and groans.At another point, a preteen boy interrupted the rally by shouting  You suck!  at Cruz. He was ordered out of the event and as he was leaving, Cruz told the crowd that he deserved a spanking.A preteen yelling ""you suck"" is hauled out of Cruz event. ""In my household, when a child behaved that way, they got a spanking,"" says Cruz.  daveweigel (@daveweigel) May 2, 2016Young protester interrupts Ted Cruz in La Porte, Ind. ""In my household, when a child behaved that way, they'd get a spanking.""  Phil Elliott (@Philip_Elliott) May 2, 2016Still angry, Cruz couldn t let it go. He added that  children should speak with respect. The crowd went wild.Spanking is a big deal for Cruz. He speaks on it frequently, often bragging about spanking his two daughters. Lately, he s been adding a splash of sexism into the mix, primarily focused on Hillary Clinton  a former Secretary of State and not Cruz s 5-year-old daughter. We do know Hillary told her daughter Chelsea,  Well, gosh, I knew it was a terrorist attack, while we were out telling the American people it wasn t,'  Cruz said.  You know I ll tell you, in my house, if my daughter Catherine, the five-year-old, says something she knows to be false, she gets a spanking. At another point, he said the American people should  spank  Clinton for Benghazi. Spanking appears to be Cruz s main way of communicating.If what is happening in La Porte, Indiana, is any indication, Cruz is going to have a rough go of it when polling starts. Having dumped all of his resources into winning Indiana, the last polls show that Trump still has a double digit lead over him. Apparently, nobody is impressed by Cruz.Or as a preteen boy might say it:  You suck!

" WATCH: NBC Crunched The Numbers, And Trump Is Facing Election DISASTER","NBC s Meet The Press tried as much as possible to be charitable to the Trump campaign during a segment in which they projected the electoral college map in a Trump vs. Clinton general election. But as host Chuck Todd discovered, when the math is against you, it just won t work.Todd opened the segment by repeating one of the tropes that Republican frontrunner and likely nominee Donald Trump has repeated for several months now: That he can somehow put states that have favored Democrats  in play  and flip them over to the Republican Party.Immediately it became clear that the Republicans face a huge uphill climb on election day. Factoring in states that have voted for either party on a consistent basis over the last four elections, the nightmare for Trump and the GOP is revealed, with 243 electoral votes for Clinton and only 180 for Trump. In a contest where 270 votes are needed, she s almost there without any so-called  swing  states being contested. Democrats have been able to bank on states like California, New York, Pennsylvania with a lot of delegates, in addition to very reliable states like Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois, and New Jersey staying in solid territory for the party.By contrast, after Texas, it s hard to find solid Republican states with a lot electoral college heft to them. On a map the wide expanses of states like Wyoming, Nebraska and the Dakotas may seem impressive, but their sparse populations limit their impact on the electoral college.Todd then showed a scenario in which more recent swing states that have divided between the parties in recent elections have been counted. If Trump won Ohio, Virginia, and Florida under this scenario, he still comes up short   and the reality is all of those states in the two most recent elections went to President Obama.Then the funniest   or saddest   point was made by Todd. For Trump to win if he somehow won those states (again, highly unlikely) he would need to find votes in Colorado or Nevada. Those states also went Democratic in the most recent election, but that isn t even the biggest obstacle to a Trump triumph. Todd pointed out that those are states with large Latino voting bases, also known as the community Trump has alienated and attacked   characterizing them as rapists and murderers from the first day he was a presidential candidate.No election is set in stone, and it is more than half a year away to the general contest. But make no mistake, especially with Donald Trump as its nominee, the Republican Party is the one behind the eight ball, facing a series of odds that make them the most likely to lose the entire race.Featured image via screen capture",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Chicago Police Caught On Camera Assaulting Black Female Pastor (VIDEO),"One night in 2013, Reverend Catherine Brown turned down the alley that leads to the driveway of her Chicago home, just as she had done many times before. Her two small children were in the back of her vehicle.As she came around the curve, Rev. Brown encountered a vehicle heading straight toward her on the narrow alleyway. Her first instinct was to slam on the horn, as she quickly brought her own car to a stop.Before Brown knew what was happening, Chicago police officer Michelle Morsi Murphy jumped from the other vehicle and immediately began hurling obscenities at the young mother.According to Brown, she was shocked by the officer s aggressive actions.  As she reached for driver s license, a second officer, Jose Lopez, got out of the vehicle and pointed a gun at her head.Not knowing what else to do, the terrified pastor called 911 asking for a supervisor to be sent to the location.According to CBS in Chicago, which obtained a copy of Brown s 911 call, the recordings  reveal she felt threatened and in danger. They also show that  She repeatedly asks for a lieutenant and police to come and help. CBS Chicago also reports that  her daughters  screams can be heard on the calls. Instead of waiting for a supervisor to arrive, Murphy and Lopez attempted to force the door of Brown s vehicle open.The terrified pastor put her car in reverse and backed out of the alley, hoping to reach an area where witnesses might see what was taking place.The two Chicago police officers pursued Brown s vehicle.Dashcam footage shows that, once she was out of the alley, Brown brought her own vehicle to a complete stop again.The cops plowed directly into Brown s car, showing a complete lack of concern for the two children in the backseat.At this point Brown got out of her car and began shouting for witnesses.Officer Lopez then pepper-sprayed the terrified woman directly in the face, also spraying her one-year-old baby in the process. Officer Murphy can be seen laughing.Murphy then jumped on top of a car which was parked on the street, next to Brown s vehicle, aiming her gun directly at the woman.Another officer appeared at this point. He charged onto the scene, hitting Brown s car with a metal object.The entire gang of Chicago police officers then tackled the unarmed mother, beating and kicking her. They beat me down to my underwear,  Brown told CBS Chicago.  They tore my skirt off. They beat me with their batons, kicked me with their boots. Between the two of them, officers Murphy and Lopez have a total of 30 excessive force complaints against them. Yet these two officers remain on the police force. Since when does protecting and serving mean beating unarmed women and terrifying innocent children?Watch the video from CBS Chicago below, via YouTube.

 GOP Outreach To Women Continues As Trump Doubles Down On Sexist Attack On Clinton,"Republicans haven t had a great time attracting women voters in recent history, and it s about to get much worse for them. Their inevitable nominee is someone who has a more lousy reputation with women than any of the  legitimate rape can be a blessing from God  crowd, and he just can t seem to stop making sexist comments. It s no wonder so many Republicans are deciding not to attend the Republican National Convention this year.Donald Trump recently went after Hillary Clinton with an attack suggesting that if she wasn t a woman, she wouldn t even be a legitimate candidate in the presidential race. Trump was asserting that the only thing she had going for her is the fact she would be the first female POTUS, and beyond that she has no qualifications. As you can imagine, it doesn t go over well with most people when you say a woman has literally no talents or redeeming values beyond her genitalia.Trump appeared on Fox News Sunday and was given an opportunity to address his poor choice of words by Chris Wallace. Trump did address the issue in the proper Republican way   by doubling down on the offensive comments. I m my own strategist, and I like what I said, and it s true. I only tell the truth, and that s why people vote for me.  He then suggested that she is just  going to have to take it  because she s a  strong person. So, the new Republican position is that a woman has to just  sit there and take  sexist comments from a guy   otherwise, she isn t  strong.  Really Donald? You re kidding, right? Even you aren t stupid enough to actually say that seriously.Following up on that verbal disaster, he reiterated his original comment by saying, The fact is, the only card that she has is the woman s card. She s done a lousy job in so many ways and even women don t like her. They don t like her. But it is the woman s card, and she plays it, and I ll let you know in about six months whether or not she plays it well. As is the usual case for Republicans, Trump is totally checked out on the reality of the situation. Recent polling models show that women overwhelmingly support Hillary Clinton over Trump by about 60 percent in hypothetical general election scenarios.In a strange way, Trump has done a great service for America and for the Democratic party. His candidacy has mainstreamed the core values of Republicans, such as bigotry, racism and sexism. He managed to convince Republican voters that it s ok to embrace these things openly, and require them to also be openly embraced by Republican candidates. In doing so, he may have single-handedly forced the Republican Party to destroy itself from the inside. Maybe Trump will make America great again, after all.Featured image via wikicommons",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton Extends Olive Branch To Sanders: We Will Work Together On Party Platform,"With the Democratic nomination wrapping up in Hillary Clinton s favor, the question remains what role Senator Bernie Sanders will play heading into the convention in Philadelphia. Trailing in the delegate support and popular vote support, Sanders undoubtedly has mastered a great chunk of clout that the Democrats will need to tap into if they hope to beat Donald Trump or long-shot candidate Ted Cruz.While the Sanders campaign has remained unwavering in their determination to win California, a power house in delegates and popular voters, they have accepted their path to the nomination is almost all but impossible. However, the campaign has found a way to make their lasting presence within the Democratic Party: the national platform.And Hillary Clinton, who is having to fight to pick up Sanders supporters, is prepared to offer an olive branch of solidarity to work together. Appearing on CNN with Jake Tapper, the frontrunner said she welcomes working with Sanders to implement a progressive platform: I certainly look forward to working with Sen. Sanders in the lead-up to the convention  in the lead-up to the platform that will represent the Democratic Party. It will be a progressive platform. I ve run on a progressive agenda. I really welcome his ideas and his passion and commitment, because the most important thing is winning in November. Sanders has called on the Democratic Party to implement open-primaries, automatic voter registration, and a 50-state strategy to garner as many votes as possible. Clinton has seemingly embraced some of these positions, and especially loved when Sanders told reporters his main priority in November is to make sure Donald Trump would not become President of the United States:There is no more important goal, and I was pleased when Sen. Sanders said the other day he s going to work tirelessly to make sure that Donald Trump was not president, and I really welcome that because that has to be our primary objective.As Clinton heads into the general, she will need to court Sanders  most ardent supporters. Extending an olive branch to work with Sanders is a smart move on Clinton s part, and will ensure a unified party.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox News Fans Found Out Malia Obama Is Going To Harvard, So They Called Her A ‘N*****’ (SCREENSHOTS)","If case you have not heard, Malia Obama is once again proving herself to be a smart young woman. Recently, Malia made headlines when she translated for her father during a trip to Cuba   something that earned her a lot of irrational hatred from conservatives. Now, she is in the news again for accomplishing something many parents wish for their kids: she got herself accepted to Harvard.While is is certainly good news   that the oldest of the First Daughters is following in her father s footsteps and becoming a successful human being, that still isn t enough for Fox News  racist fans. After the right-wing propaganda network masquerading as a news agency reported that Malia (who can t so much as look at a school or even wear a t-shirt without becoming the target of insane right-wing harassment), will be going to a good school, conservatives lost their minds and responded with such vitriol that Fox had to shut down the comments section on the article.The White House announced the good news on Sunday. Fox reported:Malia is the eldest of the Obamas  two daughters. She s 17 and a senior at the exclusive Sidwell Friends School in the District of Columbia.She s set to graduate high school in June, then celebrate her 18th birthday on the Fourth of July.Obama recently said he turned down an invitation to speak at Malia s high school graduation because his emotions would get the best of him.Malia decided on Harvard after visiting at least a dozen colleges, ultimately deciding to attend the school where her father earned his degree. Before she does this, she will take a year off school like many young people choose to do before going to college.There s nothing controversial about this at all. She did nothing wrong, but if you were to judge from the comments that flooded the website soon after the article went up, you would think she performed an abortion while marrying two undocumented immigrants inside a church while taking the congregants  guns and stomping on a flag. Readers called her a  n*gger,  a  monkey,  an  ape,  and made it very clear that her skin color is something they consider important in determining her worth as a human being.Already, the Stupid Part of America suspects that she was granted special favors, that her blackness prevents her from getting grades good enough to earn her a spot at the prestigious school:             This is just one example of the Right attacking President Obama s children. Malia became the subject of assaults after it was rumored that she had a couple drinks at a party while visiting Brown University. Whether or not she did is unknown, but conservatives decided that a.) she s guilty and b.) for doing what many teenagers do, she is literally the devil. Another time, a photograph of her wearing a t-shirt featuring the words,  Pro Era,  the name of a rap label. When she was younger, conservatives even photoshopped an image of the President touching Sasha inappropriately, then presented it as fact. Sadly, it was well-received by the right. Malia can t even get a job without being smeared as an  affirmative action loser. Malia Obama is a classy lady, no matter what these inbred taint-barnacles say. It s disgusting that Obama s more hateful critics can t so much as have the decency to avoid attacking his children. The Obamas have faced more irrational bigotry than have any other presidential family in history   and this is certainly not OK.Featured image via Getty Images/ Chip Somodevilla (modified)",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Lawmakers Condemn ‘Dangerous Abuse Of Subpoena Powers’ By GOP Panel,"Only April 28, nearly 100 lawmakers sent a letter to Marsha Blackburn, Chairman of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives. The letter condemns the panel s use of intimidation tactics against  researchers, graduate students, laboratory technicians and administrative personnel,  through what lawmaker s describe as a dangerous misuse subpoena powers.The panel was created by Republicans in October 2015, after the bogus Center For Medical Progress released a series of highly edited videos online. While the group claimed that the videos showed officials from Planned Parenthood conspiring to sell fetal body parts, the video transcripts (which you can read here) tell an entirely different story.Multiple investigations have cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing in association with the video. If that s enough, in January a Texas Grand Jury indicted two of the key players involved in creating the bogus videos, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, on felony charges.But facts are rarely allowed to get in the way of republican extremists, who continue to use the long-debunked videos as a way to push their anti-abortion agenda across the country.According to the 98 lawmakers who recently signed the letter to the Select Investigative Panel, members of the panel have moved beyond the point of repeating dangerous and false rhetoric about Planned Parenthood, launching a witch hunt which targets medical researchers, medical supply companies, students and others involved in fetal tissue research.The letter reads, in part:We are particularly concerned by the recent reports that the select panel has issued 11 subpoenas to medical supply companies and laboratories that will seek the names of researchers, graduate students, laboratory technicians and administrative personnel involved with fetal tissue research. The misuse of subpoena power is clearly aimed at not only stopping the crucial medical research, but personally intimidating the scientists who are engaged in this lifesaving work.The 98 members who signed the document strongly condemned the  dangerous tactics  employed by the panel, calling for it to be immediately dissolved.The letter goes on to rip republican lawmakers, saying: This body has spent more than enough taxpayer money doing the bidding of the Republican Congressional Committee. It is clear that this Panel serves no other purpose than to carry out politically-motivated attacks on Planned Parenthood. Not only is it insane that Republicans in Congress continue to waste taxpayer resources investigating these debunked videos, but it s reprehensible that they would use their positions as elected officials to intimidate and harass scientists, researchers and others, for their own political gain.Here are the names of the eight members of Congress who make up the investigative panel:Vote them out in November.Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Hillary Just Responded To Obama Making Fun Of Her At Dinner, And It’s Perfect (TWEET)","During the White House Correspondents  Dinner Saturday night, President Obama took jabs at pretty much everyone on both sides of the aisle. This dose of humility is good to keep everyone in check and try to not allow heads to get too large.President Obama made jokes even involving the current Democratic presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.With Bernie, the president went after the fact that the Vermont Senator has been distancing himself from the current administration. Then with Hillary, he joked about the fact that Hillary seems to try so hard to be hip with social media, but still hasn t quite gotten the hang of it. He said: You ve got to admit it though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook.  Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I m not sure I m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.  It s not entirely persuasive. Well, Hillary took to her Twitter account on Sunday to let the president know what she though of his joke.Her response was perfect, saying: Nice job last night. Aunt Hillary approves. @potus Nice job last night. Aunt Hillary approves. #WHCD -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 1, 2016Of course, all of the president s jokes were all in good jest, and no one was immune to criticism.The president did, however, make a joke early on in his speech that definitely got people laughing and thinking that he s throwing his support behind Hillary, or at least he believes she ll be the next president.President Obama quipped: Next year someone else will be standing here in this spot, and it s anyone s guess who she will be.

 Disabled Man Confronts Ted Cruz For His Lies About Obamacare (VIDEO),"Republican presidential hopeful and Texas senator Ted Cruz has earned the nickname  Lyin  Ted  for a reason, and he s in no rush to clean up his tarnished image anytime soon.Proving that he s completely worthy of being known as the least-liked GOPer, Cruz mingled with voters at The Pie Pan restaurant in Evansville this weekend   and lied to their faces. For over an hour, Cruz met and took photos with voters, clearly trying to prove that he wasn t  Lucifer, as former House Speaker John Boehner recently suggested.During this meet-and-greet, one of the issues Cruz spoke about was Obamacare. Cruz said: The top two legislative agenda items I ve got are repealing Obamacare and passing a simple flat tax, abolishing the IRS. Everything was going smoothly for Cruz until toward the end of his visit, when an older couple introduced Cruz to Scott, a disabled man in a wheelchair. Although some of the conversation is muffled, it is clear that the man is concerned about the Affordable Care Act being repealed, stating that people like him would not be able to get health insurance at all. This concern is completely valid   even current House Speaker Paul Ryan has said that putting people with pre-existing conditions into  high-risk pools  would make healthcare unaffordable for many Americans. Cruz began to respond and say, There s no doubt that we need to provide care  before the man interrupted: But it was never done before. It was never done. Nobody did it. Cruz, heartless as ever, replied with a straight-up lie: I can tell you millions have lost their health care at the same time. The  millions  that Cruz is referring to are those who had policies that didn t meet Obamacare standards. Factcheck.org has actually straightened this false GOP talking point right out   it turns out that those people didn t  lose  their insurance at all   they were offered replacements that did fall in line with the ACA instead. But of course, Cruz isn t going to bother with the truth.You can watch Cruz lie to a disabled man s face below:The feed unfortunately cut out, but not before the man confronting Cruz could point to Scott and say, Well, but it made a difference to some. Those  some  people who the man is referring to are the 16.9 million Americans that now have affordable health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Repealing Obamacare is a huge disservice to Americans, and it s a shame that Cruz s attitude toward those concerns is I don t give a f*ck.

 Geraldo Rivera: GOP Will Only Nominate A ‘Crazy Person’ Who ‘Can Never Be Elected’ (VIDEO),"Those of us on the left have long said that the Republican base took a jump off the cliff into crazy land never to return a long time ago. Well, now, one of their own is saying the same. Geraldo Rivera, famed host of trash TV turned GOP mouthpiece, has come out and echoed what we have all been saying for ages: his party is bashit insane. Rivera went on Fox News this weekend and spoke with Howard Kurtz, who pointed out that the Fox correspondent was likely  a little uncomfortable  with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump s comments regarding immigrants from Mexico, considering the fact that it is well documented that Rivera and Trump have been bosom buddies for many years.Rivera said: He is a friend of mine, I do love the guy. And then he said Mexican immigrants are dope dealers and rapists. Indeed. We all remember The Donald s infamously racist tone upon the opening of his travesty of a presidential campaign. It s nice to know that it did not go unnoticed by Rivera.Rivera continued: Though I have a deep respect for him and his family, I could never vote for him unless he moderates that position. It is easy for me to draw that line, I can go that far but no further. You have to be compassionate to this [immigrant] population. Well, that s good to know. One less vote for that lunatic Trump, even from a self-professed right winger in the public eye. Rivera went on to say that he thinks that,  Donald doesn t really mean it,  and then let loose on what those on the left already have known about the GOP s base for a very long time now: I think you have to be a crazy person to get the Republican nomination these days. I think that they have to tow a line that is in many ways intolerable for a reasonably intelligent compassionate person. You have to clear the [anti-immigrant Rep. Steven King] hurdle in Iowa to get anywhere. Steven King is the congressman that said of Mexican immigrants that they have the calves the size of cantaloupes because they are all carrying dope across the border. I mean, if you have to please that person to get past the nation s first primary election then you are doomed to a radical position that will never fly with the American electorate, and you can never be elected. Well, yeah. I mean, even though most Republicans are that nutty and ignorant, there are plenty of moderates who cannot look the other way on such positions, and certainly independents and left wingers can t. Despite the circus that is the current state of American politics, most of us really just aren t that nuts, thankfully.I might not agree with Geraldo Rivera on much, but this time he is right on the money   the current incarnation of the Republican Party is beyond crazy.Watch Rivera s comments below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Talk Show Host Whines That No One Called George W. Bush ‘My N***a’ At Correspondents’ Dinner (VIDEO),"People have called former President George W. Bush lots of things. War criminal. Worst President Ever. Terrorist. Dipshit. F*ckface. But it is doubtful that any African-American man, woman, or child (especially after his response to Hurricane Katrina) would ever call him  my nigga. While Republicans are understandably confused by Larry Wilmore s term of endearment for the President at the Correspondents  Dinner   after all, they are used to calling him the  -er  variation of the word rather than the one Wilmore used   many view Wilmore s ability to infuriate the right in this manner as the only redeeming aspect of his otherwise godawful comedy routine. So, Mr. President, I m going to keep it a hundred. Yo Barry, you did it, my n*gga,  Wilmore said at the dinner, a phrase that most recognized as a positive remark but the Right felt was a reminder of that  n-word  thing they don t get to use when referencing President Obama.Upon hearing Wilmore call the President  my nigga,  Fox host Todd Starnes, for example, nearly exploded into a noxious cloud of rage and envy after hearing Wilmore use a variation of something that he s been screaming inside his head for years as he pretended that Wilmore s words were somehow offensive. Sharing in Starnes  feigned outrage is conservative talk show host and imbecile Jimmy Mathis, who threw an almost temper tantrum on Sunday over Wilmore s ability to use the word.Suddenly, for the first time in his presidency, Mathis feels that Barack Obama deserves  respect.  That s   the jealousy felt by the Stupid Part of America that is so pervasive that they are now talking about  respecting this President   the same one they have been screaming about for years.Mathis said that public figures like Wilmore (and, presumably, Fox News hosts and other noted right-wing icons) should   go above and beyond to try to be as respectful to the individual and the office as possible    a complete departure from what typically happens in conservative media. Mathis whined that no one called President George W. Bush  my nigga : And then you have Larry Wilmore Correct me if I m wrong, I don t remember anybody while roasting [President George Bush] dropped the N-word in the final White House Correspondents Dinner.If I were President Obama, I would have walked off that stage, I would have walked off. No way you re going to disrespect me and the office. This is not a P.C. society thing. I can t imagine standing feet from the President of the United States and saying that,  Mathis said, though like all conservatives it s probably something that is a commonly recurring theme in his dreams.Here s a thought for Mathis: right now, at this very moment in time, the Republican frontrunner is endorsed by the KKK. Until you condemn that, the rest of us   especially people you regularly dismissively call  the blacks  or worse   don t give a damn what you think about a black man saying  my nigga.

 WATCH: New Music Video Calls On Supporters To Keep Rallying For Bernie Sanders,"Bernie Sanders, the upstart and relatively unknown senator from Vermont, has captured the hearts and minds of people from all generations and walks of life, especially young Americans who are the future of tomorrow. He s ignited a passion for the political process not seen in generations. One of his gifts has been his ability to explain the major issues America is facing today and to offer actual solutions to problems. His straight talk has been refreshing in a political process that borders on the repulsive this election year, especially when it comes to GOP candidates, who often attack each other rather than the issues, making a mockery of the Republican Party and setting a bad example for America. Bernie s straight talk is summed up in a new song called Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, a rallying call for Bernie s supporters to continue the march toward the Democratic nomination.The lyrics in the song include the following: He s come to save democracy from the greed of the plutocracy and slay the phony narrative and make healthcare an imperative. About income inequality and media frivolity, they ll tell you you re just out of luck, while Bernie fights for 15 bucks. Perhaps the most attractive aspect about Bernie Sanders  candidacy is his ability to take stances on issues. Unlike most politicians, the senator actually has views on issues and offers solutions rather than what most politicians do, which is to avoid taking a stance for fear of losing votes.Whether Bernie Sanders is able to win the Democratic nomination or not, he s already changed America. For example, he taught other politicians that if you criticize Israel for its abhorrent treatment of the Palestinians,  you ll survive as a politician, despite the seditious influence that Israel lobby groups have over the American political system. Politicians will have to listen to voters who call for universal healthcare and an America first attitude and Bernie Sanders has been able to normalize this talk.The Bernie Sanders revolution is here.Watch the video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5a2NAfsC4I]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox Host Throws Hissy Fit Because He Can’t Call President Obama The N-Word (TWEETS),"Larry Wilmore used the n-word on Saturday night to cap off his bit at the White House Correspondents  Dinner to congratulate President Obama, and that made one Fox host incredibly jealous.

His remarks above are at the end of the video:President Obama didn t have a problem with it, but Fox News host Todd Starnes sure did, and he let everyone know about it by throwing a temper tantrum on Twitter.He accused Wilmore, who is black, of being racist and whined about how shameful it is to use the N-word while talking about the president.Dear @larrywilmore   race baiting isn t funny   and using a racial epithet is incredibly despicable. #NerdProm #shameful  toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) May 1, 2016 What @larrywilmore called the President at the end of that disgusting speech was despicable   incredibly shameful.  toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) May 1, 2016Of course, President Obama is also black and the n-word has become a term of endearment used among some members of the black community in an effort to reclaim the word from its racist past.And Twitter users were quick to roast Starnes:Sorry you got so butthurt, @toddstarnes.

" This University Will Punish You For Being Raped, Effectively Silencing Victims","Imagine being a woman going to a university where instead of only investigating the person who sexually assaulted you, they also choose to discipline you as well. That s exactly what s happening to young women who attend Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.BYU prides itself on Mormon values, yet apparently standing up for women who have been sexually assaulted is not one of those values. Instead, with their actions, they are in turn giving permission to rape, because it s likely not going to get reported, because the women being assaulted are also being punished.One woman named Brooke told CNN after she brought her story to BYU s Title IX office, an office that is supposed to handle sexual violence: I thought there would be some mercy, you know. I told them everything, and because of the fact that I was on drugs, they used that reason to kick me out of school after reporting it. You see, BYU has an  Honor Code,  and within that code one must not commit sexual misconduct  or participate in  illegal substances.  When Brooke came forward she explained that the sexual assault came after she had taken LSD, the school decided to send her a letter that read: You are being suspended from Brigham Young University because of your violation of the Honor Code including continued illegal drug used and consensual sex, effective immediately. And as it turns out,  Brooke is not alone. Several women have come forward with similar stories of being shamed by BYU s archaic  Honor Code.  So many, in fact, that there is now a petition asking the school to  stop punishing victims of sexual assault. The woman who put together the petition shares her story, and says: I don t deserve punishment for choosing to report my rape to the police. But now I have to deal with a criminal trial and an honor code investigation. I don t want anyone to have to go through what I m experiencing now. That s why I m insisting BYU creates a way for victims to come forward without being reported to the Honor Code Office. Also stating: I spoke up at a sexual assault awareness event at BYU last week. In response, Title IX official Sarah Westerberg defended her choice to deny me services and to initiate an Honor Code investigation against me. She recognized that the honor code has a  chilling effect  on reporting of rape and that Title IX  does not apologize for that.  I felt like I was being treated not as the victim, but as a perpetrator. BYU has made it clear that victims will be punished if they report sexual violence.  That s a huge reason why so many survivors are afraid to come forward and contributes to why BYU s rape and sexual assault numbers are inaccurately low.  Without an immunity clause, BYU will continue to be a hostile environment for rape victims, and that emboldens offenders and shames victims.I can only imagine how many rape survivors have not gotten justice or help to heal because it might hurt their academic standing. It s just absolutely outrageous that women have to fear being suspended or expelled because they were victimized by a sexual perpetrator. They did not ask for what happened to them. They are NOT the guilty party. BYU better take a good long look at their practices and how they handle reports of sexual assault, because this is utterly unacceptable. Women should feel safe in their learning environment, and know that their school will be there for them if anything were to ever happen. Instead, they are victim-shamed and robbed of their education.

 Michelle Obama: Research Proves We Can Lift Economy By Educating Girls,"During her time in the White House, First Lady Michelle Obama has championed so many important causes   many of them geared toward helping children and women around the world.One of these crucial initiatives, launched last year, was Let Girls Learn   an effort to educate teenage girls. This effort was backed by studies that showed that when women and girls are educated, a nation s economy rises. In an interview with a U.S. Agency for International Development publication, Michelle said: Studies from the World Bank show that one extra year of secondary school can increase a girl s future income by 15 to 25 percent. And we know that when girls are educated, they are less likely to contract HIV, more likely to delay childbearing and vaccinate their children, and have lower maternal and infant mortality rates. Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country s GDP. The link between the education of girls and a nation s GDP has been made before   and thanks to an analysis by Politifact, we now know that there s a lot of truth to that statement.According to research, when there are more girls in school, there is a higher gross domestic product   although there is some uncertainty if it s a stronger economy that results in more girls being educated, or if having more girls in school leads to the rise of a nation s economy. One policy report from the World Bank said: By effectively educating more women   that is, providing more women with a high-quality education   more will enter the labor market, and the economy will show the favorable results. Although educating girls has been shown to improve the economy, this doesn t account for any obstacles women might encounter even if they are educated. Sexism and gender inequality can still have an impact on the economy even as efforts are made to put more girls in school and give them more resources and opportunities. According to a 2009 article in the journal Feminist Economics, the economic benefit will be lost if companies refuse to hire educated girls.However, the gains of educating girls are far more than any roadblocks they may encounter. Education allows girls to make informed decisions about their lives and allows them to contribute to and help improve society. Michelle was dead on when she said: We need to get these girls into school, because we know that education is the single-most important stepping stone to power, to freedom, and to equality.

On Thursday, the Ways and Means Committee voted on a bill that would make dark money even darker. In a 23-15 vote split along party lines, the committee approved the bill. After the Supreme Court s Citizen s United decision, a flood of dark money has been funneled into U.S. political system. Now, the Koch Brothers and their Republican goons in the House are trying to make it harder to know who is donating money to these non-profit groups.U.S. Representative Peter J. Roskam (R-IL) introduced the bill, which is titled the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act. The bill would change the current law so that non-profit organizations no longer have to disclose their donors to the IRS. The Kochs and Republicans have argued that these donor lists only serve to give the IRS a way to intimidate those who donate to certain non-profit groups.Koch Companies Public Sector president Phillip Ellender released a letter in support of the bill which says: The targeting of non-profit organizations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to limit free speech under this Administration is well documented. From the IRS subjecting donors of nonprofit organizations to the gift tax, to the direct targeting of conservative non-profit organizations based solely on their beliefs, this legislation could not be more pertinent. Considering the pair of reports released earlier this year by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), it s even more pressing. The GAO found serious internal control flaws within the IRS that could allow the agency to continue its targeting of certain Americans for audit  based on an organization s religious, educational, political, or other views. In reality, these lists are mainly used to prevent donations from people in foreign nations from influencing U.S. elections. If this bill were to pass it would open up the floodgates for foreign contributions into the U.S. political system. Democracy 21, an organization that advocates for fair elections and campaign finance reform, released a statement where they said: Currently, the fact that nonprofit groups have to report their donors, including foreign donors, to the IRS serves as a check against any nonprofit taking the risk of illegally spending these funds in federal elections. By eliminating this reporting requirement, as the Roskam bill does, there would be no way for anyone to know whether foreign money was being illegally spent through a nonprofit in a federal election and there would be no way to hold violators accountable for their illegal activities. This move by the Koch brothers is nothing more than an attempt to further erode democracy in the U.S. The reality that U.S. politicians can be bought and sold by  charities  is bad enough. The idea that they could be financed in part or totally by people who are not U.S. citizens is downright scary. This bill is treasonous and those who support it should be considered traitors to the U.S. It should concern both on the right and the left.You can watch the Ways and Means Committee session on the bill below:Featured Image from (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Ted Cruz Gets His A** Handed To Him By Chuck Todd In Humiliating Interview,"Chuck Todd took Ted Cruz to the woodshed on Sunday after the Texas Senator claimed that there s a media conspiracy against him.Cruz is currently in second place far behind Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who is close to capturing the GOP nomination.Throughout the interview on Meet The Press, Todd repeatedly tried to get Cruz to answer whether he will support Trump or not should he become the nominee. But Cruz only embarrassed himself by avoiding the question with nonsensical claims about the media and NBC that Todd called him out on. If he s the nominee, I take it you can t support him anymore, can you?  Todd asked. I recognize that many in the media would love for me to surrender to Donald Trump,  Cruz accused. It s not about the media,  Todd replied before stabbing Cruz with reality.  Senator, it s about the numbers. He may win. Republican voters are the ones rejecting you. This is not a media conspiracy, Senator. Todd continued to grill Cruz into answering the original question. Why can t you answer the question of whether you can support Donald Trump or not?  Todd asked.  You can t answer that question. Why won t you answer that question, straight forward, black and white? Cruz then accused NBC executives of being  partisan Democrats,  which Todd immediately called out as a lie. You don t get to just say that. It s just not true. Go ahead. You re broad brushing here, and this is exactly what people hate about the media and politics. Broad brushes, right? Cruz then launched into a rant about how if voters reject him the country will be lost as if he s the only person in the nation who can save it. I m not willing to concede this country,  Cruz said.  If we lose this, we lose our country. At that point, Todd dared Cruz to take a stand if he really feels that way and answer the question of whether he will support Trump or not if he becomes the nominee. All Cruz has to say is that he won t support Trump, especially if he really believes that by losing to Trump the country will be lost. Don t you think it s important to take a stand? You just said it s a time for choosing. If it s a time for choosing, say it, for him or against him as the nominee! But like a stubborn petulant child, Cruz refused to answer the question and Todd slammed him for it. Let the record show, you have not taken a position on whether you can support Trump if he s the nominee,  he concluded, to which Cruz replied that the media tried to force him to support Trump.Here s the video via YouTube:Cruz completely humiliated himself during this interview and left us no doubt about why Republican voters are rejecting him at the polls.He was given a national platform on Sunday television to tell voters that he will not stand by Trump if he wins the nomination but all he could do was offer contradictory rhetoric about how the country will be lost if Trump wins while refusing take a stand against Trump.When Cruz loses the Republican primary, he can t blame the media for it. The only one he can blame is himself because he was too cowardly to answer a simple question that would have shown once and for all where Ted Cruz stands. Instead, all he could do is complain. And whining will be all Cruz is remembered for doing during this campaign.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox News, Huffington Post Reporters Brawl Outside WHCD (IMAGES)","Fox News  reporter  Jesse Watters and Huffington Post s Washington Bureau Chief Ryan Grim got into a heated confrontation following last night s White House Correspondents  Dinner.The Washington Post reports that punches were thrown as the two  flailed around,  ultimately  upending a table and bumping into several people. While no one seems to have captured the fight on video, Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel managed to get a photo of what looks like Watters getting his ass kicked by Grim.Image credit: screen capture, Dave Weigel via TwitterThe Washington Post reports that the two men were among a group of WHCD attendees who had gathered in a heated tent outside the main party area.The fight broke out after Grim said he recognized Watters as the  ambush journalist,  who  engineered an on-camera confrontation of writer Amanda Terkel, now a HuffPo colleague of Grim. Terkel describes how Watters, an O Reilly Factor correspondent, stalked, ambushed, harassed and accosted her in this Think Progress article.Upon recognizing Watters at the WHCD, Grim decided to give Watters a taste of his own medicine.According to witnesses who spoke with the Washington Post, Grim approached Watters,  whipping out his camera phone and filming him. Grim later posted to Twitter that  ambush guy  didn t take well to being ambushed himself.Image credit: screen capture Ryan Grim, via TwitterOnce the confrontation became physical, a crowd of bystanders intervened to keep the peace.The Washington Post reports that RNC executive director Sean Spicer stepped in to separate the two men, during what he described as an effort to  stay true to the party venue. The Washington Post reached out to Watters for comment, but did not get a response.They did reach Grim, who was described as  unrepentant. Ambush guy can t take getting ambushed,  he said.

 President Obama Makes Fun Of Donald Trump And It’s HILARIOUS (VIDEO),"In his final 2016 White House Correspondence Dinner, a sharp tongued President Obama unleashed a scathing but hilarious barrage of humor on Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump and pretty much everyone who had ties to the GOP. The president drew many laughs in front of journalists, celebrities, and politicians, both Democrats and Republicans. However, one person wasn t there: Donald Trump. The president said of Trump s absence:I m a little hurt that he s not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. And it is surprising. You got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What s he doing?The president also had lots of fun with how the Republicans have reacted to the fact that Donald Trump is their most likely nominee. The president said:The Republican establishment is incredulous that he s their most likely nominee. Incredulous, shocking. They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world. Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. And there s one area where Donald s experience could be invaluable. And that s closing Guantanamo. Because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.The president also took a shot at the media for their lopsided coverage of Trump s campaign which often times has been absurd in term of the amount of free press he s received. The president told the audience full of reporters and journalists,  I hope you re all proud of yourselves. Let s hope that when all is said and done, the ascendancy of Donald Trump doesn t go beyond November and we can all breath a sigh of relief when we no longer see Trump s face plastered all over the media.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcIrak9gdn8]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bush’s Secretary Of Defense Says Trump Has No F*cking Idea What He’s Talking About,"Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is not a fan of Donald Trump, and he has no problem telling the American people that the billionaire would be a mistake. On Sunday s episode of ABC s This Week, he did exactly that.Guest host Martha Raddatz asked Gates what he thought about the speech the Republican frontrunner gave on foreign policy earlier in the week and like former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Gates was not impressed: I think based on the speech you d have somebody who doesn t understand the difference between a business negotiation and a negotiation with sovereign powers. For example, he, on the one hand, says we need to be a more reliable ally to our friends. And then in the next breath he basically says we re going to rip up all those burden-sharing agreements that we ve had over the decades with them and make them go their own way if they don t pay for everything. During Trump s speech he did, in fact, contradict himself. He claimed he was going to take care of our allies, but then he said that many of them aren t paying their  fair share and if he were president he would make those countries (mostly in the Middle East)  defend themselves. Gates also slammed Trump for his inability to take advice: One of the things that worries me, Martha, is that he doesn t appear to listen to people. He believes that he has all the answers, that he s the smartest man in the room. And I ve worked with some   for some very different presidents. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, Barack Obama. One of the things they all had in common was a willingness to listen to people who with   who had experience, and then make their own independent judgment. Now, they ve gone in different directions but they never assumed they had all the answers, and that s one of the things that troubles me. He definitely does think he knows best and that is a huge problem when you think about how much power he would have as president. Just look at his campaign, he continues to insult minorities and women even as other officials in his party tell him to knock it off. He continues to say that he will force other countries to pay for things, even though experts say that is not possible. What would happen if he were sitting in the White House and the Secretary of Defense told him that his plan to  bomb the hell out of ISIS  wasn t a good idea? Would he ignore his military advisers? The answer is: probably.When a person with as much experience as Robert Gates says Trump is a bad idea, the Republican Party should take him seriously.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Don Lemon Flipped Larry Wilmore The Bird After Being Utterly Humiliated By Him Publicly (VIDEO),"There are quite the number of mixed reviews coming in this morning of Larry Wilmore s monologue at the White House Correspondents  Dinner. Wilmore, who runs The Nightly Show on Comedy Central, took some pretty serious stabs at the mainstream media, particularly CNN.At one point, Wilmore asked where Wolf Blitzer was by saying,  Speaking of girls, where s Wolf Blitzer.  The camera showed a profile of an unamused Blitzer as Wilmore went on to trash him and The Situation Room, as the crowd went silent except for a few jeers and  oooohs :Wolf Blitzer looks less than amused with Larry Wilmore s jokes   screen capture+Wilmore seemed to be, for the most part, bombing here. The crowd, which arguably is full of the people Wilmore has decided to insult, isn t being kind to the anti-media position. That didn t stop Wilmore from trudging on, coming to Don Lemon and delivering an epic roast that earned him more than just a few laughs, It earned Don Lemon s middle finger:Don Lemon couldn t show a little restraint, opting to show the bird to Larry Wilmore instead   screen captureTo be fair, Larry Wilmore laid a smackdown on Lemon that probably warranted a little comeback, but seriously, Don? At the WHCD? The president and the first lady are in that room get a grip.Here s the exchange between Wilmore and Lemon that had fingers flying:The line, in case you missed it, was,  America s finest black journalists are here tonight. Don Lemon s here too.  Lemon reacted, poorly, and he ll catch a lot of grief for it. Wilmore, on the other hand, has taken a few hits for what people called a horrible performance and also been heavily praised by people who think we SHOULD question the status quo. CNN Doesn t get a pass just because they aren t Fox News anymore. When President Obama delivered his monologue, he made notes of some journalists who had made moves away from the White House Press Corps and then he zinged Jake Tapper for  leaving journalism to join CNN. It was a rough night for the media, that s for sure.Featured image by Getty Images Pool/ Screen capture",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama Invades Iran With A Moderate Reformist Government–Defies GOP Logic Of Democracy Via War,"How many times more are we going to get to say this before 2017?  While Republicans were bashing Obama for <insert situation here>, he was busy taking care of the same problem they were crying about better than they ever could have hoped to do.  This is a common theme between Republicans and President Obama. Every time President Obama does something good, they call it the biggest disaster imaginable. Do they think we re not watching?Remember during President Obama s Iranian nuclear deal, when Republicans said  going easy  on Iran (translation   not invading their country) would only make them a worse threat?Huge shock incoming: literally nothing Republicans swore would happen from the Iran deal happened. In fact, yet again the exact opposite happened.The latest proof of President Obama s phenomenal and historic success comes with news of the recent Iranian elections. Supporters of Hassan Rouhani swept to power in run-off elections that gave the Iranian moderate reformist movement legislative control of the Iranian parliament for the first time in over 10 years.Forty-two percent of the total seats were won by Rouhani s moderate supporters. Independents took nearly 30 percent of the remaining seats, and the vast majority of them are also moderate reformists. This leaves a paltry 28 percent left for the Iranian hardliners, which essentially amounts to a seat at the  kid s table,  where their rhetoric means diddly squat and they can do no legislative harm.The landslide success of the Iranian moderate reformists has been linked directly to the success of the nuclear agreement reached between President Rouhani and the United States. The deal brought a great amount of both social and financial relief to the people of Iran, and Rouhani s big win is being viewed as an endorsement of it by the Iranian people.The seriousness of this would be difficult to overstate. President Obama not only won on the Iran deal, but he helped move into place a reformist government that could carry things far beyond the deal alone.As if the electoral results were not enough of a statement for a more moderate future in Iran, the first priority of the new government is going to be a bill to guarantee citizens  rights. This is IRAN we are talking about. The idea of citizen rights being the first priority for a newly elected government is astounding, considering they were viewed by most of the world as a terrorist state for decades.While Iran won t be turning into a mirror image of the West anytime soon, just the fact that the nation took such a huge pivot so quickly is all anyone needs to know when it comes to how President Obama did on the Iran deal.Republicans just can t win when it comes to President Obama. Every time they bash the hell out of him in the media for handling a situation poorly, he literally does the exact opposite   quite often simultaneously   while the rest of the world laughs at the GOP. We sure are going to miss him.Featured image via Getty",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Long Beach Police Have Discriminatory Policy Targeting Gay Men, Judge Says (VIDEO)","On April 29, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Halim Dhanidina overturned the conviction of Rory Moroney, a gay man arrested by an undercover Long Beach police officer in October 2014.In overturning Moroney s conviction, the judge confirmed what LGBTQ advocates have been saying for years: that gay men are routinely targeted by members of the Long Beach vice squad.The judge agreed with Moroney s attorneys, who sought to have their client s conviction on charges of  lewd conduct and indecent exposure thrown out,  citing the discriminatory nature of Long Beach  lewd conduct stings. During the stings, male officers are sent out into the community to specifically target gay men.In Moroney s case an undercover officer made gestures toward him in a public restroom. Moroney was arrested after responding to what he presumed to be sexual advances on the part of the officer by exposing himself.Dhanidina found that  the presence and tactics of the decoy officers actually caused the crimes to occur. The judge also found that  Long Beach s vice tactics are discriminatory because the squad uses only male officers as undercover decoys in lewd conduct stings. He went on to say that the police department intentionally targeted men who engaged in homosexual sex,  during the stings.While the police department claimed that the stings were only done in response to citizen lewd conduct complaints, the judge shut down that argument after they failed to show evidence of citizens complaining.LGBTQ activists and civil rights attorneys have long criticized the tactics used by police to arrest gay men.Jim Key, a spokesman for the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told the Los Angeles Times that police who use these tactics  aren t saving lives, they re destroying them by branding innocent men as sex offenders. John Duran, West Hollywood councilman and expert witness, said the lewd conduct stings  came out of the era when homosexuality was criminal,  calling them  a leftover from the last century. While the judge s decision is a step forward, both for Moroney and others who have been entrapped by Long Beach police, these same tactics are unfortunately used to persecute gay men all across the country.Last year police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana finally apologized for destroying hundreds of lives after they entrapped and arrested gay men using a ban on sodomy struck down by the Supreme Court almost 15 years ago.Watch video from The Young Turks, which talks about how police targeted and trapped the victims of these false arrests:Just as we have a long way to go in the US to eliminate institutional racism, we still have a long way to go to eliminate institutional homophobia, which includes a multitude of tactics used by police and lawmakers to profile, target, entrap, criminalize and imprison members of LGBTQ community.Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images",News,"May 1, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: President Obama’s ‘Couch Commander’ Comedy Video Is The FUNNIEST Thing He’s Ever Done,"For his final White House Correspondent s Dinner, the White House release a hilarious comedy video, starring President Obama, Vice President Biden, and a cast of famous faces. The plot of the video showed the President going on a quest to figure out what, exactly, he plans to do with his free time after leaving the White House.Watch @POTUS in ""Couch Commander."" https://t.co/p1xFpHrSmP  The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 1, 2016After dropping an expletive on NBC s Chuck Todd, who calls him the  Couch Commander,  Obama meets with Vice President Biden, who advises him to start driving again, or to get involved in sports.That s followed up by another joke at the expense of birther conspiracy theorists.The President then plays around with Snapchat, which creates a media controversy.Seeking advice for what to do in retirement, President Obama turns to his former nemesis, former Speaker of the House John Boehner, who watches an emotional film and out come the waterworks.Boehner then dispenses some advice to Obama to just be himself, and the President expresses relief at being able to wear  mom jeans  again.The video showcases a lot of what has made Obama so endearing to his supporters, and what drives his detractors up the wall. He is a natural performer, at home making fun of himself and the weird institutions and traditions of Washington, D.C.The Couch Commander video is quite similar to President Bill Clinton s offering at his last Correspondent s Dinner in 2000. That showed President Clinton lounging around the White House looking for something to do as the election ran past him, even Hillary Clinton had abandoned him as she went to New York for her senatorial run. Eventually Clinton ended up with the kid from the then-ubiquitous Dell commercials showing him how to use eBay and send email (it was the turn of the century and still so very new).

 Conservative ‘Christian’ Says Wives Should Submit To Husbands Even If Treated Like Sh*t,"If you re a woman you re going to want to deck this asshole for what he just said.During an interview with the Christian Post this week, evangelist nut job Kirk Cameron said that no matter how wives are treated by their husbands they should be submissive and stay in the marriage because God commands it. Wives are to honor and respect and follow their husband s lead, not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband,  Cameron said before claiming that women should know their role so that the marriage can succeed.  When each person gets their part right, regardless of how their spouse is treating them, there is hope for real change in their marriage. In other words, even if she is being beaten daily by her husband and treated like a slave, a wife should always remain submissive and basically let her husband do whatever they want without consequence. And it s all because the Bible says so according to Cameron. A lot of people don t know that marriage comes with instructions,  he said.  And, we find them right there in God s word. Seriously. This is the  advice  Cameron has for women.Someone should call Cameron s wife and make sure she is okay because the former child actor clearly thinks domestic violence is something wives should just ignore instead of saving themselves and getting out of the marriage.Cameron is, of course, part of the conservative  Christian  fundamentalist movement which repeatedly preaches that women are nothing more than common house slaves meant to cook, clean, raise children, and talk only when their husbands give them permission to do so.Just take pastor Steven Anderson for instance.In February, Anderson posted a sermon in which he preached that women should be banned from voting, barred from seeking divorce, prevented from entering the workforce, and ought to be confined to the home where they are submissive to their husbands. The right to divorce your husband is what they mean. You know what they mean? The right to rebel and disobey your husband, the right to divorce him, the right to go out and get a job and make your own money, the right to tell him what to do, the right to go vote for our leaders as if women should have any say in how our country is run when the Bible says that  I suffer not a woman to teach, not to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. Here s the video via YouTube:Two years earlier, Anderson demanded that women shut their mouths in church so that the men could teach them. You have to wonder if Cameron believes that, too.Anderson has also preached that women shouldn t be allowed to talk, read, or leave the house.Basically, if conservative  Christians  like Steven Anderson or Kirk Cameron had their way women would be forbidden to have lives outside of the home and would be under the boot heel of their husbands day in and day out without a say in the matter. And just think, many Republican lawmakers agree with them.It s a scary thought that should spur women across the country to use their right to vote to put men like Cameron and Anderson in their place.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Revolution Won’t Be Beat: Here’s How Sanders Is Going To Change The Democratic Party (VIDEO),"While Bernie Sanders is nowhere near ready to concede defeat in the Democratic primary race, on Thursday the Vermont Senator vowed to bring  the most progressive agenda that any party has ever seen  to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.According to Fortune, Sanders and his backers have not yet decided on all of the issues they will press for during the convention, which is scheduled to take place at the end of July.But on Monday Senator Sanders listed single-payer healthcare and a comprehensive climate change plan as issues the Democratic party would need to adopt if they hoped to gain support from his backers.Later in the week, during an interview with CNN, Jane Sanders pointed to election reform as another of the campaign s top issues.Mrs. Sanders said during the interview: One of the things that we will be fighting for on the platform, whether he s the candidate or not, is electoral reform. The process needs to change. We need an open electoral system, same-day registration and open primaries. According to Fortune, Sanders  team may also press the party to change primary rules, and to eliminate the use of superdelegates to determine the party s nominee, a system which many Democratic voters are uncomfortable with.Another item likely to be on Sanders  agenda is a $15 federal minimum wage.With 14 primaries yet to be held, Sanders  told a crowd of supporters at Purdue University on Wednesday that he s  in this campaign to win and become the Democratic nominee. Watch a video clip from the candidate s speech, via YouTube, below:While many pundits and pollsters say that Senator Sanders has little chance of winning the party s nomination, as Fortune reports here, win or lose, if Sanders captures at least 40 percent of pledged delegates during the primary, party rules provide a lot of room for his supporters to define the party s platform.It would not be the first time in history that such a maneuver has taken place.As Fortune reports:In the divisive 1980 Democratic convention, losing candidate and then-Senator Ted Kennedy battled with President Jimmy Carter over major platform points, bringing amendments to the convention floor in a show of defiance. Kennedy was able to help push the Equal Rights Amendment into the party s platform.Few today would say that was a bad thing.Image: 4/29 Indianapolis, IN   by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" House Republicans Just Went After Your Retirement Savings, And They Want To Give It To Wall Street (VIDEO)","On Thursday Republicans in Congress voted to overturn a rule, proposed by the Obama administration, which requires investment advisers to act in the best interest of the person they are advising.The rule was first proposed last year, after a detailed report from Senator Elizabeth Warren revealed that financial advisers are receiving a treasure trove of incentives, kickbacks and non-cash awards for giving out bad financial advice to seniors and people on the brink of retirement.As Addicting Info reported here, Warren s report showed that financial advisers are rewarded with all-expenses-paid, luxury vacations to places like South Africa, the Bahamas and Aruba, as well as golf outings, theater tickets, gift cards and cash prizes, all for steering retirees toward risky, company-owned investment options.While financial advisors personally profit from doling out bad advice, retirees lose more than $17 billion a year because of a loophole that leaves them unprotected under traditional conflict of interest laws.The Obama administration has been working to fix the loophole by including people who seek advice about pension and retirement accounts as people toward whom advisers have a  fiduciary obligation,  under the conflict of interest law.In the meantime, the industry has been fighting hard to keep the rule from taking effect.During a hearing on the proposed rule last year, Senator Elizabeth Warren went head-to-head with the President of Primerica, Peter Schneider, who was brought in to testify against the rule.Watch Senator Warren hammer away at Schneider in the video below, courtesy of Sweet Videos on YouTube:While it s clear from Senator Warren s report and the testimony in the video above that the rule is needed to protect consumers, Republicans proved yet again that they have no desire to serve the interests of the public.Congress introduced and passed H.J.Res.88, which reads as follows:This joint resolution disapproves and nullifies a Department of Labor rule published on April 8, 2016, relating to the definition of the term  fiduciary  and the conflict of interest rule with respect to retirement investment advice.(The rule defines who is a fiduciary with respect to pension and retirement plans. Under current law, a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation that requires the person to provide advice in the sole interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. The rule changes the definition of  investment advice  to treat people who provide investment advice to pension and retirement plans for a fee or other compensation as fiduciaries in a wider array of advice relationships.)As much as Republicans would like him to, there s almost no chance that the President Obama would sign any bill which attacks the proposed fiduciary rule.Still, the Republican-sponsored resolution confirms what we already know about their priorities.While Democrats like President Obama and Elizabeth Warren are fighting to protect the public from Wall Street predators, Republicans are working hard to pass legislation that prevents them from doing just that.There s only one solution. Vote them out in 2016.Photo credit KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Man Caught Peeping On Little Boy In Airport Bathroom – But GOP Worries Ladies Might Have A Penis,"According to Republicans, it is imperative that we  protect women and children  by instituting measures that punish transgender women for having a penis. Some measures would literally place a bounty on transgender people, financially rewarding anyone who spots a penis in the women s restroom. Others would impose heavy fines on transgender people simply for going to the correct bathroom. These measures, which combat alleged threats which have absolutely no basis in reality, have been decried nationwide by thinking individuals who realize that Republicans   the very people imposing these harsh and pathetic laws on the rest of us   are a greater danger to women and children than transgender people could ever be.While Republicans crow about their attempts to save woman and childkind from the evil penises that may or may not be attached to women whose primary goal in a bathroom is to relieve themselves, they ignore certain inconvenient truths   like that children face greater danger from straight men in the men s restroom. On April 22, a traveler at a Seattle airport noticed something horrifying: a man was snapping pictures of his 8-year-old son in the bathroom.According to charging papers, the little boy was using the bathroom when North Carolina resident (yes, he s from the same state that recently shamed the nation by  protecting  children from transgender women with its asinine  bathroom bill ) stood in the neighboring stall and began taking photos over the stall wall. The boy s father spotted the man performing this disgusting act and rushed to stop him. Are you taking pictures of my son?  the man demanded angrily. Joshua Gitlin denied it, but the father saw a photo of his son still on the pervert s cell phone screen. He grabbed Gitlin s phone and slammed the stall closed as others called for police assistance. Gitlin was arrested  at the scene. Police confiscated his phone and other electronic devices with which Gitlin was traveling. He was jailed and charged with voyeurism, but was released Saturday on $100,000 bond.To date, there have been zero instances of transgender people being arrested for bathroom misconduct, but the same can not be said for Republican lawmakers. Unfortunately, transgender people don t write the laws.In November, be sure to head to the polls and vote BLUE so we can end this absurdity and begin focusing on real, important issues   like undoing the damage Republicans are inflicting on our nation.Featured image via Afflictor",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

 Kasich Gets Tripped Up On ‘Born Gay’ Question: ‘I Don’t Know How It All Works’ (VIDEO),"GOP presidential candidate John Kasich would like us to believe that he is the non-bigoted alternative to the likes of extremists like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. However, whenever he opens his mouth on certain issues   specifically those of the LGBTQ variety   we see more and more that nothing could be further from the truth. Case in point   a situation Kasich recently found himself in when he was interviewed at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco by Kelly Bryan. When Bryan asked Kasich if he believed gayness is something folks are born with, the candidate attempted to dodge the question by saying, I m not going to get into the analysis of this or that. Bryan wasn t letting Kasich off that easily, though. He pressed, It s not analysis.Are people born gay? Kasich answered uncomfortably: Probably? I don t know how it all works. Are they? In all probability, they are. Bryan then pressed Kasich on the issue of LGBTQ rights, saying,  Don t we deserve free, regular rights like everyone else  Kasich insisted that LGBTQ people do have  free, regular rights,  when, of course, nothing could be further from the truth on that point: You have free regular rights. We re not denying you any rights. I m not, in Ohio. I m not out to discriminate against you.. I think you should have as good a life as anybody else. If Kasich truly believed this, he would include LGBTQ people in the hate crimes statutes in his state of Ohio, of which he is governor. Further, he would not be supporting a party platform that opposes marriage equality and other rights for LGBTQ people. The only thing Kasich did right during this exchange is to vaguely insinuate that he does not support anti-trans bathroom bills like North Carolina s HB2. On that front, Kasich said: I think we should just try to, like, take a chill pill, relax, and try to get along with one another a little bit better instead of trying to write some law to solve a problem that doesn t frankly exist in big enough numbers to justify more lawmaking. Well, that s something, at least. But then, when asked about marriage equality, Kasich feigned ignorance. Bryan said of the issue as far as the official GOP platform goes: Republicans don t believe in marriage equality. It s your platform. Kasich shot back, Is it? I haven t read that thing lately.  He went on to refer to the Republican Party as  my vehicle [and] not my master. The thing is, though, this interview makes Kasich s positions clear. He is just as anti-gay as his GOP comrades. He just dresses his bigotry up in nicer language.Do not be fooled, people. John Kasich is just as extreme as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz   he just does a better job of hiding it from everyday people.Watch the exchange below, via Raw Story: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas Republicans ACTUALLY Claim Their Awful ‘Bathroom Bill’ Doesn’t Target Transgender People,"There are many important issues in the world: racism, discrimination, poverty, police brutality. Unfortunately, Republicans   issue of the week,  while it touches on one of those in all the worst ways, is something so unimportant, so petty, that Americans are actually paying attention to the plight of transgender individuals for once.All across the nation, the GOP is focused on making sure that no one with a penis enters a women s restroom, even if they identify as a woman. Kansas, for example, literally wants to place a bounty on transgender individuals with its  spot a penis, win a prize bill, which provides financial incentives for people who simply share a bathroom with a transgender individual to childishly scream  Eek, a penis! Republicans in other states   Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, and South Carolina, and others, are attempting to punish transgender people simply for using the correct restroom while North Carolina and Mississippi, for example, have already passed legislation that punish women who happen to have a penis (let s face it: they aren t concerned with trans men) for going pee.Not to be outdone by the other bigots in our country, one Texas city has thrown itself into the fray with a  bathroom bill  that would levy huge fines against transgender people   though they are attempting a new approach to the matter by claiming that it doesn t target transgender individuals.Now, you may be shaking your head at his point and asking,  F*cking SERIOUSLY?  But we assure you it s true.The New Civil Rights Movement reports:Transgender people could face fines of up to $500 for using restrooms according to their gender identity under an ordinance to be considered by the City Council in Rockwall, Texas, on Monday.The ordinance, submitted by Rockwall Mayor Jim Pruitt (photo), would require people to use restrooms according to their  biological sex,  as shown on their birth certificates. It would also bar businesses from allowing trans people to use restrooms according to their gender identity. I just think that it s insanity not to have those protections in place,  Pruitt, a Republican, told WFAA-TV.  These folks aren t transgender that this is targeting. This is targeting folks of the opposite sex that are going into those restrooms under the guise of being transgender and having access.  This is not about sexual orientation or anything of that nature. It is about privacy and the protection of our children. Republicans love to claim that they are protecting women and children with these obviously discriminatory pieces of legislation but the truth is that there isn t a single verifiable instance of a transgender individual so much as harassing a non-transgender person in a bathroom. None. Nada. Zilch. In fact, if they truly wanted to protect women and children in bathrooms, Republican lawmakers would ban Republican lawmakers from entering bathrooms at all.At this point, everyone needs to recognize these bills for what they are. They keep no one safe. They do not prevent crime. They do not protect women or children. They do not make sense when one looks at crime statistics. What they do is perpetuate a culture of hate and fear among the poorly-educated and bigoted in society. They increase the chance that women   cisgender or trans   will be harassed by stupid people who think they don t look feminine enough. They do nothing but promote exactly the sort of mentality that reasonable people have been trying to eliminate every single time conservatives find a new group of people at whom they can level their irrational hatred.But they do accomplish one positive thing: They bring attention to the plight of a group of people who regularly face discrimination, yet whose cries for help are ignored.Watch one example of the sort of nonsense this legislation encourages below:  Featured image via Tumblr",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" President Obama To Senate GOP: Seriously Guys, Do Your F*cking Jobs Already (VIDEO)","President Barack Obama had plenty of obstacles when he took over from the Bush administration. The country faced a recession not seen since the Great Depression and the U.S. was embroiled in the Iraq war which left hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis along with thousands of American soldiers in what has turned out to be one of the most catastrophic American foreign policy blunders in history. One would think that the Republicans would help the young president fix what they had broken. Unfortunately, since Obama took office, the Republicans have done nothing but try to stifle him, even at the cost of shutting down the government.Fast forward more than seven years and we still see an unbroken theme with the Republicans   continued obstructionism that has prevented the government from functioning properly and has kept vital decisions from being made. In the latest round, the Republicans in the United States Senate refused to give Chief Judge Merrick Garland a fair hearing and a vote despite the fact that it s been 45 days since the president nominated him for the United States Supreme Court. In his address, the president made it clear that the U.S. Supreme Court must remain above partisan politics and the senate must do its job.Unfortunately, as they ve done in the previous seven years, the Republicans are unlikely to heed the president s advice and suggestions. In the end, it s the American system and ultimately the American people who suffer from the partisan politics which have become so dysfunctional.Watch the video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl8quI2z0sY]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Disproves The Effectiveness Of Walls As He Climbs Over One Himself (VIDEO),"Since the beginning of Donald Trump s campaign for president, his cornerstone plan has been to build a wall, a great, big, YUGE wall, spanning the entirety of the United States and Mexico border. He s got his fans so excited to be racist that they just can t wait to be the utter isolationists they ve always wanted the country to be.Well, it looks as though Trump just disproved the effectiveness of walls as he was able to easily climb over one on his way to a campaign stop in San Francisco, California. He needed to do so because of all the protesters who had arrived. And because things got very heated, with violent exchanges between the pro and anti-Trump crowds, the real estate mogul had to find an alternative way into the Hyatt Regency where his event was taking place.Of course, he noticed the very tangible hypocrisy in the whole ordeal, but he made a joke of it in very a Trumpian fashion. He told his crowd: That was not the easiest  entrance I ve ever made. It felt like I was crossing the border, actually. Which is both offensive because it s NOTHING like crossing the border, as many have died seeking better lives for themselves and their families, and it was true only in the sense that a border wall is a joke of an idea. Clearly, as Trump has just proven himself, one can find a way over, or even under walls. The centerpiece of his campaign was just flushed down the toilet by the reality star himself.Maybe Trump will now start talking actual policy plans. Ha! Who am I kidding? He has no plans, he just wants to be King of America, because he clearly thinks he deserves it, despite not having any of the proper experience whatsoever..@realDonaldTrump forced to climb over wall to attend his own event in San Francisco. #9News https://t.co/qavo3f9qzH  Nine News LA (@9NewsLA) April 30, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Man Barges Into Women’s Bathroom Because He Saw Short-Haired Woman And Thought She Was Transgender,"Ted Cruz got his wish. After weeks of fear mongering about transgender people and encouraging conservatives to lash out, men and women across the country are being harassed by self-appointed  bathroom cops  who have taken it upon themselves to barge into public bathrooms and demand their victims  prove  they are the biological gender they say they are.In Cruz s home state of Texas, a confused woman began recording her confrontation with a man as he walked into a women s bathroom and told her that her short hair and manner of dress made him suspect she was secretly a man. It s a perfect example of how Republicans have fixed a non-existent problem (transgender people do not use public restrooms to sexually assault young girls), and created a bigger one: An unregulated militia of angry men who now feel it is their duty to go into public restrooms and inspect people s anatomy.Jessica Rush is not transgender, but she has a short  fauxhawk  hairstyle and dared to wear a t-shirt and shorts when she went in to use the women s restroom at Baylor Medical Center in Frisco. Hot on her trail was an unidentified man who came into the bathroom with her and asked if she was a man. When I saw you enter I thought you was  the man says. A boy?  Rush offers. Yeah, it was kind of confusing.  Certainly she can see why.  You dress like a man,  he says several times as he walks away.Rush was understandably flabbergasted by the exchange. Later, she said she approached the man to ask why he felt compelled to approach her. He said his mother was using that bathroom. Somewhere on the campaign trail, Ted Cruz just nodded in approval. His fear mongering is working.Currently the issue of the right for the transgender community to use the bathroom of their choice has engulfed several southern states (with a few more, including Texas, on the way). The conservative argument is that trans people are little more than sexual predators dressing as women in order to gain access to young women. This has been shown both by scientific research and by example to be utter nonsense.Despite it s fictional roots, North Carolina s Republican governor has chosen it to be his hill to die on. In the wake of massive boycotts to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and incalculable national humiliation, Governor Pat McCrory says he is standing firm and keeping his discriminatory bathroom bill on the books. Sen. Ted Cruz, desperate to find a wedge issue to separate him from Republican front-runner Donald Trump, has made bashing trans people the central plank in his platform.And while most people are rightfully outraged by this latest stab at discrimination, the talking points are clearly working with some people. Many Americans who may never have even thought about the non-issue, have become consumed with fear that their loved ones will be attacked in a bathroom stall. It s hardly surprising, then, that some, like this man, have taken it upon themselves to interrogate people trying to use the bathroom. It s the inevitable conclusion to this level of transphobia.Watch the incident below: Video Apr 28, 2 13 35 PM from Voice Media Group on Vimeo.Featured image via Vimeo screengrab",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Maher Insults Trump’s Supposed Masculinity And It Is GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump wants everyone to believe that he is this hyper-masculine ladies man that every guy on the planet should strive to emulate. However, as Real Time host Bill Maher points out, nothing could be further from the truth. Trump is actually more like a whiny brat than he is like anyone s version of a real man.Maher started out by asking the guests on his show how anyone could think Trump is masculine: Tell me what is masculine about Donald Trump. I don t see anything masculine about this guy   the most thin-skinned erratic non-logical whiny person in the world. That s the  old woman  stereotype. But I don t see what is so masculine about him. Then, the conversation turned to the  woman card  insults that were directed at Hillary Clinton, and one of Maher s guests, Kelly Conway, insisted that the comment was Trump putting Clinton  on notice  that she better fight for the votes from the ladies, saying: Hillary Clinton s having a hard time getting these young women in the Democratic primaries. They re voting for Bernie Sanders, so why is that? If it were just as simple as,  I m pro-choice  or  I m for pay inequality  she d be running away with it, Bill, she would be the nominee. Then again, though, Conway is a Ted Cruz supporter, so she clearly doesn t know much about being pro-women s rights, despite being a woman herself.After that ridiculous moment, Rob Reiner, who was also on Maher s panel, shut Conway down, saying: So she s not just playing the  woman card.' Indeed, she is not. She is doing well because she is qualified. Reiner later pointed out the obvious and gave Trump an epic beatdown, when he said that everything that comes out of his mouth is moronic to the Nth degree. Maher reminded Reiner that moronic or not, Trump s idiocy is authentic. Reiner replied, He is authentically moronic, yes. Yes, Trump is a moron. Hopefully, there are enough people out there who recognize this as fact and not merely opinion to keep that fool from becoming the next president of the United States.https://youtu.be/jcGyI_lRJ2oFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sanders Campaign Withdraws Lawsuit Against DNC After Investigation Shows No Theft Of Voter Data,"You might remember a few months ago, the Bernie Sanders campaign filed a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee for cutting off access to their own campaign data stored on the servers at DNC headquarters. The cut off came from when a few Sanders staffers found they could access protected, private information of the Hillary Clinton campaign, which was stored on the same servers.The DNC came out quickly and said that the Sanders staffers intentionally exploited software errors to gain access to the Clinton team s proprietary data. Sanders fired back immediately that the error has been a recurring one, and his campaign had attempted to make it known to the DNC that this was happening before, with no success in getting it resolved.DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that the extreme move in cutting off access to the Sanders Campaign of even their own data was the only way to protect the other data on the servers. Wasserman Schultz also said that the Sanders campaign  not only viewed it but exported and downloaded it. Fast forward a few months and an independent investigation later, and it turns out that the DNC gave us the wrong story.After the independent investigation concluded, it was confirmed that the DNC had made assertions about what happened which were not supported by evidence and that the serious level of tampering everyone was led to believe happened did not occur.According to the Sanders campaign statement, the breach did not extend beyond 3 staffers and their manager. They had access for approximately one hour to Clinton campaign scoring models but not to any of the Clinton campaign s proprietary voter data, which was at the heart of initial reports.The Sanders campaign then released a statement saying the original claims by the DNC were  wholly inaccurate  and that the campaign never stole any voter data.The settlement of this lawsuit is a positive thing. However, the problems that led up to it have not been resolved.Over the past several months, more and more scrutiny and criticism have been being visited upon the DNC s leadership, as well as Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz. The data breach issue was an ongoing problem that wasn t resolved in a timely manner, the circumstances were misreported by the DNC and the action they took regarding the security loophole were called by many an overreach.Add on top of this the moves by DNC leadership to open the floodgates for corporate money within the party, as well as the DNC chairwoman s joining with Republicans to attack Elizabeth Warren s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and there are many calling for the DNC to find new leadership.It remains to be seen if Wasserman Schultz will keep her seat as a Congresswoman in, due to an unexpected primary challenge she is now facing. However, regardless of if she wins or loses, the DNC s own leadership does need to hold itself to a higher standard of accountability   especially regarding its leadership   for the good of both party unity and taking back Congress this fall.Featured image via wikicommons",News,"April 30, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Racist Trump Fan Arrested By FBI For Threat On Obama’s Life, Had Bombs","A racist Donald Trump fan has been arrested by the FBI after he made threats to kill President Obama. The authorities also found that he had a cache of pipe bombs on his property when they raided his home in Oregon.John Martin Roos, a 61-year-old from Oregon, has been charged with communication of a threat in interstate commerce, and additional charges are likely forthcoming. Roos first came onto the federal government s radar after a  concerned citizen  brought Roos  Facebook and Twitter postings to the FBI s attention in February, according to an affidavit from Special Agent Jeffrey Gray.Roos also had a series of Facebook and Twitter posts with racist rants targeting the President. Obama you goat fffing fudgepacker, the refugees are men of fighting age. Black lives matter! Sure we need someone to pick cotton and wash cars. Paris, burn diseased muslim neighborhoods to the ground and start over with human beings. Obama you are on a hit list,  he wrote in a post that appears to have been removed.He is just the latest in a line of people, ranging from the truly dangerous to just out and out cranks, that have been apprehended since Obama s inauguration in 2009 for threats towards the first black president.His postings online definitely took cues from the targets of Donald Trump s ire. The Huffington Post reported that Roos used his online postings to attack  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, singer Beyonce, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and reporter Michelle Fields.  Roos also had praise for those who have supported Trump or been praised by the reality TV star:He praised Ann Coulter and Stacey Dash, and posted several links to posts on Breitbart.com.Coulter has identified herself as a Trump supporter, while on Fox News, Dash has defended and promoted Trump.Breitbart.com has been the most pro-Trump of the conservative media outlets, and an insider has actually alleged that Trump has been paying the site for favorable coverage.Featured image via Facebook",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" In RARE Case Of Factual Reporting, Fox Shows How Cruz Is Too Stupid To Run For President (VIDEO)","For a party so terribly interested in governing this country, Republicans sure do lack the basic knowledge about how governing actually works. One of the latest examples of this is Ted Cruz and his choice to pick a vice presidential running mate at this stage in the process. In an incredibly rare case of factual reporting, Fox News explained in detail exactly why Cruz completely screwed up by doing this in the video below.Cruz made a huge deal out of the fact he picked a VP. He had a press conference just to announce it. Signs were made, people were cheering and then it turned out to be   Carly Fiorina? Her low popularity makes her a strange choice, but when you re Ted Cruz it s very likely you can t get a lot of the more popular people to hang out with you.Unpopularity aside, Cruz s pick of a VP is actually pretty ignorant for another reason   and this has nothing to do with Carly the Wicked Stepmother. There s virtually no chance that Ted Cruz will get the nomination outright. He would come up about 100 delegates short, even if he won every single one of them from here on out. This means that if Trump doesn t win outright (which he still can), the only hope Cruz has is a contested convention.That s where things completely go wrong for Cruz. Convention rules clearly state that a nominee cannot pick their own VP in a contested convention. The VP pick is up to the delegates, and if one were to make an educated guess, Carly Fiorina would NOT make the cut.Carly Fiorina s popularity is non-existent. Her entire campaign only lasted for two states, and then she was out. Convention delegates are extremely unlikely to pick a VP who they feel would be damaging to the party s chances of winning in November. So, this begs the question, did Ted even bother to read up on the rules of how you run a campaign for the presidency? Imagine his embarrassment after all the hoopla surrounding his pick, only to have her booted at the RNC.Watch Fox News explain how Ted Cruz has no clue how running for president works:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" When A Journalist Covers Trump, They Get Death Threats From White Supremacists Like This (TWEETS)","Journalist Julia Ioffe did a profile of Donald Trump s wife, Melania, for GQ magazine. The story was not an attack, but rather did what so much journalism does in an election year   fill in the picture of the contenders and their families.But unlike past years, candidate Donald Trump has cultivated an extremely anti-Semitic group of supporters, who have taken pages right out of the Nazi playbook in order to attack those they see as the enemy. Unluckily for Ioffe, her story got on their radar, and they aimed a torrent of abuse in her direction, with violent anti-Semitic rhetoric and threats.On Thursday, Ioffe answered a phone call from an anonymous caller who played a Hitler speech. She received another call from  Overnight Caskets . On Twitter, users posted photos of her face superimposed on a mug shot from Auschwitz. The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist site, attacked Ioffe in a blogpost titled:  Empress Melania Attacked by Filthy Russian Kike Julia Ioffe in GQ! It s unsettling,  she said on Thursday night.  I started the day off having a sense of humor about it but by the end of the day, after a few phone calls like this, with people playing Hitler speeches, and the imagery, and people telling me my face would look good on a lampshade, it s hard to laugh. Many of the messages Ioffe received on Twitter were of the same bigoted variety. Some showed the writer, with images of yellow stars saying  Jew  sown on to her chest, echoing the method in which concentration camp prisoners were labeled by the Nazi regime before their mass execution.From my inbox.

Trump refused to disavow the support of a former KKK Grand Wizard during a CNN interview, and the candidate himself has reposted the tweets of anti-semites and racists dozens of times since becoming the frontrunner of the Republican Party.And of course, Trump himself has called Mexicans rapists, called for a ban on Muslim immigration and a national registry of Muslim residents, attacked Black Lives Matter, and encouraged his supporters to beat up protesters at his rallies.This, and worse, is what happens.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Out NRA: President Obama Is Coming For You,"Where Congress isn t acting on gun reform, President Obama is doing whatever he can. He knows that the ever-present epidemic of gun violence in the United States isn t going to go away on its own, and it s not going to go away by adding more and more guns to the mix either. Common sense actions need to be taken, and that s exactly what the president is offering   NRA be damned.The president wrote Friday in a Facebook post: Today, I want to update you on some important progress we ve made to protect our communities from gun violence. As I said in January, these commonsense steps are not going to prevent every tragedy, but what if they prevented even one? We should be doing everything we can to save lives and spare families the pain and unimaginable loss too many Americans have endured.First, we ve jumpstarted the development of smart gun technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally. As long as we ve got the technology to prevent a criminal from stealing and using your smartphone, then we should be able to prevent the wrong person from pulling a trigger on a gun. So, my Administration released a plan today to expedite the development of smart gun technology, including by identifying the requirements that smart guns would have to meet in order for law enforcement to purchase and use them effectively   and keep themselves and the public safer in the process.Second, we re doing more to make sure that those who are already prohibited from obtaining a firearm can t get their hands on one. Today, we re announcing a rule to ensure that federal mental health records about individuals prohibited from buying a gun are reported to the background check system.Third, the White House will convene state and local elected officials from all 50 states in May to discuss their efforts to prevent gun violence through legislative and executive actions. The goal is to figure out what works on the ground when it comes to keeping our communities safe, and then share those practices.As long as I m your president, I will do everything in my power to make our communities safer and keep guns out of the wrong hands. That includes calling on Congress to pass the kinds of commonsense reforms supported by the vast majority of the American people.Making progress on these issues is how we honor the lives that have been lost by gun violence, and it s how we leave behind a stronger, more secure nation for our children. The initiative President Obama announced was just put on the White House blog in great detail, which can be found HERE.The president laid out his hope for smart guns back in January as well: Of course, though, the NRA is already fear-baiting their followers and getting people to be afraid of any changes that my take place..@POTUS' new #guncontrol push is ""alarming cops who say they don t want to be guinea pigs."" https://t.co/Auoo6o77wu #2A  NRA (@NRA) April 28, 2016And while the police have every right to be apprehensive, it s important to remember that something, anything, needs to be done to help push forth the effort for a safer United States. Promoting safer guns is an idea that should be embraced by all, and you d think any group, like the NRA, who says they re for  responsible gun ownership  would embrace an idea that made gun ownership more responsible.Within the same Politico article that the NRA tweeted out, it states: [Smart gun technology] wouldn t prevent most mass shootings, gun crimes or suicides   currently the biggest driver of gun deaths. However, they could cut down on the roughly 500 deaths each year from accidental shootings, especially by kids. Advocates also point to findings that most youth suicides are committed with a parents  weapon, and instances where officers  own guns are stolen in a scuffle and used to shoot them cause about 1 in 10 police deaths. It s important to note that this technology probably could have happened a long time ago had it not been for possible political backlash. The gun lobby currently owns several members of Congress, which is truly the biggest obstacle to getting common sense gun reform passed.What President Obama has put forth isn t an attack on guns, it s not an attack on gun owners, and it s not going to limit any rights of those who do and should be able to own guns. What it does is put forth measures to make guns safer, less accessible to those who shouldn t have them, and start a national conversation.The president is taking on the NRA and doesn t really care what they have to say, because all they care about is profit for their gun manufacturer buddies. Something needs to happen, and it needs to happen sooner rather than later.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 It Finally Happened: KKK Grand Imperial Wizard Endorses Donald Trump,"All the months of speculation that the modern day KKK does indeed endorse Donald Trump can be confirmed as the terrorist organization s Rebel Brigade Knights Grand Imperial Wizard endorses the GOP frontrunner on live national television.When asked by reporter Chris Thomas who would be the best one for the job of President of the United States, the Wizard answered: I think Donald Trump would be best for the job. The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes in, we believe in. We want our country to be safe. Under the guise of now being a  political  group, the word  safe  has now become synonymous with xenophobia, Islamophobia, racism and bigotry   all tenets, still, of the KKK, no matter how they want to word it.And they re pretty much endorsing Donald Trump.To make it even better, the Klan has (apparently) had success in recruiting since President Obama has been in office   and it has nothing to do with being black, so says the Grand Wizard.  It s merely a difference in politics. Totally.And if that wasn t strange (and stupid) enough, the Grand Wizard also admitted should Trump lose the nomination, they would back Kasich, not Cruz, for President. Why? Because Ted Cruz wasn t born on American soil. In their eyes, he s a foreigner who isn t fit to be president, even though they share a lot of the same views.Again, this is purely political and absolutely nothing to do with being a racist, xenophobic bigot.So now that there seems to be plurality of KKK members rushing to embrace Trump, is to fair to say he s the candidate for racist America?Let s see how long it takes him to disavow this endorsement. It took Clinton one day to disavow the phony Koch  endorsement.  If it s any indication, his rejection of David Duke took two weeks and much consideration.I wonder how much consideration this will take.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Burns Trump For Attacking Hillary For Being A Woman,"If Trump thought he could attack Hillary Clinton for being a woman without being smacked down by Elizabeth Warren for it, he was wrong.Earlier this week, the Republican frontrunner capped off his sweeping victory in several states on Tuesday by accusing the Democratic frontrunner of  playing the woman card  and that her gender is the only thing she s got going for he in this election. If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don t think she d get five percent of the vote,  Trump declared.  The only thing she s got going is the women s card, and the beautiful thing is, women don t like her, okay, and look how well I did with women tonight. Here s a video of his remarks via YouTube.Despite his claim, a recent Gallop poll shows that 70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Trump compared to 28 percent who somehow hold a favorable view.Count Senator Elizabeth Warren as part of the 70 percent.During an interview with the Boston Globe on Thursday, the popular Senator from Massachusetts hammered Trump for doing  what weak men do. Donald Trump clearly feels threatened by Secretary Clinton s qualifications to be president so he s attacking Hillary Clinton for being a woman,  Warren said.  That s what weak men do. It is an old story, and I don t think the American voters will fall for it. We need someone in the White House who isn t afraid to fight for equal rights for women,  Warren continued.  That person is not Donald Trump. Warren went on to express disappointment that the Globe didn t ask her if she thinks Trump is a sexist and she provided an answer anyway and took a shot at Trump s hair in the process. That s like asking if he has bad hair. He wears the sexism out front for everyone to see. This is nothing compared to the shellacking she gave Ted Cruz, however. Earlier this month, Ted Crus begged for money in an email by complaining about the  sacrifices  he has made to run for president. Boo hoo,  Warren wrote on Facebook.  He whined about facing constant attacks, nonexistent family time, his limited health and sleep, and having no personal time. Are you kidding me? We re supposed to pity him because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?! After listing the sacrifices the American people make every day, she suggested Cruz start doing his job to help them. Senator Cruz   you chose to run for President. Working people don t get a choice. Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your  significant sacrifices    and more time trying to do something about theirs. It s too bad Warren didn t run for president this year. It would have been amazing to watch her crush these two Republican men day after day throughout the campaign.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Fox News ‘Terror Analyst’ Pleads Guilty To Major Fraud, Faces 40 Years In Prison","Fox News has long since stood by a slogan that says  We Report, You Decide  and it seems they should tag on  if what we are telling you is actually real or not.  Time and time again Fox News has been caught in lies, but using a  CIA Analyst  who was never actually an analyst may take the cake.Wayne Simmons, who has appeared unpaid on Fox News since 2002, is a fraud and now he s now facing up to 40 years in prison for pretending to be a CIA Analyst, a lie that got him actual work with the United States government. The Washington Post stated: According to federal prosecutors, his claims of a 27-year career with the CIA were lies, and it was only by repeating such falsehoods that Simmons was able to briefly get actual security clearances and real government contracting work in more recent years. Well, the lies caught up with him, and last October Simmons was arrested and charged  with making false statements, major fraud against the United States and wired fraud. If you want to check out some of Simmons  time as a  Terror Analyst  for Fox News, you can find it here:According to Dana Boente, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia: His fraud cost the government money, could have put American lives at risk, and was an insult to the real men and women of the intelligence community who provide tireless service to this country. Now, Simmons has pleaded guilty to his charges. According to the Washington Post: Wayne Simmons, 62, pleaded guilty to major fraud against the United States, wire fraud and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He acknowledged that he made more than $78,000 from actual government contracting work he got in part because of his claim that he had worked for the CIA.Importantly, though, Simmons s written agreement with prosecutors does not include language in which he says outright that he lied about his clandestine past. He conceded only that the government  would prove at trial  that he never worked for the CIA. With Simmons saying: I believed then and I believe now that my skill sets could be used in Afghanistan to fight the global war on terror. Sure you did, buddy. You re a regular Captain America.Simmons  sentencing is currently set for July 15.I know it s asking a lot for Fox News to maybe do a background check on their supposed  analysts,  but for all our sakes, it would be nice. We should all  decide  Fox News is full of sh*t.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This DA Just Called B.S. On Anti-Trans Republicans: ‘Most Predators Are Straight Men’ (VIDEO),"As the GOP s fight to control which bathrooms transgender people can and can t use continues, one of their main talking points has been how  dangerous  it is for trans individuals to be allowed to use the same restrooms as women and children.Despite how false that argument is (there have literally been NO instances where a transgender person has assaulted someone while using the restroom that matched their gender identity), this misleading stance actually sweeps an extremely important issue under the rug   who the majority of sex offenders really are.Chad Butler, the District Attorney of Nashville, Tennessee, has prosecuted hundreds of sex crimes and has found the recent anti-trans  bathroom laws  in states like North Carolina extremely frustrating. In speaking to WSMV Channel 4, Butler revealed that throughout the entire length of his long career, he has never prosecuted a case against a trans individual. Not one. So who are the real threats? Butler says that sexual predators are overwhelmingly  heterosexual men. As long as I ve been doing this job and the hundreds of cases I ve reviewed, I ve never once had a transgender person come across my desk as an offender. Butler believes that the ongoing arguments over transgender people s bathroom rights actually distract the public from real dangers. Specializing in crimes against children, Butler revealed that although these discriminatory anti-trans laws are supposedly meant to protect children, they don t. The real threat, he says, are the people the children come in contact with every day. Butler said: A majority of my cases are fathers, stepfathers, uncles, Boy Scout leaders, coaches, youth ministers, preachers. People that are already close to the family that the family trusts. Butler called the claim that trans people are a threat to children statistically unfounded and off base.  These accusations only encourage parents to be weary of the wrong people. It is actually very frustrating because it sort of takes the dialogue and the conversation away from where it should be. What Butler believes WILL actually keep children safe, is open discussions about consent and sexual abuse at an early age. Butler says that one of the most important things parents can do is educate their children, and believe them if they come forward because more times than not, children are molested by someone close to the family. A child is more likely to be sexually assaulted in their own bathroom than a public restroom by a stranger.

 California Trump Rally Leads To Violence Between Thousands Of Protestors And Supporters (VIDEO),"One of the most tragic aspects of Donald Trump s candidacy (and there have been lots of  tragic aspects) is that he s managed to do something no one thought to be possible for a candidate running for president in 21st Century America: He s managed to not only normalize racism, but violence as well. There have been so many instances of violence that they ve become normalized. In other words, we ve come to expect violence, and even more alarmingly, we ve also come to accept the violence. However, it s important to fight this normalization and continue to report on the absurdity that is Donald Trump.That absurdity was on display outside a Trump rally in California on Thursday as supporters clashed with protestors. Many of the anti-Trump protestors held Mexican and American flags and were outraged at Trump s rhetoric. About 20 protesters out of hundreds were arrested outside of the rally, a Trump supporter was beaten, and property was damaged including a police vehicle.Watch video here:Since he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination, Trump has made a series of inflammatory remarks about Mexicans, calling some of the immigrants rapists and murderers. He continuously talks about building a wall to prevent Mexican immigrants from coming into the country. His rhetoric has created a divisive atmosphere that has bred racism and violence.The bottom line is that Trump has created an environment that is tearing the country apart rather than working for unity. If his candidacy is any indication of what his presidency will be like, we are all in deep trouble as a society. He is normalizing the toxicity of violence and racism and should he be elected, America will become a very dangerous place for a lot of people.Featured image via video screenshot.

 Watch Allison Janney Take Over For Josh Earnest The Only Way She Knows How – As CJ Cregg (VIDEO),"After The West Wing wrapped up its final season in 2006, many of us were left with a gaping hole in our soul watching a part of our lives cease to exist any longer. The brilliance of the show between the writing, directing and acting is one that seldom happens, and can seldom be recreated.However, what it can be, is reprised. Which is what just happened as actress Allison Janney took to the White House press podium to reprise her role as Claudia Jean  CJ  Cregg. For six seasons Janney played the beloved role of Press Secretary for the President Bartlet administration, and then played the White House Chief of Staff.Janney came to the podium telling everyone that  Josh is out today,  and that the president is still preparing his jokes for the Correspondents  Dinner. That s when real-life Press Secretary Josh Earnest makes an appearance and seems surprised to see Janney there.Clearly, it was a set-up that was brilliantly pulled off, and was made so that Janney could get her broader message across which is the dangers of opioid abuse. She came to the White House alongside television heavyweight Chuck Lorre, creator of Janney s show  Mom,  to discuss opioid abuse and recovery.According to ABC News: The White House held an event today honoring 10  White House Champions of Change  who help fight the epidemic in their local communities. After Janney was done speaking, a reporter asked if he could ask her a question. She politely said  sure.  Then the reporter asked if she knew which Democrat President Bartlet is supporting for the election. To which Janney quickly quipped back,  I think you know the answer to that. After all, Janney s character CJ has been said to have been modeled after former Clinton Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers. So, one can only assume who she was talking about in her answer to the reporter s question.All in all, it was great to see CJ Cregg back in action!Watch here:.@AllisonBJanneyAKA CJ CreggAKA Bonnie on @MomCBSdrops by the White House press briefing. https://t.co/TK4NJ7TEyM  The White House (@WhiteHouse) April 29, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Millennial And Latino Disgust With Republicans Reaches All Time Highs (POLL),"Say what you want about the GOP but they really don t like half-measures. In the span of just 4 years, they managed to not just alienate themselves from much of their base, they also managed to piss off the two fastest growing voter demographics in the country: Millennials and Latinos.According to polling done by the Pew Research Center, 30 percent of Latinos view Republicans favorably which is surprisingly high considering just how ugly Donald Trump has been. But it s a little less surprising that the unfavorable percentage is at 61. By comparison, the black community has a favorable/unfavorable opinion of 15 percent for and 78 percent against.Just to be clear, the black community has been crucial in several states to electing Democrats. If, or more likely, when, the Latino vote reaches the same levels in terms of turnout and anti-Republican sentiment as the black community, states like Texas and Arizona will turn blue and stay that way. On the other hand, Latinos view the Democratic Party 56 percent for and 36 percent against. Expect those numbers to rise as more Latinos take office with a  D  next to their name.The picture is just as grim for Republicans among Millennials. A whole whopping 35 percent have a favorable view of the GOP and 58 percent of them will pass, thank you very much. The Millennials, in case you didn t notice, recently passed the Baby Boomers in size as the Boomers die off from old age. Sure, they don t vote as often as the Boomers, but they will and soon. That makes them the about-to-be most powerful bloc of voters and they re no fan of Republicans.You might have been thinking that Millennials obviously hate the Democrats just as much. Buuuuuuut .you would be wrong. In fact, of all the generations, Millennials are the only ones the Democrats are above water with: 52 percent favorable versus 41 percent unfavorable. And since over the next 10-20 years, Millennials are going to be taking over the party that DOESN T spew nonstop racism, sexism and anti-gay bigotry, how do you suppose elections are going to go? To the left or to the right?Dear Republicans: Game OverThe only way for the GOP to survive is to attract, Millennials, Latinos and the black community. But the only way to do that is to reject the culture war nonsense that pushed all those groups away in the first place. On top of that, they would also have to reject the constant attacks on the poor and sucking up to the rich. That would drive away both parts of Republican base: The rich and the the terminally stupid. In other words, either Republicans reject everything that the Republican Party has stood for for the last 60 years, or (not so) slowly wither away.What a lovely time to be a liberal.Oh, and just as an afterthought, in case you thought old white people would come to the rescue, they hate Republicans even MORE than Millennials.

 Lawrence O’Donnell Goes Off On MSNBC For (Once Again) Cutting His Show For A Trump Rally Live Feed,"Iconic liberal news anchor Lawrence O Donnell is clearly not happy   and he has every right to be.Yet again, his  Lean Forward  bosses at MSNBC opted to cut his show so that they could run a live feed of a Donald Trump stump speech. It wasn t  news.  It wasn t even  new.  It was just Donald Trump, up at the podium, saying the kind of disgusting things he always says. MSNBC gave over their network for that. MSNBC silenced one of their star anchors for that.Needless to say, viewers were furious. So too was O Donnell.Because the anchor is in many ways the face of his or her program, many of MSNBC s disgruntled fans took out their frustrating on O Donnell. On Twitter, his account was innundated with negative responses. Many couldn t believe they were watching MSNBC hand over free advertising to Trump. Many just wanted to know why O Donnell wasn t on like they had hoped.Rather than toe the network line and give a weak defense of why Trump just had to be given the air time, O Donnell threw the script away and began sympathizing with his fans. MSNBC screwed up. They have repeatedly screwed up during this election. They need to own this..@Patta47cake @cp2austin I tried to make it clear that wasn t my decision.  Lawrence O Donnell (@Lawrence) April 29, 2016 .@Kcurran222 I don t like it.  Lawrence O Donnell (@Lawrence) April 29, 2016.@JoeLeydon @Patta47cake @cp2austin I understand. Completely.  Lawrence O Donnell (@Lawrence) April 29, 2016In an act of defiance (or maybe a hope that maybe his bosses might see reason), O Donnell also began tweeting media critics who have repeatedly slammed networks for their unabashed love affair with Trump( s ratings).Media: We're not enabling Donald BREAKING NEWS: Donald Trump giving same stump speech he's been giving for months pic.twitter.com/nlgGcJag1Y  Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) April 29, 2016This truly may be unprecedented in the TV era: One candidate, and one candidate only, given massive free air time by media giants.  Joe Adalian (@TVMoJoe) April 29, 2016Like other anchors, O Donnell is rightfully fed up with allowing the tail to wag the dog. Rather than report the news, MSNBC has settled on chasing Trump from campaign event to campaign event in the hopes that viewers will tune in. It s given the Republican candidate unprecedented amounts of free air time. He doesn t even have to spend money on advertising because huge networks give it away for free.And instead of trying to rein in the absurd status quo, MSNBC has shown signs that it will only get worse. Already the network tossed one of their fiercest liberal hosts, Melissa Harris-Perry, because they needed more time for Trump live feeds. They ve recently begun hinting that they will be expanding their conservative morning show, Morning Joe, in an effort to entice both Trump and his fans to check out the network. Host Joe Scarborough is a well known Trump fan making the relationship between the Republican candidate and the network even more inexcusable.Did the media  create  Donald Trump? The answer is complicated. Certainly, Trump s racist and sexist fans were already around, just waiting for a candidate to say all the right things to them. But there can be no question that the media has enabled Trump. Every phone interview. Every campaign rally. Every panel discussion about Trump s  viability  makes Trump s star rise. There is no such thing as bad publicity, and nobody gets publicity   good and bad   like Trump.Kudos to O Donnell for taking a stand against this betrayal of integrity.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Biography Reveals He Had ‘Difficulty Achieving and Maintaining an Erection’,"A little-noticed detail in the 1993 biography Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump has just resurfaced and come back to haunt him   big time.No one gave it much thought when Trump s then-wife, Ivana Trump, revealed to her friends that despite being amazing at erecting skyscrapers, the business mogul struggled in the bedroom department. Thanks to an initiative by Politico to bring five of Trump s biographers together to discuss the Republican party s frontrunner, this little detail came back to life. Politico reported what the different biographers have revealed, with Ivana s comments coming from Harry Hurt III: Want to know where Trump inherited his entrepreneurial bent? Gwenda Blair traces it to his grandfather, who ran a series of restaurants in the Klondike that featured some of the best food in town, as well as private areas where  sporting ladies  could  entertain  miners. Who was really doing the deals that made Trump famous? Wayne Barrett will tell you the only signature that really mattered on a contract belonged to Trump s father, Fred. What broke up Trump s first marriage? Harry Hurt III writes that Ivana  confided to female friends that Donald had difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection. That personal detail managed to fly under the radar and actually make it into the published book because it was overshadowed by Ivana s claim that Trump attacked and raped her during their marriage. Hurt was the first reporter to break that news, and the only reason that his publisher was able to avoid a lawsuit was because Trump was too dumb for his own good. Hurt said: Prior to the publication of my book, he and his lawyer, Jay Goldberg, came to scream at the folks at Norton, mainly about Ivana s divorce deposition  And finally Donald got so frustrated, he jumped up and he pulls a tape recorder out of his coat pocket. He said,  I ve been recording all this,  and our little lawyer looked at him, and Goldberg just turned like this napkin, white.  You ve been recording this and you didn t tell us? That s not right.  And I m going,  Yeah. They walked out and I said,  He can t sue us now. He s not going to sue us because they just shot themselves in the foot. Now of course, making fun of someone s issues in the bedroom is no laughing matter, but the fact that it s Trump   a man who forced millions of people to watch him talk about how big his d*ck was during a GOP debate   is slightly humorous. It merely validates what we ve all known   Trump s brash, vulgar behavior is just a cover-up for some deep-seated insecurity.Featured image via Ralph Freso / Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Colbert Roasts Fiorina’s Creepy Singing: ‘It’s Like Disney Gave The Wicked Stepmother Her Own Song’ (VIDEO),"In case you haven t heard yet, creepy GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz has somehow decided that math doesn t matter and that he will win the Republican Party s nomination for president anyway. To that end, he has picked an equally creepy running mate in failed candidate Carly Fiorina. It seems that Fiorina wanted to make sure that she was just as creepy as Cruz, so during her speech when her status as running mate was announced, she chose to, for some bizarre reason, start singing to the crowd.It was seriously the worst thing ever for those listening, and the best thing ever for late night comedians. Late Show host Stephen Colbert wasted absolutely no time in ripping Fiorina for that ridiculous display. First, Colbert roasted Cruz himself for thinking he actually needed a running mate, since it s clear he won t be winning. The host began: That is bold. After Tuesday s huge wins by Clinton and Trump, Bernie Sanders saw the writing on the wall and laid off hundreds of staffers. Meanwhile, Ted Cruz saw the writing and covered it up with a  hang in there, baby  poster. He then pivoted to Fiorina, who he said was clearly honored to accept this important job that will never exist.  After that, things got really good. Colbert ran tape of Fiorina s creepy singing about Ted Cruz s daughters. The whole thing was just downright weird. Colbert said of Fiorina s bizarre and creepy attempt at spontaneous singing: It s like Disney gave the wicked stepmother her own song. Colbert is right, of course. Carly Fiorina doesn t need to be singing to anyone, much less two little girls who are probably just as creeped out by her as America is by their own father. But hey, at least it s good for a joke or two. Hopefully both Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina disappear into the dustins of history where they belong when this primary is finally over.Watch Colbert s brilliance below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Flip Out Over Law That Would Require Women To Register For The Draft,"Far too many people don t understand the awesome simplicity of the Republican war on women. They try to analyze the underlying causes; blame some on religion, some on chauvinism. Overthinking is a strictly Democratic problem. To the good ol  white boys club of the GOP, women are just inferior creatures in need of nurturing: weak and restrained; helpless at best. Yeah, sadly it really is just that simple to figure out why their war exists. They have no respect for their mothers. Ouch   OK, that was harsh. Republicans, in general, find women to be beneath them. Republican women depend on their men because their fathers told them to, just like their mothers told them to just pull the Republican lever and vote the straight ticket.Naturally when the time came to review the guidelines for selective service, Republicans went bonkers. It seems women have always been exempted from the draft because they weren t allowed to be in combat roles and the draft is for extreme-case national emergencies where combat would be likely. Things have changed. Women are now allowed in not some but ALL combat roles if they can pass the training the same as a man. Two women made national headlines as the first members of the Army Rangers earlier this year, they probably would have gladly signed up at 18 for the draft we haven t used since we stopped sending kids off to be slaughtered in Vietnam in 1973.Republicans still can t reconcile. Rep Duncan Hunter (R-CA) told The Hill: The draft is there to get more people to rip the enemy s throats out. I don t want to see my daughters put in a place where they have to get drafted. You mean you wouldn t want to see your daughters treated as equals among their peers. You wouldn t want to witness how incredibly strong any human being can be when put into extraordinary circumstances. You want them at home, right next to your sons, watching the horrors of war turned into a game show on Fox News. It s difficult as a father to imagine your daughters trotting off to war. It s just as difficult to imagine my son going. Hunter was right. The draft is there for extreme situations to get more people to rip the enemy s throat out. Do we just keep searching through the men and eliminate half the population s prospective ability to do just that? I don t know if these old men have been paying attention, but women aren t the delicate flowers they once were in the stone age when they were kids.The amendment passed the Armed Services Committee and moves forward to the house floor where a bunch more men will debate how awful it would be for their daughters to fight for their country and their freedom while they happily send the sons of the poor and working class and anyone who commits a misdemeanor who has a penis. There are a ton of exemptions available for people to be excluded from the draft, and certainly motherhood would be one. Don t worry, Republicans, there won t be moms pushing strollers across battlefields just yet.Featured image from Daniel Bendji/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Donald Trump Promotes Shooting Muslims With Bullets Dipped In Pig’s Blood, Gets An Ovation (VIDEO)","During a rally in California, GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump praised a bogus historical incident where Muslims were shot by bullets dipped in pig s blood   to rapturous applause.It appears that neither Donald Trump, nor the crowd in Costa Mesa, are aware that there is no evidence this historical incident actually happened. Given the campaign s focus on rhetoric over fact to date, t s unlikely anyone would care either. But for the record, Trump was praising the vile actions of U.S. General John Joseph Pershing. The story goes that the General cracked down on Islamic terrorism in the early 20th century with a single act of terror of his own. As Trump delights in telling the crowd, reciting it as if historical fact, the General dipped bullets in pigs blood, then shot 49 Muslims   letting the 50th off to act as a cautionary tale.Trump s point? That only the most brutal measures will make America safe from Islamic terrorism   that any and all means of persecution and punishment are justified. Even, apparently, mass murder. And the crowd went wild, erupting into applause   some breaking out into a standing ovation.It s not even the first time Trump has wheeled out the story either. Despite the fact that this complete and morbid fantasy was taken to pieces when just two months ago when he last road-tested it. Trump came back for more last night in California.What makes the matter all the more galling, is this is pure fairytale. As Mediaite s Josh Feldman has written previously:There has been a persistent rumor for years that United States General John Pershing cracked down on Islamic terrorism in the early 1900s by dipping bullets in pig s blood and shooting Muslim prisoners with them. This is a hoax. It has never been proven.In addition, the popular fact-checking site Politifact undertook their own investigation in the tale, and they ended up rating it as  Pants on Fire. This means they could find literally no truth whatsoever in the claims.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWcinTg9K98Ladies and Gentlemen, we present to you the potential future President of the United States.Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The Daily Show Turned Trump’s Own Words Into A Hip Hop Song, And It’s Glorious (VIDEO)","The Daily Show may finally have found a format in which the boastful, bragadocious word soup of Donald Trump actually makes sense: a hip hop video.One of the show s finest correspondents, Roy Wood Jr., plays Black Trump, in a video which takes Trump s own actual words, and forms them into a song called They Love Me. To give you you an example of some of the lyrics, pulled straight from Trump speeches and tweets, here are some sample lyrics:I was down there at 7/11 Spent almost nothing on my run for president All the women flirted with me on The Apprentice If Ivanka weren t my daughter, then perhaps I d be dating herAll backed up by a solid hip hop beat and plenty of bling and crotch shots.Can you believe Ted Cruz who been killing our country? Lyin  Ted Cruz used a picture of Melania Careful Lyin  Ted, I ll spill the beans on your woman I be watching Modern Family, written by a moron I never liked Bette Midler s persona (Told ya!) I have black guys counting my money The one who can beat Hillary, I m not a Mitt Romney Remember I m the only candidate who s self-funding (Told ya!)It s hard to ignore that Donald Trump really does makes a lot more sense as a Frat Bro hip hop wannabe, than as a presidential candidate. As Roy Wood Jr., tells Daily Show host Trevor Noah: Everything Trump says is straight out of a rapper s play book.

 Republican West Virginia Lawmaker Wants You To Know His ‘N*****’ Tweet Wasn’t Racist (VIDEO),"Whenever Republicans dredge up a certain specious  quote  from former President Lyndon Johnson about  n*ggers,  I am reminded of my grandmother.My grandmother didn t like black people much at all. Living next door to her and conversing regularly, I heard more slurs than one would typically hear at a Tea Party convention devoted to discourse on race relations. In fact, when a Republican says that  blacks are the real racists  or tells us what he or she thinks about  negroes,  it reminds me of my childhood   and not in a good way.Apart from that, she was a sweet, kind woman who genuinely cared about others   enough so that her personal prejudices rarely (if ever) impacted her interactions with others. My mother, though her demeanor has changed over time, was also not too fond of African-Americans when I was younger. When I was 15 or 16, I was dating an African-American girl. She was intelligent, caring, and probably one of the better people I have had the pleasure to know. However, her skin was darker, so my mother disapproved heavily.After meeting the girl, we ll call her Samantha, once, my mom knew what she had to do to protect her son from the risk of race-mixing (which, at the time, she was against,  for the good of the child ). I was not permitted to leave the vicinity of my house because I might visit her. I was not allowed to go out with friends because she might meet me wherever I wanted to go at any given time. I was a prisoner.Despite my grandmother s pretty open racism, she had a huge problem with my mother s actions. While she personally had a low opinion of people because of their skin color, she also recognized one great truth: It doesn t matter how she or anyone else feels, because everyone deserves to be treated equally. After learning of my mother s decision to effectively imprison me around my home because disagreed with the skin color rather than the character of the person I was dating, my grandmother pulled me aside and said something that was equally heartwarming and offensive to me: I want you to know that no matter what your mother says, there is nothing wrong with you dating that n*gger girl. She s nice and sweet. You tell me any time you want to see her and I ll make it happen because it ain t right that your mom won t let you be with who you want. And so it went for months. Any time my parents left the house, my grandmother would take me to pick Samantha, and she would go over an  escape plan  if they returned home prematurely. Despite her prejudices, she was always kind to Samantha. In fact, those interactions changed her opinions somewhat. She stopped being a  n*gger.  She became a person in my grandmother s eyes. She became human. Actually getting to know someone can have that impact. At first, she was  one of the good ones,  but eventually race stopped being a factor altogether as my grandmother learned that people are just people, regardless of skin color.People could offer a number of defenses for how she felt the majority of her life:  she was a product of her time  or  she didn t know any better.  I won t do that. At any point in our nation s history, there has been someone strong enough to fight for what is right, to take a stand against such horrific classifications of people. My grandmother was not one of them, but despite this she was also outspoken about equal rights (though a slur was usually included in the discussion). She genuinely believed that her own prejudices (which she admitted even early on  might be wrong ) should have no bearing on how society as a whole treats people   just like Lyndon Johnson.At first glance, Johnson would fit right in at a Trump rally. In April 2014, MSNBC s Adam Serwer noted that the former President was  practically a connoisseur  of the n-word. There is absolutely no question that Johnson was a massive racist, but he was also a huge proponent of the Civil Rights Act, which he lovingly called the  n*gger bill.  Serwer writes:Then in 1957, Johnson would help get the  nigger bill  passed, known to most as the Civil Rights Act of 1957. With the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the segregationists would go to their graves knowing the cause they d given their lives to had been betrayed, Frank Underwood style, by a man they believed to be one of their own. When Caro asked segregationist Georgia Democrat Herman Talmadge how he felt when Johnson, signing the Civil Rights Act, said we shall overcome,  Talmadge said  sick. The Civil Rights Act made it possible for Johnson to smash Jim Crow. The Voting Rights Act made the U.S. government accountable to its black citizens and a true democracy for the first time. Johnson lifted racist immigration restrictions designed to preserve a white majority   and by extension white supremacy. He forced FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, then more concerned with  communists  and civil rights activists, to turn his attention to crushing the Ku Klux Klan. Though the Fair Housing Act never fulfilled its promise to end residential segregation, it was another part of a massive effort to live up to the ideals America s founders only halfheartedly believed in   a record surpassed only by Abraham Lincoln.Ihle is under fire for jumping on the opportunity to use the word  n*gger  in a context he assumed was safe.The remark was in response to a thread about food stamps   the sort of  free stuff  the right often claims Democrats use to get black votes. The implication, of course, is that black people only want  free stuff.  While Ihle used the quote in furtherance of racist bullsh*t, something we can expect from pretty much any Republican at any time, he defends his uncensored use of the n-word, claiming the tweet is being is taken out of context (you know, just like he used the quote without providing context). That kind of racism needs to be rooted out of society and shining a light on it is an effective way to do so,  Ihle told WCHS. He says that he was simply stating a  historical truth  and that he will not be taking the tweet down. He did not address the fact that there is little evidence that Johnson even said the words he quoted.While Ihle doesn t see a problem with his  n*gger  tweet, pretty much everyone else does:    Johnson was a racist, but he was a racist (just like my grandmother) who believed society s attitudes, including his own, needed to change. Johnson recognized that he irrationally hated the very same people whose rights he fought for.  It is not just Negroes but all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry,  he said of the plight of African-Americans. Undoubtedly, he included himself in that assessment.The first step toward change is self-awareness. Johnson knew enough to know he was a racist   something of which Ihle seems incapable.Watch him defend his remarks below:Featured image via screen grab",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Gave A Green Light To Sexist ‘Lewinsky’ Attack On Clinton And It Backfired,"Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of playing  the woman card,  minimizing the employment record of the former Watergate lawyer, First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State. But it also seems to have been a way of signaling his fellow Republicans to unleash sexist attacks against the likely Democratic nominee.Cue the official with the Florida Republican Party, a key swing state with a ton of electoral college votes.Bob Sutton, chairman of the Broward County GOP Executive Committee, suggested Clinton would be easy to debate in the general election. I think when Donald Trump debates Hillary Clinton she s going to go down like Monica Lewinsky,  Sutton told the Post.Kristin Matheny, secretary of the Broward County Republican Party in Sutton s county, told the Sun Sentinel newspaper that Sutton should apologize.Clinton has already turned the sexist attack from Trump into an advantage for her campaign. On Thursday, the Clinton campaign solicited donations and in exchange said it would send supporters a  woman card  to show off.The candidate herself, in her victory speech after winning four out of five primaries on Tuesday night, told Trump that if the  woman card  meant standing up for equal rights, pay, etc.,  deal me in. Trump goes into the general election already facing huge deficits in support in nearly every slice of the demographic pie, but none worse than among women.The reality TV star turned Republican frontrunner claims that he can make up the gap by election day, but before Democrats have even run any negative ads, his history of sexist and misogynist comments has already frightened members of the Republican establishment.The Republican Party has lost the women s vote in every election since 1988, losing the key demographic even in years it which it won the overall race, like in 2004.President Obama has excelled with women voters, earning 13% more of the vote in 2008, and 11% more in 2012. Especially with a female candidate on the top of the Democratic ticket, Republicans are playing with fire by attacking Clinton in this way.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 White House Defends Boehner’s ‘Lucifer’ Comment About Cruz: ‘He Was Just Looking To Be Honest’ (VIDEO),"Ever since former House Speaker John Boehner aired out his true feelings about Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, everyone has been having a field day and running with it.It all started on Wednesday, when John Boehner was asked about the 2016 election during a forum at Stanford University. It just so happened that Cruz s name came up in the discussion, and Boehner couldn t hold back his disgust for his fellow conservative. Referring to Cruz as  Lucifer in the flesh,  Boehner mocked the Texas senator: I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life. This is a thought that many Republicans would actually agree with, as it s been well-documented that Cruz is one of the least-liked politicians   with several of those opinions coming from within the GOP. This fact only gets proven time and time again.On Thursday, the White House hilariously failed to come to Cruz s defense during a daily briefing, clearly amused by the Republicans  in-party fighting. The room broke out in giggles when CNN s Michelle Kosinski asked Press Secretary John Earnest if he felt Obama would agree with Boehner s  Lucifer  comment, and whether those remarks were appropriate or not.Earnest, trying to hold back laughter, suggested that Boehner was just trying to be as truthful as possible. Earnest was barely able to keep a straight face as he replied: Obviously, Speaker Boehner was speaking based on his own experience. I don t know that he was looking to be helpful or harmful, I think he was just looking to be honest about his own view. Weighing in on whether Boehner s comments had crossed a line, Earnest simply said that if Kosinski was looking for somebody to come to the defense of one Republican who s being attacked by another, you should probably ask somebody else.

 INSANE: Southern City Passes Law To Jail Transgender People For Using The Bathroom,"Conservatives in an Alabama town have decided to give in to right-wing hysteria about transgender people using public bathrooms, and gone even further than other discriminatory laws. The city of Oxford s city council passed a law that would allow police to imprison transgender people who don t use the right bathroom, in their eyes.The law would allow Oxford police to put those who violate the ordinance in jail for up to six months.City attorney Ron Allen told CNN the law was passed because some residents panicked after retailer Target announced that it would be open minded and allow transgender employees and customers to use the restroom for the gender they identify with.As if the law itself isn t absurd enough, here is the procedure required for police to arrest someone under it:Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge did not return a CNN call for comment. But he told CNN affiliate WBRC the law would be enforced just like any other for a misdemeanor: A person would have to call police to complain, and when police arrive the officer would have to witness the crime.After that, Partridge said, the person who called in the complaint would have to sign a warrant.So-called  bathroom bills  have come along as Republicans need more boogeymen in order to convince religious right conservatives to vote for them as LGBT rights have become more and more mainstream in America, particularly after the Supreme Court made same sex marriage legal in the entire country.The laws rely on the belief that allowing transgender people the right to use the bathroom that  predators  would take advantage of the legal system. In reality, data shows that the claim that this would be used to assist predators to be completely false, and in fact the linkage being promoted by the right is just more bigotry and fearmongering.Conservative lawmakers in the south have begun feeling a major backlash, as businesses, entertainers, and other institutions have begun to pull out of doing commerce in states like North Carolina. Corporate America has discovered that associating with the modern descendant of Jim Crow laws is a bad brand image, and not something they want to be a part of.As a result, conservative Republicans in the south have seen their natural allies   big business   publicly condemn them and hurt the perception of anti-transgender rights states as business friendly.The market is deciding.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Carly Fiorina: Ted Cruz’s Chances Of Winning Are As Real As Those Planned Parenthood Videos,"It s now official. Carly Fiorina needs help. I m talking real, pharmaceutical-grade, billed at $400 an hour professional help, because she s seeing things that are not there again. This is just like that time she screamed like a banshee that she totally really did see live fetuses getting cut to bits in those Planned Parenthood videos, which were so obviously fake that not even other Republicans talk about them anymore.Megyn Kelly invited Fiorina onto her show to ask her just why in God s name she agreed to be, of all people, Ted Cruz s vice presidential candidate. He s the only person that Republicans genuinely hate more than Trump, yet she thought this was a good idea. So, what s the deal?Kelly asked Fiorina why she chose Cruz when he has no chance at securing the nomination by a majority of delegates. Fiorina immediately insisted that her math (this is the imaginary stuff now) says that Ted Cruz can win. She even blamed the media for this by saying they just wish it would be over and he [Trump] would be the GOP nominee. Here s some non-Carly math. Cruz has 562 delegates. He needs 1,237 to win. There are 578 still available. Even if he won 100 percent of all remaining ones he comes up nearly 100 delegates short. It s mathematically impossible for Ted Cruz to  win  and avoid a contested primary, yet she still said she believes Ted will win the nomination based on numbers only she can see.Carly Fiorina actually said that the majority of Republicans do not want Trump to win, to which Megyn Kelly just stared with a look of pity and bewilderment. Trump has beaten Cruz by up to 40 percent in the popular vote in some states recently. Apparently that isn t a majority anymore.Kelly then went on to point out that even though Trump isn t exactly the favorite of the party, there is no alternative. Cruz is still in it, but nobody is uniting behind him to stop Trump. Of course, Fiorina responded by telling Kelly she was wrong because there s a huge line of supporters flocking to Cruz   which again only she can see.Carly either sees things that do not actually exist, or she intentionally lies. I don t really know which is worse, but she thinks this qualifies her to be our next vice president.It s 2008 all over again. We have another mentally flawed person in the VP seat for Republicans   except this time, it s so bad she won t even get to the general election. Carly Fiorina should think long and hard about that. Sarah Palin made it closer to the vice presidency than she ever will. That has to sting.Watch Carly Fiorina prove how she can fail even in the most friendly of surroundings below:Featuerd image via video screen capture",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hatred For The Republican Party Reaches 25 Year High,"It s now no surprise that Donald Trump, the most hated presidential candidate in the field, is the GOP s frontrunner. It seems being hated is all the Republican Party is good for these days.And there s even better news for Democrats!A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that the GOP is overwhelmingly hated by the American public and has reached its highest level of disdain since 1992. According to the poll, 62 percent of Americans have an unfavorable impression of the GOP whereas only 33 percent view it favorably. American s positive perception of the GOP fell four points in the last six months.The poll also found a very interesting trend: most of the negativity towards the GOP came from self-identified Republicans, where only 68 had a favorable view of their own party   an 11 point drop from October.As Trump rises is in the polls, Republicans feelings about their party falls. What a coincidence.In contrast, 45 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the Democratic Party versus 50 percent who harbored negative views. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats had a favorable view of the party.Not surprisingly, Independent voters were more favorable to the Democratic Party   preferring them 37 to 28 percent   than the Republican Party. As Trump continuously tells the public he s winning with Independents, he certainly hasn t been very successful. Also not surprising was respondents who were black, female or young were also much more likely to give favorable impressions of the Democratic Party compared to the GOP.When broken down, the poll reminds us of what we already know:White people, in general, are almost identical in how they feel about both parties; 37 percent have a favorable view of both parties, while 59 percent have an unfavorable view of the Democrats and 58 percent for the Republicans.It looks like the two-party system has failed the oppressed whites yet again   how sad.Over 2,000 Americans responded to the poll, which was conducted between April 12 to 19 and it has a margin of error at 2.5 percent.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" The WORLD Is Terrified Of Trump’s Foreign Policy Speech, Here’s What They Had To Say","One thing has been made abundantly clear: Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has no idea what he is talking about when it comes to foreign policy and diplomatic leadership. And whoever is in his ear and/or writing his speeches clearly doesn t either.After Trump made his  foreign policy  speech on Wednesday, not only did America react, but so did the rest of the world, with a number of foreign dignitaries speaking up and out against the real estate mogul s ineptitude.Germany s foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said: I can only hope that the election campaign in the USA does not lack the perception of reality The world s security architecture has changed and it is no longer based on two pillars alone. It cannot be conducted unilaterally. No American president can get round this change in the international security architecture .  America first  is actually no answer to that. Former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt believes Trump s speech is  abandoning both democratic allies and democratic values.  Also adding,  Trump had not a word against Russian aggression in Ukraine, but plenty against past U.S. support for democracy in Egypt. Former South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Sung-han seems outright terrified viewing Trump as  the first isolationist to be U.S. presidential candidate, while in the post-war era all the U.S. presidents have been to varying degrees internationalists.  Adding: Saying the U.S. will no longer engage in anything that is a burden in terms of its relationships with allies, it would be almost like abandoning those alliances. It will inevitably give rise to anti-American sentiment worldwide. Then there s the U.S. and Americas Programme at Britain s Chatham House think tank s Xenia Wickett, who said Trump s rhetoric, it  suggests Trump would make America s allies less secure rather than more. He talked about allies being confident but all of his rhetoric suggested that America should be unpredictable and that America s allies needed to stand up for themselves. This has been the sentiment internationally for quite some time now from every corner of the globe. A Trump presidency would be bad news for everyone, not just in the United States, but worldwide. He simply has no idea what he s doing. If he were to become president, the damage made from his incompetence and inexperience in regards to foreign policy and international diplomacy could be so severe it could damage ties for decades to come. We cannot allow this to happen.Trump talks a good game to his imbecilic group of followers because, quite honestly, they don t know any better, and sounding big, tough and filled with nationalistic isolationist pride sounds good to them. Mostly because most of them don t even know the world beyond their front porch.America is strong when is stands together with its allies. Isolating ourselves is not only dangerous, but stupid. Saying our military is going to be the strongest ever in the world isn t only dangerous, but stupid. Making false claims about our international allies isn t only dangerous, but stupid. And stupid is as stupid does and stupid votes Trump.We must make sure we do all we can to make sure Donald J. Trump doesn t get anywhere near the Oval Office   no matter who, vote blue. Not only for yourself and the nation, but the world.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders ‘Appears’ On Seinfeld And It’s Hilarious (VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders has taken America and the world by storm. The once relatively unknown senator from Vermont enjoys enormous grassroots support from people of all walks of life and backgrounds. He has struck a chord with millions, especially young American progressives who identify with Sanders  ideas of income equality, education, universal healthcare, and a foreign policy that is fair for oppressed groups like the Palestinians living under Israel s brutal occupation.Bernie s appeal to America and to the world is that he s honest and candid. Unlike most of the other candidates, he actually talks about the issues and in addition, he has sound and rational solutions to problems.His appealing straightforwardness and candor was all on display as he made an  appearance  on Seinfeld. In order to understand why the word  appearance  is in quotes, watch the video below.Watch video here:As you can see, in his talks with Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer, Bernie is as straightforward with his language as ever. There is no doubt that in the age of individuals like Donald Trump, who says so much but with very little substance, or Ted Cruz, who says frightening things and we would just prefer him to shut-up, America needs someone like Bernie Sanders who has the intelligence and the approach that America needs today.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bitter Cruz Claims He ‘Doesn’t Know’ John Boehner, Forgets Boehner Once Hired Him To Sue A Democrat","Sen. Ted Cruz is attempting to stop the bleeding after a brutal dress down by his former colleague John Boehner became headline news.Boehner, who resigned as Speaker of the House last year and thus has absolutely nothing left to lose, told a Standford University gathering that he disliked Trump but absolutely reviled Ted Cruz. How much does Boehner hate Ted?The deeply Catholic former politician accused Cruz of being  Lucifer in the flesh.  He explained that his hatred of Cruz transcends politics:  I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.  John Boehner HATES Ted Cruz.This isn t exactly surprising. Most human beings seem to come to the same conclusion at one time or another. In fact, the more you get to know Ted Cruz the more likely you are to despise him. His old college roommate famously hates him.As a freshman, I would get into senior parties because I was Ted's roommate. OUT OF PITY. He was that widely loathed. It's his superpower.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) January 10, 2016People might think Craig is exaggerating. He's not. I met Ted freshman week and loathed him within the hour. https://t.co/2ZrbTdjHJh  Geoff (@gacohen) January 20, 2016His former law colleagues famously hate him.In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment. Some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges.His fellow politicians hate him. I don t know how he s going to deal with Congress,  Bob Dole recently remarked.  Nobody likes him. When it comes to the junior senator from Texas, ignorance is bliss.Cruz s response to Boehner s blistering assessment of him was as telling as it was weak. When asked about it, Cruz pretended to not know the guy. Truth of the matter is I don t know the man,  Cruz said, adding that he d be surprised if he s said more than 50 words to him.  I ve met the man two or three times. Cruz wants us to believe that he has never spoken to the guy he worked closely with to shut down the government in 2013. Yikes.But more damning still, Cruz actually knows Boehner very well. He was his lawyer.Back in the  90s, Boehner needed a young conservative lawyer to help him destroy the political career of a Democratic rival. Ted Cruz was just the guy for the job.Per The Washington Post:The year was 1998. Shania Twain and Savage Garden were all the rage. Boehner was House Republican Conference chairman. He had decided to sue Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) for allegedly violating wiretapping laws.At issue was a recorded phone conversation in 1996 involving Boehner and then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, among others. A Florida couple intercepted the call on a police scanner. The couple gave a recording of the call to McDermott, then the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee. (Gingrich was facing ethics sanctions.) McDermott shared it with the New York Times. And, well, Boehner wasn t happy.Cruz was hired, and even wound up publicly speaking in support of Boehner after   as was his plan all along   he used the publicity from the lawsuit to fundraise for his re-election campaign.It s hard to imagine that Cruz and Boehner didn t share more than a few late night gab sessions during that period. The relationship was certainly mutually beneficial. Boehner won his re-election and Cruz got to brag about taking down a Democrat and use that persona to sell his Tea Party agenda when he eventually got around to running for office.Lyin  Ted, indeed.Featured image via Win McNamee and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Florida Landscaper SWEARS He Accidentally Mowed Over Trump Sign…Repeatedly (VIDEO),"We hear a lot of talk about making America great again coming from Donald Trump and his massively stupid acolytes   but what about our lawns? Can they be great again? That s what one brave landscaper in Florida apparently decided to find out when he saw a Trump sign in someone s yard. Unfortunately, curiosity can sometimes get the cat banned from working in a neighborhood. It all began with a panicked Facebook post from the sign s Trump-supporting owner: Look at what our landscapers did .. I understand people may not like Trump but I have my rights to put this sign in my yard and it was no accident see for yourself! The video shows a 19-year-old worker riding a mower at high speed directly into Josh Boesch s Donald Trump campaign sign   one of many in the Citrus Chase subdivision resident s yard. He then hops off his mower, appears to throw the sign back in front of the mower, and run it over again. Then, he backs up and appears to run it over again.For those who are concerned, the sign lived through the apparent assault, but Boesch is not happy. The resident told news station WKMG that after noticing his mangled sign, he watched six hours of video to figure out who did the thing in his yard.Boesch says his six-hour investigation into the incident reveals that his lawn had already been mowed, though he admits it could have been an accident   a sentiment echoed by Fred Heldrith, the owner of the landscaping company.Heldreth says his employee did not typically work in the neighborhood, and that he was simply inexperienced with that type of mower.  If he wanted to destroy the sign, he would have destroyed the sign,  he pointed out.  The sign is still there. Indeed, it is still there. But should it have been there in the first place? WKMG reports that Boesch s show of support for Trump was a violation of the Citrus Chase Homeowner s Association guidelines, which prohibit display of campaign signs more than 90 days before an election. Additionally, they report that residents typically remove their signs before landscapers arrive and put them back up later   a courtesy with which the Trump supporter could not be bothered. It s been there for like since January,  Boesch told the station as he explained why he did not do what his neighbors do to make things easier for landscapers,  and it s never been hit by the lawnscapers. They either always mow around it or they use their edger because a lot of them have respect. This, of course, is an ironic statement coming from someone who refuses to show workers the same respect his neighbors do, even forcing them to stop mowing to edge around the campaign signs that have been occupying the space in violation of HOA policies since January.Accident or not, the man responsible for Moweerghazi will not be back. In response to the incident, Citrus Chase assured Boesch: The guy has been removed from the crew, he will not be allowed in our development any more. What do you think? Was this an accident, or was the landscaper simply trying to make Boesch s lawn great again? In any case, the signs are still up and in workers  way. Boesch still refuses to show  respect  to people who simply want to do their jobs without unnecessary hassle.Watch a report on the incident below:Featured image via screengrab ",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Obama’s Response To 8-Year-Old Girl In Flint Should Give Us All Hope (VIDEO),"Yesterday, an eight-year-old girl from Flint, Michigan got a response from President Barack Obama that she ll never forget.Mari Copeny, also known around her town as  Little Miss Flint , had written to Obama about Flint s water crisis, which had been poisoned and contaminated with lead thanks to corruption and negligence by the state s Republican administration. In her message to the President, Copeny spoke up for many children growing up in Flint when she wrote: I am one of the children that is affected by this water, and I ve been doing my best to march in protest and to speak out for all the kids that live here in Flint. Copeny also mentioned that she would be in Washington, DC this week  to watch the congressional hearings of our Governor Rick Snyder and wanted to meet the President and First Lady Michelle Obama despite the fact that My mom said chances are you will be too busy with more important things. Copeny was hopeful, but she didn t expect a prompt response from the busy commander-in-chief. Little did she know, her request was about to be fulfilled in a major way. Obama wrote back, and his response was nothing short of the amazing warm-heartedness that we ve come to expect from our President: Thank you for writing to me. You re right that Presidents are often busy, but the truth is, in America, there is no more important title than citizen. And I am so proud of you for using your voice to speak out on behalf of the children of Flint.That s why I want you to be the first to know that I m coming to visit Flint on May 4th. I want to make sure people like you and your family are receiving the help you need and deserve.Letters from kids like you are what make me so optimistic for the future. I hope to meet you next week,  Little Miss Flint. The White House confirmed those plans in a statement that read, On Wednesday, May 4th, the President will travel to Flint, Michigan where he will hear first-hand from Flint residents like Mari about the public health crisis, receive an in-person briefing on the federal efforts in place to help respond to the needs of the people of Flint, and speak directly with members of the Flint community. Despite her young age, Copeny is a big activist in her community and frequently uses YouTube to raise awareness for the important issues the area is facing. To make sure that no one forgets that people in Flint are still depending on bottled water for their drinking, cooking and bathing needs, Copeny has created a video where she speaks about the hardships the community must endure. You can watch it below:Unfortunately, the polluted water in Flint will be life-altering and affect future generations to come. Not only will children have learning disabilities and behavioral issues, but the lead will be passed onto younger generations by women who are pregnant. Until every last lead pipe in Flint is replaced, this situation will not be resolved. We can only hope that the President s visit to Flint will push Congress to find a solution to this injustice.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images and screenshot",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Paul Ryan Wants To Make This Healthcare Nightmare A Reality Again (VIDEO),"On Wednesday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called for an end to protections found in the Affordable Care Act that prevent insurance companies from denying people coverage based on pre-existing conditions.Reuters reports that Ryan told students at Georgetown University that he is in favor of scrapping the protections found in the Affordable Care Act that prevent insurers from charging higher rates for sick people in favor of creating subsidized  risk pools  on a state level. Less than 10 percent of people under 65 are what we call people with pre-existing conditions, who are really kind of uninsurable,  Ryan said.  Let s fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage so that they can get affordable coverage,  he said.  You dramatically lower the price for everybody else. You make health insurance so much more affordable, so much more competitive and open up competition. Less than 10 percent of people under 65  is a deceptive way to describe approximately 26 million people. A report released in 2011 from the Department of Health and Human Services found that half of the U.S. population has some sort of preexisting condition. That study includes those who are aged 65-years or older. The term  preexisting condition  is broad and different studies can provide wildly different figures on the number of people who have a preexisting condition, depending on how the term is defined in the study.Support for the Affordable Healthcare Act as a whole has run mostly along partisan lines. Republicans strongly are in favor of scrapping President Obama s healthcare reforms altogether. However, out of all of the individual provisions found in the Affordable Care Act, protections for people with preexisting conditions have consistently received support from people in the U.S. across the political spectrum. A survey conducted in 2012, just before that year s presidential election, found that 82% of respondents supported provisions set in place to prevent insurance companies from denying people coverage based on preexisting conditions.That makes Ryan s choice to vocally oppose those protections a major political gamble. Ryan, along with the rest of the Republican Party has failed to offer any solid alternatives to the Affordable Care Act during their now nearly decade-long opposition to healthcare reform package. Republicans are stuck between a rock and a hard place when trying to define an alternative to the Affordable Care Act. With the exception of the individual mandate, polls show that people tend to support key aspects of the healthcare act than they do when asked if they support the act in its entirety.You can watch Ryan s speech in full below.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images)",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" George Takei’s Powerful Message To Liberals: It’s Time To Unite, And Here’s Why (VIDEO)","Actor, activist and one of liberal America s strongest social media advocates George Takei has long supported the presidential primary campaign of Bernie Sanders. But this week, he has delivered a powerful message to his fellow Bernie supporters: it s time to admit the campaign is over, and unite behind Hillary Clinton.In a video released to his over 9 million Facebook followers, Takei made an impassioned plea to both Bernie and Hillary supporters, to treat each other with respect and civility. Ultimately, we Democrats know that a bit of a tussle isn t a bad thing   it makes us stronger. Keeps us sharp,  he said.  And really, it s like a family squabble, where only family   those very close to us   can truly get under our skin. But remember this, too: it s precisely because we like and respect each other that the words and criticisms sting as much as they do. The video message came in response to Hillary Clinton securing victory over Bernie Sanders on four of the five recent primary states. As Clinton moves ever nearer to victory, it seems the fight between supporters is reaching fever pitch   with fairly toxic commentary on both sides.It s okay for us to argue passionately for our beliefs; we don t hold them lightly. The differences between the Clinton and Sanders campaigns are not cosmetic; they go to the core of sincerely held and contrary views about how we share this nation   wealth inequality, national security, foreign policy, Israel. These are not marginal issues, and the candidates have very different proposals for the country.For some on either side, those views are so contrary that they would rather vote Republican, or not at all, than for the opposing candidate. While that feels extreme, it is understandable.But Takei advises that we consider what America will look like after election day if liberal acrimony secures a victory for the likes of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. The common ground between Sanders and Clinton is something we should not simply take for granted as we argue over the other issues. The separation of church and state, women s reproductive rights, LGBT and civil rights   here is our common ground in 2016. Takei urges his fellow Sanders supporters to recall the words of their own candidate   that on her very worst day, Hillary Clinton is an infinitely better candidate and President than the Republican candidate on his best day. If Bernie believes that, his supporters can, too,  Takei adds.It s tough in a two party system. The churches on both sides of the aisle are broader than any single candidate can reconcile. The question is not  do we agree on everything?  but  do we agree on enough? George Takei and Bernie Sanders argue that we do.Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Boehner Launches Blistering Attack On ‘Miserable Son of a B*tch’ Ted Cruz,"Former Republican speaker John Boehner has launched a blistering attack on GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz, in which he describes the Texas senator as satan incarnate, and a  miserable son of a b*tch. Boehner was asked about his views on Cruz and other presidential candidates during an event held at Stanford University this week. The Stanford Daily reported that Boehner replied: I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a b*tch in my life. Adding that he considers Cruz to be: Lucifer in the flesh. This was in sharp contrast to his views on the other candidates. Boehner revealed that he is on friendly terms with frontrunner Donald Trump, stating that the two are actually  texting buddies.  One can only imagine the contents of those texts.And how does Boehner feel about outside challenger and fellow Ohioan John Kasich? Not much apparently. [Kasich] requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends  but he s still my friend, and I love him. Boehner went on to state that in the event of a run off between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, he would throw his vote and support behind a Trump candidacy. Of course, the frontrunner may well be forced to consider that with a friend like Boehner, he may require no enemies. The former speaker is, like Trump, a fairly divisive figure in the Republican Party and wider conservative movement.Of course, as Addicting Info s Matthew Desmond pointed out earlier today, this is all becoming a moot point. Like it or not, the campaigns of Ted Cruz and John Kasich are essentially over. Donald Trump is the de facto Republican candidate for President.The GOP clown car has delivered perhaps the most repugnant presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater. The party will have to live with that, but America still has the chance to repeat the landslide of 1964 against Trump in 2016   and remind the world that the U.S. is committed to progress, not hate.Featured image via Flickr Creative Commons/Flickr Creative Commons",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Madeleine Albright Unleashes Blistering Attack On Trump After His Foreign Policy Speech (TWEETS),"Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has never been the type of person to hold back when she sees stupidity, and Donald Trump just felt the burn of her disapproval.On Wednesday, the Republican frontrunner attempted to appear  presidential  by laying out his foreign policy  plans.  The speech was just like him, full of emptiness and bullshit. He attacked President Obama s foreign policy again and again, painting him as weak on terrorism and blaming him for the problems in the Middle East. Surprisingly, however, the marmalade-tinted imbecile didn t talk about his Great Wall of  Murica at all. Later that evening, though, former Secretary Albright laid into the billionaire on Twitter.She said that she was posting on the social media site because it is Trump s favourite method of communication  and then promptly destroyed his policies:Today, @realDonaldTrump tried out a foreign policy speech   something I have experience with.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016 So I thought I d respond using his favorite method of communication and tackle some of the #TrumpDoctrine s biggest flaws head on.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016Trump demonstrates no real understanding of complex international issues and has no serious proposals for how to address them.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016 Trump speaks about regaining the trust of our allies, but then threatens to pull out of NATO.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016Trump preaches unpredictability as a policy, then asks us to trust him with the nuclear codes.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016 Trump s understanding of trade policy is simplistic at best, and would have disastrous effects on our economy.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016Trump praises Western values, then questions why we should support democracy in other countries.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016 Trump s views on torture are completely out of sync with recommendations by military leaders and America s values.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016Trump s newest slogan is  America First,  recalling the self-defeating isolationism of the 1930s.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016 Trump s proposals to ban Muslims and deport immigrants would undermine America s greatest strengths: diversity and tolerance.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016The so-called #TrumpDoctrine is simply bellicose rhetoric strung together with contradictory statements. Bluster is no strategy, Mr. Trump.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) April 27, 2016OUCH!Secretary Albright said everything we have been saying all along: Trump is in over his head. He entered this presidential race without any clear vision for the future, let alone a basic understanding of foreign policy. It would be disastrous if this man were ever allowed to dictate policy with our allies. He has no idea what the hell he is doing and would destroy this country and our relationships with the other world powers.One thing was blatantly obvious yesterday: the stakes are too high to sit at home and pout in November. Democrats must come together and keep this lunatic out of the White House; so, vote blue   no matter who.Featured image via Paul Marotta/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bigoted Cops Shove Lesbian Out Of Women’s Bathroom Because She Looks Like A Man (VIDEO),"The hopes and dreams of millions of bigots finally came true when three cops on a power trip confronted a lesbian in a public restroom and shoved her outside. Why? Because they  thought  she was a guy.In a video titled  Lesbian harassed and forced to leave a public restroom because the police insist she s a man, three officers, two males and a female, can be seen in a public women s restroom telling a woman referred to her friends as a  dyke  that she has to leave. This is despite the fact that several of her friends are standing right there telling the cops that she is, in fact, a girl.Now to be fair to the cops, the woman in question didn t have ID and was dressed like a guy because women NEVER do that in America. Completely unheard of. And, even worse, she was fairly flat chested and that s something else that s simply inconceivable. Everyone knows that woman always have curves so you can identify them as chicks. So, clearly, there was absolutely no WAY the cops could know whether or not this was a woman.Other than, you know, the woman and her friends saying that she was. But since when do whiny civilians know better than the police? Frankly, I m surprised they didn t force her to drop her pants to prove it.Here s the disturbing video:This is exactly the kind of prejudice Republicans have been hoping to inspire with their  Bathroom Laws.  They know that people only need the thinnest of justifications to vent their hate and we see here the result. As far as I m concerned, the cops knew damn well that she wasn t a man or they would have arrested her. That they didn t even threaten it tells me that bullying was the intent and nothing else. Again, exactly what Republicans wanted.The right has lost the culture war against the LGBT community and what we re witnessing now is the last desperate attempts by bigots to turn back the clock to  better times.  I hope this woman sues the crap out of the police for violating her civil rights and they all lose their jobs. We have enough power tripping assholes on the streets as it is.Featured image via screencap",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rape Deemed Legal In Oklahoma Because You Can’t Substitute Force With Intoxication Under The Law,"The definition of rape came under fire in Oklahoma Wednesday when a the state s high court ruled that a girl who had accused a boy of sexually assaulting her was too drunk to be a reliable witness and dismissed the charges against the boy she says raped her while she was either too intoxicated or unconscious. She was 14 at the time of the assault and he was 17.The boy claims that the girl, who was four times past the legal limit to drive, engaged in a consensual oral act with him. The Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with him, stating that  force can t be substituted with intoxication under the [forced sodomy] law.  Prosecutors are furious, because the boy gets a walk, and while the court also said,  We will not, in order to justify prosecution of a person for an offense, enlarge a statute beyond the fair meaning of its language,  it stated it in an  unpublished opinion,  meaning the case can t be cited as precedent.That means that nothing has changed. The court has given its opinion on what some poor drunk teenage girl forever changed because a poor decision led to a boy who is legally an adult in many states raped her and got away with it. By saying it isn t precedent means they certainly don t want to close the door on the fact that people are raped, just not for this girl, who they obviously believe could have possibly been responsible for such a thing at 14-years-old. They don t make good decisions when they re stone cold sober, nevermind when you ply them with booze.From what s available, the boy, who had a friend with him, gave the girl a ride home because she was so drunk. He dropped his friend off first, who would testify that the girl was drifting in and out of consciousness, and somewhere between there and the girl s house his DNA ended up all over her and she has no memory of the encounter. The court said they wouldn t create a crime to prosecute one offender because the forcible sodomy law says you have to use force, not alcohol or by that logic, date rape drugs, to incapacitate and force yourself on your victim.Interpreting law is what a high court does. Does somebody really have to tell these idiots that rape is about control, not sex? Maybe they saw this one kid as some believable victim of a circumstance beyond his control, but what they ve done is fostered a rapist and given plenty of other young abusers -in-training a new something to think about. Until Oklahoma either changes the law or replaces the imbeciles on its high court who interpret it, it s a breeding ground for predatory behavior.Featured image from okhouse.gov",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Barbara Boxer DESTROYS Carly Fiorina After She’s Announced As Ted Cruz’s V.P. (Tweets),"It s a shame Barbara Boxer is leaving the Senate. A fierce defender of working families and minority communities, Boxer is the kind of firebrand progressive we need in the Senate. She s also one of the funniest, apparently.In 2010, when Republicans swept the House of Representatives and picked up six seats in the Senate, Boxer faced Carly Fiorina, who mounted a tough and controversial campaign to unseat Boxer in California.In the end, Boxer prevailed, garnering 52 percent of the vote to Fiorina s 42 percent. After that, Fiorina, a sore loser, packed up and moved to Virginia, leaving California behind.Now she s Cruz s vice presidential choice (should he win the nomination). Well, with this rather unusual and obviously pandering move   Cruz admitted he needs Fiorina to win California   Boxer wasn t going to hold back.Taking to Twitter, Boxer took Fiorina and Ted Cruz to task in the most brilliant way possible:.@TedCruz talks tough on Iran, but his  running mate  was soft on Iran when she skirted the law to sell them computer parts.  Barbara Boxer (@BarbaraBoxer) April 27, 2016 Slogan idea for the Cruz/Fiorina  ticket :  Mean & Meaner  Barbara Boxer (@BarbaraBoxer) April 27, 2016Cruz/Fiorina= a perfect match. He wants to ship immigrants out and she s a champion at shipping jobs out.  Barbara Boxer (@BarbaraBoxer) April 27, 2016 Cruz thinks Fiorina will help in California. Maybe he doesn t know Carly left after she lost by a million votes?  Barbara Boxer (@BarbaraBoxer) April 27, 2016And this last one is quite possibly the best commentary on the subject:I predict that the latest @CarlyFiorina merger will be as successful as her last one.  Barbara Boxer (@BarbaraBoxer) April 27, 2016John Dingell is the king of Twitter, and now it appears Barbara Boxer is the queen. If Ted Cruz thinks his new Hail Carly move will secure a win in California, maybe he should have considered just how much of a loser she is in California.If Boxer s prediction is correct, Cruz s merger with Fiorina will be as successful as her last one, and Donald Trump will be the nominee, thus giving us President Hillary Clinton.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New Carly Fiorina Website Gets Pushed Directly To Something She’s REALLY Gonna Hate,"As you probably know by now, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz reached deep into his bag of desperation when he decided to prematurely name Carly Fiorina as his potential vice presidential running mate. Keep in mind, it is pretty much mathematically impossible for Cruz to get the nomination through elected delegates, so his only hope is in Donald Trump not getting to the much desired 1,237 delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination. Then, Cruz can go to the convention and try his best to figure out a way to get things to go in his favor. The thing is, Trump still has the popular vote by a large margin, so the will of the people is clearly not with Cruz.Anyway, back to Fiorina.As if Ted Cruz wasn t already horrible enough on his own, he decided to double-down on people not liking him by adding a woman who is against a woman s right to choose. Not only that, she lied about Planned Parenthood, was the CEO to a company that she promptly flushed down the toilet, including outsourcing jobs, and has absolutely no public policy experience whatsoever.Speaking of Planned Parenthood, some clever person just took the website  CarlyFiorinaForVicePresident.com  and pushed it to go directly to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund donation page.carlyfiorinaforvicepresident.comNot only quick thinking on the part of whoever put this together, but absolutely, breathtakingly brilliant.Just to remind you, Carly Fiorina loved to lie time after time about Planned Parenthood, and fed directly into the  baby body parts  myth that circulated unsubstantiated for several months.The fact that now her new mythical potential to be vice president now leads people directly to donating for Planned Parenthood isn t only amazing retribution, but pure magic.Well done, internet. Well done indeed. This is what some may call   karma.Featured Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Tehran’ Tom Cotton Throws Tantrum After White House Exposes Him As Clueless Obstructionist,"The Republican senator who gained infamy last year by attempting to sabotage a historic nuclear deal with Iran is back at it again   this time by trying to derail a crucial appropriations bill so America is forced to violate the agreement.Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton got the moniker  Tehran Tom  after he and many of his Republican colleagues in the senate sent a brazenly out of line letter directly to the Iranian capitol in an effort to convince the country to stop negotiating with President Obama. The plan not only backfired (the Iranians delighted in mocking the Republicans), but it led to a major backlash from across the country. Politics may be getting nasty, but it seems betraying your country to score a cheap shot against the president still crosses a major line.Unable to understand when he has lost, Cotton has since been working behind the scenes to undermine the agreement any way he can. This week, he and his loyal band of obstructionists introduced an amendment intentionally meant to rankle relations between the two countries. Cotton had tried to bar the purchase of  heavy water produced in Iran.  Heavy water is  a component of making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy.  Part of the deal with Iran involved the country handing over its stock of heavy water (to show they were serious about ending their nuclear program)   but Cotton doesn t want America to take it. Why? Because then the deal would actually work.Needless to say, the White House was furious. At a press conference, Press Secretary Josh Earnest let Cotton have it: So it is clear what the intent of his amendment is. Senator Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy water. I m confident that he couldn t differentiate heavy water from sparkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Cotton is fast becoming a single-issue politician. The time and energy he pours into trying to hurt Iran-United States relation borders on pathological. Even many of his colleagues, some of whom signed his letter in 2015, have given up thinking they can stop this agreement. Not Tehran Tom. He keeps plugging away.On Twitter, Cotton did not take the news of his White House dress down well. He suggested that he, a sitting United States Senator, isn t aware the existence of  sparkling water  because he was in the military   a claim many found  dubious.As for you @PressSec , you re right, I don t know much about sparkling water. It isn t served in Army, unlike in your ritzy West Wing.

It is a message that echoes several similar statements issued by police departments seeking to defend their own, only to have supplementary video footage or testimony contradict the claims of officers on the ground.Recently the family of 12-year-old Tamir Rice entered into a legal settlement with the city of Cleveland after the child was shot and killed while holding a toy gun. In that case, police claimed the boy was reaching into his waistband, which prompted the lethal shooting.

 FREAK OUT: Republicans Will HATE That This Famous Liberal Actor Is Going To Play Ronald Reagan,"Comedian and actor Will Ferrell has been cast as former President Ronald Reagan in an upcoming movie. The former Saturday Night Live cast member is known to be a liberal, and was a supporter of President Obama. Now he will be portraying arguably the biggest icon of the conservative movement.Sources tell Variety Ferrell is attached to star as President Ronald Reagan in the Black List script  Reagan. Penned by Mike Rosolio, the story begins at the start of the ex-president s second term when he falls into dementia and an ambitious intern is tasked with convincing the commander-in-chief that he is an actor playing the president in a movie.The script was so popular following its announcement on the Black List, an annual catalog of the top unproduced scripts in Hollywood, that a live read was done recently done in March starring Lena Dunham and John Cho.Ferrell s iconic portrayal of George W. Bush on SNL was a key part of the cultural zeitgeist, cementing the image of Bush as a slow-witted, unintelligent buffoon with large segments of the public. Ferrell s version of Bush, along with Phil Hartman s interpretations of Reagan and Bill Clinton, is often seen as one of the best such parodies in the show s history. Ferrell also appeared as Bush on Broadway, in the production  You re Welcome, America. Ferrell has also appeared in several movies that have progressive themes that also lampoon conservatives. The Other Guys cast Wall Street raiders as the bad guys, ripping off police pensions; The Campaign lampooned right-wing billionaires who meddle in politics, like the Koch Brothers; and Get Hard again showcased the elite 1% as heartless bad guys, while the working class character is the ultimate hero. Several of Ferrell s films are directed by Big Short director Adam McKay, which of course is another film about the super-rich soaking the rest of America.Ferrell also starred in one of the most popular videos posted on YouTube by the Obama campaign (over 5 million views), where he promised to do anything in exchange for a vote to re-elect the president:Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Speaker Of The Big House: Child Molester Dennis Hastert To Spend Over A Year In Jail,"Former Speaker Of The House Dennis Hastert got handed the sentence of 15 months in prison for monetary payoffs he made to keep his sexual abuse of young boys silent. The judge in the case called him a  serial child molester,  and also ordered him to enroll in a sex-offender treatment program.Hastert was accused of molesting 4 boys aged 14 to 17, during his time as a coach at Yorkville High School in Illinois. The case came to light when one of them finally broke decades of silence on Hastert s conduct.If you re thinking 15 months for molesting 4 boys is outrageous, you d be correct. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations has expired on the molestation cases. This forced the court to focus on illegal cash withdrawals that Hastert made to pay hush-money in order to keep the crimes buried.As is always the case with your average Republican who does something criminal, there is a news reel of them being hypocritical by attacking others for somewhat similar conduct. Hastert was a very vocal critic of then-President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clearly, Bill was not in any sense as despicable as Hastert. However, that didn t stop Hastert from strongly attacking Clinton for it.Dennis Hastert on the House floor, 1998:When the allegations first came to light, Hastert did what all Republicans do; blame the victim. His initial response was to claim that the money withdrawal was because HE was the one being victimized by a blackmailer over a baseless claim of sexual abuse. This didn t end up working well for Hastert because the judge used it to hand down an even stronger sentence to him, with the judge telling him,  You tried to make him a victim again. U.S. Attorney comments on Hastert:This is yet another case of the universal hypocrisy that is a chronic condition of the Republican party. During a time when Republicans everywhere are trying to pass bathroom laws to  protect people  from the theorized molestations they believe will occur if a transgender individual uses a public bathroom, their party heroes keep getting nailed for doing the very thing they claim to hate.Here s a better idea. Since Republican men do this more than transgender individuals, we will make a  Republican Men s Bathroom.  We can do voter ID checks to make sure Republican men can only use their assigned bathroom because it s a  public safety issue,  as they like to say regarding their anti-LGBT bathroom laws. While we re at it, we can make Republican male-only movie theaters, restaurants and stores to help protect the public from mass shooters.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Taxpayers Billed $800,000 A Year For Prayers In Congress","American taxpayers are being charged more than $66,000 an hour for prayers said in the US House and Senate.  The total cost per prayer, which lasts an average of 90 seconds, is a whopping $1,659.According to Andrew Seidel of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who did the math to determine what taxpayers are being charged for prayers in Washington, the total annual bill comes to more than $800,000.Both the U.S. House and Senate employ a chaplain whose singular duty is to administer prayer. The budget for the House Chaplain s office is $345,000, while the Senate Chaplain s office receives $436,886.Seidel reports that both the House and Senate chaplains earn executive level salaries which are equal to those of high-ranking government officials, such as  general counsels of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the chief financial officers of NASA and the EPA; the Chief Information Officers of almost every major federal department and agency; and the Army s Director of Civil Defense. The two chaplains earn three-figure salaries for presiding over opening prayers in the house and senate, which only convene about 135 days out of the year.Seidel reports:And even with those fat salaries, the official chaplains let  guest chaplains  deliver many of the prayers about 40% in the House. The House chaplains gave 1,341 invocations over the 16 years from 2000-2015, or about 84 invocations each year. Guest chaplains gave another 857 over that same span. Congress is budgeting more than three-quarters of a million dollars every year for chaplains to give these prayers or coordinate the guest chaplains  prayers.As Seidel explains here, in 2011 the House Chaplain delivered just 104 prayers, lasting an average of 90 seconds each. That s about 2.6 hours of work. For that he was paid $172,500, or $66,346 an hour.Over the 15-year period between 2000 and 2015, US taxpayers spent $10 million on prayers in Washington. In the meantime, elected officials slashed spending on essential programs like WIC and SNAP as well as other assistance for the vulnerable.The idea that taxpayers are being billed exorbitant amounts of money for prayers, all while right-wing politicians screech about the national debt and wasteful government spending, is beyond outrageous.The church is not government and government is not a church. Everyone is free to exercise their religious beliefs in the U.S. Using millions of dollars in taxpayer money to support daily prayers in Washington, however, is not even close to acceptable.The Freedom From Religion Foundation is encouraging voters to make their voices heard on this issue by contacting their elected representatives here and here.Image credit: Wikipedia",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Carly Fiorina Bursting Into Song At Cruz Rally Is The Most Bizarre Thing You’ll Ever See (VIDEO),"Just when you thought things couldn t get weirder, Carly Fiorina bursts into song.It all happened during the Ted Cruz rally where he named Fiorina his vice presidential choice if he were to somehow magically secure enough delegates for the GOP nomination.The entire publicity stunt of adding Fiorina just reeks of desperation from the Cruz campaign. It s very reminiscent of what President McCain John McCain did in 2008 to try to appeal to voters in a last-ditched effort to try to become president, and we all know how that turned out.Nonetheless, Fiorina accepted his request to run on his imaginary ticket, so she spoke to the crowd at his latest rally in Indiana.She spoke in fluent conservative-speak, saying things like: A President Ted Cruz will restore power back where it belongs in the hands of citizens,  and  This is the fight of our time, and I believe Ted Cruz is the man to lead that fight. Along with a boatload of other malarkey.Then, as if from out of nowhere, she started singing about Ted Cruz s daughters. Now, some may think,  aww, that sounds delightful,  but those people clearly don t know Carly Fiorina. It was a mixture of weird and very creepy, and most definitely cringeworthy, to the point where you couldn t wait until the moment was over.This move by Cruz is definitely odd and sort of unprecedented, but it will be interesting to see how it works out for him.Watch the strange serenade here:WATCH: @CarlyFiorina bursts into song after @tedcruz names her his running mate https://t.co/2RAbmQaqkV https://t.co/xRcCJ51mvN  MSNBC (@MSNBC) April 27, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Israeli PM Rejects Obama’s $40 Billion Aid Offer, Demands More While America’s Children Go Hungry","The state of Israel currently receives a staggering $3 billion a year in so-called aid, much of it for its military, which is then used to brutalize the Palestinian people in the form of a military occupation and a settlement apparatus of land theft that is illegal under international law. With the current agreement set to expire in 2017, Israel wants a raise. They are now asking for an estimated $5 billion a year over the next ten years, for a total of more than $50 billion.Despite the fact that we can use this money at home to help America s 16 million children who live below the poverty level, Israel s prime minister not only is asking for more money, but he had the nerve to reject President Obama s offer of $40 billion over the next ten years. Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israelis are using their pull in Washington to get the POTUS to play by their rules. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a lobby group in Washington that works on behalf of a foreign country (Israel) often through the coercion and arm twisting of American officials, just got 83 U.S. senators to sign a letter demanding that the president send money to Israel. The letter states: In light of Israel s dramatically rising defense challenges, we stand ready to support a substantially enhanced new long-term agreement to help provide Israel the resources it requires to defend itself and preserve its qualitative military edge. Not surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders was not one of the signatories to the letter. The senator has recognized not only that Israel uses disproportionate force on Palestinian civilians through weapons the U.S. gives to Israel, but he also knows the alarming poverty rate that exists in our own backyard with a staggering number of children living in food insecure homes: Another element to this insane demand for money from a country supposedly in need is that Israelis enjoy free universal healthcare and education. American households incur billions in debt just so their children can be able to go to school. Moreover, many Americans continue to have no access to healthcare and Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare.It s time for America to take care of its children, its sick, and its hungry. It s time for America s politicians to worry about America first instead of an ungrateful country that doesn t require aid but rather needs to be stopped and sanctioned for its brutality against the Palestinian people.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons ",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BREAKING: Cruz Names Carly Fiorina As His VP Running Mate,"After suffering debilitating losses in five northeastern states   Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania   and his  alliance  with John Kasich crumbling after only two days, Ted Cruz needed to find a way to stop GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.And he found the way   at least he thinks he does.The Cruz campaign announced Wednesday afternoon that failed CEO, failed Senate candidate, failed presidential candidate and largely disliked Carly Fiorina will be the Texas Senator s VP running mate.Simply put, this is Ted Cruz  sad, pathetic attempt at a hail Mary to pander to female GOP voters (who loath Trump). And what s even sadder is Cruz only picked Fiorina out of sheer logistics   not because he necessarily likes her or thinks she would be a good Vice President. According to Politico:The hope within the campaign is that Fiorina will help Cruz in California, which will award 172 delegates on June 7. Fiorina is scheduled to give the keynote address at this weekend s California Republican Party convention, speaking hours after Cruz takes the stage.The move comes at a time of growing desperation within Cruz circles. Some in the campaign worry that the Texas senator will lose Indiana on Tuesday and lose other key states in May, paving the way for a Trump nomination.Yes, the women who helped dent Silicon Valley and lost a statewide election to Barbara Boxer by 10 percent is the perfect choice for Cruz s California comeback. As it becomes increasingly clear that Trump s negative image will spell certain doom for the GOP in November, Cruz has literally taken it upon himself to pull a John McCain circa 2008. Only this time America knows who Fiorina is, and they don t like her very much.Fiorina suspended her campaign after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire and subsequently endorsed Cruz, traveling he country as a surrogate for his campaign.The decision was two weeks in the making as reports surfaced the Cruz campaign was heavily vetting the former CEO, and placed her at the top of a  serious  contender list for V.P. Never before has a losing candidate pulled such a desperate maneuver to save their campaign. Hopefully this comes back to bite them both in the behind. The GOP is tired of panderers.Featured image via Gerardo Mora/Getty Images",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michael Jordan Condemns North Carolina Anti-LGBT Law,"North Carolina Republicans just got slam-dunked by the greatest NBA player of all time.Their bigotry has cost the state many economic opportunities since HB2 was signed into law. Corporations are cancelling projects. Entertainers are cancelling performances. The federal government is looking into stopping the flow of federal cash into the state. The NBA has threatened to pull the All-Star game out of the state. Yet Republicans are refusing to repeal the law that literally allows business owners to discriminate against LGBT people.It s all because Republicans are obsessed with transgender people using the bathroom.According to conservatives, the law is necessary to protect women and children from sexual predators whom they claim will use transgender protections as a shield to defend going into women s restrooms and locker rooms to commit sexual assault. But that claim has been debunked, even by Fox News, because there has not been a single instance of that scenario occurring in the 17 states and over 200 cities that have transgender protections in place.Now NBA legend Michael Jordan has spoken out against the law, declaring in a statement that the Charlotte Hornets organization does not support discrimination and that the Time Warner Cable Arena will continue to be a safe and inclusive place for everyone.Jordan issued the following statement through the Charlotte Observer on April 27: As my organization has stated previously, the Charlotte Hornets and Hornets Sports & Entertainment are opposed to discrimination in any form, and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment. As has been the case since the building opened, we will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending NBA games and events in Time Warner Cable Arena. This should be considered a strong statement by His Airness considering his history of declining to get involved in politics.Jordan was raised in North Carolina. He went to high school there and attended college at the University of North Carolina where he played basketball for the Tar Heels before being drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984. He would go on to win six championships with the Bulls and is widely regarded as the best player in the history of the game.He is now the owner of the Charlotte Hornets and is considered one of the most influential and powerful figures in the state, so this statement carries a lot of weight. Now one just has to wonder how long it will be before Republicans pass a bill specifically banning transgender people from using the bathroom at the Time Warner Cable Arena.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Gets ROASTED By The White House For Embarrassing Teleprompter Moment (VIDEO),"Up until recently, we ve all been witnessing Donald Trump speak freely with nothing really prepared except for the usual crumpled sheet of paper he d pull out of his coat pocket to read the latest poll numbers to tell us how wonderful he is. However, with clinching the Republican nomination getting closer and closer, he s trying (and failing) to be more refined. Which includes using a teleprompter to read speeches that are prepared for him.During his foreign policy speech on Wednesday, it was painfully awkward to watch. You could hear him reading the speech, which did not come across naturally whatsoever. Watching his head swiftly move from side to side to give the illusion that he was speaking freely was more clumsy than a first date in the dark.Then came the moment when he was trying to be serious and speak about some foreign policy blunders, and he spoke about when some of our embassies overseas were compromised. However, his reading off the teleprompter proved this is probably the first time he has ever heard of the places of which he was speaking.For example, he read: Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. But SAID: Our embassies in Kenya and Tan-ZANE-ia. Small blunder? Sure, but one that was surely noticed by all and just another example of Trump s clear ineptitude.Donald Trump has a pretty interesting way of pronouncing Tanzania. #tanzaynia https://t.co/2ygcnhCVKF  DOPEITSTOM (@DOPEITSTOM) April 27, 2016Taking notice of this blunder was none other than, well, pretty much everyone- but also White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. When questioned about the moment, Earnest quipped: Apparently phonetics are not included on the teleprompter. Watch here:""Apparently, the phonetics are not included on the teleprompter."" @PressSec on Donald Trump foreign policy address.https://t.co/ORuNELmrne  CSPAN (@cspan) April 27, 2016All in all, it shows how ill-prepared Trump is at not only addressing the nation, but also reading.

 Students LOSE IT After Conservative Speaker Tells Them Feminism Is ‘Cancer’ (VIDEO),"On Monday, Milo Yiannopoulos   an editor for conservative website Breitbart   offended students at the University of Massachusetts when he told them that feminism was a  cancer  on society during a panel about political correctness organized by the school s College Republicans group.Let s just say those misogynistic conservative views didn t go over too well. While some students were cheering for the panel, it was clear that several students did not like what the conservative speakers had to say. Once Yiannopoulos announced,  Feminism is cancer. Thank you very much,  everything began to go downhill. It didn t take long before one brave, outspoken female student began to protest, shouting  F*ck you! F*ck you!  to Yiannopoulos and called him a  rape apologist. As Christina Hoff Sommers, another speaker on the panel, tried to ignore the inflammatory situation happening in the audience by moving onto the subject of how evil third-wave feminism was, the protester continued to only get louder. The student shouted over everyone, This is free speech! Keep your hate speech off this campus!  She added,  Stop talking to us like children! Sommers fired back at the student,  Then stop acting like a child! The entire assembly quickly fell apart, causing chaos to errupt as several more students began objecting to the panel s misogynistic views.You can watch the insane footage from the event below, courtesy of college news website Campus Reform:The students disrupted the panel so much that Yiannopoulos actually threatened to donate $50 to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s campaign every time they were interrupted.Sadly, Yiannopoulos wasn t the only a**hole speaker disrespecting the students at this gathering. While addressing the packed audience of students, conservative comedian Steven Crowder called the protesters  silly liberal fruitcakes  when they tried to counter the speakers hateful rhetoric. Crowder was also kind enough to remind the students that Yiannopoulos   Dangerous Faggot Tour  was a response to protesters like themselves. He said,  This monster right here that you re so afraid of   the face you see in your nightmares, was created by social justice warrior a**holes like you. Just to prove what a misogynist Yiannopoulos really is, this is what he tweeted after the event:NEW CLUB BANGER https://t.co/ZGcq1Pcp6e  Milo Yiannopoulos   (@Nero) April 27, 2016The anti-woman attitude of the entire panel is extremely disgusting.

 The Satanic Temple Trolls Anti-Abortion Fanatics Into Stunned Silence (VIDEOS),"One of the greatest institutions in America right now is the Satanic Temple. Their mission is simple: Mock, troll and thwart conservative Christian encroachment into our lives. To this end, the Detroit chapter of the church took to the streets of Ferndale and Detroit dressed unconventionally  to expose the creepy obsession the  pro-life  movement has with fetuses:According to the Temple s Detroit chapter leader, Jex Blackmore,  the anti-choice movement s obsession with, and mischaracterization of the fetus obscures medical reality and a woman s constitutional right to choice. The group dressed in baby masks and diapers, replete with BDSM gear, bottles and baby powder.Watch the really funny but reeeealllly creepy videos: Sooooooooo yeah. That actually happened. BDSM babies being flogged for their sins? I dunno. But the leader of the group, Jex Blackmore, refers to the attacks on Planned Parenthood as  fetal idolatry  which might possibly be the best description I ve ever heard. The fact is, the (mostly) conservative Christian fight against abortion is centered around  protecting  the fetus until the second it s out of the womb. Then the little moocher and its  taker  mother are on their own. Don t come asking for food, clothes, healthcare, schooling or anything else! The pro-life  movement doesn t have time for any of that! They re on a mission from god to save babies from abortion!Worship the fetus, ignore the baby. If that s not fetal idolatry, I don t know what is. Here s how Blackmore describes it:The Satanic Temple (TST) believes that the anti-choice movement s obsession with, and mischaracterization of the fetus obscures medical reality and a woman s constitutional right to choice. Enlarged images of fetuses which are no larger than an inch and the personalization of mindless, senseless human embryos elevates the fetus to the status of a demigod. The strategy of elevating tiny human em br yos and fetuses to a rever ence creates a fantasy in which the maternal body is both erased and criminalized.All I have to say to that is,  Hail Satan!

 John McCain Fundraiser BUSTED For Operating A Meth Lab In Her Home (VIDEO),"Senator John McCain got some bad news on Tuesday when the women listed as the RSVP on his re-election fundraisers was arrested on drug charges.According to AZ Central, 34-year-old Emily Pitha, a former member of the staff of retired U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., was one of two people who were arrested after the Maricopa County Sheriff s Department raided her house. When police entered her home they discovered a meth lab, LSD, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, counterfeit money, about $7,000 in cash and a marijuana grow house behind the home.In addition to all of the drugs and cash, two children were in the home (5 and 10). Detective Doug Matteson said: [The kids] had easy access to all of (the) drugs and materials, even the bomb-making materials that were located in the back with the meth lab. A Maricopa County Sheriff s Office spokesman said authorities executed the search warrant after a package containing over 250 grams of raw ecstasy (MDMA) from the Netherlands was delivered to the house.McCain s campaign manager, Ryan O Daniel, released a statement following the raid, saying: We commend the hard work and dedication of our law enforcement officers in their fight to keep our community safe from illegal drugs and associated criminal activity. The campaign immediately terminated any relationship with Ms. Pitha upon learning of her alleged involvement in the operation. It s a bit awkward that McCain s campaign is now embroiled in a drug scandal, when the senator has spent so much time claiming that he is tough on drugs. Perhaps he should tone down the rhetoric if he is not going to bother to properly vet the people associated with him.

 Rachel Maddow EVISCERATES Trump For His ‘Woman’s Card’ Comments About Hillary (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, Republican front runner Donald Trump made the horrendous mistake of dissing leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, saying that she was unqualified to be a candidate and that she only had the  woman s card to help her win over voters.Specifically, Trump had said, The only thing she s got going is the woman s card. And the beautiful thing is, women don t like her.  He also added that if Clinton were a man, she would only get  5 percent of the vote. (Obviously, Trump has forgotten about all of these qualifications and accomplishments Clinton has worked for over the years).Later that day, NBC host Rachel Maddow properly ripped Trump for his comments, pointing out what an idiot he was for continuing his long history of misogynistic, sexist comments and pushing female voters even further away. Maddow told co-host Brian Williams: As our colleague and friend Nicolle Wallace pointed out earlier this evening, Donald Trump does have a general election problem. Even if he gets this nomination, even if everything goes the way it has been for him during the primary as he heads toward the general election, he brings with him a big problem with women voters.To say about the woman that you re running against that the only reason she s in the race is because she s a woman   that her achievement is basically the result of some sort of affirmative action, some favor being paid to her as a woman   and that as a human being she is patently unqualified when she is the former two-term senator from New York and the former secretary of state and has the experience that she s had, I do think that even a lot of Republican women will read that wrong. It s literally baffling and somewhat amusing to think that Trump believes that female voters would connect with a sexist, misogynist candidate like himself. What Trump may not realize is that women actually hate him WAY more than they dislike Clinton. According to a survey by Morning Consult, a nonpartisan firm, only 39% of women view Clinton unfavorably, compared to a whopping 52% for Trump.You can watch Maddow blast Trump below:Featured image via screen capture",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Colbert Outs Republicans As The True Weirdos For Obsessing Over Who Goes To The Bathroom (VIDEO),"Late Show host Stephen Colbert hilariously took aim at bathroom obsessed Republicans on Tuesday night and hit the bulls-eye.Colbert began by talking about how anti-LGBT conservatives have organized a boycott of Target because the company unveiled a policy in which transgender people can use the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. And then he told the audience where he stands on the issue. Here s the thing. I don t care if you re male or female, what sex or gender identity someone is, I   and I mean this sincerely   do not want to share a bathroom with anyone. For two reasons: No. 1   and No. 2,  Colbert began.Unlike Republicans, Colbert says when he goes into the restroom he has no desire to look at everyone s genitalia to ascertain whether they are transgender or not. When I am forced to use a public bathroom   which is infrequently, thank God   I go in there with blinders on. I don t know who s next to me. It could be a centaur next to me, for all I know. I don t even like to look at myself in the mirror afterwards. I know what I did. I m there for a surgical strike   get in, get out, minimal casualties. Colbert doesn t even care if a famous celebrity or a fan is standing next to him. He simply wants to do his business with no chit-chat and get the hell out. I m not there to make friends. If we ve just come out of a movie and you re standing next to me, I don t want to talk about how irreplaceable Robert Downey Jr. is as Iron Man. I don t care if you re Robert Downey Jr. yourself. Second, if you re a fan of mine   that s wonderful,  he continued.  Please don t try to shake my hand in there. Because I know what you just shook. Also, if there are a bunch of open stalls, don t take the one next to me. It s not the buddy system. With that being said, Colbert concluded that Republicans are the real weirdos for obsessing so much over who is using the bathroom and what their genitalia is. To all those lawmakers out there who are so obsessed with who s using what bathroom and what plumbing they ve got downtown   newsflash: You re the weirdos. Here s the video via YouTube.Colbert is absolutely right, of course.Republicans are not only obsessed with gay people having sex, they are obsessed with who is using the bathroom. In fact, they actually expect people to inspect the genitalia of other bathroom users and report them to authorities.Kansas Republicans recently introduced a pair of bills granting students $2,500 every time they see and report a transgender student using the bathroom, which means they would actually have to look at what each person has between their legs in order to cash-in.The fact that conservatives even thought of such bills is sickening. And considering that Republicans themselves have been arrested for misconduct in bathrooms while not a single transgender person has committed such a crime, it makes one wonder why we don t have laws banning conservatives from using public restrooms. After all, they seem to be the only ones who can t control themselves.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 You Won’t Believe What This Michigan Teacher Said That Got Her Fired,"A Battle Creek, Michigan substitute teacher has been fired because she had the audacity to say  vagina. Allison Wint said that she has been teaching at Harper Creek Middle School since January, but was recently let go after she used the word during a discussion about art history with a class she was teaching. She said that she just wanted to have an open discussion with the eighth graders about art and the controversies surrounding some artists  work. During the lecture she held up a reproduction of some of Georgia O Keefe s work and said: Imagine walking into a gallery when [O Keefe] was first showing her pieces, and thinking,  Am I actually seeing vaginas here, am I a pervert? I m either a pervert or this woman was a pervert. The teacher said she used the word vagina  maybe 10 times. But it was never in a vulgar capacity.  She went on to say: I thought if I used a euphemism, that would make it into a joke,  she said.  And I don t think that s a word you should be afraid of. Unfortunately, school officials did not agree and fired her. The day after her lesson, the school s principal, Kim Thayer, fired her for using the word  vagina   without previous approval.  Who knew that using the proper medical terminology for a part of a female s anatomy was no longer allowed in schools? Maybe the principal would have preferred she say  whoo-ha  or some nonsense like that?Let s be real, it is a sad day in the American educational system when proper terms for body parts are off limits because they offend an adult s delicate sensibilities. How the hell are our children supposed to learn if they aren t even taught basic things like  vagina  is not a bad word? Being afraid of the word   creates an aura of shame around the body part,  Wint said.Indeed.Not only is it important for students to know that it is not a dirty word, knowing the proper names for anatomically correct terms helps to combat sexual abuse. According to Think Progress:Perhaps most importantly, teaching kids to use the accurate words for their body parts teaches them that they have ownership over their body, provides a positive boost to their self-image, and increases their confidence. That could have radical implications for our current society s pervasive rape culture, which advances the false perception that sexual assault is merely a consequence of promiscuity rather than a serious crime. If youth grow up with a deeper understanding of bodily autonomy and consent, they will be more likely to speak up when they feel that consent has been violated   and perhaps less likely to violate someone else s consent.There is absolutely no reason at all that this teacher should have been fired for using a word that these kids should have ALREADY been comfortable hearing. The fact that it was considered  inappropriate  demonstrates how much Battle Creek has already failed their kids.Wint said that the only other time she has had a problem with the principal was when she hung a sign that the students made her behind her desk. The sign read Marriage is about love, not gender.  Thayer told her to remove it.It sounds like Thayer is one of those right-wing, religious nuts who have no business overseeing a school. If she can t shelve her personal feelings about things before she goes into work, then she really has no business holding the position she does.Featured image via Detroit Free Press",News,"April 27, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 A Restaurant Worker Has Moved Millions With This Act Of Kindness To A Disabled Customer (IMAGE),"Footage of a Georgia restaurant worker taking time out to support a disabled customer with no hands is moving millions around the world.The restaurant worker, known only as Alex, has become a viral internet star overnight after another diner at the Cinco De Mayo Mexican Grill in Douglasville, Georgia captured him helping out a disabled diner  by feeding him his dinner.

He watched as Alex carefully put together forkfuls of food for the man with no hands, and then feed them to him. Widener was so moved, he took the picture and shared online on Sunday, saying: This seriously hit me right in the soul. Still good [people] in the world. Interviewed on the matter later by CBS News, Widener added: Southern hospitality is real down here. People do kind things all the time that s above and beyond what normally happens. He was also thrilled that the image had provoked such a powerful response across the country, and the world. Widener felt Alex deserved to enjoy the moment, and to be acknowledged for making a difference every day in his job. Commenters from around the world were certainly keen to make their views known.Erick Watkins wrote: That s awesome, bro. I would have gave him a tip myself just for doing that! ShanBama Ryder added: God bless him for real. That s a great dude right there. At a time when those working in America s food service industry are fighting to be paid enough to survive, this incredible moment serves as a reminder of the extraordinary people we have working the tables of the United States.

 Watch Chris Christie’s Wife Roll Her Eyes At Trump’s Sexist ‘Woman Card’ Remark (VIDEO),"After a clean sweep of victories for Donald Trump on Tuesday night, he quickly took this as an indicator that he is the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party. He also took it as the perfect time to completely start to try to throw Hillary Clinton under the bus.There s nothing a misogynist is more fearful of than a strong woman, let alone a strong woman who has actual policy proposals and far more experience for the job you re vying to have. And with Hillary Clinton nearly clinching the Democratic nomination for president, and Trump close to clinching the Republican nomination, he went directly after Clinton for being a woman. Even claiming the only reason she s doing well is because of the  woman card. He said: The only card she has is the woman s card. She s got nothing else going. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don t think she d get five percent of the vote. The only thing she s got going is the woman s card, and the beautiful thing is, women don t like her. Well, one woman who clearly didn t like all this talk of the  woman s card  was Mary Pat Christie, wife of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was standing directly behind Trump. When he uttered that phrase, she very visibly rolled her eyes.Christie s reaction was likely that of every woman across the nation who doesn t hate themselves for being a woman. Trump is showing that he is absolutely terrified of Hillary Clinton, otherwise he wouldn t say such a ridiculous thing to try to sway the vote. Hillary has more proper policy experience in her pinky finger than Trump does in all ten of his tiny fingers.Keep showing your true colors, Trump, because more women just like Christie s wife will be setting the narrative for your campaign as they roll their eyes at your clear ineptitude rolling into November..@ChrisChristie's wife Mary Pat reacts to @realDonaldTrump during his ""woman's card"" comments on @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/yNKo8wE6tv  POLITICO (@politico) April 27, 2016Miss it?

While a triumph for the candidate as he moved close to the psychologically significant 1,000 delegate mark on his way to the 1,237 needed to win the nomination, he also made remarks that could foretell the death of all Republican hopes.At the end of a long, directionless, rambling press conference and victory celebration, Trump decided to unleash a sexist attack on Hillary Clinton that is sure to echo with many American women who have been put down in the workplace.Donald Trump: ""If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5% of the vote."" https://t.co/Z5FJK1qaf8https://t.co/IhBbfhcRVv  ABC News (@ABC) April 27, 2016Trump told his supporters and the reporters on scene:  If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don t think she d get 5% of the vote.  He added,  women don t like Hillary. In fact, polls have shown that it is Trump s historic unpopularity with especially women voters, thanks to his long track record of sexist, misogynistic, and insulting attacks on women like Megyn Kelly and Rosie O Donnell, that have Clinton well-positioned to beat him.Chris Christie s wife, Mary Pat, grimaced as Trump made his sexist attack:Mary Pat Christie made this face behind Trump after his comments about Clinton and the woman card pic.twitter.com/oIxm9XRp2d  Tal Kopan (@TalKopan) April 27, 2016Earlier in the evening, Clinton responded to Trump s previous whining that her candidacy was based on  playing the woman card,  telling her supporters to raucous applause:  Deal me in. The Republican Party was already in trouble with female voters before they were saddled with a nominee like Donald Trump. The party has lost the female vote in every presidential election since 1992, losing that key demographic even when they have won the overall election.The party has tried to keep its positions that are unpopular with women out of the public spotlight, preferring to fight against abortion and birth control at the state level, rather than nationally. But with a female candidate the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party, along with a slate of women nominees running for Senate seats across the country, this could turn out to be a nightmare of epic proportions for the GOP.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary NAILS Response To Trump’s Accusations Of ‘Playing The Woman Card’ (VIDEO),"As exit polls roll in for the latest batch of states to vote in this election cycle s hotly contested primaries, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton turns her attentions to Donald Trump. Ever the unrepentant sexist, Trump recently accused Clinton of  playing the woman card  to get votes away from Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders. In her speech this evening as the latest primary votes roll in, the former Secretary of State addressed Trump s uncalled for comments. Clinton said: Now, the other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the, quote,  woman card.  Well, if fighting for women s healthcare and paid family leave and equal is  playing the woman card,  then DEAL ME IN! Secretary Clinton is right, of course. GOP sexists like Trump like to try and make people believe that women are equal citizens in this country. We are not; in fact, far from it. There is most definitely a war on women s reproductive health rights, the GOP refuses to pass equal pay laws, and sexism is rampant all over the place   including in this very presidential primary. People who accuse folks of playing the  woman card  or the  gay card  or the  black card  are simply bigots who don t understand the existence of systemic inequality.This response was right on the money, Secretary Clinton. Thank for letting that sexist imbecile Trump have it.Watch the video of her brilliant response below:Featured image via Eric Thayer/Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox Host Gives Conservatives The Best Advice For How They Should Vote In November (VIDEO),"Conservative voters should definitely do this.A Fox News host finally came up with a good idea that would truly make America great again.During Fox and Friends on Tuesday, the show s newest host Ainsley Earhardt suggested that conservative  Christians  vote via prayer and let God decide who the next president will be.Religious nut Kirk Cameron s equally super religious sister Candace Cameron Bure joined the show as a guest and was asked her opinion on how to get Republicans to unite behind a single candidate.Current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is in the middle of a fight with Ted Cruz over the Republican nomination which has split party extremists while alienating moderates. I don t know what it s going to take,  Bure said after conceding that she is NOT a political expert.  But I m an American and I hold conservative values, and I think at the end of the day, I realize I put my faith in Jesus Christ, not in any one person. Of course, Jesus is not a candidate for president but Bure promised to pray for whoever wins anyway. Whoever becomes our candidate, our nominee and eventually our president, I will pray for them and support that they make the best decisions for our country,  she continued.Earhardt, who replaced Elisabeth Hasselbeck on the panel when the latter stepped down in 2015, then suggested the idea that conservatives should just pray and let God decide who the nominee will be. As in, they should pray their votes into the ballot box and see if God counts them himself and whispers the name of the winner into the ear of the people who are supposed to count the votes. I know your faith is important to you as it is to many of us. Do you feel like in this election, we just pray about it and give it to God? And God s going to pick the right candidate? Bure balked at the suggestion and urged conservatives to physically vote at the ballot box for the candidate of their choice.Here s the video via YouTube.But Earhardt s idea should be given a fair chance by conservatives to work, especially if they really believe in the power of prayer and God s will. That s why they should sit at home on November 8th and just pray their vote to God by repeating the name of whichever Republican ends up on the ballot. Not only would conservatives be leaving the fate of the election in God s hands, they wouldn t have to stand in the incredibly long lines their Republican legislatures created by cutting voting hours and polling places.And when the Democrat wins, conservatives should concede that God has spoken and stop whining for at least the next four years while the chosen one does what is best for the American people   even if Republicans don t like it.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jane Sanders Smacks Down Trump’s Idiotic Suggestion That Bernie Betray The Democratic Party (VIDEO),"Donald Trump wants Bernie Sanders to be the Donald Trump of the Democratic race   and that just isn t happening.In a move that suggests Donald Trump is getting more and more worried about his general election chances beyond the primaries, he sent a tweet to his followers that suggested Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders abandon the party and go independent.Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats both with delegates & otherwise. He should show them, and run as an Independent!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2016It s not a surprising suggestion coming from Trump, considering the fact that he has repeatedly threatened to bail on the Republican Party if things didn t go his way in the election. Just last week, Trump said if he lost he would not endorse whoever beat him, opting instead to  never be seen again.  We should be so lucky.But while Trump continues to set fire to the GOP, Jane Sanders threw cold water on Trump s attempt to spread the wildfire to the left. Speaking with CNN s Wolf Blitzer, she emphatically said that her husband would not be running as an independent if he didn t get the nomination..@janeosanders responds to Donald Trump:  Bernie will not be running as an independent  https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/5RLWPlv1zA  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) April 26, 2016Without blinking, Sanders told Blitzer that  we ve been very clear right from the beginning that we will not play the role of spoiler.  And as if to make it even clearer, added:  Bernie will not be running as an independent. In short, the stakes are just too high. When the alternatives are a bigot like Donald Trump or a  dangerous  anti-government zealot like Ted Cruz, liberals need to unite rather than allow themselves to be divided. As Jane Sanders said, the electoral system may not be perfect, but: We cannot afford a Republican in the White House. We cannot afford a Republican appointing Supreme Court justices. Jane Sanders  comments echo that of President Obama, who recently said it has been a  difficult time for Republicans  (surely an understatement), but things were looking up for Democrats.We have two fine Democratic candidates who, no matter their differences, share this same set of core beliefs that defines our party. And in November, we re going to make sure that one of them becomes our next president.It s clear that there is only one political party in danger of being torpedoed by one of its own candidates, and it s not the Democrats.Featured image via video screen capture/Twitter",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch This NC HB2 Republican Spew Utterly VILE LGBT Hatred: ‘Keep Our State Straight!’ (VIDEO),"Republicans in the state of North Carolina really need to get a better hobby, because legislating hate and constantly disparaging the LGBT community is getting really tired. It s almost as if they have nothing better to do, and they believe hating on people is just so much darn fun.One of the ring leaders of all this hatred is Republican State Senator Buck Newton. He s very proud of the new discriminatory law HB2, which prohibits Transgender individuals from using the proper bathroom. He also doesn t care who thinks he s wrong about the law, because, you know, God. Because his Almighty would apparently want him to discriminate against others based upon misinformed opinions and personal distastes.Now, at a rally in Raleigh, NC, Newton is continuing the charge against the LGBT community. This time even being so bold as to say: Go home, tell your friends and family who had to work today what this is all about and how hard we must fight to keep our state straight. Yep, no beating around the bush, he just came out and said it. He doesn t want any LGBT people in the state of North Carolina.What s even scarier? Newton is the Republican nominee for attorney general.Newton also said: We all know that the folks that wave the rainbow flags and things like that are politically very upset about the way things are today. They re upset about the way things have always been in this state And they re bound and determined to try to change it, whether it s by winning elections in the city of Charlotte on their city council or whether it s wining elections in November in the General Assembly or whether it s winning elections in November for our governor. Good. Hopefully they do.Then, to reiterate his hatred and complete ineptitude of the Trans community, Newton said: Now it s been said that there are many, many, many, many more sexual predators on the sex offender list than there are transgender people. And we can all feel sympathy for folks who are having difficult times, because we all know folks that have a difficult time, whether folks are struggling with drugs, are struggling with their marriages, figuring out what it is that they re supposed to be doing in life. We can all have sympathy for that. But that does not mean that we should expose our wives and our sisters and our children to the sexual predators in the bathrooms. What an asshole. No, seriously. Transgender individuals are not  sexual predators.  However, you know what group of individuals has been caught time and time again with their pants down? Republican men.This hate-speech is merely going to fuel the fire of an already fiery war to combat HB2 and its legislated hatred of LGBT individuals. Businesses have already pulled out, performers refusing to perform, and the entire nation has its eyes on North Carolina and what they plan to do next.This man does not belong in public office, because he is not a public servant, but rather a self-serving prick who writes laws to spread his own fear and hatred. Disgusting.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" POWERFUL: Men Read Hate Tweets To Female Sports Writers, What They Say Is Sickening (VIDEO)","In a powerful new web PSA video, female sports writers have some of the hateful tweets directed their way read by male sports fans. The ad was designed to highlight just how over the line online harassment has become for women, who are often the targets.The video features sports writers Sarah Spain and Julie DiCaro.Spain is a columnist for ESPN and has appeared on ESPN radio and on the network s premiere program, SportsCenter. She s written at length about the sexual assault allegations about NFL superstar Peyton Manning, pointing out that  for years the story had been treated with kid gloves. DiCaro is an anchor on a Chicago sports talk station, and has written about rape allegations against NHL player Patrick Kane.For their work, and for simply being women in the male-dominated sports media, Spain and DiCaro regularly face dehumanizing, threatening, sexist comments from men online. The website Just Not Sports worked with the writers to produce this video to highlight the problem   which is often dismissed as casual criticism, but as the video shows, is actually much sicker than that.#MoreThanMean hopes to open guys  eyes   by having them open their mouths. The video shows what happens when real sports fans read real online comments made about women sports reporters   right to their faces.In reading the statements out loud to women journalists, guys are forced to experience, sometimes for the first time, the shocking online harassment happening to women in sports day in, day out. It serves as proof most sports fans would NEVER say these things to another person   so we shouldn t type this garbage, either.The video is a strong example that shows that while relations between men and women have obviously come a long way over the last century, there is a toxic culture that tries to bully women away from issues that some men feel they own.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Alabama County Succeeds In Re-Instituting School Segregation,"The Republican-controlled southern states have done very little in recent years to scale back the impact of America s history of racism, from stubbornly supporting the Confederate flag on government property to retorting  All Lives Matter  to the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as dismissing all concerns posed by institutional, systemic, and overt racism prevalent throughout the country.In Sumter County, Alabama, a quarter of the county s children are white, but not a single one of them attends a public school. A report by Dan Carsen of a local NPR affiliate on the county s school district shows the schools are in terrible shape due to neglect and lack of funding precipitated by school segregation. They live in this county, but they will not send their children to the schools in this county,  Sumter School County Board Member Julene Delaine told Dan Carsen in an interview.  Instead, many white families send their kids to a local private academy or outside the area.  We shop in the same place. We eat at the same restaurant. So why can t our kids go to school together? Carsen also reported that while other states provide extra funding to low income school districts, Alabama does not. The state also refuses to increase taxes to compensate for the needed income. Alabama s Republican Governor, Robert Bentley, has gained a notorious reputation for corruption and abuse. He has recently been accused of having an affair with a political aide, increasing pay of his staff substantially despite the state s budget concerns after he blocked a minimum wage increase in the city of Birmingham, and is using over $1 million in taxpayer money to remodel a second Governor s mansion.In contrast to Sumter County s public schools, not a single person of color can be found in photos of Sumter County s  private school, Sumter Academy. The school s website also touts that it is a Christian based learning environment. Under the veil of emphasizing privatization over government ownership and regulation, the Christian Right has been able to succeed in inoculating themselves from having to adhere to federal laws protecting the rights of black people and other marginalized groups.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Amy Goodman: The Corporate Media Has Created ‘Trump-Land’ (VIDEO),"Democracy Now! host and award-winning journalist Amy Goodman shredded the corporate media for the role they have played in what Goodman refers to as the creation of  Trump-land. Goodman s evisceration of the media s vapid election coverage came in the form of a three-minute video spot for Aljazeera s millennial-focused media project, AJ+. In the video, Goodman points towards the findings in the 2015 Tyndall Report, which found that ABC World News Tonight gave Donald Trump 81 minutes of media coverage for every one minute of coverage of Bernie Sanders  campaign.Across all major news networks, Sanders has received 10 minutes  worth of media coverage compared to Trump s equivalent total network coverage of 234 minutes. As damning as that figure is for the corporate media, it gets worse when considering Sanders  record-shattering accomplishments.Goodman mentions one of Sanders  accomplishments that is particularly relevant in an era where corporate money largely controls elections. In March, he [Sanders] raised something like $44 million dollars. Hillary Clinton raised 29-and-change million dollars. $44 million dollars. That hasn t been done before. You break every record and there s a blip in the corporate media radar screen. It just shows how astounding it would be if he got anything near the coverage of the other candidates. Keep in mind   the vast majority of that cash was raised by small donations from his supporters, which is a feat that would have seemed impossible before the primary election started. Sanders has, for the most part, modeled his campaign funding after Eugene Debs  multiple presidential campaign runs at the beginning of the 20th Century. During those runs, Debs only took small campaign contributions from the working class. Using the digital tools of the modern age, Sanders has proven that the same model can be used effectively to run massive campaigns free from corporate influence. Furthermore, the model can be scaled to fit any campaign at any level.That means that not only has Sanders shattered historical records, but his campaign has completely changed the way political campaigns operate in the future. Given his accomplishments, his call for a political revolution should not be disregarded by the left   nor the right for that matter.It isn t surprising that the corporate media would wish to shy away from these realities. The system that has led to their dominance as super predators in the media environment is the one that secures their hegemony.You can watch the full video below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Terrorizes His Fans: ‘Lock Your Doors!’ Muslims Are Coming! (VIDEO),"On Monday, it seemed that Donald Trump has given up on his recent effort to act  presidential  and went back to his normal, fear-mongering, bigotry-fueled program at a rally in Rhode Island. Sensing that far too much time had gone by without an anti-Muslim rant, the Republican frontrunner urged his fans to  lock their doors  to stay safe from Syrian refugees that were resettled in the state.Suggesting that these refugees were affiliated with ISIS, Trump warned: Now here s one I don t like. Syrian refugees are now being resettled in Rhode Island. The crowd ate it up and booed the news Trump had just shared as he read off a piece of paper. He continued: We don t know who these people are. We don t know where they re from. We don t know where they re from. They have no documentation. We all have hearts and we can build safe zones in Syria and we ll get the Gulf states to put up the money. We re not putting up the money, but I ll get that done. But you know what? We can t let this happen. But you have a lot of them resettling in Rhode Island. Just enjoy your   lock your doors, folks. It seemed like the crowd didn t really know what to do with this information. Some people laughed, others yelled. Trump shouted: No, it s a big problem! We don t know anything about them. We don t know where they come from, who they are. There s no documentation. We have our incompetent government people letting  em in by the thousands, and who knows, who knows, maybe it s ISIS. Referencing the terrorist attack that happened in San Bernardino, California last December, where it is believed that the two Muslim suspects were inspired by ISIS, Trump added: You see what happens with two people that became radicalized in California where they shot and killed all their coworkers, OK? Not with me, folks. It s not happening with me. You can watch Trump s rant below: Trump is correct that Syrian refugees have been resettled in Rhode Island, but that s the only truth to this horrific rant. Many of these refugees have spent years getting all of their documents together and have endured in-depth interviews and near-flawless background checks before being allowed to enter America.This is just another line on the ever-growing list of disgusting anti-Muslim things Trump has said after he proposed that all Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. Fully aware of the consequences of such hateful rhetoric, President Barack Obama recently called Trump s attitude toward Muslims  dangerous.

 Obama Finally Weighs In On His Vote For President With Explicit Message For Democrats,"If you ve been on the email list for President Obama, as well as the Democratic National Committee, then you probably woke up to an email this morning from the president. For the most part, he s kept quiet in regards to who he would like as the person to come after him as commander-in-chief. There s been speculation, but nothing definitive, and to be honest that s really best. Whoever wins should win on their own merits.However, in the email sent out, President Obama told it like it is. He gets directly to the point and lets us know that we cannot, no matter what, allow a Republican to win the White House. Their divisive and hateful rhetoric is absolutely un-American. Yet, more to the point, the president points out that the Democrats have two fantastic choices, and that no matter what their differences may be, they actually share more in ideology than they disagree.Here s the president s message:In a few months, I ll be heading into the voting booth to cast my vote for the next President of the United States. And, like so many of you, I ve spent this primary observing the candidates and the parties, and what they represent.And I have to say, this has been a difficult period for the Republicans. They re trying to figure out what they re standing for   whether they will be the party of building walls and surveilling neighborhoods, whether they will be the party that enshrines discrimination in our laws.But the good news for Democrats is that we know what we believe. We believe that climate change is real and that we must do something about it. We believe in raising the minimum wage, and that women should be paid the same as men for doing the same job. We believe that our laws should reflect our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect, no matter their race or religion, gender or sexual orientation.We have two fine Democratic candidates who, no matter their differences, share this same set of core beliefs that defines our party. And in November, we re going to make sure that one of them becomes our next president.Thanks,Barack ObamaHe then asks us to pledge to vote for a Democrat this November and say  you re in.  And while there will definitely be folks who disagree, because they wanted their candidate to win the primary, the bigger picture is what everyone needs to keep in mind.We simply cannot allow a Republican back into the Oval Office. The last time we did (or rather the Supreme Court did), we ended up with two-unfunded wars, one of which was based on lies, and a recession that brought us to the brink of utter collapse. We ve come too far to turn back now.We need to pull together for the good of the nation. Let s listen to President Obama and follow his lead, and come November, vote blue no matter who.Featured Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Says Half Her Cabinet Will Be Women If Elected President,"Women make up over 50 percent of this country, but are grossly underrepresented in just about everything. In the United States Congress, more than 80 percent of those representing the people are men   80 percent in the Senate, 81 percent in the House.On the Supreme Court, only three of the nine Justices are women.And yes, even in the progressive Obama Administration, only 13 out of the 47 individuals who have served in his cabinet have been women   28 percent.It is no secret that Washington D.C. is still a hard place for a woman to find her voice. Even though it s been proven statistically that when women take charge of the operations and debates in D.C., stuff gets done quicker in a more bipartisan manner. Still, women aren t taken seriously.But Hillary Clinton, while shattering that glass ceiling herself, wants to shatter it in all aspects of D.C., starting with her cabinet, should she win the presidency.In an MSNBC town hall Monday night, Clinton told viewers that she intends to have her cabinet reflect the demographics of America:Well, I am going to have a Cabinet that looks like America, and 50 percent of America is women. Whether it s in a vice president or members of a Cabinet or in the White House staff, I want as broad a set of experiences that I can possibly draw together, because I m someone who likes to listen to people who come at problems from different perspectives.While Donald Trump accuses her of playing the  woman card,  Clinton is setting in motion a push to make women more equally represented in American society, something Trump would never consider.Should Clinton win, she not only is responsible for her cabinet, but also her appointments to the Supreme Court, which could produce two vacancies in the next four years.But it s this particular election that could be a driving force for women in Congress. Democrats have the opportunity to get out and elect women, from California to Maryland, from New York to Florida.If women are fifty percent of our population, then they deserve equal representation at every level, and Clinton seems to definitely be on board with making sure that happens if she were to become president.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Watch Chris Christie Awkwardly Dance At Springsteen Show, Ignoring That The Singer Hates Him","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie loves Bruce Springsteen. The feeling is not mutual.Christie took time out of shilling for Donald Trump to attend a recent Springsteen concert in Brooklyn and while he appeared to have a great time playing air drums over the hits, you could cut the tension with a knife. Over the years, the governor has been repeatedly called out by Springsteen for his heartless policies and pathological hatred of New Jersey s poor. It s gotten so bad in the last few years, that Christie did the  ultimate betrayal    he said his new favorite singer was Bon Jovi.Despite the stab in the back, Christie was seen rocking out in Brooklyn   and it was awkward. Trapped: The Saga of Chris Christie and the George Washington Bridge  pic.twitter.com/gddbEZN0ju  Jon Schwartz (@jonlschwartz1) April 26, 2016If his dance moves were noticeable, so too was the fact that Springsteen loathes Christie. The legendary New Jersey singer has reportedly banned Christie from using his songs at his campaign events (a claim Christie vehemently denies, yet adheres to) and has penned an op-ed slamming Christie s devastating budget cuts. The cuts are eating away at the lower edges of the middle class, not just those already classified as in poverty, and are likely to continue to get worse over the next few years. A few years later, Springsteen would join Jimmy Fallon in mocking Christie for  Bridgegate. Christie s latest political antics aren t doing him any favors either. Endorsing Trump, widely seen as a cynical move meant to land him a job in a future Trump administration, and while Springsteen has stayed mostly out of politics in this election so far, there is certainly no love lost between Donald Trump and Bruce Springsteen. Trump was fighting with him all the way back in 2012. (Note: Romney went on to lose Ohio. Badly.)Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines? Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2012It s no secret that conservative politicians have a celebrity problem. While Democrats fight over A-listers (Clinton gets George Clooney, Bernie Sanders gets Spike Lee), Trump s endorsements read like a casting call for Celebrity Big Brother   D-list celebs, reality tv show stars, Duck Dynasty guys, Dennis Rodman.No wonder, they rail against Hollywood so much   Hollywood wants nothing to do with them.

 Ted Cruz Doesn’t Want Transgender People To Pee Unless They’re At Home (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz is trying to differentiate himself from Republican front runner Donald Trump by any means possible. Recently, Trump shocked everyone by calling controversial anti-trans bathroom bills  discriminatory  and stating that transgender individuals should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they feel corresponds to their identity. Meanwhile, Cruz has decided to go the complete opposite way as his rival, ramping up the bigotry. His latest comments are transphobia at its worst.While in Indiana last weekend, Cruz was filmed talking about his bathroom policies, making it perfectly clear that he is on board with divisive anti-trans bathroom legislation. Despite that fact that no trans person has ever attacked anyone in a bathroom, Cruz insisted that the only bathrooms trans people should be able to use are the ones in their own homes. The Texas senator told reporters: Every one of us has the right to live our lives as we wish. Then, Cruz s lack of intelligence resulted in an epic contradiction. If any one of us wants to dress up as a woman or man and wants to live as woman or man and believes that we might be something other than what we were born, God has made each of us with free will and the ability to choose to do that if man to wants to dress as a woman, and live as a woman, and have a bathroom at home. A reporter clarified with the presidential hopeful, So, then they shouldn t use the bathroom out in public? Yes, exactly. Cruz drove his bigoted point home: You don t have a right to intrude upon the rights of others because whether or not a man believes he s a woman, there are a lot of women who would like to be able to use a public restroom in peace without having a man there   and when there are children involved, you don t have a right to impose your lifestyle on others. Here s the video, courtesy of the American Bridge:Cruz has definitely amped up his anti-trans rhetoric over the last few days. The GOPer recently released an ad about transgender people using public restrooms with the message  it s not appropriate, it s not safe  and has also made anti-trans jokes insulting Donald Trump. In the same weekend that this awful video was taken, Cruz called transgender protections  political correctness on steroids. Cruz has also voiced his support for North Carolina s bathroom laws, which prevent transgender people from using the restroom they re most comfortable with.If you care anything for the LGBT community and their right to freedom, Ted Cruz is definitely making himself out to be one of the community s biggest threats.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Clinton Supporter Claims Credit For Multiple Bernie Facebook Groups Being Taken Down (IMAGES),"Sure, we get it you trolled them teehee. Trolling is fun. Trolling for a cause is even more fun. Liberal trolling is a fantastic world full of wonderful people who come together to attack ultra-conservative pages still calling for Obama s execution and to expose the stupidity of the right to as many young people as possible. What you don t find in the world of liberal trolls are trolls who troll each other.This election, things have gone poorly for the mud-slinging internet portion of our Democratic primaries, who have taken to the field of battle on flat screens with mouse in hand and keyboard at the ready. This thing called Bernie Sanders happened, and a lot of people got on board. I got on board. I m still on board. If he wins I ll happily usher him into the White House. If he loses, I ll support former First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. That eliminates me from contention in the ridiculous war between the extremist camps of both of these campaigns.Bernie or Bust, which is the dumbest political philosophy of all time, was born of those who are yet to belong to a party for real but want to vote for Bernie no matter what. It s a die-hard movement that will die hard once the reality of a Donald Trump presidency hits America. On the flip-side, you have the  Hil-Bots,  who are now infiltrating Bernie Sanders support groups on Facebook with an age-old trolling technique that works to have a group removed, if only temporarily. By becoming members and posting lewd pictures, groups of them could then report the images to Facebook, whose automated system will take the page down and refer it to a human being for review.While the groups are back up, it was still just a nasty little trick. What makes this worse is that these are liberals fighting with liberals. Once we start trolling our own we turn into the fractured right. Conservative groups and pages are divided over Trump vs Cruz. If we could have been the adults in the room, we could have taken advantage of that while our candidates had an issues-driven campaign.Instead, what we have are violent groups of internet pranksters, ready to shake things up by inconveniencing Bernie supporters for a few hours, causing them to get their  Hillary is a crook  memes from somewhere else. Honestly, we really should be above this.Casey there is awfully proud of herself. You can see the whole discussion where she confesses in a piece on U.S. Uncut. It will be nice, from a troll s point of view, when the primaries are over and reality sets in. Whether you re Bernie or Bust or a die-hard Hil-Bot, you re going to learn that we have two excellent candidates for president. Their roles started out as expected, with Sanders pushing Clinton further to the left and Clinton becoming a better candidate for it. Then something happened, and people like me who thought they would support Hillary no matter what when it was our consolation prize in 2014 after the Democalypse. We like Sanders, we d love to see the radical change he s talking about. He s exciting, and real, and extremely fair. I m proud to have been a part of something in American politics that special.On the other hand, Hillary Clinton isn t some consolation prize. She s the most qualified person in the room. She s the only one of the candidates ever to spend significant time in the Oval Office, and while Republicans occupied it she sat on the Senate. Her reputation as a progressive voter has some of the realities of life attached to it. She s been a politician and a businesswoman all of her life. She has relationships with people that couldn t possibly be considered a bad thing when a call from her becomes a request from the White House. If Hillary Clinton wins the nomination and you stay home because internet memes have convinced you how horrible she is, you weren t a Democrat to begin with.Anyone who thinks that the Republicans should win out of spite doesn t appreciate what handing all three branches of government to the GOP would do to this country. That s the real fight. Please stop bickering about superdelegates, rigged voting machines, tax returns and urine samples and focus on Removing as many Republicans from office while simultaneously providing a landslide victory for our eventual nominee.Featured image via Facebook/Getty Images ",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Hillary Clinton And Rachel Maddow Brilliantly Handle Protester Who Disrupted MSNBC’s Town Hall,"On Monday evening, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both sat down with Rachel Maddow for a town hall style interview to try to pick up any undecided voters who may be left before Tuesday s primaries. During Clinton s interview, a protester interrupted to yell out a question, but instead of becoming irritated, Hillary and Rachel handled the protestor with the dignity they deserved.A female protester stood up and yelled something about women in immigration detention. Now, if this had happened in a Republican town hall meeting, the women would have been immediately escorted out and possibly beaten if Trump s supporters were there. None of that happened here. Rather than treat the women like an annoyance, Maddow repeated the woman s question and Clinton answered it.The transcript from MSNBC documented the incident:QUESTION: (OFF MIKE) the lives of the women that are (inaudible) right now?MADDOW: This is outside of our forum (ph). Let me just rephrase the question for you. Tell me if I get it right. Asking about women and families in family   immigration detention facilities.CLINTON: Yes, I m against that. Absolutely I m against that. I ve been against it for a long time. I ve said we should have family detention. We should end private prisons and private detention centers. They are wrong. We should end raids and roundups, and when I am president we are going to get comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. So we will end all of these problems at the time we are successful.By taking the protester seriously and not becoming angry, Hillary Clinton showed the audience (both at the venue and at home) that she cares about the issues that are weighing on the voters in this country. She could have just ignored this woman, but she showed her the respect she deserved by giving her an answer to the question she yelled out. And it wasn t a bullshit answer just to shut her up, it was clearly something she has thought about and wants to fix.Hillary Clinton acted presidential last night and it was great.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Crazed Cop Caught On Camera Breaking Man’s Leg Over A Single Walmart Tomato (VIDEO),"A police officer in Atlanta has been caught on camera breaking the leg of a man during an altercation over a single tomato at a Walmart store.According to reports and the video evidence, Tyrone Carnegay is approached by Officer Trevor King as he goes to leave the store, after a manager accused him of stealing a single tomato. Before any apparent reaction from Carnegay, Officer King begins beating him repeatedly with his baton. Carnage hits the deck without retaliating.The beating was so severe that Officer King broke two bones in Carnegay s leg and ruptured an artery. He needed to be hospitalized and have a titanium rod implanted in his leg. He also remained handcuffed throughout his time at hospital, despite being the victim and not the perpetrator of an attack.He was later charged with simple battery against police and willful obstruction of law enforcement officers   and jailed for three days.It wasn t until the video of the attack was produced, along with the receipt for Carnegay s purchase of the tomato (which was in his pocket the entire time), that Carnegay was released and the charges dropped.Had Officer King simply asked him to produce the receipt before attacking Carnegay, the matter would have been cleared up in a moments. He is now taking up legal proceedings against local law enforcement for the injuries he sustained in the brutal attack. He told WSB-TV: As he s grabbing me, he s beating me at the same time, [saying]  Get on the ground, Beating me at the same time. Carnegay s attorney, Craig Jones added: The officer went into Robocop mode and beat the crap out of him, Officer King needed only to ask a simple question of Tyrone Carnegay, to establish whether or not he had purchased the tomato. Instead, he opted to launch a frenzied attack with zero provocation. If anyone should be languishing behind bars right now, it is him.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Glenn Beck’s Bullsh*t Defense Of Bigoted Bathroom Bills Is Pure Stupidity (AUDIO),"Glenn Beck has shared his opinion on the bigoted Bathroom Bill in North Carolina which forces transgender people to use toilets contrary to their gender identity. Beck s bullsh*t defense of the plans is just about the stupidest thing you ll hear all day   and we re in an election cycle.Beck argues that his support of the bathroom bills popping up across the nation s red states is absolutely nothing to do with bigotry and transphobia. According to Beck: It has nothing to do with hate. It has everything to do with common sense. But we have detached from common sense. He then, of course, launches into the same entirely hateful, ignorant, fear-mongering which Ted Cruz and Curt Schilling have engaged in during the course of the debate. He creates the specter of his young daughter being confronted by a man pretending to be a woman in the bathroom   invoking primal fear. Beck and others state is as a fact that this will happen all the time without a bathroom bill, despite the sum total of zero cases to date.But Beck is far from alone in his stupidity.Curt Schilling was recently fired by ESPN after sharing a Facebook post in support of the anti-transgender bill passed in North Carolina. The post consisted of an image, featuring a man in a wig, his T-shirt cut to expose breasts, and a bizarre black outfit of women s clothing. The image was accompanied by text which read: LET HIM IN! to the restroom with your daughter or else you re a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die. Former player Schilling then added: A man is a man no matter what they call themselves. I don t care what they are, who they sleep with, men s room was designed for the penis, women s not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic. ESPN later issued a statement claiming Schilling s  unacceptable conduct  violated their policy of inclusiveness: ESPN is an inclusive company. Curt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated. GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz has also come out in support for the bills on the same bigoted basis. Cruz told ABC News Saturday: There is no greater evil than predators and if the law says that any man, if he chooses can enter a women s restroom, a little girl s restroom and stay there and he cannot be removed because he simply says at that moment he feels like a woman, you re opening the door for predators. However, using a caricature of a cross-dressing predator to invoke fear about transgender people using the gender identity appropriate bathroom is plain bigotry. One could just as readily argue the opposite, as transgender men did en masse with the hashtag Using the hashtag #WeJustNeedToPee. Bearded transgender men posted pictures of themselves in the women s bathroom, next to women entering cubicles and doing their makeup.Michael Hughes, from Minnesota, posted the picture below, asking:  Do I look like I belong in a women s bathroom?Under the North Carolina law, Michael would be legally compelled to use the women s bathrooms   despite the fact that he would clearly cause some degree of confusion and worry by doing so.Surely the long-term answer is to remove the gender apartheid from toilets altogether? Plenty of countries around the world do just fine using mixed bathrooms. Why not us?Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Missouri GOP Throws Away $8.3 Million To Block Planned Parenthood From Getting $400K,"In a growing trend to keep backwards-thinking idiots voting on the issues that really matter, like a woman s right not just to choose but her right to accessible, affordable healthcare, the GOP is going to even more ridiculous lengths than ever to enshrine their antiquated beliefs into law. Between that and teaching your children to love God and worship him like the founders intended and making sure what happens in your personal life is regulated by overwhelmingly Christian beliefs, the zealots of the right have their hands full. To prove they can be bought with taxpayer money, Missouri Republicans are willing to spend $8.3 million so Planned Parenthood doesn t get $400K.It s so simple it s stupid, which is why it s the perfect play for the GOP. First, you decline all federal funding for healthcare costs associated with women s health care, which in this case is $8.3 million. You then take that money, less the cut intended for Planned Parenthood and anyone else who performs abortions and pay it out of the state s general fund. Go ahead and tack it on the deficit. You can call it the cost of saving lives you ll complain about having to feed. Considering abortions aren t funded with a single federal dollar unless a life is in imminent danger, this really shouldn t matter, but it does.Missouri is spending $8.3 million to block Planned Parenthood from receiving about $400k in federal funds https://t.co/e1drx0WFRH  Reid Wilson (@ConsultReid) April 25, 2016Planned Parenthood and other local women s health clinics that offer abortion also offer pelvic screening, cancer screening, STD screening and family planning services. Every dollar of the $400K cut is taken from those programs because federal dollars can t pay for abortions unless someone s life is at risk. So at great cost to the taxpayer, great cost to the community and without a second thought about how dumb a move this is, Republicans are applauding a victory over that evil Planned Parenthood.In the end, they ve shot themselves in the foot. Healthy, informed women starting at a young age have a huge effect on the teen pregnancy rate, which in turn has a huge effect on the public assistance rolls. Trying to destroy Planned Parenthood over some bogus videos, knowing that the funding you re blocking doesn t cover what you re opposed to and allowing your lie to cost the people $8 million to perpetrate are all signs of desperate people preying on the emotions of pro-lifers. We know them as Republicans.Senator Kurt Schaefer (R), who heads the state s appropriations committee, said that Planned Parenthood is free to do whatever it wants, but that the taxpayer wasn t going to pay for it anymore. That statement is mostly true if you consider that the taxpayer wasn t paying for it to begin with. The taxpayer will still be paying the health care costs for those women who need it, but it will be coming from state revenue and not federal dollars already allocated that your legislature TURNED DOWN. It s so sad when an idea backfires so bad that there s nothing to do but hold an entire party to blame.Featured image from LifeNews.com",News,"April 26, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Anonymous Group Hacks KKK Website, Causes Total Shutdown","Internet hacktivist collective Anonymous is not to be f*cked with. While they are huge supporters of free speech and freedom of expression, what they are not huge supporters of is organized hate. Therefore, it should be no surprise that they have used a DDoS attack to take down a website belonging to one of the oldest hate groups in America: the Klu Klux Klan. As of this writing, the Loyal White Knights of the KKK website is still inaccessible.The group was questioned regarding their insistence that the Klan does not deserve to spread their message online, despite their adamant position that everyone deserves a voice. They told Hackread: We targeted the KKK [because] we believe in free speech but their form of beliefs is monolithic and evil. We stand for constitutional rights but they want anyone who is not Caucasian removed from earth so we targeted the KKK official website to show love for our boots on the ground and to send a message that all forms of corruption will be fought. We are not fascist but we certainly do not agree with the KKK movement. They are the Fascists and they are the Racists. Anonymous is right, of course. Free speech is one thing, while hate speech is quite another. The Klan, the Aryan Nation, and other racist hate groups incite violence and mayhem at every turn, resulting in the terrorizing of minority communities, violence against said communities, and sometimes even death. They are also responsible for the crime of creating new generations of bigots among impressionable youth, and they keep systemic bigotry going and help continue its perpetuation as an integral part of the society in which we live.The Klan is a group that should not be allowed to exist. However, since the Constitution forbids the government s disbanding of such hateful organizations, we must have groups that counter their disgusting messages of bigotry. If that includes hacking their websites and disallowing the spreading of their hate via the interwebs, then so be it.Good going, Anonymous.

 How A Federal Judge Just Helped Republicans In A Key Swing State,"Republicans were just given a leg up over Democrats in this fall s presidential election in the battleground state of North Carolina, and they have a judge put in place by George W. Bush to thank for it.Federal judge Thomas D. Schroeder decided in favor of Republican legislators in court on Monday, letting a controversial voter ID law stay in place despite strong objections from civil rights groups.Research on Voter ID laws have shown that these laws are often a reliable way for Republican conservatives to cut down on voters that often vote for Democrats, especially minorities and young voters.The judge, Thomas D. Schroeder of Federal District Court in Winston-Salem, wrote near the end of his 485-page opinion that  North Carolina has provided legitimate state interests for its voter ID requirement and electoral system. North Carolina s voter identification law requires people to display one of six credentials, such as a driver s license or passport, before casting a ballot. Those who cannot may complete a  reasonable impediment declaration  and cast a provisional ballot.Schroeder was officially put in place on January 8, 2008, at the beginning of George W. Bush s last year in office.The North Carolina law also banned same-day registration, cut down on the amount of days available for early voting, and stops 16 and 17-year-olds from preregistering to vote.An expert testified at the trial that the law was designed in a way to put extra burden on black and Latino voters. Republican legislators and the state s GOP governor Pat McCrory deny the claim.In 2012, a Republican Pennsylvania State House leader bragged that that state s voter ID laws would  allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania  (he didn t), while recently a Republican congressman from Wisconsin said voter ID would make the state   which has recently voted for Democrats   competitive in the fall for Republicans.President Obama won North Carolina in 2008 by 0.32% then lost it in 2012 by 2.04%. Polling in March showed the race in North Carolina effectively a toss-up between the Democratic and Republican presidential front runners.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Polls Show Millennials Hate Trump, Would Overwhelmingly Back Clinton","The notion that millennials are stupid, spoiled, uninformed voters who only care about themselves was shredded today after a new poll from the Harvard Institute of Politics showed millennial voters would overwhelmingly back Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup with Donald Trump.Collecting responses from over three thousand 18-29 year old voters showed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton would garner 60 percent to Trump s 25 percent, an astonishing 36 point lead, while 14 percent remain undecided.So, in other words, the  selfish, uninformed, spoiled  millennials wouldn t back the actual selfish, spoiled, uninformed Republican front-runner. Go figure.Not only do millenials overall have a highly unfavorable view of Trump overall, he isn t all that popular amongst young Republicans, either. His bombastic, hateful nature has rubbed some young Republicans the wrong way:Overall, 60 percent of millennials want to see a Democrat occupy the White House in 2017, up five points from last year, while 40 percent want a Republican. It seems even Republicans aren t so keen on having a racist, sexist, bombastic blowhard being their commander-in-chief. When it comes to sheer image, Trump s favorability is negative 57 percent (17 percent favorable, 74 percent unfavorable).According to Politico:Harvard IOP polling director John Della Volpe told reporters Monday that Trump is playing a similar role in helping the Democratic nominee as former President George W. Bush did during Barack Obama s 2008 campaign. I don t think there s a question about that,  he said,  and there s a lot of evidence that suggests that that s the case. The day has come when Donald Trump is more hated than George W. Bush. Democrats didn t even have to do anything.

 Ted Cruz Gets Confronted By A Furious Trump Supporter And It Doesn’t Go Well (VIDEO),"Ever since his devastating, humiliating loss to Ted Cruz in Colorado, Donald Trump has been whining and moaning about the delegate process in a number of states, accusing the system of being crooked. And just when he s been a little more silent on the issue, his supporters have decided to take up for him.On Monday, Ted Cruz was confronted by one of Trump s angry supporters while at a campaign stop in Indiana. Nearly as soon as he stepped off his campaign bus, Trump fan Kathy Hiel approached and accused the Texas senator of playing establishment games and rigging the system, which Cruz denied. The GOPer tried to remain civil in the face of pure idiocy, maintaining that the grassroots operations that were in place in states such as Colorado to win delegates were the  exact opposite of the establishment. Cruz also reminded Hiel that Trump was funding the Gang of 8, which Hiel dismissed, claiming that a few thousand  isn t funding much of anything.  Cruz pointed out that he hadn t given anything.Hiel wasn t having it, and the exchange got heated. As Hiel s attitude escalated, Cruz had to keep his distance and tell her,  I ll have a respectful conversation with you.  You can watch the confrontation below:WATCH: @tedcruz has heated exchange with Trump supporter over delegate process: https://t.co/1bYiZ9lTn0https://t.co/jkT4BVN71A  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 25, 2016The exchange ended pretty much the way Trump would have ended an argument with Cruz: by Hiel saying that Cruz wasn t a natural-born citizen. Cruz made sure to point out that if the tables had been turned and it was Trump being challenged by a voter about delegates, violence would have have likely ensued.After this confrontation, Hiel was interviewed by ABC News and criticized Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich for recently joining forces to try and defeat Trump. Bashing the two candidates  alliance and attempt to save the Republican party, Hiel said: With the collusion of Ted and the Republican Party and John Kasich I feel that they should   both men should just step out. They re just doing nothing but trying to hurt the front-runner when they actually don t have a chance of winning.

" ‘Big Government Tyranny’ Once Again Saves Ted Cruz’s Beloved Texas, Obama Approves Disaster Aid","Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is busy criss-crossing the nation to spread his message of small government fanaticism, but his own state just got a lesson in why the federal government isn t just important, it can be lifesaving.While Cruz spent his time making offensive jokes about trans people this week, Texas has been hit with a horrific run of severe weather. Many areas of the state, particularly in Harris County, have seen their homes and jobs literally washed away in major flooding. The severe weather, which saw parts of major cities like Houston and Austin go underwater, is estimated to cost over $5 billion.Cruz, whose typical response to tragedy involves tweeting  thoughts and prayers  to the victims, has offered little else. Meanwhile, President Obama and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have gotten to work. This week, Obama approved federal disaster relief funding to the parts of Texas affected by the flooding.Federal assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. The presidential disaster declaration, which includes all of Harris County, allows FEMA and other federal agencies to begin providing relief to individuals affected by this most recent flood. Harris County continues to work with local nonprofit and volunteer organizations to provide immediate relief,  said Harris County Judge Ed Emmett.Cruz, of course, famously voted against giving similar aid to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy (which may explain why New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wanted nothing to do with endorsing Cruz for president). His logic was that states should be left on their own, and federal aid was little more than government overreach. Citing the potential aid package s extra funding for other government projects   a standard procedure   Cruz said at the time: This bill is symptomatic of a larger problem in Washington   an addiction to spending money we do not have. The United States Senate should not be in the business of exploiting victims of natural disasters to fund pork projects that further expand our debt. Some of the  pork projects  included funding scientific research into extreme weather events that scientists had hope to be able to help states avoid future disasters. Or as Cruz calls it  wasteful spending. Despite Cruz s adherence to strict  no hand outs  when it came to other states, Texas being a massive state with tens of millions of people and lots of potential disasters has always stuck out its own hand when it came time for help.The recent onslaught of floods in Texas come at a bad time for Cruz politically. It certainly undermines his nearly pathological aversion to the federal government. It might be just the thing to remind people that Ted Cruz infamously shut down the very government that they are now counting on to help them rebuild after a horrific natural disaster. Suddenly reading  Green Eggs and Ham  on the Senate floor to avoid funding the government doesn t seem so noble, does it?Featured image via Adam Berry/Getty Images ",News,"April 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Caitlyn Jenner’s Friends Call Out Her Hypocrisy To Her Face For Supporting Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"When choosing a candidate for president it s probably a smart idea to choose someone who will best have your back on any number of issues. What s not smart is supporting a candidate who calls you names, tells you how disgusting you are, and publicly humiliates you. Yet, Caitlyn Jenner still seems to want to support Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz despite the fact that he is so utterly outspoken against the Transgender community.Jenner has been a Republican for a very long time and still hasn t been able to wrap her head around the fact that she is supporting not only the worst party for her own cause, but also the absolute worst candidate within that party in regards to Transgender rights and protections.In the latest episode of her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner s friends called out this blinding hypocrisy to her face. During the show, they showed the women sitting around listening to the fact that Ted Cruz is asking for the Houston, Texas HERO Act (which guarantees rights to the LGBT community) to be repealed. And while Jenner brushed it off as Cruz just being  totally misinformed,  her friends told her, in so many words, that you can t be a supporter of LGBT rights and a supporter of Ted Cruz at the same time.A Cruz presidency would be devastating to the LGBT community on so many levels, and could turn back the clock on all the progress that has been made over the past decade. We cannot allow that to happen. We ve come so far, and we have so much further to go.

 Woman Who Wants To Control Texas Education Thinks Preschool Makes Kids Gay (IMAGE),"There s currently a woman who wants to be selected to serve on the Texas State Board of Education (SBOE). Her name is Mary Lou Bruner, and she s about as far-right in ideology as one could ever seem to imagine. She s an ultra-right-wing  Christian  conservative who believes heavily in conspiracy theories, and her latest theory is just a bonkers as all her others.According to Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune, Bruner is now putting out the theory that preschool programs are a plot to make children gay. Not only that, but to also turn kids against their parents who  do not accept Islam and gay marriage. Smith, who seems to have access to the SBOE hopeful s private account, tweeted out a screen-capture of Bruner s Facebook post declaring this absurd theory. In the post, Bruner said: The GLBTQ agenda is one of the big reasons the liberals want 3-year-old and 4-year-old children to attend public school Pre-K programs. The federal government wants to indoctrinate the little children, teaching them a homosexual marriage is just as good as a marriage with a father and a mother. The federal government wants to push its socialistic and multicultural agenda onto these impressionable litter children who believe anything they are told.Children who get government indoctrination in Pre-K are going to become confused about their sexuality, and they are going to become rebellious because the government curriculum plans to tell the children not to listen to their parents if their parents tell them something different. The government curriculum plans to tell the little children their parents are ignorant, and they don t understand because of the way the parents were taught. Or the little children will be told their parents are bigoted because they do not accept Islam and gay marriage. Likely #SBOE member Mary Lou Bruner: pre-K is feds indoctrinating kids to make them sexually confused #txlege pic.twitter.com/ngMtsOq1S3  Evan Smith (@evanasmith) April 22, 2016The fact that this woman is running for the Texas State Board of Education and could very well have influence over what is taught is absolutely terrifying. Bruner is clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic.Newsflash to Bruner: you re not taught to be gay, and teaching acceptance and love of others is actually the Christian thing to do. As a person who was raised in a very evangelical Christian home and is also a lesbian, let me tell you, if you re taught to be gay, where the hell did I learn it? The only learned behavior Bruner is promoting is wanting to teach kids to be discriminatory, vindictive, and hateful of anyone who doesn t fit her definition of how to live one s life.Bruner needs to stay as far away from educational decisions as possible. She needs to keep her crazy conspiracy theories within the confines of her own home. She s truly what is actually dangerous, not kids getting early childhood education.

 Christian Lawyer Threatens Transgender Women With Gun Violence If They Use Same Bathroom As Her,"Years of lugging guns around in public places   such as supermarkets   have resulted in zero terrorist plots thwarted. As such, ammosexuals have had to find a fresh new reason to make sure they are armed to the teeth every time they go outside of their homes. This time, the threat is only  Isis  if that s the name of a transgender woman who happens to be in a public restroom.Christian Extremist and president of a theocratic law group named The Liberty Council Anita Staver has declared to the internet that she will be carrying a firearm with her every time she uses the bathroom in public from now on.Staver took to Twitter to make her formal declaration of pseudo-vigilantism.I'm taking a Glock .45 to the ladies room. It identifies as my bodyguard. #BoycottTarget @Target  Liberty Lawyer (@AnitaStaver) April 22, 2016There are reasons to be concerned with this statement, one being that she thinks her gun identified itself as something. This sounds like she thinks her gun is both self-aware and talks to her. The other more obvious one is not only her threat against transgender women but the tacit approval and advocacy for this behavior in other individuals.Anita has been sharing bathrooms, whether she wants to admit it or not, with transgender people for decades now   just like every other self-appointed member of the new American bathroom police. Only since Republicans made it fresh and new again has bathroom usage in America become the greatest domestic security threat of our generation.To give you a little context, Anita is married to Mat Staver, who is the head of Kim Davis s legal team. That would be the same Kim Davis that the right wing glorified for violating her duties and refusing to issue licenses for same-sex marriages. These people are nothing short of walking hate machines towards LGBT individuals, which explains the irrational bathroom paranoia.Staver s comments come on the heels of a conservative group hissyfit over commercial interests, such as Target department stores, openly accepting the LGBT community and allowing them to use whatever bathroom suits them best. As more companies and franchises join the ranks of Target here with the rest of civilized society in the year 2016, it s logical to assume more right-wing theocrats will be taking weapons into those bathrooms.After all, having paranoid people carrying guns in a confined and densely populated room with only a single exit is FAR less dangerous than a transgender woman who just wants to pee.

 Cher Just Went Nuclear On Trump In Incredible Twitter Rant (TWEETS),"It s probably not very controversial to say that Donald Trump has an image problem. Sure, the Republican base turn up to his rallies to be turned on by his xenophobia, but his electability in a general election is an entirely different matter. In some of the latest polls done on Trump s favorability, the Republican front-runner is the most hated politician since post-Watergate Richard Nixon. When it comes to Trump, most of the country falls somewhere between  actively loathe  and  hate with a passion. This is due, in large part, to the fact that the very stuff that helps him in the primaries   anti-immigrant bashing, open bigotry, violence against minorities at his rallies   repulse everyone else. In short, if you aren t the guy literally dressed as a wall at a Trump rally, you probably hate him.This guy attended a recent Trump rally dressed ""as the wall"" pic.twitter.com/AaF9TfBFSC  Pigeon Today (@PigeonToday) April 15, 2016To address this glaring problem, Trump s campaign has been quietly pivoting from  Our candidate, the bigot  to a supposedly softer tone that presents Trump as more  presidential.  In a recording made to a group of Republican insiders, Trump s campaign manager Paul Manafort said Trump s  part  would be evolving.The part he s been playing is evolving into the part of that you ve been expecting but he wasn t ready for it because he had the first phase. You ll start to see more depth to the person, the real person. You ll see him in a different way.Are you buying that? Singer and firebrand Cher sure wasn t.

 Right Wing Drudge Report Calls Beyoncé An ‘Urban Terrorist’ Because Racism Is Dead In America,"Beyonc  is already a favorite target of hate for the right-wing because she s: A. Black B. A woman C. Rich D. Powerful E. Not ashamed of being black and F. Did I mention she s black? But the so-racist-it-might-as-well-be-Stormfront Drudge Report took Beyonc  hating to a new low because of the  Hold Up  music video released over the weekend.Off of the album  Lemonade,  Hold Up is a suuuuuper angry song and video dealing with Beyonc s very justifiable rage at her husband Jay-Z for cheating on her. In the video, she takes a bat and smashes the crap out of stuff. It s not entirely clear why this is controversial in the slightest. Anyone who s been cheated on wants to smash everything around them; it s a perfectly natural reaction to that kind of hurt and betrayal. So, of course, Drudge Report responded to it like this: Urban,  of course, is a right-wing dog whistle for  ni**er  but why a  terrorist?  Oh, right, because Beyonc  supports Black Lives Matter and had the nerve to recognize black history during the Super Bowl so anything she does these days is scary to the poor, persecuted white minority of America.The article Drudge links to is just as tasteless, shoehorning in President Obama and soon-to-be-president Hillary Clinton by lamenting that Obama, previously a fan,  may be changing his policy on Beyonc .  Because only white people are allowed to be angry or something. When black people do it, they re out of control and savages. Didn t you know that already?Later, the article comments on Beyonc s album about being cheated on and forgiving her husband by saying:Indeed, all of  Lemonade  appears to be Beyonc  saying she s made lemonade from lemons  meaning she s somehow stuck it out in a bad marriage despite lying and infidelity. That sounds more like the Clintons  story than the Obamas .HAHAHAHAHAHAH! That didn t feel forced at all. Even a little.Now, if Beyonc had gone out and actually smashed people s cars in a rage instead of channeling her anger into a creatively destructive music video, OK, fine, call her names. But for the love of all that s holy, it s a MUSIC VIDEO. I know Drudge makes money by feeding the hate and rage of the right-wing but this is a stretch, even for them.By the way, if you want to see Beyonce get righteous with a bat, you ll have to go to TIDAL and sign up for a free trial.Featured image via Getty",News,"April 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Christian Nutjobs: ‘Eliminate Evolution, It’s A Religion!’ Federal Court: LOL","In the interest of wasting as much time and energy as possible pushing their religious beliefs into anything and everything you do, the Christian right has had its case heard that you can t teach sciencey stuff like evolution if you can t teach the reality of creation. Creation can be proven because it s in a book, you see, that was written by God through the vessel of man he created whereas evolution is just a silly collection of data about things we ve learned by going out and looking.Since creation is the only viable explanation but our government won t allow it in schools, the next necessary step to keeping our children as uneducated as possible is to see that nobody teach anything at all. Ignorance is bliss. That was, at least, what the Citizens for Objective Public Education, or COPE, hoped would happen when they argued to a federal district court that teaching evolution and the way man has come to understand his own ancestry is the same as teaching them the religion of atheism. They obviously don t understand the words they use sometimes, but that s OK.According to COPE:[Evolution brings students] into the religious sphere by leading them to ask ultimate religious questions like what is the cause and nature of life and the universe    where do we come from? The purpose of the indoctrination is to establish the religious Worldview, not to deliver to an age appropriate audience an objective and religiously neutral origins science education that seeks to inform. Isn t that precious? A group of ultra-religious zealots who want your children to believe the earth is barely 6000 years old are calling evolution  indoctrination.  How dare you teach things scientists have gone out and dug into the ground to find and prove? In the end it all comes down to the same thing: God had a plan. That plan couldn t possibly be to ignite the big bang and watch a universe develop. No, the plan has to be the story from the book that was stolen from the other book that learned it from another book that heard it passed down at dinner time for 25,000 years, when God was Goddess and men were washing her feet.The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver snickered a bit and responded: COPE does not offer any facts to support the conclusion that the Standards condemn any religion or send a message of endorsement, and any fear of biased instruction is premised on COPE s predictions of school districts  responses to the Standards an attempt by COPE to recast a future injury as a present one. Americans United for Separation of Church and State chimed in, saying that COPE feared that scientific facts would cause  Kansas schoolchildren to be subtly manipulated into rejecting their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So, these people don t want things like science and fact get in the way of their Sunday morning fairytale, where strict obedience is all that s truly needed in the end. Americans United continued: It s a nonsensical argument, which is why courts have unanimously rejected it. COPE, it seems, isn t interested in promoting facts; it s interested in forcing public schools to conduct far-right religious and political indoctrination. It s a shame that in today s day and age we need to have a society to separate church and state. It s like a cold with a runny nose the country picked up in the 1950s that we just can t shake.Featured image by Education Images/Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 College Students Tell London Mayor To P*ss Off After Racist Remarks About President Obama,"The Mayor of London s recent remarks about Barack Obama are causing him more problems than he likely expected. During a rant about the president s suggestion that the U.K. not leave the European Union, Boris Johnson ripped into the president for his decision to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office: Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president s ancestral dislike of the British empire   of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender. In reality, the president removed the bust of the British icon, placed there by George W. Bush, to make way for one more relevant to the United States: Martin Luther King, Jr. President Obama says that he had Churchill removed because There s only so many busts you can have before it starts looking a little cluttered in there. This incident provided us with a macabre ability to feel relieved that other countries have their  Tea Parties,  as well. In the United Kingdom, such a group would be the Tories. The remark was widely condemned as racist, with Labour leaders condemning Johnson s  dog whistle  remark. In fact, he was directly compared to the Tea Party:Labour s shadow chancellor John McDonnnell tweeted:  Mask slips again. Boris part-Kenyan Obama comment is yet another example of dog whistle racism from senior Tories. He should withdraw it. Fellow Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott said that what Mr. Johnson had written was  offensive  and echoed words used by the  Tea Party  right-wing tendency in the US.Former Lib. Dem. leader Lord Campbell added that Mr. Johnson s comments were  an unacceptable smear , adding:  If this is an illustration of the kind of diplomacy that we might expect from a Johnson leadership of the Tory Party then heaven help us. Now, college students are standing up and refusing to allow the racist mayor to get away with his bigoted rhetoric. Right-wing lie-factory Breitbart complains that  Safe Space Stalinists  and  footsoldiers of orthodoxy and conformism  at King s College are PC-ing up the place. In fact, they talked it over and decided that they don t want him stinking up their campus. In an email canceling the mayor s plans to speak to a group of students called King s Think Tank, informed Johnson: The level of discourse over the past few days does not meet the bar we set for these events nor do we feel does it help the British people in making the most momentous decision of our lifetime. Furthermore,  they added,  we believe it does not reflect the true greatness of the United Kingdom, a land of tolerance, respect and fair play towards all .Next part of #borisjohnson backlash of his Obama ancestry comments. Kings College letter withdrawing #EUref invite pic.twitter.com/OUYyQyYDw1  Ryan Heath (@PoliticoRyan) April 24, 2016 Given your inappropriate comments and inferences towards President Obama s Kenyan heritage, of which he is rightly proud, and your general tone of disrespect over the past few days in retaliation to the President of the United States of America,  the students said,  we are now formally withdrawing your invitation to speak at Kings College London. Johnson seems to have made the same mistake as Republicans in our country often do: he assumed that because he hates the president and his skin color, the rest of the world feels the same way. Unfortunately for Johnson, he just received a lesson in how much people all across the globe adore the truly great man who currently occupies the Oval Office.Sorry, Boris.Featured Image via Getty Images (Chris Ratcliffe)/Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Christian Gun Nut Shoots Unarmed Man Dead During Church Service And Gets Away With it (VIDEO),".During the days of the Old West shooting an an unarmed man violated a code that cowboys lived by and brought shame as well as arrest and prosecution for murder.But in the conservative version of the Old West we are being forced to live in today, codes and the law mean nothing as long as you re a Christian gun nut.During the morning church service on Sunday at Keystone Fellowship Church located within Montgomery County in Pennsylvania a parishioner with a concealed carry permit shot and killed 27-year-old Robert Braxton in the chest during some sort of altercation as members of the congregation ducked for cover after the shots rang out. It sounded like three pops, almost like a champagne bottle opening three times,  said congregant Breeana Somers.  Everybody s trying to make themselves as small as possible. You could hear some screaming and some crying but it was pretty silent. I went under a chair in a fetal position. I tried to make myself as small as possible. It s really frightening that anything like this could happen here. Despite the fact that the gun-toting churchgoer openly murdered an unarmed man for what is sure to be a ridiculous reason, the man has not been arrested or charged, according to Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele. There s no one in custody,  he told NBC 10.  The individual involved in the shooting is cooperating with police at this point. Yeah, and he s the only one who gets to tell the story because the other guy is dead.Ironically, the Keystone Church had written a Facebook post earlier announcing that an anti-government evangelical pastor would be a guest speaker that day and banned photography and video  for our guest s safety.  Apparently, church leadership was not concerned about guns or the threat they pose to the safety of their congregation.Here s the video via NBC 10.Again, a man literally shot and killed an unarmed man in the middle of a church service and he gets to walk free. This is sickening.

" Bigot Cashier LOSES IT On Gay Customer, Refuses Service (VIDEO)","A customer at a New Orleans Family Dollar store was forced to endure a bigoted, anti-LGBT rant by a cashier on Friday, turning what should have been an ordinary shopping trip into a nightmare.Melissa Langford was simply minding her own business when she heard the cashier making a not-so-subtle announcement that she hated gay people. Langford recalled the experience on Facebook: It started off with the cashier loudly voicing her opinion on how much she hates gay people. After five or six minutes (or at least it felt like that long) of listening to her yell and preach to each customer about how  gay people need to get  the fuck , they got somethin wrong in they head, *edit* that she had the right to refuse service to anyone she wants, gays are sick  etc. Hearing this level of bigotry and hate broke Langford s heart, and she quickly became emotional and decided to speak up. I started to writhe away internally. I wanted to cry right then and there. In fact, I m crying right now  cuz yall didn t hear the hateful passion in her voice. She was so loud, so cruel, so uneducated  selfish and just outright mean  anyways .I spoke up.I said,  excuse me, but im very very gay and you re really offending me. Think what u want but keep it to yourself. And then, the cashier  flipped out.  While carrying on her homophobic rant, the woman behind the counter refused to serve Langford, and even denied service to the customer in front of her because they were both defending the rights of the LGBT community. At this point, Langford began recording the encounter with her cell phone. Langford said that when she started filming, the cashier calmed down slightly, as far as leaving the counter and goin by the exit just to not serve my gay ass. In the video, you can see the chaos unfold as Langford and the other customer argue with the cashier. You can hear the man in front of Langford shouting  You ignorant! Why are you going to hate on people for who they are, and they re spending their money here just like everybody else?  as the cashier continues to refuse service and rail against gay people.Here s what Langford was able to record:The encounter devastated Langford. She said: Im really upset. This is the worst antigay s t ive ever had to deal with in my 34 years. In the interview below, Langford shares her feelings on the awful incident: Featured image is a screenshot Now Langford wants an apology, but she hasn t gotten it yet. She had contacted Family Dollar headquarters, but hasn t gotten a response. According to NOLA.com, a manager at the store refused to do something about the cashier s behavior and said  I can t control nothing. [The employee] can say and do what she wants. Hopefully now that Langford s video and post has been shared thousands of times, the store will be forced to do something about this cashier s horrendous behavior.

 Trump Has Meltdown Over Kasich And Cruz Joining Forces To Destroy Him (TWEETS),"The Republican Party is filled with even more drama over their primary today as Cruz and Kasich have apparently teamed up to destroy frontrunner Donald Trump   and the billionaire is having a meltdown.On Sunday, the Ted Cruz Campaign and John Kasich Campaign both released statements declaring they are joining forces and will be dividing their attention in the remaining primaries to keep Trump from winning. Cruz for President Campaign Manager Jeff Roe said: Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead. Kasich s campaign manager, John Weaver, said that the Ohio governor s campaign was going to  shift their resources to the West and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana. NEWS: Kasich campaign will marshal campaign resources to New Mexico and Oregon, allow Cruz to focus on Indiana. pic.twitter.com/auUIUX961O  Team Kasich (@TeamJohnKasich) April 25, 2016According to CNN, this is a campaign strategy the two Republicans have been working on for weeks. They hope that they will be able to keep Trump from obtaining the 1,237  delegates necessary to win the nomination this summer. If they can do that, the Republican s will have a contested convention over the summer and that will leave the door open for one of them to swoop in and win the nomination. Ted Cruz has already been trying to woo Trump s pledged delegates into voting for him on a second ballot at the convention.When the news broke that Cruz and Kasich were doing this, Donald Trump (of course) took to Twitter and slammed the campaigns:Wow, just announced that Lyin  Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2016 Lyin  Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2016After those two tweets, Trump apparently went to bed but was back at it again first thing Monday morning: Lyin  Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2016Shows how weak and desperate Lyin  Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can t stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2016Over the last week or so, Trump has been trying really hard to seem  presidential. But his facade is going to be really hard to maintain after this announcement.

 ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Who Shot His Girlfriend Beaten Unconscious By Partygoers (VIDEO),"According to the NRA,  good guys with guns  across the nation are the last line of defense between some unspecified threat that could occur anywhere at any time, and something else. But who will protect the world from the  responsible gun owners  who prove themselves to be anything BUT responsible?In the latest instance of  responsible gun ownerness,  a Utah man found himself beaten to a pulp by people who were leaving a party at his home after he shot his girlfriend. According to ABC4 Utah, everyone was enjoying the all-night party until the unnamed man began fighting with his significant other. Overcome by emotion, he  responsibly  pulled out a handgun and demanded that partygoers leave his home.Obviously, confronted by a presumably drunk individual who thinks a gun is the best way to get people to leave a party, those present quickly left   but as they were in the driveway, they heard gunshots. Unified Police Department spokesperson Lex Bell says that the heroic individuals rushed back inside and pummeled the shooter, who left his victim with gunshot wounds to her ankle and hand, until he was unconscious.In an apparent effort to protect the shooter, the girlfriend told police that she  accidentally  shot herself while cleaning the gun   but law enforcement says that she was likely shot while trying to wrestle the gun away from her violent and crazy significant other. A friend who drove her to the hospital confirmed that her story was false. Fortunately, her injuries are not serious, though she may need surgery on her hand.According to area residents, the couple recently moved into the neighborhood   and after learning about their new neighbors, they are a bit concerned. One man, identified as  Dan,  called the incident  troublesome  because he has a family whose safety is placed at risk by the new  responsible gun owners  in the neighborhood.No charges have yet been filed, but Bell says that those who rushed in and heroically beat the living hell out of the shooter were likely, legally, justified.Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Charles Koch Does A Brutally Honest Interview The Republican Party Isn’t Gonna Like (VIDEO),"Charles Koch sat down with ABC News and did an interview, during which he said it was  possible  that Hillary Clinton could be a better president than some of the Republicans still left. It was in no way an endorsement of Clinton. It was a well-worded question that elicited a noteworthy and honest response. That 30 seconds of reporting dominated the already slow news cycle while the meat of the Charles Koch interview went largely ignored.Charles Koch doesn t come across as many people think he should. He shows up in sweaters and comfy shoes looking like Mr. Rogers and being extremely passionate about his policy positions. What many people don t understand is that the Koch Brothers, while massive and powerful beyond belief, are Libertarians. Libertarians want taxes gone. They want money out of politics because they think the government should be almost non-existent. In order to achieve this Libertarian Utopia, they first have to conquer the Republican Party, the only people who will give them a flat tax and deregulate everything.Charles Koch admits that he benefits from a  rigged system.  He admits to all the money that is spent on corporate welfare and tax shelters for the wealthy. He admits that cronyism runs our country and he knows that the rich are getting richer and the poor have no chance. If you were to attach Charles Koch s belief system to a liberal set of values you d have Bill Gates meets Warren Buffet. Unfortunately, what you actually end up with is a grandfatherly figure whose sheer power won t be stopped, it ll be chatted about nicely in the den.The Kochs lean to the right on enough issues that their money gets thrown at the Republican party. They want to eliminate the tax code, thinking it will put people on level playing field   or maybe just to keep more profits. They want regulation out of business, so free markets could thrive and regulate themselves   or maybe just to cut corners and save money. They want money out of politics, so they pour money into politics. The Kochs aren t in danger of being aligned with Democrats, but if you listen to Charles tell it, if the Democratic party would come around on just a few things, they would see more Koch money. Yes, that s a ridiculous notion. Charles Koch sits and talks about everyone taking care of one another while it was he and his brother who created the Tea Party and their bigotry and went to work in 2014 to see to it that everyone hated the poor and Ebola enough to vote red.The Kochs have always backed Republicans, an investment Charles calls  disappointing.  He remembers the one time he asked for a political favor to shoot down a bill that was nothing but corporate tax breaks and fewer than 10 percent of the people they backed on the campaign trail came through when it was time to vote. The one time. Somehow it seems unlikely that a man who just confessed to raising half a billion dollars for political purposes has asked for more than one favor, but we ll let Mr. Koch s good character speak for itself (wink, wink).They have apparently gotten tired of the Republican party, at least this time around. Charles is adamant that the mud-slinging ad-hominem festival of stupid that has been the GOP primary has not received a dime from their war chest. Not a single campaign on either side has reaped the benefits of Koch support. The only candidate Koch mentions by name is Bernie Sanders, who he says is at least addressing the issue of the two-tiered system and wealth inequality, though he can t understand his methods. It s difficult for a man who professes to be a  classic liberal  to consider putting the needs of the less fortunate first. If his barn is stocked with horses, his cupboards and refrigerator with food and his home stocked with creature comforts he ll be in a much better position to help those who have struggled.All in all, this interview doesn t bode well for the GOP. They re looking for almost a billion dollars from Koch s PAC, which by his own estimate has only raised $200 million so far this year. The Republican party has certainly shown that it knows how to screw up a free lunch. When you can t do something as simple as keeping your number one source of income in the game, you know the end is near.

" Ninety-Year-Old Senator Finds Love Again, This Time With A Man","On Saturday, former Pennsylvania senator Harris Wofford, now 90, announced his engagement in a touching op-ed, published by the New York Times.In his younger days, Mr. Wofford served as special assistant for civil rights to President John F. Kennedy and adviser to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.He was married to his wife Clare for 48 years.In his op-ed, Wofford writes: Clare and I fell in love trying to save the world during World War II. He goes on to say that the couple s  romance and adventure  continued through the decades. They raised three children, and he states that  she was the heart of their family. He writes:When I told her,  You re my best friend,  she would reply,  and your best critic.  And when I said,  You re my best critic,  she responded,  and your best friend. She died 20 years ago, as they were both nearing their 70th birthdays.He says:I assumed that I was too old to seek or expect another romance.But five years later, Mr. Wofford would find love again.In writing about the moment he met his future spouse, he describes the scene in this way:It was afternoon, and the tanning beachgoers faced west, toward the wall of concrete buildings lining the boulevard, to catch the sun, ignoring the beautiful sea. I swam alone in the water, attracting the attention of two bystanders near the shore. They came over to say hello, which is how I met Matthew Charlton.He says his second love is someone whose  inquisitive and thoughtful manner  and  charm  struck him right away. They became fast friends and travelled together often.It was three years before the former senator found the  nerve  to tell his children about the romance. In time, he says, they welcomed him into the family.Now, 15 years later, the couple is planning to celebrate their marriage on April 30.He writes:Twice in my life, I ve felt the pull of such passionate preference. At age 90, I am lucky to be in an era where the Supreme Court has strengthened what President Obama calls  the dignity of marriage  by recognizing that matrimony is not based on anyone s sexual nature, choices or dreams. It is based on love.The former senator speaks from the heart when he says: It is right to expand our conception of marriage to include all Americans who love each other.

The result is that 10,000 lives are lost because of someone driving under the influence. Worse, about one-third of drunk driving deaths are caused by repeat offenders.According to the website, one-third of all traffic related fatalities are caused by a drunk driver.Given these horrible statistics, it bears repeating: If you re drinking please don t drive.Image credit: via We Save Lives on YouTube",News,"April 25, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Just Accidentally Gave America The Greatest Reason Not To Vote For Him,"Donald Trump wanted to give his supporters a strong reason to support him, and instead he just handed the rest of America a great reason to fight like hell to ensure he never gets elected.At a campaign rally just days before a crucial primary day that could decide whether Trump gets the nomination before the convention or not, he told his followers that if he loses, he ll go into hiding, never to be seen again.Signalling yet again that he would not be willing to support another Republican should he lose the nomination, Trump said there was nothing sadder than watching a losing candidate grovel at the feet of the victor. Which, to be fair, is true if the victor is Donald Trump.Clearly not a fan of Ted Cruz, Trump suggested he would never go on to endorse him: They fight like hell for six months, and they re saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine. And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says,  I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he ll be a great governor or president or whatever. So Trump made his supporters a promise: I m not sure you re ever going to see me there. I don t think I m going to lose, but if I do, I don t think you re ever going to see me again, folks. I think I ll go to Turnberry and play golf or something. It s bad enough that Trump is already playing the sore loser, but his gambit is almost sure to backfire. It s been well documented that Trump is despised at almost surreal levels. His unpopularity among nearly every demographic is so staggering that it s amazing he s made it this far. The sheer level of loathing people have for Donald Trump may be the one thing that can truly unite the country. He s hated by Hispanics. He s hated by women. He s hated by African Americans. He s hated by young people. He s hated by the one group the GOP could always count on, white men (yes, really).He s the most hated politician in three decades. The last person who came close? Richard Nixon post-Watergate. Even Dick Cheney   at the lowest moments of the Bush years   was hated by (slightly) fewer people.That s a massive number of people who would all but run to the polls if it meant Donald Trump never shows his face in front of a camera again. It s hard to imagine a better way Donald Trump could Make America Great Again than that. And Trump just promised to do it.The stakes in this election, already very high, just became: President Trump vs. Trump never being seen again. Pray America makes the right choice.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Just Tossed Charles Koch A HUGE F*ck You After Kinda-Sorta-Endorsement (SCREENSHOTS),"We have some bad news for Charles Koch: Hillary Clinton just isn t that into you. Recently, the evil billionaire backer of the Tea Party announced that Republicans are so terrible, he is forced to admit that Hillary Clinton is possibly better than all of them. Koch told ABC s This Week that Clinton s husband was a much better President in terms of government spending than was George W. Bush, who is idolized by many conservatives. In some ways. In other ways, I mean he wasn t an exemplar. But as far as the growth of government, the increase in spending, it was 2.5 times under Bush than it was under Clinton,  Koch said, explaining that for Hillary to be a better President than the entire Republican field, she would have to be a gigantic hypocrite who can be bought and sold like everyone else they back. Asked if he would support her campaign for President, Koch said: We would have to believe her actions would be quite different from her rhetoric, let me put it that way. While Koch is in love with Clinton as anyone on the Right is going to get, he probably should not expect much from her. On Sunday, Clinton let the Koch brothers know what she thinks of them and their money by essentially telling Charles to go f*ck himself.Referencing the Kochs  climate denial and attempts to suppress minority voters, Clinton explained that she could not accept an endorsement from someone so evil.  Not interested in endorsements from people who deny climate science and try to make it harder for people to vote,  she said, linking the interview.Yes, it s no secret that the Republican field is chock-full of terribleness, but Koch is almost certainly not going to find any friends among Democrats these days. It s far, far too late for that.Watch the interview below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvqf3mSz8yQFeatured image via Getty Images (John Moore)/screengrab",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox Airhead Says Stuffed Armadillo Disproves Climate Change,"During an April 24 Fox News segment, climate-change denial expert Marc Morano unveiled top secret proof that 97 percent of real scientists are wrong about global warming.Morano brought a cage, draped with a blanket, onto the set of Fox amd Friends on Sunday.In preparation of explaining to the show s dumbed-down viewers that top scientists around the world aren t really concerned about climate change, Morano peeled the back the cover of the cage to expose a stuffed armadillo.Morano, who was named  Climate Change Misinformer of the Year  by Media Matters in 2012, proceeded to explain how a stuffed animal is definitive proof of a massive global warming hoax. This is significant,  Morano said. The armadillo was the only animal that was used as a mascot for global cooling in the 1970s Morano was referring to an unpopular and short-lived theory that the earth s temperatures were gradually falling. This idea did not ever have widespread support among members of the scientific community. More that that, it conflicted with the majority of the scientific research of the time. By 1976 the World Meteorological Organization had already issued a warning that a very significant warming of global climate  was probable.Morano continued during the Sunday morning segment. Referring to the caged, stuffed armadillo, he said: It s not a mascot for global warming. They re claiming the armadillo is migrating north to get out of the heat. While we re not sure if the armadillo can rightfully be called a  mascot for global warming,  in 2011 researchers noted that armadillos, along with many other small animals, are indeed migrating further north.According to an article that appeared in Scientific American:But there s no question armadillos   and other small mammals   are on the move in the United States, expanding into terrain biologists thought highly unlikely just a few years ago.Some of that migration can be attributed to opportunity: The armadillo in particular has been moving northward since it arrived in Texas in the 1880s and Florida in the 1920s, according to Colleen McDonough, a biology professor at Valdosta State University in Georgia.McDonough went on to say that some of the movement is  clearly triggered by climate change.  Armadillos have settled into southern Illinois, Indiana, Kansas and Missouri   all areas that were  totally unexpected.  Winter temperatures in these regions were once too harsh for the armadillo.The article also describes the migration of white-footed mice and southern flying squirrels, species which have travelled more than 140 miles north of their original habitat in recent years.Even without the stuffed armadillo, Morano s assertions about climate change are ridiculous.There s a big difference between the short-lived hypothesis of global cooling that sprang up in the 1970s and a scientific consensus that includes more than 97 percent of people working in the field.Watch the segment below via Raw Story.

 Texas Cop Vows To Brutalize Any Trans Woman Who Uses The Restroom With His Daughter,"The sweep of crazy anti-transgender bathroom laws has brought out the bigots in droves. One such bigot is Texas police officer Tracy Murphree, who is also potentially in the running to become Sheriff of an entire county in the Lone Star state. Murphree decided to post to Facebook his feelings on transgender women   and that s not all. This cop actually said that he would beat any transgender woman in a public restroom with his daughter until she lost consciousness. This whole bathroom thing is craziness I have never seen. All I can say is this: If my little girl is in a public women s restroom and a man, regardless of how he may identify, goes into the bathroom, he will then identify as a John Doe until he wakes up in whatever hospital he may be taken to. Your identity does not trump my little girl s safety. I identify as an overprotective father that loves his kids and would do anything to protect them. Luckily, Murphree was quickly put in his place by Amber Dyden Briggle, who once ran for Denton County Council. She also happens to have a transgender son. Briggle responded to Murphee: As the parent of a transgender child who is only 8 years old, Tracy, this   really, really upsets me,  she wrote.  I know you are a protective parent, but SO AM I. If my son were to walk into a women s room, looking the way he does, he would no doubt be corrected and sent to the men s room. What we ve done now is call attention to a young child, only 8 years old, who is now behind closed doors with a bunch of men   had he walked in there to use the bathroom to pee in the first place, no one would have batted an eye, because he looks like and IS a boy.  Let me put it another way: halfway through first grade, this PERFECT child of mine, who is just as miraculous and amazing today as he was on the day of his birth, stopped feeling comfortable using the girls  room. But, of course, the bigoted Murphree doubled down on his hatred and said that Briggle is the problem, not him: Amber, you have demonstrated part of the problem. You advocate your right to defend your child and state that your child has the right to pee in peace. Yet when I advocate my right to defend my child and her right to pee in peace I m a bigot and dangerous. I m not a bigot I have nothing against you or your child. I would defend both of you with my life. Yes, I will be the next sheriff, and I will serve all citizens. I will not sit back and not voice my beliefs and opinions. I will not give in to the political correctness police. I won t be threatened by those who may call me a bigot or ignorant. I have no issue with transgenders. That s between them and God. The few transgenders rights do not trump the rights of the many. I will not stand by in political correctness afraid of being labeled and allow a male to enter a bathroom my daughter occupies. I just won t do it. Mr. Murprhee is the last person who should be on any police force. He has shown himself to be violent against those he hates and/or does not understand. He is incapable of listening to logic and reason, or of learning to be accepting of diverse groups of people. This man is dangerous. He has explicitly said that he will harm his constituents for the  crime  of using a public bathroom.Denton County, please do NOT elect this violent brute as your next sheriff.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas School Officials Request For New Name Goes Horribly Wrong (VIDEO),"Students of Robert E. Lee Elementary School in Austin, Texas, along with their parents, have been battling over the school s name for well over a year.As KXAN reported here, an advisory panel heard testimony from people on both sides of the argument in January.Daniel Oppenheimer, whose children attend the school, told KXAN the name should be changed, saying: It s actually an active deterrent for black families and families of color to attend our school. I think that s reason enough why it s worth thinking about changing. Another parent, Jessica Grogan, expressed similar concerns, telling reporters: I d say my main reason is it is alienating to certain families and I feel like it doesn t represent our community values. Watch video from the January board meeting, courtesy of KXAN below.Following the meeting, the Campus Advisory Board recommended that the school board begin taking steps to change the name of the school.Problem solved, right?Wrong, because it s Texas.The school board asked parents and community members to submit suggestions for the new name.The leading suggestions were as follows:Donald J. Trump Elementary: 45 nominations Robert E. Lee Elementary: 34 nominations Russell Lee Elementary: 32 nominations Harper Lee Elementary: 30 nominations Elisabet Ney Elementary: 15 nominationsThere were plenty of others as well, such as Bleeding Heart Liberal Elementary, Communist Elementary and The Illuminati.Among the least controversial suggestions submitted by Texans were Generic School, Elementary School #1, Bee Movie, Schoolie McSchoolface and The Rubber Duckies.Read all 15 pages of suggested names here.While the original plan was to select from the list of top contenders, it s highly unlikely the school board will approve a name like Donald Trump Elementary.It s sad that so many members of this Austin, Texas community chose not to take the issue seriously. As so many students and parents pointed out, a public school has a duty to ensure that no student is discriminated against and all students feel valued and welcome.The school board hasn t said how it plans to proceed with selecting a new name, in light of the submissions received.The best option appears to be limiting community involvement as much as possible.Featured image via Linda Lawrence via Facebook",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Maine’s Governor Somehow Gets More Racist: I Can’t Understand Indian People Without Interpreter,"Maine has a very bad governor (thanks Tea Party movement!) who just keeps getting worse.Republican Governor Paul LePage decided to take a cue from Donald Trump and spend the weekend mocking Indian people. Apparently drawing upon his own experiences   and warped by LePage s truly stunning level of racism, no doubt   he lamented the fact that restaurants hire immigrants. The problem, he said, was that he needs  an interpreter  to understand them. And, he added, people from India are  the worst ones. This is right on the heels of Donald Trump s latest stab at xenophobic nationalism when at a rally he put on a stereotypical Indian accent to lament the fact that he had spoken to someone outside of America to inquire about his credit card. (Part of his plan to Make America Great Again, is to bring telemarketing jobs back to the country. A job nobody wants.) The crowd ate it up. So, it seems, did LePage, whom recently accused Ted Cruz of  stabbing him in the back  and is a big fan of Trump.LePage has made a name for himself as both a terrible governor in the traditional sense (he s been nearly impeached a number of times and is universally loathed by both Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature), and an unrepentant racist. Already this year he made headlines for this astoundingly offensive rant: These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty  these types of guys  they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. He later said he didn t mean to say  white girl.  Then a few days later, he said screw it and admitted that he did mean white girls but only because he knew that would make the story sound scarier.In a twisted way, LePage is probably relieved that his racism is back in the news. His last act of infamy was blocking a bill that would provide life-saving drugs for opioid overdoses to addicts. His reasoning: Why bother saving them? They ll just overdose again.Paul LePage is the worst.Featured image via YouTube screengrab",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Doesn’t Think Men Should Have To Change Diapers Or Play With Their Kids (AUDIO),"It s a wonder why Donald Trump has been divorced so many times. He s clearly such a good catch (note sarcasm).Trump s going to tell us time and time again how wonderful he is, how great is for the nation, and what fantastic things he s going to do. Here s the thing   he s all talk. And now Buzzfeed has reminded us that he s not that great of a father either   or at least in the sense that a  great father  is one that actually wants to spend time with their kids.While he touts how well he can provide for his family, he apparently thinks that money can by love, and who knows, maybe it does. Yet, he most certainly made if very apparent during a 2006 interview on the Opie and Anthony show that he wants nothing to do with actually taking care of his children, besides monetary support.When asked if he changes diapers, he said: No, I don t do that There s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there s a lot of husbands that listen to that. So you know, they go for it. They  go for it ? Like their being conned into actually caring for their child. God forbid a father actually want to take part in raising a child.He added: If I had different type of wife. I probably wouldn t have a baby, ya know, cause that s not my thing. I m really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don t. It s just not for me. No, that s not being a  great father,  that s being a sperm donor that provides monetary assistance.To reiterate, he doesn t seem to think men should be acting  like the wife. He also said: I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them. I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s not like I m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park. And apparently during a 2005 Howard Stern interview Trump brought up how he hated the fact his ex-wife Marla Maples had the audacity to suggest he bring their daughter on a walk. Well, Marla used to say,  I can t believe you re not walking Tiffany down the street,  you know in a carriage. Right, I m gonna be walking down Fifth Avenue with a baby in a carriage. It just didn t work. This really just goes down deeper to the fact that Donald Trump doesn t respect women   at all. He seems to thoroughly believe in gender roles, and I bet the fact that he may be running against Hillary Clinton in the general election sends shivers down his spine. How dare a woman think they can do a man s work after all, right? I mean, he s made it clear a man shouldn t do  women s work. Trump can tout how  great  he is with women until he s blue in the face, but it s all a lie, just like with most everything else he says. He s a businessman trying to sell himself on being president, but he s clearly not remotely qualified. The fact that he s doing as well as he is speaks to the fact that he does know how to sell. However, come the general election with a far smarter electorate, that s reaches beyond the Republican base of voters, they will make sure he never sets foot in the Oval Office.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Michelle Obama Just BLASTED Conservatives For Their Racist Lies About Our President (VIDEO),"On Saturday, Michelle Obama graced Jackson State University with her presence as she gave the commencement speech to this year s graduating class. Though she normally stays out of the fray with regard to the right s horrible attacks on her husband, the First Lady took a moment to share her thoughts on the insane, racist attacks coming from conservatives in America. As I ve walked this journey with Barack, I ve gotten a pretty good look at what it means to rise above the fray, what it means to set your eyes on the horizon, to devote your life to making things better for those who will come after you,  Obama said, praising the President s ability to  stay the course  no matter what  kind of ugliness is going on at any particular moment. Then she dropped the hammer, condemning the right s use of  hateful and divisive language  directed at her husband: Charges that he doesn t love our country. The time he was called a liar in front of a Joint Session of Congress. The nonstop questions about his birth certificate and his belief in God. She urged the graduating class to follow her husband s example and address such unabashed hatred with dignity: Are you going to get angry or lash out? Or are you going to take a deep breath, straighten your shoulders, lift up your head, and do what Barack Obama has always done  as he says,  When they go low, I go high.' That s the choice Barack and I have made. That s what has kept us sane over the years. We simply do not allow space in our hearts, minds, or souls for darkness,  she said.Barack Obama has encountered an unprecedented amount of mindless vitriol from the stupid part of America, and has always met it with class. But despite that hate, he will be remembered as the best POTUS in this century and last, perhaps ever, because of his dedication to doing the right thing and his refusal to let the haters weigh him down.Featured image via Getty Images/Feng Li",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Begin Requiring Doctors Lie To Patients About Existence Of ‘Abortion Reversal’ Pill,"Part of the Hippocratic Oath that every doctor must take requires them to vow to  reject harm and mischief.  Put another way: A doctor should never allow harmful or unscientific nonsense to get in the way of treating their patients with the best possible medical procedures. Put an even simpler way: Republicans should stay out of the hospital room.In South Dakota, Republicans are forcing through legislation that would require doctors to directly lie to their patients in order to give them second thoughts about having an abortion. Two other states, Arizona and Arkansas, already have this law in place. It s the newest trend in anti-abortion measures, instead of targeting the women (which hasn t worked), they ll just require doctors to push anti-abortion myths or face losing their jobs.Specifically, the new law, signed by Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard, will tell doctors that they must inform their patients that they can get an  abortion reversal  pill that will stop abortions in progress and allow them to keep a viable fetus. As Judith Graham at medical blog Stat News notes, the magic pill is psuedoscientific nonsense.An antiabortion group is promoting model legislation to inform women they can  reverse  medication abortions.Yet that claim has no solid science behind it  just an anecdotal case report written by a physician who invented a protocol and arranged to have it tested on a half-dozen patients who regretted swallowing the abortion pill.To put it mildly, the medical community is not cool with being told to lie to their patients about untested medical procedures which may, in fact, harm them. As physicians, we can t just experiment on patients willy-nilly,  said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco. Doctors offering to undo medical abortions are  essentially testing an unproven, experimental protocol on pregnant women,  he said.If requiring doctors to use untested drugs on their patients in order to lie to them about having an abortion isn t doing  harm and mischief , then what is?It s also attempting to fix a problem that doesn t exist. Despite what anti-abortion activists emphatically insist, the research shows conclusively that virtually no woman who has an abortion regrets it. When a University of California San Francisco School of Medicine study asked over 600 women at facilities across the country how they felt about their decision to have an abortion, more than 95 percent said they felt it was the right thing to do. Women overwhelmingly felt abortion was the right decision in both the short-term and over three years, and the intensity of emotions and frequency of thinking about the abortion declined over time,  the study concluded.It seems that women, far from being doe-eyed  victims  of sinister Planned Parenthood clinics preying on them, actually know what they are doing and do what is right for them, their bodies, and their families. Go figure.None of this seems to matter to South Dakota Republicans, who have long retreated into superstitious dogma and seem only dimly aware that the scientific community thinks they are ridiculous. Instead of reassessing their beliefs, they are telling doctors to help them promote their misconceptions or else face their wrath. Galileo is probably nodding his head in recognition. An age old problem with a modern-day spin.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: River Set On Fire Thanks To Fracking,"Thanks to the quest for natural gas power through fracking, an Australian river has become polluted enough that it can be set on fire. Dramatic video of what happened was captured by activists and published online:https://www.facebook.com/RTvids/videos/1201457439864507/A Queensland river near a fracking site exploded into flames after a coal seam gas (CSG) protester sparked a kitchen lighter above the water surface.Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham uploaded dramatic footage of the river ablaze to his website and social media accounts to highlight his party s concerns about fracking and the extraction of coal seam gas.The video shows the New South Wales Greens MP ignite the fire on the Condamine river and then jump up in shock, exclaiming:  Holy f***! Unbelievable   a river on fire! The video echoes other viral videos in the past that have shown that the gases released by fracking have sometimes leaked into the traditional water supply, and allowed similar experiments where water coming into homes has been set on fire as well.Fracking has also been linked to increased earthquake activity, and as a result it has been banned in several U.S. states, sometimes completely or pending further study of the technology.Some have called for a complete ban on the practice, while others have called for a slowdown in its use. Fracking has been credited with contributing to the lower price of oil and gas in the last few years, but like every other energy extraction technology used on a mass scale, it has an environmental downside.The only energy technologies without the serious problems of fracking or traditional oil drilling are green technologies like solar or wind power, but to date they are incapable of generating the kind of power output needed to fully displace the traditional sources of energy. The Obama administration has tried to incentivize the creation of  green tech,  but has been opposed by Republicans who take in the bulk of donations from the fossil fuel industry (who also fund an enormous amount of anti-green propaganda).Featured image via Facebook",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Joe Biden: I’m Not Part Of The Party That Says ‘Well We Can’t Do It’,"On April 23 Vice President Joe Biden cast his vote in the Democratic presidential primary, in his home state of Delaware, but declined to say which candidate he voted for.Neither the president or Vice President has publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2016 race, but during an interview with The New York Times, published on Wednesday, might provide some insight into which way the vice president was leaning on Friday.The New York Times reported:He remains neutral in the battle between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, but not between their campaign styles. He ll take Mr. Sanders s aspirational approach over Mrs. Clinton s caution any day.During the interview Vice President Biden told The New York Times reporter John Harwood: I like the idea of saying,  We can do much more,  because we can. He went on to compare the candidate s very different approaches to their campaigns, saying: I don t think any Democrats ever won saying,  We can t think that big   we ought to really downsize here because it s not realistic. C mon man, this is the Democratic Party! I m not part of the party that says,  Well, we can t do it.   The New York Times also reported that the Vice President likes the idea that Mr. Sanders is aiming high, regardless of whether the large steps he envisions to narrow income inequality and broaden economic opportunity become realized in the next presidential term. According to the interview:The philosophy Mr. Biden has advocated within the Obama White House: Push for a lot, and persevere over the long run.Vice President Biden stressed the point, saying: Presidents have always been told by really smart people:  Don t push something that you can t succeed in   it diminishes your power. I completely disagree with that proposition. Indeed, the race between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and VT Senator Bernie Sanders is strikingly similar to the Clinton-Obama race of 2008.Then Senator Obama ran on a platform of  hope and change,  telling his energetic followers  Yes We Can. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton sought to portray herself as level-headed and realistic, warning that there is no magic wand to fix the problems in Washington.After eight years of George W. Bush, 2008 voters preferred Obama s message of bold change to Clinton s ideas for incremental change.This time around though, the 2016 electorate is leaning more toward Clinton s pragmatic approach, likely as a response to eight years of Republican obstructionism and even outright sabotage in Washington.While voters are certainly tired of budget showdowns and government shutdowns, the fact remains that as long as Republicans control Congress, both candidates will face the same right-wing extremism that President Obama has faced once they reach the White House.No democratic president is going to make Republicans in the House and Senate reasonable or even sane.Regardless of whether voters choose Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, there s no question that both Democratic candidates would be hated and vilified by the GOP.While all eyes are on the race for the presidential nomination, changing the dynamics of Congress should also be a top priority to anyone who wants to see the country continue to move forward, not back.Image credit: Wikipedia Public Domain",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox Host Shatters Conservative Claim That Bathroom Bills Are Needed To Stop Predators (VIDEO),"A Fox host actually debunked a conservative talking point by doing what a real journalist does best: research.An anti-LGBT conservative columnist appeared on Fox News Sunday to defend anti-LGBT laws that ban transgender people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.Ben Domenech argued that such laws are necessary to protect women and children from predators whom right-wingers claim will use transgender protections to get into women s restrooms to sexually harass and assault victims. That s actually what people are concerned about,  The Federalist columnist claimed.  They re less concerned about transgender people coming into bathrooms than they are about men using this as a way to get into locker rooms with women and to exploit that opportunity to participate in some kind of criminal act. Of course, predators can already do that and no law will stop them from doing it anyway if they are stupid enough to do it. Besides, sexual assault is a crime whether transgender people are protected by the law or not. So men who willfully go into women s locker rooms and sexually assault them are going to be arrested and jailed for it.These anti-LGBT  bathroom bills,  however, criminalize the act of going to the bathroom and have more to do with bigotry than they do with preventing crimes that haven t even happened yet. It sounds like many of these Republicans have watched the film Minority Report one too many times.And that s the exact point Chris Wallace made in response to Domenech s claim. We actually tried to find out whether it is a public safety issue,  Wallace said.  Whether it is a problem with transgender people misusing bathrooms to prey on others. Wallace then hit conservatives with a PolitiFact ruling stating that they  haven t found any instance of criminals convicted of using transgender as cover in the United States. Neither have any left-wing groups or right-wing groups. Indeed, in 17 states and over 200 cities across the country that have passed transgender protections, there has not been a single example of a predator using the protections to get into a women s bathroom. This seems to be a solution in search of a problem,  Wallace observed.Fox analyst Juan Williams agreed and used the example of a North Carolina Sheriff who said that he had never dealt with this issue over the course of his entire 40 year career in law enforcement. Republicans are creating a  wedge issue,  Williams explained, so that they can court the votes of evangelicals in the same way that Republicans did by putting anti-same sex marriage initiatives on the ballot in 2004. Only this time, the transgender issue isn t having the same power because most of the population doesn t consider transgender people to be a problem.Here s the video via YouTube.These  bathroom bills  are nothing more than a bigoted effort by Republicans to legalize discrimination against the LGBT community and states that have foolishly passed them are facing severe backlash that has resulted in corporations cancelling projects and entertainers cancelling shows. The federal government is even looking into whether federal funding in these states should be revoked over violations of federal anti-discrimination laws which could cost these states billions of dollars.The fact is that Republicans are creating an imaginary issue to justify the passage of bigoted laws and they have brought shame and economic ruin to their states in pursuit of nods of approval from an ever-shrinking evangelical population who wish to use religion as a shield to excuse discriminating against certain groups of people.But Fox News just shattered the bullshit claim made by conservatives to defend these bigoted laws. So the question is what excuse will they invent next?Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Henry Rollins DESTROYS North Carolina’s GOP Governor For Signing Anti-LGBT Law,"Bigoted North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory is going to be nothing more than a footnote in history who everyone forgets about as far as Henry Rollins is concerned.In a column for LA Weekly, the singer, actor, and television presenter known for hosting programs on the History Channel wrote about how the Republican governor will be little remembered after this shameful time in North Carolina comes to an end. It seems like a long way to go to please a handful of hicks, but obviously the governor was losing sleep over all those poor homophobes shaking in their boots as to who is in the stall next to them, and he took action,  Rollins wrote.The ink was not even dry on the anti-LGBT bill McCrory signed into law before corporations, activists, and entertainers began hammering the state for legalizing discrimination.Paypal has cancelled a project in the state that would have created hundreds of jobs. The NBA is considering pulling the All-Star game out of Charlotte. Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and several other entertainers have cancelled performances in North Carolina in protest of the law. And the state faces losing millions of dollars that flows into the state from the federal government. All of this is costing the state dearly as Republicans continue to refuse to repeal the discriminatory law.HB2 allows business owners to discriminate against LGBT customers and employees and they can hide behind their Bibles and scream  religious freedom  to do so.Rollins also detests the bigoted law and warned McCrory that people will want to forget his legacy and that he ever existed for the way he has embarrassed North Carolina during his tenure as governor. The truth is that no one cares what his name is,  Rollins continued.  He will be dimly remembered as the asshole who signed that f*cked-up bill that embarrassed the majority of North Carolinians. If McCrory eventually caves and tries to repeal it, everyone will know it s because he values money over his homophobia, which he has poorly disguised as moral rectitude and common sense. Either way he s f*cked. Rollins also hilariously smacked down North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Walker for whining about Bruce Springsteen cancelling the concert. Punching himself in the dick, North Carolina Congressman Mark Walker described Springsteen as  known to be on the radical left,  then generously added,  He s got every right to be so,  but considers Springsteen s cancellation a bully tactic. In a sad attempt to show how  with it  he is, Walker quipped,  We ve got other artists coming soon   Def Leppard, Justin Bieber. The congressman added,  I ve never been a Bieber fan, but I might have to go. Maybe artists who weren t  born to run  deserve a little bit more support.  Do they hand out free bags of dumbfuck at red lights in N.C.? Mic. Dropped.Republicans seriously need to give up their effort to legalize bigotry in this country under the guise of religious liberty because it is clearly backfiring.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Republican Clerk Who Wiped Thousands From The NY Rolls Just Got Very Bad News,"Republican Clerk Diane Haslett-Rudiano is living proof that voter fraud exists, but not in the way her party is selling it. They would have you believe that dead people are voting by the thousands; that entire congressional districts are won by people who moved away decades ago. You ll hear stories of illegals storming the southern border at great peril to their own lives so they can vote in American elections. Those stories would be all false. We know why Republicans want to keep people from voting. If enough people voted, things would change.Haslett-Rudiano was handed something we don t hear about often enough in these kinds of matters: She was suspended without pay pending an investigation. The translation to that is that it doesn t look good that whatever this woman was involved in cost thousands of New Yorkers their right to vote. According to Telesur TV:The board may fire her as soon as Tuesday, and the New York Daily News reported that colleagues said she is being  forced out. Why is it alleged that 125,000 people have been removed from the voter rolls? Why did 60,000 people receive notices to vote that didn t have the primary date? Why were people told they were in the wrong polling place time and time again?  New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer told CBS 2.  The next president of the United States could very easily be decided tonight and yet the incompetence of the Board of Elections puts a cloud over these results. The New York Attorney General said he received over 1,000 voter complaints, compared to 150 complaints in 2012. Haslett-Rudiano is thought to have skipped a step in a regular protocol of updating the voter list with deaths and changes of address.The error resulted in nearly 8 percent of Brooklyn s registered voters being denied their ballot.She skipped a step. Oops! Who gets the shaft? The registered, disenfranchised voter. In Brooklyn, they re probably hoping to hit more Democrats. Eight percent of any population is mind-blowing. It s a potential game-changer no matter where you go. The lengths the GOP will go to see to it that people lose interest in the voting process are astounding. They ll enact  voter fraud  legislation and pull tactics that have folks remembering voting as some line they used to stand in for no reason.Keep your corporate shills in office, gut education so you can cultivate more Republicans, and hope you don t lose too much in the next crash.

 Maine GOP Governor’s Statement On Drug Overdoses Proves ‘Pro-Life Republicans’ Don’t Exist,"If I were to tell you that Republicans simply hate regular American citizens, that wouldn t be news. To suggest that they just wish the poor, criminals, and other less advantaged segments of society would do them a favor and just die already, wouldn t come as a shock either.However, what is a bit shocking is to hear a Republican SAY IT so boldly and in such a smug and self-righteous manner.Maine s Republican governor, Paul LePage, just vetoed a bill that would allow pharmacists to provide anti-overdose drugs for use on victims without a prescription. If that isn t  bad enough, wait till you read his reason why.Pro-life? Yeah right.LePage proudly announced his support of increased overdose deaths, saying that using anti-overdose drugs  serves only to perpetuate the cycle of addiction. LePage said that the drug, Naxolone, doesn t  save lives    it only extends them until the next overdose.A governor of a U.S. state just literally said that he would rather his own citizens DIE than be able to get assistance with a drug that could prevent death long enough to get them to a hospital. HOW THE HELL IS HE STILL IN OFFICE?Why stop there? Why not just say ALL medical treatment or medicine should be made unavailable because it only extends life? Got meningitis? Tough luck, you will only grow old and die anyway some day. Cancer? Screw you. Go die in the corner.It s important to remember too, that there is currently a serious heroin use epidemic going on in northeastern states, Maine in particular. Having this drug available without a prescription, to be kept in the case of an emergency, could mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people who struggle with addiction.Paul LePage is the perfect personification of all the hate, contempt, greed, and joy in the harm of others that is at the rotten heart of modern American conservatism.

 Amy Schumer Attacks Anti-Choice Republicans In Hilarious New Sketch (VIDEO),"Whenever Amy Schumer has aimed to make a feminist statement, she s hit her mark perfectly. She s back on television for the fourth season of her Comedy Central show  Inside Amy Schumer,  and she s delivered another spot-on sketch about the GOP s never-ending war on women, and the absurdity of male politicians making personal decisions for women.For the show s premiere, Schumer opened with a hilariously accurate skit about women s healthcare. During the sketch, Amy is at her OBGYN s office to get her pap smear when she realizes that instead of her gynecologist, she ll be seen by four politicians from a fictitious House Committee on Women s Health.Schumer demands to know where the real doctor is, and one of the congressmen replies with the very logic that has been used by several GOP lawmakers:  We re the House Committee on Women s Health! So I think we have a better idea than a bunch of science-y nerdles. The four fake congressmen then pull out clipboards and bombard Schumer with a bunch of misogynistic questions about her sex life and vaginal health. They shame Schumer s sexual history, call her menstruation cycle a  lady curse  and refer to tampons as  blood diapers.  One politician is completely silent during the whole thing, aside from randomly inserting  ew  as Schumer tells her ill-advised committee about her vagina or period.The conversation with the clueless politicians goes pretty much exactly how actual discussions with Republican lawmakers go when it comes to women s bodies, their health and their human rights. After getting through all the committee s invasive questions, Schumer finally is ready to get her pap smear. But as she puts her legs in the stirrups, she finds that she is surrounded by an even larger group of male politicians watching her. She objects: What? Wait. I feel a lot more comfortable with a woman in here. Aren t there any women on the Women s Health Committee? Driving Schumer s point home, a congressman giggles and makes the condescending remark, That would be like letting the lions run the zoo!  You can watch the hilarious but true episode below:Inside Amy SchumerSchumer absolutely nailed it by pointing out exactly how ridiculous it is that we have male politicians   who are completely clueless and unqualified   making legislature on behalf of women s bodies and health.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"April 24, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Tries To Imitate Hillary Clinton In Attempt To Be Funny — Fails Miserably (VIDEO),"While Donald Trump may be winning among those taking part in the Republican primaries, his method for garnering votes will probably not hold up as well in the general election if he were to be the GOP nominee. So far, he s been incredibly racist and xenophobic, not to mention sexist, juvenile and just outright rude. All things that play well with a large part of the Republican base, and Trump clearly knows this.Knowing he s getting closer and closer to securing the Republican nomination, and knowing Hillary Clinton is very close to securing the Democratic nomination, Trump has made a clear pivot to the general election in his campaign strategy. Now, instead of making fun of his GOP competitors like Cruz and Kasich, he s putting more energy into making fun of Hillary Clinton. And I say  making fun,   that is literally in the most sophomoric sense it can be taken.While in Connecticut, Trump decided he would imitate the former Secretary of State and how she conducts herself with speeches. You know, like an adult   like a person who wants to be president.After talking about how many have asked him to be  more presidential,  he tells his crowd he simply can t do such a thing, because he needs to rile up and entertain his crowds so they don t fall asleep. Then he brings out his new attack line and nickname for Clinton and asks the crowd,  have you ever seen Crooked Hillary?  then imitates her walking on stage. Then he says,  Hello. How are you? This is Crooked Hillary Clinton?  and of course his crowd ate it up, because let s be real, they d be entertained by a paper bag floating in the wind ( oooh, so pretty! ).The imitation wasn t only horrible, it was in horrible taste. Trump is a man vying for the highest office in the entire nation and whoever wins the election will be leader of the free world, and he clearly thinks being a vile, misogynistic child is the way to behave to gain people s respect.Trump doesn t deserve our respect, he deserves our condemnation, and any decent person with half a brain should agree. So, let him perform for his crowd of imbecilic simpletons. The adults who will be deciding the general election will make damn sure he never sets foot in the Oval Office.Watch his insane performance here:.@realDonaldTrump says acting ""presidential"" is easy, does a Hillary Clinton impression: https://t.co/0SZwzCgxxz https://t.co/pRiNYg0Vbl  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 23, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Imitates Indian Call Center Worker In Latest Racist Tirade On Campaign Trail (VIDEO),"If one were to best describe Donald Trump, especially at one of his campaign rallies, he would be the living embodiment of a Fox News Facebook comment section   just full of vile, fear-filled, xenophobic, racist, hate-filled rhetoric.Making sure he lives up to this reputation while on the campaign trail in Delaware, Trump decided he would tell people about his experiences with call centers, primarily those that are overseas. And while these call centers are taking away American jobs, the people who work in these centers overseas are human beings trying to make an honest day s wage for themselves, and should be treated as such.However, Trump decided to do what he always does, and with no regard for who s he s throwing under the bus because he has a point to make, decided to imitate a call center worker from India.Trump said that he called the center to pretend he was checking on his credit card, then asked the worker,  Where are you from?  and that s when he did the impression, saying  We are from India,  in his disgusting attempt to pander to his racist and xenophobic crowd. Trump then supposedly said to the call center,  Oh, great. That s wonderful. Thank you very much, that s all I need to know,  and proceeds to pretend to hang up the phone.Did he make this story up? Probably, but it doesn t make it any less racist.Here s the thing, Trump doesn t care who he s offending as long as he s winning. He s fanning the flames of racism and hatred everywhere he goes, because it s clearly working, and that should terrify all of us.We need to make sure Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office come November. He s not only bad for the nation, but it would be devastating for the entire world.Donald Trump says he called his credit-card company just to see if an Indian call center answered https://t.co/Cdv0korqNo  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 22, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fact: Superdelegates Have Never Determined The Democratic Nominee,"As the Democratic Primary heats up heading into yet another  Super Tuesday   where Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Maryland, Delaware and Connecticut will decide who to support for the 2016 presidential election, questions (and hostilities) are flaring up yet again over the designation of superdelegates.Questions remain whether or not Hillary Clinton will be able to amass the 2,383 delegates needed to secure a nomination without the support of superdelegates. Clinton s campaign says they are not worried about falling short, but Jane Sanders, wife of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, thinks otherwise. However, after a crushing blow in New York, team Sanders has had to come up with a new strategy if they hope to win the nomination   that strategy, according to reports, is to persuade superdelegates to back him, a move the Clinton campaign has cried foul on.But in all, it really doesn t matter one way or another. What many people may not know is the superdelegate system, since its introduction in the 1984 election, has never determined who the Democratic nominee is.That s right. Superdelegates have never been responsible for putting Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry or Barack Obama on the national stage for the general election. In 2008, the primary showdown between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton was even closer than it is now, and still superdelegates weren t responsible for Obama s win.While appearing on Fox News with Maria Bartiromo, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, head of the DNC and a congresswoman from Florida, reminded audiences of this crucial fact, as hostility intensifies within the party.Politifact decided to fact check this claim, using information and second opinions from a multitude of political scientists, and concluded that Wasserman Schultz is right (with one little detail left out), and gave the rating as  Mostly True,  writing:The first election where Democrats used superdelegates was in 1984, where they helped Mondale secure the nomination on the first ballot at the convention. It s not clear that they were the  determining  factor. Some say Mondale would have won without them.Since that time, a Democrat has won the nomination early enough where the superdelegates haven t mattered.What that means is the elections between two candidates (or more) in the Democratic primary have never been so close that superdelegates were needed to break the  tie  or push one candidate over the edge to victory. By the time the conventions have rolled around, it s been clear who the people (and pledged delegates) have picked.Only Mondale got help with superdelegates, but sources differ on whether they determined his win.Essentially, the superdelegates have been a symbolic vote by those within the Democratic ranks as to see which direction they want the party to head in. But why should we have them, then? According to the Wasserman Schultz, their purpose is to make sure that party activists who want to be delegates to the convention don t have to run against much better-known and well-established people at the district level. So whether or not you love them or hate them, just remember they have never been responsible for nominating the candidate you love or hate.

 Florida Doctor Fired For Attacking Uber Driver (VIDEO),"A Miami doctor has been fired after a video of her assaulting and screaming profanities at an Uber driver went viral.Jackson Health System announced on Friday that they are terminating Anjali Ramkissoon, 30, a four-year neurology resident for her actions in the video. They released a statement that said: Jackson Health System is moving forward with the termination of Dr. Anjali Ramkissoon, a resident doctor. She is entitled to an appeal process. The assault took place in January and the doctor was initially put on probation. In the video, an extremely drunk Ramkissoon is seen hitting, kicking and cursing at the driver. The Uber driver is seen trying to restrain her, but after she kicked him he threw her to the ground and ran to his car. Ramkissoon got up, went to the car, opened the door and started throwing things out of his vehicle. There is absolutely no excuse for my actions. I am so sorry. I have hurt so many people with this. My family, my friends, my job, the Uber driver. Nobody deserves to be treated that way. That s not me. Unfortunately for her, the apology was not enough to save her job   and rightfully so. I have been drunk many times and have never used it as an excuse to assault another human being. At thirty years old, she should know how to handle herself. While I understand that alcohol makes some people act a fool, as a neurologist she should know what happens to her brain when she drinks too much   it makes her actions even less excusable.Hopefully, she has learned how to control herself. It would be a shame to see all of that education go to waste.Watch the assault:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Guess Which Supreme Court Justice Got Caught SLEEPING During A Case (IMAGE),"These days, a certain few justices on the Supreme Court (the Republicans, of course) are known to be doing little more than occupying space and selling their votes to the corporate owners of the Republican Party. The one who is most notorious for being a useless sack of protoplasm is Justice Clarence Thomas. The guy never says a word. He just sits there, staring into space and waiting until he can render his verdict. It s a contemptible type of conduct for someone who is supposed to help decide on issues that are of grave importance to millions of   if not all   Americans on a daily basis.Thomas has openly admitted in the past that he has a work ethic that can be summed up best by the word  zero.  There were times he had admitted that he decided how he would rule on a case before it even started. This is literally judicial malpractice. As a judge, the essence of how you do your job is tied to listening to evidence and making a conclusion based on the facts in an impartial way. What Clarence Thomas does is a complete abdication of his responsibilities as a Supreme Court justice.So  you must be wondering,  What does Clarence Thomas do all day at work if he doesn t actually DO or even SAY anything? You ll get your answer by hitting the play button below:look at this drawing from SCOTUS oral arguments yesterday pic.twitter.com/eSTR9IiEfN  sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) April 22, 2016A courtroom artist decided to be brutally honest and draw Clarence Thomas doing exactly what he does   sleeping on the job.Yes, a judge on the highest court in the free world, responsible for deciding cases of monumental importance to the function of our republic, finds it to be just fine to just sit and sleep during his work day.

 Watch Bill Maher Absolutely SHRED Trump For Trying To Clean Up His Image (VIDEO),"Bill Maher LOVES ripping Donald Trump apart, and Friday night s Real Time was no exception. As the media has recently been fawning over the Republican frontrunner s new politically correct persona and celebrating the fact that it has been a few days since Trump has disrespected or offended anyone, Maher took it upon himself to set the record straight.During his show, Maher was joined by his panelists, author Charles Cooke, Leslie Stahl of 60 Minutes, and CNN s Van Jones, to talk about Trump s new public image   a move that Trump s newly hired senior aide, Paul Manafort, was behind. It seems that Trump s campaign has finally caught on to the fact that the candidate s vulgar, brash personality is working against him as the general election approaches, and Manafort has been trying to get the business mogul to tone it down. Since Trump has been playing nice lately, the conservative media hasn t stopped gushing over how  presidential  he is.Remarking on Manafort s comments that Trump has merely been  playing a part  this whole time, Stahl wondered, They re trying to tell the [Republican] party that he s going to change, that they re gonna  fix  his personality  he can t do that. How s he gonna change his personality? Maher was quick to jump in and made a hilarious connection between Trump and dichotomous comedian Andrew Dice Clay, who switches identities whenever he feels like it. Imitating what Trump might sound like, Maher said: He doesn t have to. Sometimes he goes  I m done being Andrew. I m Dice now.  And then Trump puts on the leather jacket:  Hey, hickory dickery dock / a Mexican went up the fucking clock! You can watch Maher s entire takedown below:Manafort s comments about Trump s personality are reminiscent of something Trump endorser and former candidate Ben Carson said about The Donald when he was explaining why he was supporting him. Completely leaving out the part where Trump bribed him with a job, Carson said: First of all, I ve come to know Donald Trump over the last few years. He s actually a very intelligent man who cares deeply about America. There are two different Donald Trumps. There s the one you see on the stage and there s the one who s very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully. Hardly believable. Trump s team can try to repaint Trump s personality all they want, but they ll never be able to hide his ignorance, intolerance and bigotry.

" Costa Mesa Official: If You Don’t Make Enough To Live Here, Get Out","California is one of the most expensive areas of the nation to live in. That s no secret. However, there are plenty of people who live there who aren t high-rolling actors, singers, producers, and other wealthy Beverly Hills types. There are plenty of everyday folks who live in California, and many are being priced out of their homes and neighborboods. This problem is something that people are attempting to resolve in Costa Mesa, through ordinances regarding development, but one official has a completely heartless  solution  for poor families who cannot afford to live there: move somewhere else.The idea of an ordinance to make a town affordable for a variety of income levels sounds like a good one, right? Well, not to city council members in Costa Mesa. The original idea was that there would be a choice for housing developers: either have some units that almost anyone could afford, or pay the city for the privilege of providing only luxury housing. However, the entire idea has now been shelved. Council member Katrina Foley says of the original idea, which she personally championed: The goal is to try to protect the quality of the community   don t overbuild it, use measured development that is planned and thoughtful. I don t see that we re doing that in any way, shape or form, and we re definitely not providing housing for our workforce. Another member of the Costa Mesa City Council, Sandy Genis, says the ordinance would essentially apply to those developers who somehow benefit from building in Costa Mesa: If we re giving something, we need to get something. If we re going to have a healthy community, we need to have housing for our workers. The thing is, though, the idea for the ordinance in Costa Mesa is not a new one. The ever-increasing costs of living in a place like California mean that, according to records, one-third of cities and counties in California have adopted some form of inclusionary zoning.  As it should. California does not have an asterisk next to its name that says  only rich people welcome. However, Mayor Pro Tem Jim Righeimer is totally heartless on the matter. He says he is, quote,  completely against  affordable housing ordinances, and insists that if people cannot afford Costa Mesa, they need to pick up and go elsewhere: I m going to be very clear, and this is a wakeup call to people: If you cannot afford to live here and your kids can t have decent housing, you should look at where you can afford. That is, of course, the most cold-hearted response to this housing crisis this horrible man could come up with. Does he really think poor families can afford to move across the country at the drop of a hat? Hell, the move itself would cost thousands. That s not even including the part about switching schools for children, finding new jobs, finding places to live in a new location, leaving extended family behind   the list goes on and on.Does this guy even think about what he is saying here? Mr. Righeimer, we re all aware of how expensive California is to live in, and it is that expense that is the problem, not the poor people you want to price out of their homes.You, sir, have no business holding office anywhere if you cannot represent all of your constituents   including the poor ones.Featured image via Mark Boster/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oklahoma Republican: God Will Pay Legal Expenses And Save Economy If We Ban Abortion,"Republican delusion never ceases to reach new ridiculous heights of absolute stupidity.In their race to make Oklahoma the most anti-abortion state in the nation, Republicans passed SB1552 in the House this week. The legislation now moves to the Senate where it will likely also pass before then heading to the desk of GOP Governor Mary Fallin, who will likely sign it into law. You know, because hating women and costing taxpayers millions of dollars to defend an unconstitutional law is what Republicans obsess with these days.But one Republican actually argued that Oklahoma taxpayers shouldn t worry about the cost of the legal expenses because according to him, God will pay the costs.Despite the fact that Oklahoma faces a $1.3 billion deficit, GOP state Rep. David Brumbaugh excused passing the bill by claiming that God will fix the state s crumbling economy and pay all the legal expenses resulting from forthcoming lawsuits if they do the  moral  thing and ban abortion. Everybody talks about this $1.3 billion deficit,  Brumbaugh said on Thursday.  If we take care of the morality, God will take care of the economy. I ve heard almost every argument today about judicial challenge to this legislation and after much prayer and study, I ask myself this question,  he continued.  Do we make laws because they re moral and right, or do we make them based on what an unelected judicial occupant might question or overturn? No, Rep. Brumbaugh. We make laws in this country based on the Constitution and the Supreme Court has ruled that the 14th Amendment prohibits banning women from making private choices regarding their own bodies, and that includes the right to choose to have an abortion.But if SB1552 passes in Oklahoma, women across that state will no longer get a choice because the bill makes it a law that doctors who perform an abortion other than for a woman who has suffered a miscarriage or their life is in danger to have their license revoked. In short, women would not even be able to get an abortion within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy when 90 percent of abortions occur because doctors would be faced with having their license to practice medicine taken away from them. Basically, Republicans are trying to ban abortion by punishing doctors who perform the procedure.Brumbaugh went on to compare abortion to slavery and then scoffed at the fact that the bill is unconstitutional. Don t let people tell you,  Unconstitutional arguments, Roe v. Wade,  all this,  he said.Once again, a Republican insanely believes that passing certain legislation will please God enough that all of our problems will be magically fixed. Taxpayers in Oklahoma should be outraged that one of their own representatives is trying to dupe them in this way to excuse a bill that would strip millions of women of their reproductive rights.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Hillary Lambasted Trump’s Hateful Rhetoric By Mocking His Ridiculous Tweets, And It’s Hilarious","When it comes to political campaign strategies, Donald Trump clearly believes he can hate and insult his way into the Oval Office. So far, it s working in the Republican primary, because let s face it, the GOP has become a party of hateful rhetoric and building up fear of anyone other than those who look and act exactly as they do (predominantly white, heterosexual,  Christian,  etc.). However, that strategy, most likely, will not work in the general election, because the rest of America sees Trump as the ridiculous mudslinger that he actually is.Pointing this out in a pretty hilarious way was none other than Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. She, or her campaign staff with her approval, took to Twitter to put Trump on blast about his hateful tone and rhetoric. After all, Trump is already pivoting to the general and referring to Clinton as  Crooked Hillary.  It s a technique he s been using in the primaries against his Republican opposition, so he figures he should try it out for the general as well.What did Hillary tweet out? A Washington Post article highlighting pretty much every hateful and disparaging thing Trump has said throughout his campaign, with every paragraph beginning,  Remember when  Yet, she introduced the article on Twitter by hilariously mocking the way Trump tweets. All too often you ll see Trump tweet something out, and it will be followed with a one word sentence    Sad! Well, Hillary did just that right back at him.Does Trump think he can fool us into forgetting his hateful rhetoric? Sad! https://t.co/0Vvw0m36ZX  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) April 23, 2016If Trump wants to pretend he s a politician and enter into the biggest political race in the entire world with no experience whatsoever, he s in for a boat-load of  f*ck you  from the Clinton campaign if they face off in the general election. Trump may be able to get away with going after his Republican opponents, because let s face it, they re weak and inexperienced themselves, but the Clintons?? Haaaa! Good luck with that.

 Bill Maher Hilariously Humiliates Ted Cruz With Facts You Didn’t Know About Him (VIDEO),"Bill Maher had every one of his panelists in stitches as he read these.During Real Time on Friday night, the HBO host noted that Us Weekly ran a list of 25 things we don t know about Hillary Clinton. After lampooning some of them, Maher declared that the other candidates deserve equal time.So he and his staff put together 25 things we don t know about Ted Cruz and read some of them during the show, and guest panelist Van Jones couldn t help but laugh his ass off, which greatly amused Maher. I spent my entire freshman year of high school stuffed in a locker,  Maher began about Cruz. As a child I used to imagine what it must be like to have an imaginary friend. My nickname at Princeton was F*ckface Mirrors don t show my reflection. I named the stick up my ass,  Hank. At that point, Jones was laughing so hard that Maher told him he should take some heart medication. And then he continued. My Cuban half once robbed my Canadian half at gunpoint. My children love to play hide and seek, sometimes for weeks at a time. Jesus once descended from heaven just to punch me in the face. Here s the video via Twitter. I smell with my tongue   and 25 other things you didn t know about Ted Cruz, thanks to @BillMaher. WATCH:https://t.co/pToAJBnMBC  Real Time (@RealTimers) April 23, 2016This is without a doubt the most hilarious take-down of Ted Cruz to date. And he totally deserves it.While Republican front-runner Donald Trump seems to be saying stuff just to make conservatives happy even if he may not necessarily truly believe what he is saying himself, Ted Cruz actually does believe the bullshit he says. Ted Cruz is probably the most dangerous candidate in the GOP field, but the good news is that most Americans, including his own Republican colleagues, hate him. And that makes him the perfect fodder for comedians like Bill Maher.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oklahoma GOP Just Took Their War On Women To A Whole New Level Of Crazy,"Republicans in Oklahoma just took their war on women and placed it on the doorsteps on doctors in the state.Late Thursday evening, the House of Representatives in the state, overwhelmingly approved a Senate bill that could revoke the licenses of doctors if they perform an abortion. Yahoo News reported:In the Republican-dominated legislature, the state s House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a Senate bill late on Thursday. Governor Mary Fallin, a Republican, has not yet indicated whether she will sign it.Under the bill, doctors who perform abortions would risk losing their medical licenses. Exemptions would be given for those who perform the procedure for reasons including protecting the mother or removing a miscarried fetus.According to the author of the bill, Senator Nathan Dahm, the bill was necessary because, This is our proper function, to protect life.  Republicans often say that they are protecting life when they interfere with a woman s right to choose, but the reality is that they are just pandering to the religious nuts in their voting base.As I have said a million times before, if the GOP was even a little bit  pro-life  they would do absolutely everything they could to prevent unwanted pregnancies. This means they would make sure that children were given a comprehensive education about sex; they oppose that. Republicans would also make sure that birth control (all forms) were easily available to women and men; they oppose that. If these imbeciles were pro-life, they would want to make sure all children were fed; they oppose foodstamps. Pro-lifers would also make sure that kids had medical care, even if their parents can t afford to pay for it; they oppose Medicaid expansion. Finally, if the right were actually pro-life, they would never send our kids off to die in their wars, bomb families in the Middle East, and they certainly would not support the death penalty; and yet, they do all of those things.This bill in Oklahoma bans abortion, make no mistake about that. And it doesn t ban it because the right loves babies and respects human life. It bans abortion because the right hates women and they especially hate when women have sex. It bans abortion because the GOP wants to punish  whores  who open their legs and it lets men off without any ramifications.This is just another way for men to exert their power over women. Fortunately, for the women in Oklahoma, if the female governor of the state decides to side with the right-wing jackasses in her party and sign the bill into law, it is completely unconstitutional and will never hold up in court.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 The Federalist Runs Ridiculously Offensive Story Claiming Republican Women Are More Attractive,"Conservative website The Federalist often bills itself as the respectable, serious alternative to many of the toxic right-wing watering holes that proliferate online, but every so often their true colors shine through. Guess what? They can be just as awful.Federalist writer Henry Scanlon was ogling some young women at this year s CPAC and came to the conclusion that the women who share his views on limited government and Ayn Rand are  incredibly attractive,  whereas the women on the left are manly. What follows   in a 2,000 word screed   goes from delusional to offensive to just plain pathetic almost at every paragraph. It s a stunningly offensive piece of fantasy that manages to demean liberal women and condescend to conservative ones in the very same breath.Here s what Scanlon, a middle-aged married man, says he noticed at CPAC:The young women who attend CPAC are spectacular. No kidding: What s up with this concentration of incredibly attractive young, conservative women? It s noticeable and remarkable. They are beautiful and stylish in the way French women often are, which is to say in their own way, not in a conforming or predictable way. They all look like the girl the high school quarterback wants to date, and they are confident, relaxed, and smart, joking amongst themselves.Could it be that they were joking amongst themselves about the creepy old guy staring at them from across the convention hall? Just a thought.Scanlon has two theories as to why conservative women are attractive. His own is based in science. The other, what he calls  a woman s explanation  is about French fashion. His  scientific    and let s use that word loosely here   explanation is that young women who dare read Ayn Rand despite the evil mainstream media demonizing the libertarian movement makes them  the prettiest, smartest girls  because they have an inner confidence.His wife, providing the  women s perspective , said it was because conservative women don t act like boys, which is ugly. Instead, she says, they are willing to take fashion risks, just like trendsetters in Paris.Scanlon also surmises that women on the right are more beautiful because being  politically correct  gives women wrinkles.Women of the Right are allowed to accept obvious things rather than engage in exhausting psychic gymnastics to get to a place that is politically correct, while preposterous. If a thug murders a pregnant woman, he should be charged with two murders, not just one, and women of the Right feel no compulsion to weary themselves by filing amicus briefs on behalf of the murderer to nullify the second killing because the unborn baby does not qualify as human life.He concludes that conservative women are just  freer  (in ideology, if not in, say, the right to decide what happens to their bodies) and that inner beauty makes them outwardly beautiful as well. And this being the Federalist, Scanlon attributes that to God favoring registered Republicans.Put another way, maybe what I m noticing is simply women who have been liberated by their worldview to be who they are, uniquely and confidently, unabashedly and apologetically, unencumbered by the politically correct constraints imposed on women of the Left, and the result is a kind of essential womanhood that, far from being oppressive, as the Left would have it, is instead, miraculous and quintessential, and, you could say, God-given.Bravo, Henry Scanlon, you ve managed to reduce women to either being ugly, oppressed liberals or angelic eye candy right-wing men can salivate over at conservative conventions. It s no small wonder why the Republican Party has had an incredibly difficult time appealing to women in this election.Featured image via Fox",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Jimmy John’s Thinks $1 Sandwiches Are Going To Make Us Forgive Their Horrible Right-Wing CEO,"This week Jimmy John s sandwiches offered $1 subs as a promotion for  Customer Appreciation Day,  hoping to revamp their image after the public caught wind of owner  Jimmy John Liautaud s disgusting business practices and hunting fetishes.The company started posted their $1 sandwich day on Facebook and Instagram earlier this week and people immediately called them out. According to Raw Story, the admin on the business  official Facebook page began deleting comments from posters who pointed out just how shady their CEO is. Specifically, anyone who reminded potential customer s about Liautaud s history as a big game hunter, had their comments immediately deleted.In 2015, the CEO admitted to the Chicago Tribune that he had killed a rhinoceros, elephants, and a leopard in the past, but claimed he doesn t hunt there anymore: I choose to hunt and I choose to fish,  he said.  Everything I ve done has been totally legal. And the meat has been eaten, if not by me than by someone I m with. I don t hunt big African game anymore. He claimed that it had been ten years since his last hunt in Africa, even though the pictures that outed him were from 2010.In addition to killing innocent elephants, Liautaud has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party. In 2011, Chicago Business reported:He s faced down a union-organizing drive and boycott in Minnesota. His Arizona franchisees have been picketed over his contributions to candidates who back that state s year-old anti-illegal immigration law. And he s stepped up his support of Republican candidates and causes, giving $100,000 to Sen. Bill Brady in the last few days of his losing gubernatorial bid and prominently co-hosting a big fundraiser Downstate last month for GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, to name just two.He is also one of the disgusting CEOs who protested being forced to provide his employees with healthcare when the Affordable Care Act took effect. In fact, he hated it so much that he made an appearance on Fox News and said that he would begin cutting his workers  hours in an attempt to avoid it.As if all of that wasn t reason enough to avoid his company, in 2014 Democrats in the House of Representatives sent a letter to the Labor Department and Federal Trade Commission asking for them to investigate Jimmy John s after the company forced employees to sign non-compete agreements. The letter stated: There is no justifiable business interest in imposing such a restriction on restaurant employees that are not privy to any of the company s proprietary information. Furthermore, we believe this practice can intimidate working individuals, many of whom are struggling to support themselves and their families while earning barely above the minimum wage. With all of these unsavory facts out there, it s not surprising that Jimmy John s would try to woo people with $1 sandwiches. Unfortunately for them, there are thousands of people like me who want everyone to know how horrible the company and its CEO really are. It is going to take a helluva lot more than cheap sandwiches to make us forget all of this.Featured image Instagram ",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Poised For Massive Losses This November,"The Republican Party is tearing at the seams due to Donald Trump s frontrunner status for the party s presidential nomination. Thousands of Republicans will either refuse to vote for him or vote for Democrats to keep Donald Trump from taking over their party and ultimately the Oval Office. But Mr. Trump s campaign, along with Senator Ted Cruz who is also despised by many of his Republican colleagues and supporters of the party, have pulled Republicans far to the right, leaving moderate Republicans with nowhere to turn but the Democratic Party.Republicans currently have a majority in both the House and the Senate. Congress has been in gridlock since they took over. The GOP majority has consistently refused to do their jobs; they are more focused on obstructing President Obama than working with Democrats to solve the pressing problems facing our nation. This November, those do-nothing Republicans will pay the price by losing elections across the country, in addition to the presidential election.Republicans love to do nothing, so the Democrats will help them achieve those ambitions of doing nothing by no longer allowing them to be employed in Congress. Despite the pressing and timely concerns posed by the threat of climate change, Republicans refuse to acknowledge its existence and do nothing. When religious nutjob Kim Davis refused to do her job as a county clerk charged with issuing marriage licenses in Kentucky, Republicans applauded her propensity for not doing her job. When Paul Ryan became Speaker of the House, Republicans forced him to promise to not do anything on immigration reform, and bow to the party leaders  wishes for Congress to continue to do nothing better than before.Despite mass shootings occurring all over the country on a regular basis, the Republican Party has refused to take any action on gun control or mental health issues.  Every meaningful proposal or reform that is introduced into Songress is met with staunch resistance from the Republican Party, who refuses to act to help solve or mitigate any of the issues facing the country. With the Republican majority gone, Democrats can finally start solving some of the country s problems.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 SICK: Republicans Write Letters Supporting Child Molester,"Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, who molested children, received some support from his fellow Republicans as they submitted letters asking for leniency for Hastert after a recent conviction.Dennis Hastert s legal team filed dozens of letters in federal court in Chicago on Friday from individuals expressing support for the former House speaker in preparation for his sentencing on Wednesday.Rep. Tom DeLay, the former House majority whip who helped position Hastert for his role as speaker, wrote that he is a man of  strong faith  and  great integrity. Hastert pleaded guilty of setting up payments of at least $900,000 in order to silence a high school student he sexually abused while he worked as a wrestling coach in suburban Illinois. Two more students also allege that Hastert abused them, and the sister of a deceased student says Hastert abused her sibling as well.Hastert, a conservative Republican, served as Speaker of the House from 1999 to 2007. During that time he was part of the movement to impeach President Bill Clinton over an extramarital affair. Hastert had already committed his offenses by then.Former Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who was often the true muscle at Hastert s side during his time as second in line to the presidency, was not the only Republican who submitted letters asking for leniency for Hastert, due to his age and health problems.In addition to DeLay and members of Hastert s family, Hastert s former GOP colleagues Reps. Thomas Ewing, David Dreier, Porter Goss and John Doolittle also submitted letters of support. The letters were initially submitted under seal, but Durkin said they had to be filed publicly in order to be considered at Hastert s sentencing.In 2015, former Hastert student Steve Reinboldt s sister Jolene gave an interview to ABC News. She told them that her brother confessed to her that his first sexual experience was with Dennis Hastert, and that he never told anyone because he was afraid nobody would believe him. Her brother told her that Hastert abused him for all four years of high school because he served as equipment manager for the wrestling team and had easy access to him.During his time as Speaker of the House, Hastert reportedly worked with other Republicans to cover-up allegations that Rep. Mark Foley had engaged in inappropriate relationships with young Congressional pages.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Eight Family Members Shot And Killed ‘Execution Style’ In Ohio (VIDEO),"Eight members of a family, seven adults and one teenager were shot and killed in rural Ohio in what authorities have described as an  execution style  homicide. Authorities say that all of the victims appear to have been shot in the back of the head. There were, however, three children who survived the shooting, all under the age of four. Ohio s attorney general Mike DeWine said: What makes this particularly grisly is the fact that you have these children involved who obviously were there when the executions took. The one mum was apparently killed in her bed with the four-day-old right there. It s just hard to believe. DeWine added that the killings may have taken place when the victims were in their beds adding,  You have one person who is armed and dangerous and there may be more than one, there may be two, there may be three. The victims were found Pike County, which is about 70 miles (112km) south of Ohio s capital, Columbus in separate homes. DeWine said: All of the victims are believed to possibly be members of the same family, and they were found in three Union Hill Road homes. The attorney general asked the public to contact authorities about any information that would lead to the capture of the suspect in the murders.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjlsh9oRxl4]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"April 23, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Phyllis Schlafly: Michele Bachmann Unqualified To Lead Conservative Movement,"Phyllis Schlafly, the rabid anti-feminist, anti-gay, anti-anything that makes sense grassroots organizer, thinks Michele Bachmann   yes, Michele Bachmann   is completely unqualified to pick up the torch and lead the family values movement.For once, Phyllis Schlafly and liberals agree on something.Schlafly, 91, is facing a coup by her own daughter and other members of her organization, The Eagle Forum, after endorsing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. Other members of the forum were unaware and taken aback by Schlafly s endorsement, and would have rather backed Texas Senator Ted Cruz.While appearing on right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones  radio show, Schlafly contends that after passing over her daughter, Anne Cori, for the position of successor, all hell began to break loose. The forum handpicked a successor, Ed Martin, but that notion quickly went down in flames.It was Schlafly s pick for a successor that shouldn t have surprised anyone: Michele Bachmann.The former Congresswoman from Minnesota and failed presidential candidate is almost identical in every way to Schlafly. They are both anti-woman, anti-gay, anti-science and oppose anything progressive. It seemed like a perfect match. Bachmann even recorded a moving tribute to Schlafly, who she called the pioneer of the modern conservative woman and her personal  heroine. However, as Schlafly got to know the Congresswoman on a more personal level, the quicker she realized Bachmann was completely unqualified to succeed her. Telling Alex Jones: A lot of our people wanted us to pick Michele Bachmann, and she certainly has a lot of talent, a very fine speaker and so forth. But she knew nothing about running an organization and she knew nothing about politics outside of her own domain. Ouch. Even Michele Bachmann is too stupid to lead an organization of equally stupid people. Add that to the list of things she s failed at.I m not quite sure what  her own domain  means, but if she s talking about Bachmann s fantasy-land inspired politics, than yes, she knows nothing.Here s Bachmann s cringe worthy tribute to Schlafly:Featured image via Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Curt Schilling Doubles Down On Transgender Hate On Facebook, Adds Racism (IMAGE)","After ESPN fired washed-up MLB pitcher Curt Schilling, and rightfully so, for posting an extremely transphobic image on his Facebook page, he decided that wasn t enough hate, so now he s added some racism to the mix.Clearly pissed that he lost his job, Schilling decided to repost an image put out by conservative blogger and wannabe comedian Steven Crowder. In the image it throws noted writer and activist Shaun King under the bus in its pathetic attempt to be funny. Which, I m sure to the myopic, racist and transphobic crowd Crowder plays to, is hilarious.The image says: Liberal Logic:Shaun King: Fakes being a black man. Gets Promotion.Curt Schilling: Thinks men should use men s bathrooms. Fired by ESPN. Here s the image: via FacebookNow anyone with half a brain knows that Shaun King, who has time and time again been accused of lying about his race, and has struggled through his own past to appease those who don t understand things that aren t as simple as black and white, is indeed a man of color speaking his own unique truth.But clearly, many conservatives, especially those like Crowder and Schilling who like to make fun of and are clearly afraid of anyone different from themselves, can t wrap their head around this sort of thing.And not only is Schilling not apologizing for his transphobic hatred that got him fired, he s now doubling down on it.As a diehard Boston Red Sox fan, who was proud during the bloody sock moments, I couldn t be more disgusted at this pathetic little scrap of a man who can t bring himself to basic human decency and recognize there are people on this planet who are, indeed, transgender.Schilling, at this point, delete your account.

 Watch: Obama Forced To Reassure U.K. That Republicans Haven’t Completely Ruined United States Yet,"In yet another unforced error committed by the Republican Party that hurts America s reputation, the recent surge in discriminatory laws against the LGBT community has caused alarm to the rest of the world. The U.K. even issued a travel alert to its citizens warning them of the risk of vacationing in places like North Carolina and Mississippi, given the new so-called  bathroom laws  and other forms of legislated bigotry. The U.S. is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country,  the advisory stated.  LGBT travelers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi. Before traveling please read our general travel advice for the LGBT community. The advisory encouraged travelers to avoid potentially risky situations and  excessive physical shows of affection,  and to  exercise discretion  in rural areas.President Obama, who happens to be in London, was forced yet again to play  only adult in the room  and reassure the international community that Republican laws, while particularly nasty, haven t made the United States a nightmarish hellscape, and that most people, including residents in those states, want absolutely nothing to do with the Republican Party s brash forms of discrimination. I want everybody here in the United Kingdom to know that the people in North Carolina and Mississippi are wonderful people, they are hospitable people, they are beautiful states and you are welcome. You should come and enjoy yourselves. I think you ll be treated with extraordinary hospitality. Taking a moment to get a bit more personal, Obama said that he found the laws to be absurd, hateful and contrary to the values of America. I also think that the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned and they re in response to politics in part and some strong emotions that are generated by people, some of whom are good people but I just disagree with when it comes to respecting the equal rights of all people. Obama on Miss. & N. Carolina anti-LGBT laws:The  laws that have been passed there are wrong  https://t.co/wpXr2SNDa9https://t.co/zbeZyND63o  CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) April 22, 2016The  bathroom bills  are in response to fabricated scenarios in which male child predators would dress up as women to gain access to bathrooms with girls in them. This has never once happened. The law, instead, opens up members of the trans community to further harassment, violence, and stigmatization.Most Americans seem aware of this and protests against the bathroom bills have become widespread. In North Carolina, the state is hemorrhaging millions of dollars a month in lost business and boycotts while the Republican governor and legislature stubbornly refuse to concede that this plan was based on little more than ignorance and hate. In South Carolina, a similar bill was quickly killed in a desperate effort to avoid becoming the next North Carolina.Meanwhile, the president is forced to explain and defend America s pathetic treatment of its LGBT community, because his opposition in the Republican Party would rather focus on bullying trans people than address things like climate change, wealth inequality, healthcare reform or immigration.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 What This Trump Company Did To A Veteran Will Disgust You,"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has claimed that he loves veterans and he loves the military. To be sure, most of the expressions of this supposed love have come in the form of Trump arguing that he would use the military to execute the innocent relatives of terrorists and that he would force members of the armed services to engage in torture practices banned by the Geneva Convention.But now it has been revealed that one of Trump s companies treated a military veteran in a disgusting way.Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has been vocal about the need to take care of U.S. veterans. He s said that if elected, he ll  put our service men and women on a path to success as they leave active duty. But that s not what the Trump Institute, a get-rich-quick real estate seminar, did for Richard Wright, a senior master sergeant in the Air Force reserves who worked for the company in 2006 and 2007. Wright was deployed to Afghanistan in the spring of 2007. When he came home to his job, the Trump Institute fired him.  All of your absences,  Wright s boss at the Trump Institute told him, had forced the company to  reevaluate your position with the Trump Institute.  It is a violation of federal law to penalize an employee for absences caused by military service.Wright provided the Huffington Post with proof he was awarded three medals for outstanding service during his time serving in Afghanistan.Stories about the shady and sometimes unethical business practices Trump engaged in or lent his name to over his career will continue to plague the candidate as he tries to restart and remake his image in preparation for the general election.It is unlikely to work and Trump s rhetoric will continue to be exposed as empty words hiding behind the military.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 93 Percent Of The Great Barrier Reef Is Nearly Dead Because Of Climate Change,"In the book, The World is Blue: How Our Fate and the Ocean s are One, Marine Biologist Sylvia Earle wrote: Even if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean, the ocean touches you with every breath you take, every drop of water you drink, every bite you consume Everyone, everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea. A report released this week discovered roughly 93 percent of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the largest living structure on Earth, has been damaged due to coral bleaching. We ve never seen anything like this scale of bleaching before,  said Professor Terry Hughes in a press release. Professor Hughes is Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and leader of the National Coral Bleaching Task Force which produced the report.  In the northern Great Barrier Reef, it s like 10 cyclones have come ashore all at once. The task force evaluated 911 coral reefs by air around Australia, and found 93 percent were suffering from coral bleaching to some extent. The bleaching was found to be worse in the northern sector of the reef, where no coral has escaped its impact. Based on diving surveys, the researchers say they have seen nearly 50 percent coral death so far.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, part of the United States Department of Commerce, increased ocean temperatures caused by climate change are the leading cause of coral bleaching. Coral depends on algae to survive, which is very sensitive to temperature changes. If warm temperatures remain constant for a long period of time, the coral dispels the algae, leaving it colored white, and eventually leading to the death of the coral if the stresses are prolonged. In 2005, the United States lost half its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea due to a massive bleaching event. High carbon emissions absorbed by the ocean also decrease Ph levels, leading to ocean acidification. Observation stations monitored by the US EPA in Hawaii, Bermuda, and the Canary Islands found that in the past two decades, carbon dioxide levels in the oceans have increased, directly resulting in the acidification. These changes also put stresses on marine life, diminishing the quality of their habitats and depleting food sources. If emissions aren t reduced soon, the negative effects already being seen in these environments will be irreversible. The bleaching doesn t necessarily mean the coral is dead, but the greater the stressors causing coral bleaching, the less likely the coral is able to recover.  It can take thousands of years for coral reefs to fully form, so once the coral dies, those ecosystems are unlikely to ever recover. This is, by far, the worst bleaching they ve seen on the Great Barrier Reef,  Mark Eakin, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s Coral Reef Watch, in an interview with the Washington Post.  Our climate model-based Four Month Bleaching Outlook was predicting that severe bleaching was likely for the [Great Barrier Reef] back in December. Unfortunately, we were right and much of the reef has bleached, especially in the north. Today on Earth Day, it is important to acknowledge and fully comprehend how dire the situation of our world s ecosystems are because of climate change. There is no time for incremental efforts. We must either make the necessary changes to mitigate the effects of climate change in the future now, or pay dearly for the consequences which will manifest exponentially in the near future. We can no longer treat our Earth as a source of infinite economic development when the resources on it are finite.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Remember That Time Prince Wrote A Song About Donald Trump? Listen Here (AUDIO),"With the passing of the legendary music icon Prince, many have been going to their music libraries to binge listen to everything they own that was done by the musician. It s a way for people to both grieve and celebrate the life of such an immense talent that was a gift to everyone he came in contact with, whether personally, or through his music.Yet, digging through the very large amount of music that Prince was a part of, it turns out that in the 90s Prince wrote a song called  Donald Trump (Black Version)  put out by the group  The Time.  Upon listening to the lyrics, it seems it s a song that has a man trying to be everything to a woman by buying her affection.Here s a brief taste of the lyrics: Honey baby, you truly know it. You truly know it. You look good. Tryin  your best to show it. If I were you, I would. True love and affection. These are nice, so nice but when a money man walks in the room, girl, you look more than twice. You look once, you look twice. Can I rap to you sugar tonight?(chorus) Donald Trump (black version), maybe that s what you need. A man that fulfills your every wish, your every dream. Donald Trump (black version), come on take a chance. A 1990 s love affair, the real romance. Flash forward to 2016, and the real Donald Trump is trying to buy the nation s affection to win himself the White House, even though he has no diplomatic, policy, or political experience whatsoever.Hopefully, money can only buy the Donald Trump s of the world love and not the presidency.Listen to the entire song here:Featured Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 New Study Offers Hope In Search For Alzheimer’s Cure,"Alzheimer s Disease is a devastating type of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, and currently affecting over 5 million Americans. According to the Alzheimer s Association, it is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States, and someone in the U.S. develops the disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, the number of cases is projected to reach 13.8 million.Scientists and researchers have grappled with understanding the disease in a search for a cure since 1906, when German neurologist Dr. Alois Alzheimer discovered the plaques and tangles in the brain of a woman who had died of an unknown mental illness with symptoms of memory loss, difficulty with language, and erratic behavior. Over the progression of the disease, amyloid plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles build up in the brain, disrupting connections between nerve cells and ultimately death of nerve cells and brain tissue.A recent study led by scientists from the University of Glasgow in Scotland and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has produced a potential breakthrough in Alzheimer s disease treatment.In mice with a progressive disease similar to Alzheimer s, the researchers injected a protein called IL-33. Within a week, the memory and cognitive functions of the affected mice improved to normal levels.  The daily protein injections cleared out existing amyloid plaque in the brain of mice and stopped its development. The results have yet to be tested in humans, with no guarantee the protein will have similar results in human trials. A 2014 study estimated positive results from experiments on mice translate to success in humans at a rate of 8 percent.Nonetheless, the study is promising as no cure or treatment is currently available for Alzheimer s disease. Alzheimer s care and other forms of dementia are estimated to cost the United States $236 billion in 2016.Working with the mice, the Scottish and Chinese researchers found the protein, IL-33, promotes the development of microglia, immune cells in the brain, and direct them towards the plaque formed by Alzheimer s disease. The relevance of this finding to human Alzheimer s is at present unclear. But there are encouraging hints,  said Professor Eddy Liew, a leading researcher of the study from the University of Glasgow, in a press release.  For example, previous genetic studies have shown an association between IL-33 mutations and Alzheimer s disease in European and Chinese populations. Furthermore, the brain of patients with Alzheimer s disease contains less IL-33 than the brain from non-Alzheimer s patients. There have been enough false  breakthroughs  in the medical field to caution us not to hold our breath until rigorous clinical trials have been done. The researchers will soon begin the first phase of clinical trials on humans to test the toxicity of the protein IL-33 at the doses used on mice, with the global medical community anticipating with hope for favorable results.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hollywood’s Secret Conservative Club Shuts Down Because Actors Can’t Stop Fighting Over Trump,"A highly exclusive, highly secretive club organized by and for Hollywood s (relatively small) conservative community has spectacularly imploded   and like many bad things, this can be blamed on Donald Trump.According to a recent announcement by  The Friends of Abe a club with members including Clint Eastwood, Gary Sinise, Kelsey Grammer, Jon Voight, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer   the group will abruptly end after reported in-fighting and lack of enthusiasm caused irredeemable dysfunction. Effective immediately, we are going to begin to wind down the 501 c3 organization, bring the Sustaining Membership dues to an end, and do away with the costly infrastructure and the abespal.com website,  the executive director, Jeremy Boreing, told members in an email, a copy of which the Guardian has seen. Today, because we have been successful in creating a community that extends far beyond our events, people just don t feel as much of a need to show up for every speaker or bar night, and fewer people pay the dues that help us maintain that large infrastructure. As the Guardian notes, one of the major reasons the celebrities can t get along is because of the question of Donald Trump. Many of the members can be said to subscribe to the school of  Never Trump , but some of Hollywood s conservative community has been warming to the candidate. Now, as California appears to be the key primary state, the one which will likely decide whether Trump slides easily into the nomination or if the clown show heads to a contested convention, things have gone nuclear. Things only got worse after the group hosted both Trump and his rival Ted Cruz at separate events  neither candidate, apparently, won over everyone.The club itself has been around for a decade, but not a lot is known about its meetings. The members, an enclave of conservatives in  liberal  Hollywood, adopted   and I m not kidding here   the first rule of  Fight Club : Don t talk about The Friends of Abe. Secrecy was strictly enforced, including a ban on pictures and tweets.It s unclear where the battle lines are drawn, but Jon Voight seemed to throw some serious shade at the  Never Trump  club members when in an interview with Breitbart, he said conservatives preventing Trump from being president were suckers. There are many Republicans fighting to keep him from winning the Republican nomination. You know why? Because he has no bull to sell, and everyone will discover the bull most politicians spew out is for their own causes and benefits. I pray all Americans who have seen and felt the meltdown of America with the Obama years, to please fight for Donald Trump. Both Gary Sinise and Kelsey Grammer are die-hard Cruz fans.In many ways, what happened in Hollywood is happening all over the country. The Republican Party has been shredded over Donald Trump s rise and with an alternative as weak as Ted Cruz as the only other option, many long-time Republicans have been stumbling around in what can only be described as a catatonically despondent state. Apparently, even holding a secret meeting with fellow conservatives at a bar became too much to handle as the primary season slouches towards its terrifying conclusion.Featured image via Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Warner Bros.

 Planned Parenthood Worker Rains Holy Hell On Ignorant Right-Wing A**hole On Social Media,"Planned Parenthood workers are sick and tired of being harassed by conservative pricks, and they aren t taking it anymore.Damien is an employee at a Planned Parenthood in Oregon and he was asked by the aunt of a teen boy to give her nephew the sex talk because the boy s mother didn t feel comfortable teaching the boy about sex and the his school lacks a sex ed program.And so, Damien gladly took up the task and later wrote about the experience on Tumblr. Today a 16-year-old boy was brought into the clinic by his aunt to  have the talk  because his school didn t teach sex ED and his mother wouldn t talk to him about sex. She spent 40 bucks so he could get tested for the first time. I spent an hour talking to this young boy about sex. I got to have the sex talk with him. I showed him how to properly use a condom and protect himself and his partners. We talked about STDs and pregnancy prevention. We even talked about pubic grooming and ways to avoid razor burn. This poor boy has never had someone talk to him about anything related to the changes his body is going through. And then we spent 20 minutes talking about consent and how important it is. Growing up I never, ever had someone talk to me about consent and its importance. I even had sex ED in school! This shit is important ya ll. Of course, it didn t take long for a conservative troll to notice the post and start harassing Damien and trash talking Planned Parenthood. It is the parents  duty to have  the talk  with their kids, not a government funded organization that murders babies,  the troll commented.Damien didn t sit back and allow the right-wing troll to get away with it. He ruthlessly fired back. First of all f*cktruck: I am not a government employee. My wages are not paid by the government. Second: zero babies have ever been murdered in a planned parenthood. I didn t say a god damn word about abortion but you had to get your f*cking tighty whiteys in a bunch because an organization that you know nothing about is doing good things for millions of people and you hate it. Shut your face up about shit you don t understand you f*cking dump truck. Abortion is murder, just because they re in the womb doesn t change the fact you re killing an innocent human being,  the right-wing troll continued to insist.  As I said, it s not a faceless organization s job to provide sex ed while simultaneously killing unborn children. The right-wing troll has slapped Damien with a glove so he picked up a gauntlet and smacked back on behalf of women everywhere. Listen up kiddo: Abortion isn t murder. Murder is illegal. Abortion is not illegal. IE abortion is not murder. As I said (and we ll go with what I said as not total bullshit because it s obvious you have absolutely no real knowledge when it comes to sex or reproduction and i think we can thank your parents for that) this young man had a single mother that didn t feel comfortable talking to him about sex. So i did it. I provided medically accurate and up to date information unlike so many parents today. And by the way, planned parenthood isn t some shadowy faceless organization. For example, this is my face. The face i made while reading your stupid ass response. And then he posted a picture of himself.Image via TumblrAnd that is how Planned Parenthood workers fight back against conservative blowhards.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: A GOP Candidate Just Released This Amazingly Racist Ad,"Republican congressional candidates have been the source of some of the most outrageous campaign ads over the last few years. A new ad from Kentucky 1st district candidate Mike Pape is one of the most racist examples of this that has come across in a long time.In the ad, three apparent Mexicans approach a border fence wearing t-shirts that say,  Stop Trump   Stop Ted Cruz  and  Stop Pape . The subtitled, heavily-accented actors explain that Pape will work to build Trump s wall or help Cruz repeal Obamacare, before saying they must stop him and charge into the country illegally. Pape then appears in the foreground to say he approves the message.The ad builds on Donald Trump s racially charged campaign rhetoric and his bizarre promise to  build a wall  between the United States and Mexico, paid for by the Mexican government.On the very first day of Trump s campaign, he blamed Mexicans for  bringing crime  like rape to America, as well as drugs.Gaskins is currently running in the Republican primary for his district against three other candidates, for the seat that will be opened up due to the retirement of Rep. Ed Whitfield. It is a heavily Republican district, with 73 percent of the vote going to the GOP in the 2014 election.The ad is a symptom of the problems plaguing the Republican Party nationally. As the country becomes more diverse, especially with Latinos, the GOP s hardcore base demands that candidates stick to racist and sexist appeals that reliably get voters to the polls.And when Republicans attempt to slightly moderate themselves   even with candidates who are otherwise hard conservatives   they are ostracized and excluded. For instance, while former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was an orthodox conservative, he argued in favor of immigration policy that was harsh but not as draconian as other candidates. As a result, Bush was utterly destroyed in the 2016 primaries and caucuses, even though he had more money than everyone else.This ad reflects the current state of the Republican Party, and it isn t a good look.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Moron Of The Day: Joe Scarborough Seriously Compares Trump To Prince (VIDEO),"Media Matters reports that on Friday morning, Joe Scarborough made a total ass of himself by comparing Donald Trump, the racist, sexist, knuckle-dragging buffoon, to the artist now and forever known as Prince:DONNY DEUTSCH: Trump voters, we all know right now, are so sticky. They re not going anywhere.JOE SCARBOROUGH (HOST): Yeah.DEUTSCH: Everybody who s voted for Hillary, well, I guess Hillary. Number two, he can go to the left and right of Hillary and pretty much put portfolio of issues together he s behind.NICOLLE WALLACE: Because he doesn t really care that much. I mean, he s so nimble.DEUTSCH: And to the point, to this last point  SCARBOROUGH: And by the way. I ll give you the last point in a second, but just on this other point where you said he s so flexible, he s like Prince, a shape-shifter, New York Times top left, election 2016,  Trump s views on gay issues set him apart on the GOP. I mean, Trump on social issues, on Planned Parenthood, when he was in the middle of the fight in South Carolina, it wasn t like he was hiding things. And so Hillary is going to be up against a guy that not only says we re not going to cut Social Security, I m with you on social issues. And by the way, we re going to kill ISIS in two weeks.Joe Scarborough is so far up Trump s ass that he probably thought this was a compliment to Prince. But let s be honest, Prince was an artist, a priceless cultural treasure that elevated his field. He influenced an entire generation of musicians and his presence will be sorely missed.Trump, on the other hand, is a con artist, a tacky cultural eyesore like his ugly buildings. His influence is a net negative for society. And that was BEFORE he got into politics. Trump s candidacy is not about the lowest common denominator, it IS the lowest common denominator. When he loses in November and eventually fades away in disgrace, no one will miss him but racists and misogynists.Scarborough was trying to compare their  shape-shifting  in a favorable way but Prince constantly re-invented himself while holding on to the core of his genius. Trump has no core other than,  Will it make me money and/or more famous?  This was a sad display, even for a hack like Scarborough.Here s the video:Featured image via screencap",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rabid Conservatives Blame Obama After Fox Reports Older Whites Are Killing Themselves At An Alarming Rate (SCREENSHOTS),"According to Fox News viewers, that dastardly President Barack  Barry  Obama Hussein Soetoro Bin Laden is singlehandedly eliminating the Republican Party. On Friday, Fox reported that middle-aged white people now account for a third of U.S. suicides.This is, of course, no laughing matter. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Fox notes that the rate of suicides in our country have risen 24 percent in the past 15 years. But the focus of the report, of course, was regarding white people:Suicides have long been most common among white people   particularly older white males. But most striking in the new report is the growth in whites ages 45 to 64.They were a third of suicide deaths in 2014, up from about a quarter in 1999. The findings in this report are extremely concerning,  said Nadine Kaslow, an Emory University researcher and past president of the American Psychological Association.The CDC data   released Friday   provides a detailed look at the latest year s suicide statistics, and a broader look at how much the situation has changed over 15 years.There were nearly 43,000 U.S. suicides in 2014. More than 14,000 of them were middle-aged whites   twice the combined total for all blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Alaska Natives.In other terms   a group that represents 18 percent of the U.S. population accounted for 33 percent of the suicides.No one knows why aging white people are killing themselves at such an alarming rate, though the report mentions that  middle age can be a particularly hard time for whites,  who don t have  as many supportive relationships with friends, family, or religious communities  as other demographics. But not to worry   the geniuses who pay attention to Fox for anything more than comic relief have some ideas. One idea, anyway. Obama. Of course.          Is Obama forcing older white people to kill themselves? Is this part of his plan to eliminate the white race, as some Trump supporters have alleged? Suicide is many things. It s a very real issue affecting millions of American families. It s an issue that needs to be addressed. It s sad. It is not a joke, and it is certainly not something that anyone in their right mind would blame on the President of the United States.But, of course, this is the Fox crowd we re talking about here. What else can we expect?Featured image via Getty Images/Robert Spencer (modified)",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 BUSTED: Trump’s RNC Czar Caught Telling Party Officials That The Donald Is All An Act,"Have you ever really taken a close look at Donald Trump? You can tell by looking at him that he s a fraud. He never looks genuine; his speech doesn t flow. He uses a fourth-grade mentality and he panders to idiots. There s nothing about the man that points to him actually being this staunch conservative Republican, and now we have proof. The Associated Press reports that Trump s own Republican National Convention Czar was caught in a behind-closed-doors meeting telling party officials that everything about Trump the party hates is an act.Trump s newly hired senior aide, Paul Manafort, informed Republican National Committee members that Trump has a private persona and an onstage persona, and that the onstage Trump will be mellowing out to bring electoral results should he be the party s nominee. Manafort said in the private briefing: When he s out on the stage, when he s talking about the kinds of things he s talking about on the stump, he s projecting an image that s for that purpose.You ll start to see more depth of the person, the real person. You ll see a real different guy.He gets it. The part that he s been playing is evolving into the part that now you ve been expecting, but he wasn t ready for, because he had first to complete the first phase. The negatives will come down. The image is going to change. In other words, the guy people are looking to because they don t want  another crooked politician  is playing the political game at a higher level on the Republican side than all of the establishment candidates he s run out of town. What exactly can we expect from Trump as time goes forward? Well, if his past is any indication, he should be whatever suits his mood at the time. It wouldn t be surprising to see him come out in favor of more liberal ideals. He has already stood up for the LGBT community on the transgender bathroom issue. It s obvious he couldn t care less about gay marriage. If he thinks he s gonna reap the same ignorant rewards from the general public on immigration and hate expansion, he s got another think coming.Trump s only play should he win would be to run his campaign like a Democrat. It s not like he doesn t have practice.Featured image by John Lamparski/Getty Images ",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Tributes have poured in all over social media and around the world. Block parties blasting his music could be seen roaring late into the night everywhere from his home state of Minneapolis, Minnesota, to New York City. There is another way the public is playing tribute to the iconic artist though: by bathing buildings in purple.Social media site Twitter is alight with images and tweets of various buildings alight in Prince s signature color, from his famous and timeless hit,  Purple Rain.

 Trump STUNS Republican Voter By Straight-Up Telling Her That He WILL Deport Her Family (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has figured out that the more offensive, controversial and vulgar he is, the more conservative voters are going to love him. He s carried that tone throughout his entire campaign, and has only seemed to rise in the polls. Now, he s focusing on offending individual Republican voters to win their approval.During a Today Show town hall event on Thursday morning, undecided Republican voter Jamie Eckman asked The Donald a question that would impact many Americans: would he deport the undocumented parents of a relative that was a natural-born citizen relative? Eckman asked: My relative is a natural-born American in the military, deployed in Oman. His father and stepmother are undocumented citizens here in the   undocumented people here in the United States for the last 25 years without any way of adjusting their status. If you re president, what will you do for those members that are the fabric of our country, that have been here for 25 years undocumented? Won t they be deported? Once again, Trump nailed his formula of being an absolute a**hole and despicable human being. After taking a few moments to insult his rival, Canadian-born Ted Cruz, Trump returned to the matter at hand and answered Eckman s question with something she probably didn t want to hear: Yes, your loved ones are still getting deported. Trump said: When you say natural-born citizens, that s interesting. I assume you were born here. Why do you mention that? Because you know who always says that? Ted Cruz. He was born in Canada and lived there for four years. He says,  I m a natural-born citizen  when, actually he was born in Canada. But, you know what? He has no path right now.. Eckman quickly clarified that she wasn t on team Cruz before Trump continued to tell Eckman she could kiss her family goodbye if he became the next President. They ve been here how many years? We re going to do something. For people that have been   look, we re either going to have a country or we re not going to have a country. But many people are very fine people. and I m sure these are very, very fine people. They re going to go, and we re going to create a path where we can get them into this country legally, okay? But it has to be done legally. Taken aback that she didn t get the answer she was looking for, Eckman asked the Republican front runner,  You will deport them first, right?  Trump responded: They re going to go, and then come back and come back legally. We have wonderful people. It s too tough to say you ll never come back again. They re coming back, but they re coming back into our country legally. So important. And to prove just how disgusting and heartless he is, Trump added,  Now that might not be the perfect answer for you, but am I going to get your vote?  Eckman didn t answer.You can watch Trump break this Republican voter s heart below:Despite all of the backlash he s faced, Trump continues to cling to his racist, intolerant immigration stance. It seems that unless Eckman wants to be packing her relatives  bags in November, she d better vote for Hillary Clinton. But unfortunately, because Republicans just aren t very bright, Trump might still get her vote.

 The NRA Just Got Caught In A Lie That Shatters EVERYTHING They Stand For,"Who can forget how emotional Wayne LaPierre was after Sandy Hook. As he stood at the podium with the NRA logo and raised his voice in disgust and demanded we put more guns outside first-grade classrooms. An armed security guard for every hallway! Never mind that schools in many states have resource officers from their local police or sheriff s department on hand, LaPierre needed to allow the pure anger to come through. Where were all the guns when those kids needed saving?That s the NRA s sole purpose for existing now: To make sure everyone has a gun, possibly 2. The 4.5 million-member organization is a powerhouse on Capitol Hill, spending $3.6 million lobbying in 2015 and nearly another million in campaign contributions, primarily to Republicans. They only care about one thing: a complete lack of gun control laws and regulations. They d like to see the Smiths with a battery of surface to air missiles in their side yard to compliment the Wilsons  anti-aircraft cannon. Stingers for all the kids this Fourth of July! They want everyone with a couple hundred bucks to be able to walk in and purchase a gun, no questions asked because that s what the gun manufacturers pay them to want.One of their most successful strategies has been to build up the  bad guy  theory. How often do you hear some meathead say  it would be better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have one.  Well, as it turns out, even with 300 million guns floating around the country, very few are used to thwart a crime or in an actual act of self-defense. Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center released a study about the use of firearms in self-defense and other  justified  shootings by private citizens with some scathing remarks for the lies perpetrated by the NRA: The [National Rifle Association] has staked its entire agenda on the claim that guns are necessary for self-defense, but this gun industry propaganda has no basis in fact. Guns are far more likely to be used in a homicide than in a justifiable homicide by a private citizen. In fact, a gun is far more likely to be stolen than used in self-defense. Purchasing a gun may help enrich the firearms industry, but the facts show it is unlikely to increase your personal safety. In fact, in a nation of more than 300 million firearms, it is striking how rarely guns are used in self-defense. It s not really that striking. The study found that just one in 32 gun deaths involving a criminal were the result of a self-defense scenario. That s when someone is armed and threatening another person. Those people whose toddlers kill each other after finding a gun in a nightstand because their parents need to feel  safe  from intruders were the victims of 0.1 percent of crimes involving guns.Basically, the NRA is full of sh*t. There is no cavalry of good guys with guns out there ready to stop criminals in the street. There are no packs of trained defense experts hanging out in school libraries waiting to thwart the next shooting. The people we need to really be afraid of are the mentally ill people, the felons and the domestic abusers. More often than not when you re the victim of a crime it s someone you know. You shot at something in your kitchen in the pitch black and then you were surprised to find your teenager came home late? Oops.They re selling fear and lies. ISIS is coming to get you. Burglars want to rape and kill your family and steal your flat screen. The feds are coming to take your guns and toss you in FEMA s famed  re-education  camps. That s good stuff right there.Featured image from Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

We remember the horrific scenes when Vice President Joe Biden s son died, and conservative trolls literally celebrated. It left many of us thinking: surely brain cancer doesn t need to be a partisan issue? Surely we should be able to mourn the untimely death of a person with compassion, whoever they vote for? Can we not just be human beings together in these moments?For some it seems, the answer is a resolute  Hell no!

 The Plans For The Republican Convention Just Suffered An Embarrassing Blow (VIDEO),"The plans for the Republican convention have suffered an embarrassing snag, because the country s leading and most renowned performers are refusing to play at the event. In short, the GOP is being boycotted by America s finest entertainers and performers.The GOP planned a concert on July 17 to kick off their convention, but performers are simply refusing to play ball. Seemingly after a number of rejections, the party got desperate and tried to trick performers into playing by selling the gig as a benefit for veterans. They managed to convince Eagles singer/songwriter Joe Walsh to play under this ruse. But when Walsh rumbled their plans, he immediately pulled out and issued a furious statement: It was my understanding that I was playing a concert which was a non partisan event to benefit the families of American veterans on Monday, July 17 in Cleveland. The admat I approved said this specifically. Today it was announced that this event is, in fact, a launch for the Republican National Convention. In addition, my name is to be used to raise sponsorship dollars for convention-related purposes. Therefore, I must humbly withdraw my participation in this event with apologies to any fans or veterans and their families that I might disappoint.I am very concerned about the rampant vitriol, fear-mongering and bullying coming from the current Republican campaigns. It is both isolationist and spiteful. I cannot in good conscience endorse the Republican party in any way. I will look at doing a veteran related benefit concert later this year. And Joe Walsh wasn t alone. Powerpop legends Cheap Trick told the Guardian they were also offered a staggering amount of cash by the GOP to play the convention, but also turned it down as a matter of principle.  They explained: The Republican National Committee called our office and offered us $100,000 to play at their convention in Cleveland [this summer]. We turned it down. Then we had second thoughts. Maybe we should have accepted it   but we would all have got swastika guitars made. At this rate the GOP convention will be rocking it out to Ted Nugent, followed by a Chuck Norris marital arts display. The party is now so toxic, even formerly open conservative performers won t taint themselves by association.Featured image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Says Non-Whites Should Only Be Depicted On Separate But Equal Novelty Money (VIDEO),"Republicans found their new election year wedge issue. Since they lost on Obamacare, marriage equality, and Benghazi, the new rage source they identified is  Harriet Tubman being placed on the $20 bill.This is the new big deal. It s practically an attack on the Constitution itself. Right?It certainly seems to be for Republicans, at least. So many people on the right are exploding over the idea of replacing Jackson on the $20 bill now. However, this isn t new news. This has been planned for a relatively long time. They KNEW this was coming, and there was no outrage   right up until someone who was both non-white and non-male was going to do the replacing.Luckily, Fox News  Greta Van Susteren came up with the perfect response. Her plan is to leave white people s money as it is and make separate money for non-whites. No, that s not a joke. She literally said we should make a new $25 bill so that Jackson could stay in place.Let s do a bit of critical thinking, based on a bit of history. A Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was released by the government a long time ago. EVERYBODY hated it. Not only did it look like a quarter, and people got confused by that, but it was redundant. We already had a $1 bill that everyone was accustomed to. Not every cash register has room for a new bill slot either. Certain types of automated bill changing machines would have to be retrofit for a $25 bill as well.The point is that a whole new denomination of money would be an annoyance and hassle, and the public would not have any patience for it. To put it into context, America has had a $2 bill with Thomas Jefferson on it for a really long time. Do you know ANYONE who uses them? Do you even remember the last time you saw one outside of some novelty situation for collectors?To sum it up, the Republican party thinks that the only place for a woman or a non-white person when it comes to money, is on something that will be marginalized by society   Just like how they ve marginalized women and non-white people for decades! It really makes a lot of sense when you look at it that way. Doesn t it?Watch Greta prove that Fox respects equality by hiring stupid employees of both sexes below: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton Calls For Federal Effort To Restoring Voting Rights To Felons (VIDEO),"While appearing on Good Morning America s  Coffee with the Candidates  town hall, Hillary Clinton, who emerged victorious in a hotly fought over New York, laid out her plan to combat systemic racism in the criminal justice system   which includes giving those who serve time their voting rights back.When asked how she would reform America s broken criminal justice system (which was due in part to the 1994 crime bill), she answered candidly:One, divert people away from the criminal justice system because too many people are in for low-level, non-violent offenses. Secondly, we have got address the unequal effects of the criminal justice system on people of color, particularly African American men because it is just wrong and it is a result of systemic racism   we have to have more second chance opportunities   Once you ve paid your debt to society, your voting rights should be returned immediately.Her last answer drew thunderous applause from the audience, and for good reason.Currently, 12 states do not allow those who have served their time, meaning they are no longer in prison and no longer on parole, to vote. Over 5.85 million Americans, which accounts for 2.5 percent of the voting age population, are currently unable to vote due to a current or previous felony conviction, according to an analysis by the Sentencing Project. Roughly 75 percent of the 5.85 million who are disenfranchised are out of prison and living within their communities.Clinton s call to restore voting rights comes as she and Senator Sanders face off in the Maryland primary election on April 26. Maryland, this year, passed a sweeping voting rights law into effect, granting over 40,000 ex-felons their right to back.Along with automatic voter registration and the restoration of the Voting Rights Act, Clinton s voting plan has a direct impact in dealing with systemic racism in this country.Former Attorney General Eric Holder reminded the public about the link between disenfranchisement and crime, both riddled, latently and blatantly, with racism:It is time to fundamentally reconsider laws that permanently disenfranchise people who are no longer under federal or state supervision. By perpetuating the stigma and isolation imposed on formerly incarcerated individuals, these laws increase the likelihood they will commit future crimes.Now, how many Republicans are talking about this issue?Here s the clip from Clinton s town hall discussion: Once you ve paid your debt to society, your voting rights should be returned immediately.

 Patton Oswalt To Bernie Fans: ‘You’re A F*cking Child’ If You Skip Voting Out Of Hatred For Hillary (TWEET),"Comedian Patton Oswalt has a knack for calling conservatives out on their bullsh*t and coming up with the most perfect responses to their nonsense.In the past, Oswalt has made it perfectly clear that he really, REALLY hates Donald Trump when he dedicated this hilarious poem to the Republican frontrunner on  National Poetry Day.   He s also been one of the more outspoken celebrities when it comes to opposing the GOP s hateful rhetoric (just look what he did when the GOP attacked Planned Parenthood). Now, the comedian is sending a special message to voters, urging them to act in the best interest of America by making sure that none of the Republican party s clowns are able to get into the White House.In an interview with the Huffington Post, Oswalt touched on the 2016 election while promoting his stand-up special Talking for Clapping,which premieres on Netflix on Friday. Although Oswalt has been a supporter of Bernie Sanders, he took the opportunity to clarify that he s not  Bernie or bust.  In fact, he wanted to encourage all of his fellow Bernie supporters to adopt the same attitude, for a very special reason. He said: I will vote for whoever the Democrats nominate against either of those two psychopaths. I think they re both equally dangerous and backward-facing for this country. When he was asked what he d say to a Bernie fan who would rather stay home and not participate in the election than give Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton their vote in the November general election, Oswalt had some harsh words: Well, then you re a fucking child. Well said. This is the same exact attitude Oswalt has taken to his over 2.6 million Twitter followers, urging them to unite for the Democratic party instead of divide.TwitterThe truth of the matter is that America cannot afford to have either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz as our next commander-in-chief, and the stakes are too high for us to lose millions of votes because people are upset their favorite Democrat didn t become the nominee. Every vote for the Democrats   regardless of the candidate   will help keep America safe from the disastrous GOP.

 New Analysis Shows Black Neighborhoods Excluded From Amazon Same Day Delivery,"A Bloomberg analysis of Amazon s same-day delivery service locations shows that Black neighborhoods are routinely excluded from access to the service.Although all customers pay the same $99 fee for the Amazon Prime membership, which includes same-day delivery service in covered areas, Black customers are significantly less likely to have access to that service.According to the Bloomberg study, Black customers who live in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington DC are 50 percent less likely to have access to same-day delivery.Bloomberg further reports:In New York City, same-day delivery is available throughout Manhattan, Staten Island, and Brooklyn, but not in the Bronx and some majority-black neighborhoods in Queens. In some cities, Amazon same-day delivery extends many miles into the surrounding suburbs but isn t available in some ZIP codes within the city limits.Out of all the places where Amazon same-day delivery services are available to Amazon Prime members, the analysis shows the greatest disparity in the city of Boston.According to the Bloomberg analysis: Three ZIP codes encompassing the primarily black neighborhood of Roxbury are excluded from same-day service, while the neighborhoods that surround it on all sides are eligible. In many cases this means that Black customers have no access to same-day delivery, while white customers, living just a few blocks away, do have access.Here s what the delivery zones look like in some of the most populated urban areas.Image credit: Screen capture Bloomberg.comAccording to Amazon vice president for global communications, Craig Berman, the company did not intentionally create a service area which excludes Black neighborhood.Berman says that service areas were determined by data and algorithms.As Tech Insider reports here, Amazon PR Director Scott Stanzel described the criteria the company used to generate the algorithm.According to Stanzel, that included  distance to the nearest fulfillment center, local demand in an area, numbers of Prime members in an area, as well as the ability of our various carrier partners to deliver up to 9:00 pm every single day, even Sunday. So how does a computer program which doesn t include race as a factor, generate a service area that excludes Black neighborhoods?Tech Insider sums it up best, by explaining:Racism, as researchers have documented in countless studies and reports, is the systemic marginalization of minority communities. It s the aggregate of small and large effects that make it harder for people to find housing, accumulate wealth, avoid the criminal justice system, and succeed in school if they aren t white. Data and algorithms selected in deliberate ignorance of racism can pick up and reinforce that systemic problem.So basically the algorithm reflects the racism that is already present in a service area. As described by Tech Insider, it  reflects ongoing economic disparities and segregation between white and black communities created by decades of redlining. That appears to be exactly what happened in the case of Amazon s same-day delivery service area coverage.Amazon says the company has plans to  fill in the gaps  in service coverage  over time. That doesn t seem like a good enough answer when the data shows that many Black customers are being denied equal service under the company s current model.Mistakes can happen, yes, but now that the problems have clearly been exposed, Amazon should take immediate steps to correct them.It s one thing to unknowingly generate an algorithm that excludes Black neighborhoods. It s another thing altogether to look the other way once you re aware of the issue.

 Republicans Just Made A Decision That Probably Means They’ve Given Up On The Election,"Faced with the prospect of campaigning with Donald Trump at the top of the Republican presidential ticket, the Republican National Committee appears ready to do something unprecedented eight months before the first ballot is cast and give up on the election.The Republican National Committee is scaling back its financial commitments to some of the most hotly contested states because of flagging fund-raising, the most concrete evidence yet of how the party s divisive and protracted presidential race is threatening the party s entire ticket in November.Sean Spicer, the RNC s head strategist, admitted to the New York Times that the party was not yet ready to have field organizers in place in key swing states like Florida and Ohio because the money isn t there yet, thanks to the contentious presidential contest.Even stranger, the Republicans are setting up a fund so that the party s wealthiest supporters can direct funds towards Senate and House races, instead of the marquee presidential matchup.Just as revealing, the party is also taking steps to create a separate fund-raising entity dedicated to Senate races, an acknowledgment that many of the wealthiest contributors are increasingly focused on protecting Republican control of Congress rather than on a presidential campaign they fear is lost.It is becoming apparent that those candidates are in trouble, thanks to Trump s series of toxic comments about Latinos, Muslims, blacks, and women. Already high profile Republicans like Senator John McCain have announced that they would not be attending the convention, usually the political destination of record for both parties in election years. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush and the previous Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, both also said they would be skipping the convention as well.Polling shows that Donald Trump is the most disliked person to ever head the ticket of a major party, and in head to head polling he loses by double digits to Hillary Clinton. Trump performs so poorly that traditionally hardcore Republican states like Mississippi and Utah are within striking distance for Clinton. And in states that are part of President Obama s winning coalitions in 2012 and 2008, Trump is way behind.The Republican Establishment has already announced it plans to challenge Trump s bid to be the nominee, but it may already be too late. The election may already be lost.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" If You’re A Domestic Violence Victim In Mississippi, You Can’t Get Divorced","Few states in this country can compete with Mississippi when it comes to enacting legislation which significantly constricts the rights and liberties of women,the LGBT community, minorities, and other marginalized groups.Most recently a state senate bill, 2418,  failed to incorporate domestic violence as a justifiable reason for divorce. The state currently allows only 12 justifiable reasons to legally grant a divorce including impotency, adultery, alcoholism, and incurable mental illness among some of the reasons.According to a 2014 report conducted by the Violence Policy Center, Mississippi ranks 5th in the nation in the rate of women murdered by men. In the United States, a woman is beaten or assaulted every 9 seconds. One in three women have been victims of severe physical violence from an intimate partner as some point in their lifetime. A gun being present during a domestic violence situation, where in Mississippi there is virtually no gun control, increases the likelihood of a homicide by 500 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, domestic violence is the third leading cause of homelessness among families.Setting justifiable reasons to legally grant a divorce is already a ridiculous aspect, but rescinding domestic violence off the list of justifiable reasons gives the abusers in a relationship even more power to abuse and control their victim without any repercussions. Domestic violence is rarely an anomaly, rather it is a behavior pattern of an individual,   to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation, often including the threat or use of violence. Mississippi has caught a lot of negative publicity recently, in addition to North Carolina and other southern states, which have either passed or attempted to pass discriminatory laws against the LGBT community. Mississippi s GOP is disgraceful and they seem bent on trying to get away with passing as many unconstitutional laws as possible.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 What Trump Just Said About Transgender People Will Make Republicans FURIOUS (VIDEO),"Donald Trump delivered a major  f*ck you  to his fellow conservatives when he spoke out against North Carolina s controversial and transphobic  bathroom bill  and said he would be perfectly fine with transgender people using whatever bathroom they wanted to.Trump made these surprising comments during Thursday s NBC Today town hall as host Willie Geist asked the Republican frontrunner questions from Twitter users. Geist asked Trump,  Mr. Trump, please be specific. Tell us your views on LGBT, how you plan to be inclusive as president. Speak about North Carolina bathroom law in particular. Inclusivity is something Trump has completely strayed away from during his campaign, and he s managed to successfully insult and exclude nearly every minority possible. But this time, Trump s answer surprised everyone. Stating that North Carolina s bathroom law had caused   a lot of problems,  he said: North Carolina did something that was very strong, and they are paying a big price and there s a lot of problems. North Carolina, what they are going through with all of the business that s leaving and the strife   and that s on both sides. Leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate, there has been so little trouble. This is one of the VERY few times that Trump is mostly right. There have not only been  few complaints    there have actually been ZERO instances of sexual assaults or other issues when transgender individuals were allowed to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. Still, that was one of the main arguments that North Carolina Republicans were using to get this bathroom bill passed.When Geist asked Trump if he had employed transgender individuals at his company, Trump replied that he wasn t certain, but he  probably  had transgender people working for him. Geist pressed him further:  So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom, you d be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses? And Trump stuck it to the GOP one last time:  That is correct.  Also speaking against the creation of new bathrooms specifically for transgender people, Trump said it would be too expensive, and that  I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. You can watch the interview below:Trump has previously held more liberal views than conservative, and he loves to stir up controversy whenever he can.

 Not-At-All-Racist Sheriff Amazingly Compares The NAACP To The KKK,"In a display of Olympic-level mental gymnastics, a South Carolina Sheriff said, and actually meant, that the NAACP is pretty much just like the KKK. His reasoning? They promote and support African Americans.During the talk, Wright addressed several topics. The sheriff, who is known for being outspoken, said, among other things,  I think the most racist people in America right now sometimes are minorities, small group minorities. I ve got a chaplain who works for me. He s an African-American, he is my brother and I love him more than anything.. He doesn t buy into that mess. A bunch of his friends don t either. They don t do the NAACP because  I feel like that is a racist group as well as the KKK. I don t care about them either. I don t want to be a part of no group that s got something to do just because of your color. I don t think they re right.In case you missed it, yes, he played the  I have a black friend  card.There s an argument to be made that black people can t be  racists  because they re not in positions of power to systematically oppress white people. But semantics aside, Sheriff Redneck is right that SOME black people don t like white people. In fact, they re downright bigoted! I suppose that if I were black and white people constantly treated me like a criminal or mentally inferior, I might start to resent the hell out of white people. Maybe I d even learn to hate them. This doesn t excuse bigotry but it puts it into perspective.On the other hand, the KKK hates black people just for being black. It s a not subtle difference. Bigoted black people are, by and large, responding to how they re treated. The KKK thinks blacks are innately inferior, if not, in fact, sub-human.But even putting aside of all that, the NAACP exists to help the black community stand on equal footing with white people. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It s right there in the name. Black people have been systemically kept from getting the same educational and economic opportunities as white people. The law treats them differently on every level and always for the worse. Our popular media has spent decades (centuries?) depicting black people as lazy, criminally inclined and stupid. So, yes, Sheriff Good Ol  Boy, the NAACP has got to do with skin color because America keeps treating that skin color poorly.Meanwhile, the KKK exists to maintain white supremacy, using violence and terrorism to keep the black community from freeing itself from the legacy of American slavery. But, you know, that s just like what the NAACP does because Sheriff Inbred s  black friend  told him so.And just to top it all off? Sheriff Boss Hog feels persecuted (because of course he does): This is a political bashing, that s all it is, to try to stir up controversy to draw some attention,  Wright said.Yes, why would anyone want to draw attention to the fact that the sheriff thinks black people are just as racist as the KKK?

 Music Legend And American Icon Prince Dies At 57 (VIDEO),"Music legend and American icon Prince has died at his compound in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Authorities say they responded to a medical call at 9.43 AM this morning and found the body of the 57 year-old singer. The cause of death is not yet clear and an investigation is under way.Prince, whose birth name is Prince Roger Nelson, was hospitalized on Friday after his jet flew from Atlanta and made an emergency landing in Moline, Iowa after suffering from what appeared to be flu like symptoms.Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 7, 1958, the gifted artist s work spanned five decades in what would become one of the most successful music careers in American history. Drawing influence from pop, R&B, soul, disco and jazz, Prince left an invaluable mark on current and future artists with his stage presence and flamboyant style.Hits like Wanna Be Your Lover and albums such as 1999 and Purple Rain cemented the artist s status as both a musical genius and an American cultural icon. Prince also left his mark on the music world with his prolific writing, working with countless of talented artists and launching the careers of others.Prince will be missed by generations of Americans who grew up listening to the artist or have been recently introduced to him in a sign of the musician s ability to attract people from different generations and all walks of life.Rest in Peace, Prince.Watch video here:   [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu-uQwLODkw]Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch As The Right Changes History Before Your Very Eyes On Tubman And Jackson (SCREENSHOTS),"The announcement that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill came as little surprise to most, who celebrated progress with a show of support for a truly amazing woman. If you live in the insane, historically inaccurate world of the modern right, you heard a different story altogether; one of the evils of the  Democrat Party  and how their founder tried to stop the gun-toting, Republican abolitionist, Harriet Tubman.Yes, that really is the lie they re spinning. It seems that in most cases of Republicans losing someone they fiercely admired they tend to go back to the time of Lincoln when the men were men and Northerners were Republicans. It really is that easy to understand, yet conservatives just don t get it. In the time leading up to the Civil War, northern progressives like Abraham Lincoln were in the process of forming a very different Republican party than the one we know today. The Southerners fought, seceded, lost, spent a good deal of time living with their humiliation and moved on, content to stick together as Democrats.And that doesn t seem strange to these people? It doesn t seem odd that the Republicans who abolished slavery, wrote the 13th and 14th Amendments and stood side by side with women until they could vote were predominately Northern progressive liberals? Andrew Jackson was the president who saw the beginning of the Democratic party and he was a slave owner from the South. That doesn t seem a little odd?We re talking about Harriet Tubman here. The woman was armed because she lived in fear for her life and for the lives of those she helped. She didn t belong to a political party, since as a black woman during slavery she wouldn t have been able to vote for several reasons. To call her a champion of the Republican party would be like trying to claim that Lincoln himself would be a proud card-carrying member today. Yeah, I know they claim that all the time.You can read the ridiculous claim, which is basically a 2 paragraph propaganda piece circulating among such reputable publications as Alan B West s Site. Fox News hasn t picked it up yet, but the comments on one of their local affiliates who reported the story say it all:That s just the tip of the iceberg. People sure do love to make things up online:How about some conspiracy? The president naturally spends much of his day thinking of ways to screw over Americans, that s how much he hates us:And good golly the cost. New 20s that were going to be printed need to be printed. Maybe we should add that to a conversation about how little the average Republican knows about the budget.Numerous people have also been to the thread to let them know that the Republican party officially became the party of southern regressive morons the day Strom Thurmond jumped ship and joined. Your first political move? Defraud and disenfranchise as many voters as possible across the South running on what we now know as the  Southern Dixiecrat strategy. Then, as Republicans, you shot down the ERA, tried in vain to kill the Civil Rights Movement, created the Moral Majority, The Tea Party and The Freedom Caucus and stocked them with religious zealots just to brighten our day. You re also responsible for the rise of Donald Trump.The bottom line? You don t get to claim Harriet Tubman as one of yours and you certainly don t get to stick us with Andrew Jackson. As a Northern progressive, my great, great, great-grandfather lived on the happy end of the underground railroad, no matter who he voted for in 1862.

 Viral Video Of ‘Liberal Redneck’ Hilariously DESTROYING Transgender Bathroom Laws Is MUST SEE,"There s stupid, and then there are those who write laws based off their ignorance and stupidity. It d be nice if people could just keep their stupid to themselves, but alas, we have jerks writing laws to ban transgender men and women from using the bathroom.Calling out this stupid in the most real and raw way ever is Trae Crowder, who has dubbed himself in a very viral video  The Liberal Redneck.  He absolutely decimated the ignorance surrounding the law in a magical one minute and forty-five seconds.After describing some of the lame arguments given why the law is needed to  protect kids,  Crowder says: These are the same motherf*ckers that put Mountain Dew in sippy cups and beat a six-year-old with a wire hanger for standing in front of the TV during Dr. Oz. Adding: What do you think is gonna happen? You do know that transgender people have existed forever, right? What bathrooms you think they been using? Then, after saying that the majority of sex offenders are actually grown men, Crowder throws out this zinger: Unless you re also suggesting we have separate bathrooms for Catholic priests, I think you need to cut the shit. Then brilliantly, Crowder gets to the heart of it, and that s just that those writing the laws, or those who want the laws, simply just don t like the idea of transgender individuals. He said: Because like most things that disgust you, you lack the capacity to understand it. You know, h*mos, algebra   sh*t like that. He closes by saying that whether these bigots like it or not, people like himself and those who actually have the capacity to embrace those different from ourselves, are going to ensure the world is a better, more accepting place for generations to come.Well done, Crowder, you got to the heart of it, called it out, and said it like it is.Watch the video here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Crazy Alabama Republican Demonstrates Why Religion Doesn’t Belong In Government,"This why the Founding Fathers wanted separation of church and state.Ever since conservative  Christians  pushed Congress and President Truman to pass a law establishing a National Day of Prayer in 1952, Christian fundamentalists have made every effort to force their religious beliefs down the throats of every American.Despite a ruling by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2011, which says the National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional because the Constitution bars Congress from making any law that respects an establishment of religion, the National Day of Prayer persists. It s a religious exercise that serves no purpose in our secular government, and it alienates people who are non-religious and people who do not worship the Christian deity.It also forces the President to sign a proclamation every year declaring the observation of the day, which means an atheist president would be forced to recognize religion every year in direct violation of the First Amendment.Republicans have been particularly crazy about inserting religion into government, and an Alabama Republican wrote a disturbing resolution this year that demonstrates precisely why we need separation of church and state.GOP state Rep. Mack Butler wrote up a National Day of Prayer resolution that demands America turn into a Christian nation that bans abortion and returns to  traditional values,  which one assumes includes banning same-sex marriage and outlawing contraception as well as forcing non-Christian citizens to convert against their will. He even goes so far as to call the citizens of Alabama  wicked  and called upon them to pray to prevent God from punishing them and the country.Here s the full text of HJR 316.WHEREAS, God has blessed America, where freedom exists for all, regardless of belief or creed; and WHEREAS, America s heritage is a beacon to the world, a shining city on a hill; and WHEREAS, America s exceptionalism was not only on a thoroughfare for freedom beat, but a leader and protector of values and safety around the world; and WHEREAS, though American s sovereignty did not and would not rule the world, rather than a colonial power, she shared her bounty; and WHEREAS, America has turned from her values, she is engaged in practices antithetical to her heritage by not protecting the poor, defenseless, and unborn, and has permitted the law to discriminate pitting one s rights against the rights of others; and WHEREAS, America now sits in her sanctuary while the rest of the world is falling into turmoil with genocide against Christians and radical Islamic terrorists wreaking havoc; and WHEREAS, America s Judeo-Christian tradition recognized a freedom of religion, the first freedom, that let all religions coexist; and WHEREAS, traditional values have been removed from the public square where all values were once spoken; and WHEREAS, religious freedom is threatened and God is mocked; and WHEREAS, just as Jesus observed when he drew close to Jerusalem before His crucifixion and wept over the city that thought it knew of the things made for peace, it was now hidden from their eyes and just as high government officials often invoke the name of God, yet they tempt God by abandoning His truths; and WHEREAS, America must reaffirm her freedom and her faith; and BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA, BOTH HOUSES THEREOF CONCURRING, That we urge America to reaffirm and protect its freedoms. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the fifth day of May 24 2016 be set aside as a day of reflection by the citizens of the State of Alabama who will humble themselves and pray and seek God s face and turn from their wicked ways so that God will hear from Heaven and will forgive their sins and heal their land.America faces many problems including the threat of terrorism, climate change, income inequality, and being overtaken by the rest of the world when it comes to education, just to name a few. Alabama faces serious budget issues as well as healthcare and education issues. Yet all conservatives want to do about it is pray rather than construct and pass legislation that solves the problems. They literally believe that believing in God is all we need to do and all of our problems will magically be solved. This is counter to the hopes of the Founding Fathers that our government would lead by the use of reason. If we want to solve the problems our country faces, the first thing that needs to happen is to kick religion out of government once and for all. We need lawmakers, not preachers. Then we can get to work dealing with our problems constructively instead of pretending that some invisible deity will come to our rescue. When a religion is good, I conceive it will support itself; and when it does not support itself, and God does not take care to support it so that its professors are obligated to call for help of the civil power, it s a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.  ~Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, letter to Richard Price, October 9, 1780 Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Palin Stands With Disgraced ESPN Analyst Curt Schilling By Bashing Trans People In His Honor (IMAGE),"Like clockwork, the dregs of the conservative movement crawled out of their holes (and Twitchy comment sections) to stand with disgraced, now-former ESPN analyst Curt Schilling. His principal defender: Sarah Palin, a woman with enough hate in her heart to spread it around generously and with absolutely no job she could risk losing by doing so.The one-time baseball great had finally struck out with ESPN after posting (yet another) ugly hate-filled Facebook rant to his followers. Having been repeatedly warned by the network that his unabashed bigotry was out of line and needed to be curtailed if he wanted to continue to be a public figure, Schilling decided it would be a great time to begin bullying transgender people. On his page, he shared a conservative meme that depicts a man dressed as a woman with a caption reading: LET HIM IN! To the restroom with your daughter or else you re a narrow minded, judgmental, unloving, racist bigot who needs to die!!! After the initial blowback, Schilling created a blog post defending his belief that trans people are using public restrooms to prey on little girls (a  pants on fire  level lie) in a rant that had people seriously concerned for his mental well-being.You frauds out there ranting and screaming about my  opinions  (even if it isn t) and comments are screaming for  tolerance  and  acceptance  while you refuse to do and be either.YOU RE the ones making it the issue. I don t care, if you ask me about any of the topics it s likely (much to the chagrin of many) I ll answer with my opinion.Sarah Palin was appalled that Schilling had been canned from ESPN for his bigotry, so she decided to do something: Post an equally offensive meme bullying the trans community in  solidarity  with his. (Bonus points if you noticed the meme somehow managed to blame President Obama!)https://www.facebook.com/sarahpalin/posts/10154153457003588:0And thus we get a glimpse into the mindset of Sarah Palin. The  real  victim, in her view, is the hapless conservative who isn t allowed to spread vicious lies about a vulnerable group and still be allowed to have a job as the face of a major television network. To  support  her fellow conservative, Palin lashes out at the LGBT community   who, it should be noted, were not responsible for Schilling s pink slip.What s the word for this? Dangerous? Pathetic? Idiotic? How about  cowardly ?Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" President Of Planned Parenthood Compared To ISIS, The Mob And Drug Dealers","Because the rabidly insane American right wing is no stranger to hyperbole and nonsense comparisons, Fr. Frank Pavone, an anti-choice fanatic, has compared Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood to terrorists, mobsters and drug lords. Why? Because she was invited to speak at Georgetown University by some of the students and letting Planned Parenthood speak is just plain crazy!While on an AM Hate Radio show, Pavone let loose with this gem:He said he didn t buy the argument that inviting someone like Richards to speak was allowing  inquiry into all different positions. I mean, do we inquire, do we try to understand terrorism by inviting representatives of ISIS to come and speak?  he asked.  Or let s get some of the biggest drug dealers in the country to come and talk about their business because, after all, we have to understand both sides of the issue of drug abuse. Why don t we invite the biggest mobsters to come in because we have to understand both sides of the debate about organized crime? Are they doing that? Maybe I m missing it, but do these universities invite these kinds of people too? What Pavone is actually saying is that the only side we should be listening to is the one that says a fertilized egg is a person and that Baby Jesus cries whenever a hell-bound baby killer abortion doctor performs an abortion. Also, that abortion is the moral equivalent of terrorism. That would be a perfectly reasonable argument to make except for the fact that it s pure bullshit.The burning desire for conservative Christians to impose their religious doctrine on the entire country is never more clear than in the abortion  debate.  I say  debate  because there really isn t one. The  pro-life  movement is all about control and, for the most part, completely unconcerned with what happens to the  precious life  they re willing to murder to defend. The pro-choice movement, on the other hand, is perfectly fine with common sense restrictions placed on late-term abortions, a fact that theocratic monsters refuse to acknowledge.Normally, what Pavone said would be just the ravings of a madman, but these are not normal times. The right has whipped up such a storm of hate and rage against Planned Parenthood that violence is both inevitable and ongoing. This kind of rhetoric only increases the chances that someone will declare themselves a  Soldier of God  and lash out. Shootings, arson, death threats and all other manner of terrorism have been a common occurance in a country that s supposedly at  War  with terrorism. But I guess as long as the terrorism is white and Christian, it s acceptable.

" Republicans Did This, And Now Britain Is Warning Its Citizens To Avoid America","Once again, states run by conservative Republicans have provoked international embarrassment for America. This time, it is because our British allies now have to warn their LGBT citizens about traveling to southern states that recently passed anti-LGBT laws.Britain has issued a new warning for LGBT travelers visiting parts of the United States: Be wary.In an update to its U.S. travel advisory, the British Foreign Office highlighted the anti-gay laws recently passed in North Carolina and Mississippi. The U.S. is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country,  the advisory stated.  LGBT travelers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi. Before traveling please read our general travel advice for the LGBT community. North Carolina and Missippi have lost revenue due to businesses (Paypal, Pepsi and many others) canceling plans to open facilities there and musicians like Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam deciding to cancel concert dates in those states   all because a minority of anti-LGBT bigots have decided to pass laws based on the myth of transgender bathroom predators.The so-called bathroom bills are laws correcting a problem that doesn t actually exist, in order to make conservative politicians look good to their base by attacking a group of Americans. It is what the right has devolved to and is part of their desperate attempts to keep so-called  values voters  perpetually on the edge and consistently voting for conservative Republican political candidates.In response to the British Foreign Office, the Human Rights campaign issued a statement noting,  It is both frightening and embarrassing that one of our nation s staunchest allies has warned its citizens of the risks of traveling to North Carolina and Mississippi because of anti-LGBT laws passed by their elected officials. It s even more bizarre that the supposedly pro-business right would push these laws, since the states who pass them will suffer economically. Being bigoted like this in 2016 is bad for business.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Colbert Hilariously Humiliates Ted Cruz For Losing New York By A Landslide (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz paid dearly for insulting  New York values  on Tuesday night, and Stephen Colbert couldn t resist rubbing the loss in Cruz s smug face.During the Late Show on Wednesday night, the audience applauded after Colbert told Cruz to  Suck it. The clearest message coming out of New York last night was: Suck it, Ted Cruz,  Colbert quipped.  Suck our New York values! Indeed, Ted Cruz had hoped to win New York even though he had been trashing the state throughout his campaign for not having the same values as him.And New York voters delivered a crushing defeat to the Texas Senator by voting overwhelmingly for Donald Trump.In fact, New York hated Cruz so much that Ben Carson received more votes than he did even though he hasn t been in the race for a month, a fact that Colbert found amusing. And in one county he even lost to Ben Carson, who dropped out of the race a month ago,  Colbert reported.  Though, to be fair, Dr. Carson may not be aware that he dropped out of the race. But even though Cruz was beaten like a speed bag in a loose suit, at the end of the night Ted Cruz managed to keep it positive, and also kind of creepy,  Colbert continued before playing a clip of Cruz talking about  America lying down with her back on the mat  during his concession speech.Colbert smiled and chuckled and then interpreted Cruz s words. That is when America is at her best, lying down with her back on the mat, lights on and with a firm handshake and then back to your separate beds for some quiet weeping. If you know what I mean. Here s the video via YouTube.If Ted Cruz learned anything from his loss on Tuesday, it s that you should avoid insulting an entire state when you are trailing your opponent in a race you desperately want to win, especially if your opponent is a native of the state you are insulting.Cruz had hoped that New Yorkers would forget all about what he said about them and vote for him anyway. He was wrong.

 Elizabeth Warren Just Ripped The S.E.C. Apart For Allowing A Criminal Back On Wall Street,"Senator Elizabeth Warren is pissed and she is letting the Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) know it in no uncertain terms.Her anger stems from S.E.C. regulators  (I use that term loosely) decision to allow billionaire Steve Cohen to form a new hedge fund firm even though he is not supposed to have anything to do with the industry for two years. The Wall Street mogul was punished after he failed to properly supervise one of his employees who is now in federal prison for insider trading. Cohen s firm pleaded guilty to securities fraud and paid a $1.8 billion fine.Cohen managed to escape criminal charges (SHOCKING!) by agreeing to return all of the firm s outside money, renaming it Point72 Capital and signing an agreement vowing not to manage anyone s money or employees who are managing other people s money until 2018.Unfortunately, the agreement did not prevent him from owning a firm that profits off of other people. So, he waited a mere months before forming a new firm, Stamford Harbor Capital, to do just that. This enraged Senator Warren and she sent a letter to the S.E.C. on Thursday morning ripping them apart for allowing Cohen s new firm to register with them. The Senator said that in doing so they are allowing the firm to make  a mockery of the S.E.C. s core mission to  protect investors : The Commission has permitted a recidivist hedge fund manager, well-known for his former company s willingness to evade and ignore federal law, to once again profit from and potentially exploit investors. This is an unacceptable outcome from the nation s primary enforcer of securities laws the latest example of an S.E.C. action that fails to appropriately punish guilty parties, deter future wrongdoing, and protect investors. It is absolutely infuriating that the S.E.C., who is supposed to be protecting us from predators on Wall Street, has allowed this criminal to open another firm. Make no mistake, just because he wasn t charged doesn t make him any less of a criminal. For far too long hedge-fund managers have been allowed to get away with robbing the rest of us blind. Cohen just spit on the S.E.C. and they are standing by and taking it.So, in other words, it is business as usual on Wall Street.

 Colbert’s Rundown Of The ‘Harriet Tubman On The 20’ News is Gonna Piss Off Some Righties (VIDEO),"Stephen Colbert hit the nail right on the head and surely touched on some conservative nerves when he did a little ditty on the US Treasury s announcement they d be putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. Colbert starts by pointing out that to do that you first have to remove  Indian stabber ummm Native American stabber  Andrew Jackson.Jackson, who was considered a  kind  slave owner because he gave the nearly 300 human beings he kept shackled and owned a place to sleep and food and allowed the women to have children. The last one is a no-brainer if you own people   babies are just free slaves. Jackson s rise to the presidency was also the beginning of the Democratic party that opposed Lincoln and ultimately seceded from the union.Colbert does quite a bit of poking fun at the founding slave owners, because, well they owned people. Jackson, in particular, was all about preserving the 3/5ths of a person slaves were counted as for census, which gave the South s big plantation enormous blocks of voting power within their state. And just how will Tubman feel being carried around next to the likes of Washington and Jefferson?Colbert also brought up the gender pay gap, noting that the $20 bill with a woman on it will now only be worth $17. Yet another dig at the conservatives who are at this moment trying to put out fires in racist back country congressional districts where they don t like to be left out of the decision-making process for such important things as denying African-Americans and their heritage any role in American history. Remember, these are the same people who oppose black history month, because why should  they  get their own month when whites only have the other 11?Racism, plain and simple, will be the thing people will remember most about Tubman s debut on the $20 bill. Sad but true.Featured image via screen capture",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ESPN Just Fired Curt Schilling For This Despicable Facebook Post (IMAGE),"ESPN just made an amazing stand against bigotry on the airwaves, by firing one of it s top name hosts for being anti-transgender. Curt Schilling just got handed his pink slip.Schilling has worked for the network since 2010 and is one of baseball s best-known commentators and analysts. But recently, Schilling decided to share a Facebook post in support of an antitransgender bill passed in North Carolina.The post insisted of an image, featuring a man in a wig, his T-shirt cut to expose breasts, and a bizarre black outfit of women s clothing. The image was accompanied by text which read: LET HIM IN! to the restroom with your daughter or else you re a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die. Former player Schilling then added: A man is a man no matter what they call themselves. I don t care what they are, who they sleep with, men s room was designed for the penis, women s not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic. ESPN later issued a statement claiming Schilling s  unacceptable conduct  violated their policy of inclusiveness: ESPN is an inclusive company. Curt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated. Of course, for those in conservative circles, this was another attack of political correctness which prejudices conservatives from exercising their rights of free speech. According to David Hookstead at The Daily Caller, Schilling s firing was part of some exodus of conservative media pundits:The former Red Sox pitcher has been very open about his conservative views in the past. He was previously suspended by ESPN for comparing ISIS to the Nazis.ESPN might have no problem getting rid of conservative pundits, but the network has tolerated extreme liberal positions in the past without firing anybody. ESPN employee Tony Kornheiser compared the Tea Party to ISIS and insinuated the Tea Party was attempting to  establish a caliphate. Kornheiser is still cashing pay checks from ESPN.What Hookstead leaves out is that the Tea Party is a billionaire-backed political movement with the express goal of creating a theocracy in the United States   that is federal and state law based on biblical law. On top of this, the vast majority of domestic terrorism in the US comes from white supremacists and Christian zealots. These groups have murdered LGBT people for being gay who have lynched non-whites and non-Christians. It is entirely comparable.However, using a caricature of a cross-dresser to invoke fear about transgender people using the gender identity appropriate bathroom is plain bigotry. One could just as readily argue the opposite, as transmen did en masse with the hashtag Using the hashtag #WeJustNeedToPee. Bearded transmen posted pictures of themselves in the women s bathroom, next to women entering cubicles and doing their makeup.Michael Hughes, from Minnesota, posted the picture below, asking:  Do I look like I belong in a women s bathroom?Under the North Carolina law, Michael would be legally-compelled to use the women s bathrooms   despite the fact that he would clearly cause some degree of confusion and worry by doing so.Surely the long term answer is to remove the gender apartheid from toilets altogether? Plenty of countries around the world do just fine using mixed bathrooms. Why not us?

 This New Game Gives You A Taste Of Life Under President Trump (IMAGES),"For those itching for a taste of life in America under President Donald Trump   a new mobile game provides just that and it s creepy as hell.The new game  available on Apple App Store and Google Play  is called  Great Wall of America   The Donald Trump Edition.  As you might expect, the game is all abut getting that border wall with Mexico built, and keeping immigrants out of America s southern border.Like a cross between an episode of The Apprentice and Tenko, players have to deploy advanced management skills to achieve one simple goal: to BUILD THAT WALL!There is, of course, one additionally f*cked up element to this game. Rather than building the wall with the standard bricks and mortar   in the game, the wall is made up of cuboid versions of Donald trump s opponents. I sh*t you not. Let s take a look at them shall we?The game s creator Michael Kryski is apparently trying to make American mobile gaming great again. Maybe he can follow up with Whack-a-Mexican? The role player game, modeled on the famous whack-a-mole, allows gamers to play the part of a border guard tasked with enforcing Trump s dream of a Mexican-free America. Each time a Mexican attempts to burrow under the border wall, the guard smacks them back down into their tunnels with a giant mallet. This could extend to a Muslim edition.No doubt, this in development somewhere in the world.Kryski notes on his website, the very best part of the game is that it s totally free. Apparently, Mexico is paying for the whole thing.Featured Image via Great Wall of America ",News,"April 21, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Israelis Throw ‘Death To Arabs’ Rally, Thousands Attend (VIDEO/TWEETS)","The state of Israel has been able to cover up its racism to the world quite effectively over the years through the use of propaganda and a pretense to peace with the Palestinians. Some apologists for today s crazy right-wing government even argue that if only the current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, would be replaced by a  dove,  then peace could be achieved with the Palestinians. However, the lack of peace and the fascism in Israel today is not rooted in its prime minister; rather, it is rooted in the ideology of Zionism that drives him and most Israelis. Zionists believe in an exclusively Jewish state and they always have. The only difference these days is that under the current right wing government, psychotic Israelis are the official main-stream of society and they burn babies and execute Palestinians without hesitation and they know that the government will protect them.This was all on display in Tel Aviv as thousands of Israelis came out in solidarity for the Israeli soldier who executed a Palestinian lying incapacitated on the ground a month ago. The soldier, Elor Azarya, who was filmed shooting the Palestinian last month in the occupied Palestinian town Al-Khalil (Hebron), is facing manslaughter charges. However, Israelis who injure or murder Palestinians rarely face consequences.Watch video of soldier executing Palestinian here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Bl9zAM5A4]Thousands of Israelis rally in support of soldier who executed wounded Palestinian https://t.co/EagsGN9gem by @RobertMackey  The Intercept (@theintercept) April 20, 2016Protestors chanted and held signs reading  Kill Them All.

 Ted Cruz Pulls The Last Trick From His Hat And Trump’s Ego May Not Be Able To Resist,"The tried and true Donald Trump supporter doesn t care what the fuhrer does as long as he keeps saying catch phrase like  we re gonna make America great again  and  we re gonna build a wall.  As long as they can feel superior to Mexicans, Muslims and anyone with an education as they join in beating them up for wearing an offensive shirt that claims science is real to a Trump rally. No matter how much of a bump he gets afterwards and no matter how many times he declares himself victorious, the one thing Ted Cruz has on the Donald are his debating skills.Cruz isn t exactly a master. His shrill voice and the condescending look he gets on his face are enough for almost anyone to be willing to risk a night in jail for hauling off and punching him. At the end of the GOP debates, however, Cruz always got himself a nice little push in the polls. It s amazing that the smartest guy in the Republican room ended up being the least likeable guy in Washington. To call Ted Cruz smart in any other context is an insult to smart people.Cruz s big plan, then, is to challenge Donald Trump to another debate. He doesn t seem to be getting the memos. Trump is the only candidate with a mathematical chance of a secure nomination. He s polling high in every major contest left. His worst case scenario seems to be if the RNC screws him from his nomination with a contested convention, in which case the Republican party implodes anyway. The whole thing really has been glorious to watch.The one thing Cruz has going for him is The Donald s over-inflated ego. It may not allow Trump to simply back down from a senseless debate that can serve no purpose to Trump other than the loss of even more supporters. It s a noble move on Cruz s part; bold even to suggest another debate this late in the game. Unfortunately for him, his opponent has already kicked his political teeth down his throat and stands to gain nothing by accepting.That, of course, won t stop Ted Cruz from trying, so hopefully there are a few days of good Twitter name calling. That s far more interesting to cover than anything the GOP buffoons are still yammering about.Featured image via Joe Raidle/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Al Franken Hilariously Roasts Ted Cruz During Variety Show Appearance (VIDEO),"Al Franken returned to his comedic roots last Friday and his target was none other than Republican presidential wannabe Ted Cruz.The Minnesota Democratic Senator made an appearance at MinnRoast, an annual variety show, where he used the funnyman skills he honed as a cast member of Saturday Night Live to roast the Texas Senator.On this very welcome special performance, Franken revealed who Cruz s parents really are. Republicans are in kind of a bind since their best hope for stopping Donald Trump is a guy who s the lovechild of Joe McCarthy and Dracula,  Franken quipped.Indeed, Ted Cruz bears a striking resemblance to McCarthy, who led the persecution of suspected communists during the Red Scare in the 1950s, sort of like how Cruz leads the effort to persecute non-Christians and gay people in the present day. Franken was even dead-on with the Dracula comparison. Just take a look at Grandpa Munster as played by Al Lewis on The Munsters TV show and you ll see why.Franken wasn t finished, however. He also took a swing at Cruz s personality and his effort to use it to charm voters into foolishly supporting him. Cruz can be really hard to get along with, but I understand that in a couple weeks he s planning to launch a charm offensive,  Franken began.  He s having a little trouble with the charm part but he s got the offensive part down cold. Then Franken capped off his brief appearance with a jab at House Speaker Paul Ryan about how much Republicans are begging him to run for president so they don t have to watch Donald Trump sink the party in November.Here s the video via YouTube:Franken has rarely used his comedic prowess since becoming a Senator in 2009, and this performance makes us wish he would use it more often, even on the Senate floor. Because just about every Republican deserves to be mercilessly roasted for how they have turned the Senate into an embarrassing joke over the last eight years.Featured image: Screenshot",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Threatens Voters: ‘Every Vote For Donald Trump Is A Vote For Hillary Clinton’ (AUDIO),"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz must really be getting nervous about his chances of snatching the GOP nomination from front runner Donald Trump   because he s warning conservative voters that if they don t switch over to team Cruz, they re basically handing the election to Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton.Cruz made these comments during a radio interview on WPHT-AM Wednesday. In speaking to host Chris Stigall, Cruz suggested that if voters were going to be stupid enough to nominate Trump to run against Clinton, they  might as well  just hand her the White House on a silver platter. Cruz said: We have got to win and if Donald Trump is the nominee, it elects Hillary Clinton. Every vote for Donald Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton. You might as well put a Hillary sticker on your car because Hillary wins by double-digits against Donald Trump. Cruz is absolutely right about one thing   and that s the fact that Clinton would sweep the debate floor with Trump, and right now she s destroying him in the polls. There is no way the disgraced candidate and business mogul would even stand a chance against her. But then Cruz begins to add some good old conservative wishful thinking to his rant, and reveals that HE is a good enough candidate to beat the former Secretary of State (even though he s currently losing to Trump). Cruz said: I beat Hillary in the election and that s why Republicans are coming together and are uniting behind a positive, optimistic, conservative message to bring back jobs and economic growth, to defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights and to keep America safe and defeat radical Islamic terrorists. Of course the Republican party is uniting under Cruz   they know how dangerous Trump is for the GOP and will do anything to stop him at this point. But unfortunately, they still haven t come to terms with the fact that the Democrats are going to have this election whether they like it or not. At this point, conservatives are desperate and they re grasping at straws.You can listen to Cruz s threats in the interview below:Both Trump and Cruz are no match for Clinton or Sanders, and they ve spent most of this campaign cycle making each other look like fools. They only have themselves to blame, and the GOP will have earned this loss.

 Obama Oversees Record Stock Market Results Despite Years Of Republican Obstruction And Lies,"For more than seven years now the right-wing loons have been calling for President Obama and his failed economic policies to give up and go back to Kenya, which if you listen to bumper stickers on pickemup trucks, a village is  missing its idiot.  No matter how many times he succeeds, no matter what sort of good deeds he has done, will the bigots of the right to ever see past the color of his skin.Seven years ago, our economy lay in waste. The banks had failed and the insurance companies that insure insurance companies began preparing us for the worst. Credit came to a halt. Home sales plummeted, the construction and service industries disappeared, the working class lost their jobs and the economy went into a tailspin. All the while your house decreased in value to half of the mortgage balance overnight. From there to today, which marked the second highest day of trading in seven years.Reuters reports that Wall Street is celebrating a close second only to the peak last May, which was a mere 2 percent higher. The S&P 500 has been driven up 15 percent as oil prices stabilize and quarterly reports pour in showing profits in almost all sectors. With home resales rising and the Dow closing at over 18,000, President Obama may have just presided over the worst example of  socialism  of all time. It would be overly optimistic to assume it s clear sailing from here,  said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta.  The good news has to keep on coming for this market to keep moving higher. Still tonight on the Trump, Cruz and Kasich trails, the rhetoric of rampant losses in the economy and jobs dwindling away to nothing. Trump will call the last 7 years  terrible,  when he knows how close we came to a depression. Cruz will say we have to reverse everything and take away the health care of millions of people. Kasich, well Kasich doesn t want Trump to get the delegates he needs to win. The truth is, no matter what, no Republican will ever give President Obama the respect he deserves for running an administration so obstructed by an entire party with dignity and an effectiveness they ll never forget.Featured image by Bloomberg/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Target Becomes America’s First Retailer To Allow Transgender People To Use The Bathroom Of Their Choice,"Screw Walmart (which is America s largest gun retailer), Target is busting down social barriers and spreading tolerance and acceptance nationwide!Target Corp. is now America s first retailer to allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice, a stark rebuttal of the discriminatory and hateful laws that were pushed in North Carolina and Mississippi. Not only will the choice apply to their customers, but to employees as well.On their website, the retailer posted a statement titled  Continuing to Stand for Inclusivity, and stood firm with the LGBT community, writing:Inclusivity is a core belief at Target. It s something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day.We believe that everyone every team member, every guest, and every community deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.More specifically, Target states that it will  welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity,  and will not cow tow to the  impact to our business,  thus putting people over profit.Look at that, a corporation that actually respects the dignities of every customer and every employee. While Republicans continue to be beholden to corporate entities, maybe they could learn a thing or two about what s good for business   and discrimination is never good for business.Target s statement closes with a final reassurance for all those who shop or seek employment:Everyone deserves to feel like they belong. And you ll always be accepted, respected and welcomed at Target.While the comment section of the post received mostly negative backlash from people vowing to never shop there again, Target has not wavered in their support for LGBT rights. Again, Republicans could learn something, but chances are they will continue to put profit over people, or their own necks before doing what s right.So until then, let s continue to shop at Target and show our support!

 Washed Up Crazy Singer Accuses Saturday Night Live Of Worshipping Satan,"Right-ing paranoid whackjob Pat Boone has declared SNL is now venerating Satan, because of a parody skit they ran called  God is a Boob Man.  The skit was making some light-hearted humor at recent attempts to pass anti-LGBT laws in many states. The skit is absolutely hilarious and is a parody of other recent Christian movie trailers for such films as  God s not dead. It isn t clear how Boone saw the skit since he clearly hates SNL and shouldn t be watching it as a result. Perhaps he watches it just to get outraged. He certainly did get upset, though, when he took it upon himself to Godsplain God to the rest of us:God is not thin-skinned. But he does demand reverence. If you have any brains at all you don t pitch yourself against someone who created all things, the God of the Bible. They don t have to apologize to Christians [but] when you come against God and the Holy Spirit who are one and the same, you are bringing upon yourself eternal condemnation. Source: Right Wing WatchBoone went on to not only accuse SNL of being supporters of Satan, but he also outed SNL as a secret Jew-hating enterprise as well: Something can be devilishly funny, but this skit is diabolical. God has only one real enemy   Satan. Satan ridicules faith, and they re taking Satan s side. They re also ridiculing me and the film, telling impressionable young people not to see it because it s ridiculous. Then they throw in that the lawyer is Jewish to make the Christian look even worse, but it s just anti-Semitic. Source: Fox NewsYeah, he sure nailed it. Saturday Night Live is secretly anti-Jew. Just think about how stupid that sounds for a few moments.Then, to prove that he s a couple cans short of a six-pack, Boone said he didn t feel that SNL needed to apologize to Christians  followed a few moments later by him demanding that SNL apologizes to Christians. He literally real-time flip-flopped.Boone even went so far as to suggest that gay people should be offended at SNL for being  portrayed as more bigoted than Christians.  Notice he said  more  bigoted. He literally admitted that Christians like him are bigoted, by using the word  more. As if this wasn t embarrassing enough, the producer of  God s Not Dead 2,  (they actually made 2 of these?) Michael Scott, also complained that SNL is not portraying his movie  accurately  proving that he has absolutely NO CLUE how parody or satire works.Scott also chimed in with another incredibly funny comment, saying that parody like the SNL skit  goes too far  and  can cause divisions  among us.Really? Anti-LGBT/Pro-discrimination law doesn t go too far, and bigoted irrational hate doesn t cause divisions. But, a parody skit on SNL is the great doom of humanity. You really couldn t intentionally make up something that sounds as stupid as the things fundie Christians say naturally, these days.Featured image via Fox News screen capture",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ben Carson Reminds Us Why We Hate Him – Suggests Where Harriet Tubman Belongs (VIDEO),"Not to let us be disappointed in hearing something ludicrous come out of his mouth in so long, Dr. Ben Carson just dropped a doozy on us while he was being interviewed on Fox News.Still unable to keep his eyes open for more than half a second at a time, Carson was asked his opinion about Harriet Tubman being placed in the twenty-dollar bill. He seemed flabbergasted at the notion and said that former President Andrew  Trail of Tears  Jackson, who is currently on the $20, was a  tremendous secretary  err, umm  president  and he believes he should get to hold his place on currency.When asked what he thought of Harriet Tubman, he said  I love Harriet Tubman. I love what she did, but we can find another way to honor her,  and that not being bad enough, he said  maybe a $2 bill. Tubman risked everything to free herself and others who were being held as property, and then was a key participant in trying to get women the right to vote. Being recognized on the $20 bill is the least we can do to continue to honor her and her legacy. To say that she belongs on currency that is barely in use, and could likely be considered a joke, is not only condescending, but outright insulting..@RealBenCarson: Maybe Harriet Tubman should go on the $2 bill https://t.co/OMPuGSp82N pic.twitter.com/ZtHY9s2WNi  POLITICO (@politico) April 20, 2016Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Weakest President Ever’ Has ISIS So Desperate For Cash They’re Buying Guns With Kidneys,"Almost incessantly, conservatives remind us that President Obama is weak. It s certainly not true, but we hear it constantly as the Right attempts to diminish each and every one of his accomplishments, no matter how small or large. One particular target area is the war on ISIS   which is going quite well. In December, the President promised we will  destroy  ISIS   and since then, we have seen him make good on his word. In fact, the following month.In December, the President promised we will  destroy  ISIS   and since then, we have seen him make good on his word. In fact, the following month, the United States bombed a building full of the terrorist organization s money   a move that probably did more damage than a direct strike on the extremist group s soldiers   destroying millions of the already cash-strapped terrorists  dollars in the process. In addition, Daesh has been rapidly losing territory, which means a drastic reduction in tax revenue.By February, ISIS was forced to slash salaries by half, do away with bonuses, and eliminate other perks (no more free Snickers bars and energy drinks, terrorists!). Now, things are so desperate that the terrorist group is literally killing its own people so that it can sell their organs. Taking things a bit further than their earlier order to harvest non-Muslims  organs for transplant, the Arabic-language al-Sabah newspaper reports that ISIS has now begun harvesting injured fighters  organs to be sold on the black market. Doctors were threatened to take out the body organs of a wounded ISIL militant,  the report said. Iranian news agency FARS confirms the information: The terrorists are suffering a budget shortage after their recent loss of territory in the southern part of Mosul and for the same reason it is reportedly killing its own militants who have been injured in southern Mosul to take out their body organs such as hearts and kidneys to sell them in the black market. In addition, rather than kill prisoners for YouTube propaganda, ISIS is now keeping them alive to harvest blood for transfusions.Things are bad for ISIS. In April, the AFP reported that ISIS  monthly income has fallen to critical levels: In mid-2015, the Islamic State s overall monthly revenue was around $80 million (71 million euros),  said Ludovico Carlino, senior analyst at IHS, which issues regular reports on IS-controlled territory. As of March 2016, the Islamic State s monthly revenue dropped to $56 million,  Carlino said.An IHS report also said oil production in areas controlled by IS jihadists had gone down to 21,000 barrels per day from 33,000 barrels per day before.This was due largely to air strikes by the US-led coalition and Russia, although IHS warned the decline was only an  interruption of production  as jihadists were able to repair infrastructure quickly.There s something strangely satisfying about watching ISIS in its death throes. While it is widely acknowledged that the United States, under Obama s leadership, played a large role in the terrorist organization s fall, you will never see Republicans acknowledge this. After all, why sacrifice a good talking point over a little thing like  the facts. Just for fun, here s a video of the airstrike that destroyed ISIS  cash stockpile:Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox’s Uncle Tom Sheriff: Hillary’s Hot Sauce Love Is Racist To Blacks (VIDEO),"Fox News loves Wisconsin s Sheriff David Clarke. That man is the biggest Uncle Tom ever, and they capitalize on his love of the GOP and their network as  proof  that they aren t flaming racists. Sheriff Clarke sat down on Wednesday with the hosts of the ultimate team of ignorant morons   the good folks at Fox and Friends. His reason for being there? To make sure people believe that Hillary Clinton is a racist.You see, there are many stereotypes surrounding food when it comes to black people. Watermelon, fried chicken, grape soda, and, of course, hot sauce. The last item on that list is Sheriff Clarke s supposed  proof  of Hillary Clinton s racism. Now, Clinton has a long and well-documented history of loving to put the fiery condiment all over her food. So much so, in fact, that she carries it with her. And she said so in an interview with New York s Power 105.1 s Breakfast Club radio show when they asked her a question about what she always carries with her. That doesn t stop right-wing rags from insisting that she only said that she likes hot sauce to pander to black people, especially since there s a line about it in Beyonce s  Formation  song, which is clearly a racial empowerment anthem.As per usual, though, facts don t matter to Sheriff Clarke or Fox and Friends hosts. Clarke lit into Clinton over the answer, saying: I m surprised she didn t say watermelon. just go all the way. You know, this stuff is dehumanizing. It s embarrassing, it s disgusting. Clarke went on to opine that black people would vote GOP if we knew the history of the racism of the Democratic Party, conveniently leaving out the fact that in the post civil rights era, the parties have switched places when it comes to the promotion of racism and other forms of bigotry. But, again, facts do not matter to these people.To his credit, host Brian Kilmeade did point out the obvious in this scenario regarding which party actually tries to help black people and end marginalization, and reminded the sheriff that it isn t the GOP. Kilmeade said: No Republican is legitimately going for the black vote. That s also an insult, isn t it? Clarke doubled down, though, and insisted that the GOP does care about the black vote, despite all evidence to the contrary. He told Kilmeade: There s a strategy to make that happen. It s going to take some time. First of all, you have to reconnect black people to their history. That s what the Democrats have done over the last, I would say 30-40 years, is they have gone into these area and erased the history books about who really supported the move to abolish slavery as an institution in America. Lincoln freed the slaves. And then the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it s was Democrats that were standing in the way. And it took a yeomen s effort by Republicans to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That s why I say if we reconnect black people with their history, they ll open their eyes and they ll know what to do. Well, you can t fix stupid or make the ignorant accept facts that do not toe the line of enforcing their own beliefs. Shameful, but true.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Conservatives Will Lose Their Minds When They Find Out Who The Treasury Is Putting On The $20 Bill,"Big news out of the Treasury Department: After much debate, Alexander Hamilton will remain on the $10 bill   and instead, it s Andrew Jackson who is being given the boot.According to Politico, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is set to announce two major changes to the twenty, neither of which will make America s white supremacists very happy. First, former President Andrew Jackson will be replaced by a black woman, Harriet Tubman. Tubman was a legendary fighter against slavery and is recognized as having personally shepherded hundreds of escaped slaves to freedom in the north during her lifetime. The second change is the Treasury will be changing the $5 bill to  depict civil rights era leaders. Both changes reflect the recent cultural movement to acknowledge and honor the legacy of racial justice in America. It can also be seen as a bit of condemnation for the actions of President Jackson, a man whom historians are quick to point out gave America some of its most shameful actions against Native American peoples   including the forced migration and resettlement of many tribes that would eventually become known as the Trail of Tears.Until recently, it was Alexander Hamilton who was on the chopping block. However, thanks to a resurgence of interest in the founding father s life and legacy and the outrage over Jackson, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew was adamant that Hamilton would stay, even if someone else went. So long, President Jackson!Harriet Tubman being printed on the $20 bill will be a turning point in America s cultural identity. She represents the country at its best   humane, strong and fighting for what s right. She will also be the first woman and first person of color to be represented on paper currency (Native American, Sacajawea is already on a less commonly used dollar coin.)This all has to be quite a shock to the toxic white supremacists in the country who believe that white people are being erased and replaced by  minorities.  The fact that they will have to stare at symbols of racial equality each time they use a $20 or $5 bill is deeply satisfying. Or as my colleague Oliver Willis recently put it:dear wingnuts who are going to freak out about harriet tubman on the $20. give your bills to me.

 Hannity BLOWS UP At Ted Cruz In Heated Interview: ‘You Gotta Stop!’ (AUDIO/TWEETS),"Fox host Sean Hannity lost his cool during a radio interview with Ted Cruz yesterday, as the GOP candidate tried to dodge answering questions that might actually be helpful to voters.Hannity, who is a Trump supporter, brought up the way Cruz s campaign handled delegates, stating that it baffled many (and possibly being annoyed that Cruz was more prepared to win over delegates than Trump). Cruz completely avoided answering the question, and actually told Hannity he didn t think people cared about that. Hannity pushed back, insisting that millions of his followers wanted to know because they  find this whole process confusing. Once again, the GOP s least likable Republican dismissed Hannity s question, claiming that the only people who cared were on Trump s team. Cruz must have gotten Hannity s blood boiling, because then the Fox host blew up. He said: Senator, why do you do this? Every single time no, you gotta stop! Every time I have you on the air, and I ask a legitimate question, you try to throw this in my face. I m getting sick of it. I ve had you on more than any other candidate on radio and TV. So if I ask you a legitimate question to explain to the audience, why don t you just answer it? Cruz s response was equally testy as he shot back, Sean, can I answer your last question without being interrupted?  Then he made a half-ass attempt to respond to Hannity s question, but insisted that  as I travel the country, nobody is asking me this, other than the Trumpsters and the people repeating it. Hannity wasn t satisfied and continued to press the Texas Senator, stating that  it s a simple question, it s not a Trump question. You could tell that both men had gotten under each other s skin, because at one point in the interview, Hannity said to Cruz: Senator, I don t know why you re mad. And Cruz insisted that he wasn t mad, he was just annoyed that they were talking  only about the nonsense  instead of policy.Here s the intense interview, via The Sean Hannity Show:The interview clearly left Hannity with a bad taste in his mouth, because when the interview was over he took to Twitter to blast the candidate:TwitterTwitterTwitterHannity is known for giving pretty mild interviews to Republicans, but he was obviously no match for Cruz s ability to annoy anyone he comes in contact with.Featured image via Gerardo Mora / Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ben Carson Mistakenly Makes The Case NOT To Vote For Trump While On The Daily Show (VIDEO),"After dropping out of the Republican presidential race, Dr. Ben Carson made the quick shift to endorse Donald Trump. He insists that Trump is the best person for the job, besides himself of course, because he s an  outsider  who will supposedly get us away from the status quo. However, upon his recent visit to The Daily Show, Carson just made a perfect case against voting for Trump.Daily Show host Trevor Noah wasted absolutely no time in getting to the pressing question of why Carson chose to endorse Trump, saying the neurosurgeon must think  he can only be president for four years, so it can t be that bad. Carson s response was actually a far worse reason that Noah s joke, he said: What I actually said is that would be the worst-case scenario. Which left the audience not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and the sound that emanated from the crowd indicated it was probably a hybrid of the two.Yet, after discussing the supposed two different versions of Trump that exist, Carson said something that could make people stop and think twice before casting their ballot for Trump, because it s clear that Carson s vision of and for America is very different from that of the Republican front-runner s. He said: We are the child of every other nation, so we should have the welfare of every other nation at heart and conduct ourselves in a very different way. And if we can learn from them and we can conduct ourselves in a way that demonstrates compassion towards others, I believe that it can be a dawning of a new world. To which Noah responded as we all likely would with,  I hope Donald Trump is watching this show,  because that is certainly a message of inclusiveness that needs to be heard, and a far step away from the divisive, xenophobic rhetoric that Trump has been touting daily.It looks as though Carson may want to rethink who he s throwing his support behind.Watch the whole segment here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Did Donald Trump Jr. Just Say His Dad Beat Him For Refusing To Get Him Coke? (VIDEO),"It s hard to imagine Donald Trump showing anything approaching respect to his kids. From openly fantasizing about his infant daughter s future breasts, to posing for creepy photos with Ivanka, to pretty much flat-out saying he wants to f*ck Ivanka, it s clear that The Donald probably isn t that great of a father. Watching him speak at his rallies or on television easily gives one the impression that Trump is a boiling pot of rage ready to spill over on whomever is nearby at the time. But in an interview on Fox News, Donald Trump Jr. implied that the aforementioned  boiling  took physical form, and that he was the closest in proximity to his father when it happened at least once. You told me a story once, you told me on your radio show, your dad   you re 7 or 8 years old and he asks you to get him a coke can and you didn t get it?  host Sean Hannity asked. Trump Jr. explained: He came back from a rather rough day at work and he was like  Run to the kitchen and get me a coke.  I said  I m not your EXPLETIVE maid, and I ve never seen the man move so fast in my life. Apparently, Trump Jr. ran from his father, but his mother stopped him at the top of the stairs. He says his mom, who is the  European tough disciplinarian type,  handed him to Trump for punishment. I learned never to do that one again,  Trump Jr. said with a grin on his face. He did not say what form his punishment took, but it certainly was not pretty. Most parents don t chase their kids around the house over simple backtalk. Most children are not so terrified of what would happen as a punishment that they flee in terror.Did he beat his son for refusing to grab him a coke? We ll never know until he clarifies   but The Donald is certainly a violent man. Before he ran for President, ex-wife Ivana Trump said during divorce proceedings that he would rape and humiliate her, once assaulting her after a failed surgery to remove a bald spot. The Daily Beast gives a rundown of the horrific incident:What followed was a  violent assault,  according to Lost Tycoon. Donald held back Ivana s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants. Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified  It is a violent assault,  Hurt writes.  According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes,  he raped me. Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified  It is a violent assault,  Hurt writes.  According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes,  he raped me. Obviously, if he would do this to his wife, he would not hesitate to be violent with his children.Did Donald Trump Jr. just reveal another horrific fact about his family?

 This Amazing Photo Shows The POWER Women Have When They Vote,"This photo shows the gravesite of Susan B. Anthony, the pioneering activist who tirelessly pushed for women s equality   specifically suffrage, the right to an equal vote   on the day of the 2016 presidential primary in New York.The photo shows a group of  I voted  stickers affixed to Anthony s tombstone, which is in Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester, NY.Greta Selin-Love, who posted the photo, said she  got a little weepy  looking at the picture as was  thinking back to all the work that Susan B. did for us. It is definitely worth noting that the photo comes on the same day that a woman who is very likely to be the first female president, Hillary Clinton, won the New York primary with over a million votes.Susan B. Anthony was born in 1820. She formed the Women s Loyal National League with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and quickly launched the largest petition drive up that point in American history, with 400,000 signatures demanding the abolition of slavery.Anthony followed that up with an organization demanding equal rights for women and blacks.Her activism in service of women s suffrage was launched after she was arrested in Rochester in 1872 for the crime of voting as a woman, and went to trial because she refused to pay the fine. That led to the creation of an amendment giving women the right to vote, which Anthony traveled around the country giving speeches pushing for.She died in 1906, unfortunately not seeing her dream realized. But in 1920, the Ninteenth Amendment became the law of the land, denying the right to deny anyone the right to vote based on their gender. It is only a few words, but they are powerful:The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.Anthony was later honored with her image on a U.S. postage stamp, and her face also appeared on $1 coins. But most importantly her legacy is felt every time a woman casts a ballot in America, ratifying over and over true equality.Featured image via Facebook ",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Finally, Somebody Is Getting ARRESTED For Lead Poisoning In Flint’s Water","Criminal charges are coming down the line for Flint, Michigan officials involved in the devastating lead poisoning of the city s water supply. The Detroit Free Press reports that the state attorney general is about to make a major move.Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette will announce criminal charges today in connection with his ongoing investigation of the Flint drinking water crisis, three sources familiar with the investigation told the Free Press on Tuesday.Officials believe the city got artificially low lead readings because they didn t test the homes most at risk   those with lead service lines or other features putting them at high risk for lead. Among those to be charged is a City of Flint official who signed a document saying the homes Flint used to test tap water under the federal Lead and Copper Rule all had lead service lines   a statement investigators allege was false.Flint   a majority black city of over 100,000   had its water poisoned when an emergency manager put in place by Republican Governor Rick Snyder made the decision to switch the city s water supply to the Flint River in order to save money. Thanks to a system of corroded pipes, the water was poisoned with lead and piped into homes as drinking water.As a result, tests of Flint children have shown an increase in blood lead levels from 2.5% of kids to possibly as much as 5%. Lead poisoning can cause many physical ailments as it attacks the body, as well as brain damage resulting in serious learning disabilities and other disorders.Governor Snyder and his subordinates first down played concerns about lead poisoning when Flint residents began complaining about the quality of their water. Then as national media outlets began covering the issue, Snyder hired crisis managers and began to issue apologies while failing to seriously take blame for his decision.Now someone is going to be arrested, but it is an open question if the investigation will go to an even higher level, to the decision makers at top.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 20, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trends Show Republicans Are SCREWED For 2016, And It’s All Thanks To Trump","Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump emerged victorious in blowout wins in their home state of New York on Tuesday. In a field of three, Trump managed to capture just over 60 percent while Clinton, in a field of two, captured just under 58 percent.With Clinton and Trump gaining in delegates, it s becoming increasingly likely the two will face off in the November general election (should there be no contested conventions).And if Trump emerges the nominee and so does Clinton, that spells very bad news for the Republicans.Real Clear Politics, which gathers daily polling from multiple sources and finds a median, shows that as more Americans are exposed to Trump s campaign, the more likely they are to back Hillary Clinton.As Vox puts it:This is, according to political scientists, around the time when general election polling becomes predictive of the actual vote.  Were this a few months ago, I d say,  What s the big deal?'  Christopher Wlezien, a political science professor who s done a lot of work on election polling, told Vox back in March.  But polls today are much more meaningful than they were 90 days ago. And the polls today are much less favorable for Trump. Around this time, Mitt Romney was more popular than Donald Trump is, and he was within 2.5 percent of President Obama   who obviously won. Right now, Clinton is about ten points higher than the Donald.As general election polling becomes more representative of the actual outcome, Vox and Real Clear Politics estimate that at this rate Democrats not only would win the presidency and take back the Senate, they could even take back the House.One reason the Republicans are having such a hard time catching up to Clinton is because they aren t united, and are quite fractured. Democrats, while having their own differences, are nowhere near the breaking point the Republicans are, and that is a huge advantage heading into the general election.Republicans should be terrified. If they were smart, they would broker their convention and nominate Kasich, who consistently beats Hillary Clinton in the polls. But since when has the Republican Party done the smart thing?Years of fear mongering and peppered racism has not, nor will it, pay off for the GOP. They created this monster, now they have to deal with it.

 ‘Maury’ Show Official Facebook Posts F*CKED UP Caption On Guest That Looks Like Ted Cruz (IMAGE),"Maury is perhaps one of the trashiest shows on television today. It s right in line with the likes of the gutter trash that is Jerry Springer, and the fact that those shows are still on the air with the shit they air really is a sad testament to what Americans find to be entertaining. However, Maury really crossed the line with a Facebook post regarding one of their guest s appearance with a vile, disgusting caption on Tuesday evening.There was a young woman on there doing one of their episodes regarding the paternity of her child. However, on the page, the show posted an image of the woman, who happens to bear a striking resemblance to Senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz. The caption from the Maury Show page read: The Lie Detector Test determined .that was a LIE!  Ted Cruz is just NOT that SEXY! As if that weren t horrible enough, the caption underneath the Imgur upload reads,  Ted Cruz in drag on Maury. Here is an image from the official Maury Facebook page:Here is the embed of the post itself:This is beyond despicable. It s bad enough that this show preys on desperate people to keep their trashy show going and their audience of bottom-feeders entertained, but now they publicly mock them as well? This young woman cannot help how she looks or who she resembles. That is not her fault. Shaming someone s looks on social media is something we d expect from the morons who watch this crap on a daily basis, but it is NOT something the official show page should be doing. Then again, what can you expect from a show that rolls in the mud for a living and continues to show the world that there is now low they will not stoop to? This was more than a step too far, though.Maury, you owe this young woman a public apology. A VERY public apology.

 Clinton Wins Big In New York Democratic Primary (IMAGE/VIDEO),"New York loves Hillary Clinton, and they really turned out to show her that in tonight s primary. Her 56.7% to Sanders  42.4 percent means a huge delegate and popular vote win, with Clinton picking up 129 delegates. This also means that she breaks the 7-state winning streak that Bernie Sanders has enjoyed over her. The results were called a mere 40 minutes after voting ended at 9 PM EST.Here is a map of how the delegate counts shook out for tonight s Democratic Primary in New York, via Raw Story:Always classy, Secretary Clinton tried made sure that people understood that there is more that unites us as Democrats, rather than divides us, whether you supported her or Senator Sanders.Congratulations, Madame Secretary!

 Guatemalan President Can’t Keep A Straight Face As He Mocks Donald Trump (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has been called out by yet another foreign leader for his ridiculous plan to build the Great Wall of  Murica. During a Facebook Live interview by The New York Times en Espa ol, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, a former television comedian, openly mocked the Republican s wall.Trump rose to the top in the Republican primary race by promising his supporters that he was going to erect a huge wall to keep Latino immigrants out of the country. Although he has said that he is going to force Mexico (hahaha) to pay for this monstrosity, he has also promised that he is going to have it built really  inexpensively.  In order to do that, he is going to need the cheap labor he rails against in all of his speeches, and that is what President Morales offered him: To the gentleman who wants to build a wall, I offer cheap labor. We have high quality labor, and we ll gladly build. Tell us the dimensions, and we know how to do it. The president could hardly keep a straight face when he offered to help  the gentleman.  But he quickly turned serious when he started discussing real immigration policy with the reporter, saying: We believe   although I have no reason to involve myself in U.S. migratory policy   we believe that it is necessary to think about migratory reform where many people who are there in an irregular manner will be regularized,  he said. Morales added that legalizing undocumented immigrants in the United States would benefit the country because they would  contribute more and pay more taxes. He is absolutely right, it would greatly benefit America if we would reform immigration. We have millions of undocumented immigrants living in this country who are contributing to society, but would love to contribute even more   unfortunately, they are unable to do so unless they are legalized.Republicans like Donald Trump do not consider that, though, not because they believe it is false, but because it is easier to keep their voting base energized if they have someone to hate. Right-wing,  poorly educated  voters need a scapegoat to blame all of their problems on and immigrants are perfect for that. Meanwhile, the GOP continues to fan the flames to keep their dumbass base in a constant state fear which sends them back to the polls to vote for the right s candidates. It doesn t matter how much the GOP is victimizing their voters by cutting funding for many of the programs that keep food on their tables, as long as they have  others  to pick on, they are happy.So, Trump will continue to push this Great Wall of  Murica fantasy, his supporters will lap up his rhetoric and world leaders will continue to point their fingers and laugh at us. This is another reason why it is so important to vote BLUE in November.Watch the interview below (be warned, it s in Spanish):Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elizabeth Warren Just DECIMATED Ted Cruz For Whining About His ‘Sacrifices’: BOO HOO (TWEETS),"It looks as though Ted Cruz is really proud of himself for everything he believes he is doing for the nation as he is running for president. On Monday, he sent out a campaign email explaining all the  sacrifices  he s making as he s on the campaign trail.

Then he goes on to list the sacrifices:Now, I don t know about you, but I needed a barf bag to get through his list of  sacrifices.  Someone else who was not at all impressed with Cruz s complaints about life for the good of his campaign is Senator Elizabeth Warren from the great state of Massachusetts.

" Bernie Sanders Comforts Frustrated Voters, SHREDS New York’s Closed Primary (VIDEO)","On Tuesday, Bernie Sanders slammed New York s closed primary system after a frustrated voter vented to him about not being able to vote.The voter, 21-year-old Mike Cantalupo of Massapequa, New York, went up to Sanders and explained how the system had not only confused, but ultimately failed him. Cantalupo said that he d been trying to enroll as a Democrat since last spring, but couldn t succeed because he was told that by the Department of Motor Vehicles that his paperwork was lost. Then, when he tried to register again in December, he was told that the deadline for a change-of-party in New York had passed (the deadline is October). Despite all of his efforts, he couldn t change his registration and was ultimately prevented from casting his ballot. He told Sanders: New York has terrible voting laws. Right now I m trying to do everything I can to get my vote cast for [Sanders]. I can sign a court order and an affidavit and whatever I need to do, and I m going to do that, but it shouldn t be this hard to vote. Sanders heard Cantalupo s concerns and nodded. He agreed that  No, it should not be  this hard for people to vote. He added: Today, 3 million people in the state of New York who are independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary. That s wrong. You re paying for this election; it s administered by the state, [and] you have a right to vote. That s a very unfortunate thing that I hope will change in the future. You can watch Cantalupo s conversation with Sanders below:WATCH: @BernieSanders tells independent voter by Times Square:  You have a right to vote  https://t.co/1dXt1G3Cauhttps://t.co/PztjYBywWU  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 19, 2016Because of these issues, 3 million people that are registered outside of Republican or Democratic parties may not be able to vote in the primary. Jose Ruiz, a polling site coordinator, estimated  I d say 30% are not registered, even though they thought they were. And it wasn t just registration that voting New Yorkers had trouble with. In other cases, polling places were moved without adequately notifying voters, and some polling sites were set up hours later than their scheduled time.Despite all of the issues and setbacks, Sanders is still hopeful. Continuing to bash the primary problems that voters are now referring to as  sabotage,  Sanders said: We re feeling very good. If there is a large voter turnout   despite the impediment of 3 million people not being able to participate   I think we re going to do just fine. Compared to the rest of the United States, New York is generally low in voter participation regardless of whether it s a local or national election. Open primary states, or those with same-day registration, have much higher turnouts.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Actress Salma Hayek Perfectly BURNS Trump For Confusing 9/11 With 7- Eleven (TWEET),"A tweet by actress Salma Hayek clearly demonstrates how ridiculous the Republican Party is for supporting Donald Trump.During a rally in Buffalo on Monday, the Republican front-runner didn t even notice a major slip of his tongue when he confused to the terrorist attacks on 9/11 to the convenience store known as 7-Eleven. I wrote this out, and it s very close to my heart,  Trump claimed.  Because I was down there and I watched our police and our firemen down at 7/11, down at the World Trade Center right after it came down. And I saw the greatest people I ve ever seen in action. Yeah, it s so close to his heart that he couldn t even be bothered to get the date of the attacks right. And he was in New York when he made the unforced error.Trump would end up being crucified on social media for the screw-up, but Salma Hayek won the Internet with her own hilarious reaction. I am a dyslexic Mexican and English is my second language, however even I do not confuse 7/11 with 9/11,  she wrote.Here s the post via Twitter.I am a dyslexic Mexican and English is my second language, however even I do not confuse 7/11 with 9/11. #DonaldTrump  Salma Hayek (@salmahayek) April 19, 2016Hayek has only been on Twitter for just a year now but it looks like she has mastered the art of the Twitter burn.This has to be a totally embarrassing moment for Trump. In fact, it s probably the most embarrassing gaffe he has made throughout his hateful campaign. The man lives and works in New York for his entire life and yet he can t correctly state the date of the worst terrorist attack on American soil which happened in his own backyard and claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people.Donald Trump is a disgrace and Salma Hayek just put him in his place with a single tweet.Featured Image: Gage Skidmore",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Tennessee Republican Leader Vows Punishing Tax Hike On Companies That Support LGBT Rights,"It s amazing how quickly  free market values  go out the window when Republicans don t get their way.In Tennessee, House Majority Leader Gerald McCormick (R) vowed to start an economic hit list on businesses in the state that stood up for LGBT rights in the face of a recent discrimination bill similar to the one passed in North Carolina.The so-called  bathroom bill  would have forced trans students at public schools and colleges to use the gender on their birth certificate to determine which bathroom to use. It was an increasingly desperate response by conservatives to solve a non-existent problem in opposition to the expansion of gay rights across the country. Thankfully, Tennessee s Republican lawmakers got cold feet after watching states like North Carolina and Mississippi get economically devastated by their own versions of the law.However, McCormick was not happy about it. On the floor of the House he threw an epic tantrum that included floating the idea of using economic coercion in order to get businesses to drop their support for LGBT rights. His plan was to block companies who are seen as gay friendly from getting tax breaks like other businesses in the state. The ultimate goal appears to be to drive those businesses to bankruptcy or force them to comply with McCormick s narrow view of human rights. All these companies who tried to blackmail us over this thing, when they come for their corporate welfare checks next year, we need to have a list out and keep an eye on it. Note: McCormick s use of  Blackmail  here means democratic and economic expressions of protests.McCormick also accused people concerned with gay and trans rights of being unconcerned with gang violence. What do the two have to do with one another? Who knows, and certainly not McCormick. This weekend we had four people shot in Chattanooga,  McCormick said. But  our Chamber of Commerce is writing us letters about the bathroom bill. Now the reason they re not all fired up about the city of Chattanooga s handling of the gang problem is because the city of Chattanooga sends them money and funds their budget. And we don t. Guess what. We ain t gonna. The hypocrisy of creating a needless bill and then getting upset when people  waste time  opposing it is, of course, extremely rich.Like his counterparts in North Carolina, McCormick seems absolutely bewildered by the fact that the American people are not cool with his party s attempt to bully transgender people. Rather than reflect on the outrage and reassess his own beliefs, the Republican response has been to double down and accuse the opposition of being part of a vast  gay agenda  conspiracy.With his delusions intact, McCormick now wants to use his position to destroy businesses that stand with the LGBT community. It would be laughably desperate if it weren t so vile.Featured image via YouTube screengrab",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream Founders Get Arrested At U.S. Capitol,"The co-founders of Ben & Jerry s Ice Cream, Ben Cohen, and Jerry Greenfield, were two of the 1200+ arrested in the past week at the U.S. Capitol to protest the influence big money has in politics as part of the Democracy Spring movement. According to the U.S. Capitol Police, those arrested were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, which is unlawful demonstration activity. Both Cohen and Greenfield were processed and released on scene.Ben Cohen also runs a non-profit, Stamp Stampede, which literally stamps money out of politics. The stamps stamp money with slogans such as  Not to be used for bribing politicians. No matter what issue you are most passionate about environment, healthcare, soaring prescription drug costs the root cause is always linked to corporations giving so-called donations in large sums to politicians, in a process Senator John McCain has called  legalized bribery,  Ben Cohen told me in an interview for the New York Observer in December 2015. A few hundred really wealthy people put in the majority of early contributions to our country s presidential candidates,  he said.  In the context of congress, our representatives get gobs of money from corporations through lobbyists for either passing or not passing legislation, essentially transforming our democracy into an oligarchy. We can t tackle the rest of the problems until we tackle this basic one. It s difficult to address because it requires an amendment to overturn a Supreme Court decision, but that s what Americans have done throughout history we have worked to overturn egregious decisions, which is why we have the constitutional amendment process. The non-profit s website, StampStampede.org, has photos of stamped money posing with Senator Elizabeth Warren and other advocates for getting money out of politics. As long as corporate and wealthy influences can undermine democracy through campaign contributions, the gridlock in congress will persist and most likely worsen. Big money doesn t want meaningful progressive reforms, they want to influence legislation to insulate themselves from the rigors of a competitive market while exploiting tax loopholes and government subsidies to maximize their profits at the expense of the working and middle classes in America.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Art Project Or Hate Speech? 6 Rainbow Colored Nooses Found Hanging On Tennessee Campus,"Students at Austin Peay State University were both horrified and deeply puzzled by what appears to have been an art project gone horribly wrong. Someone, allegedly with the approval of an art instructor, made 6 nooses, one for each color of the rainbow, and hung them from a tree on campus.According to a statement posted on social media Monday night, the nooses were found on campus near the Trahern building, where most of the university art classes are held.In a statement, President Alisa White called the display  deeply disturbing. This incident is deeply disturbing and is hurtful to our University community,  White said in the statement.  Regardless of the intent, the display has no place on our campus. I am saddened, and I am sorry for the hurt and offense this has caused and want our students, faculty, and staff to know that it will not be tolerated. As of this writing, no one has come forward to claim responsibility or, more importantly, explain what the hell they were thinking at the time. Considering that Tennessee has over 200 confirmed cases of post-Reconstruction lynchings, hanging any noose of any kind is, to be delicate, in extremely poor taste.But, even more bizarrely, it might not have been intended as hate speech:According to a student in the class who asked to not be identified, the display was a part of a project in an introductory sculpture class. The student said the project concepts and locations were approved in advance by the instructor.Comments on Instagram indicate the rainbowed noose theme has to do with the number of suicides in the LGBT community, which I can sort of see if I squint really hard. Admittedly, we ve all said or done something that sounded great in our head but turned out to be a really stupid idea in practice. I m leaning towards the suicide explanation because, frankly, I m having a hard time believing that an art instructor heard the pitch  I want to hang rainbow colored nooses because I don t like gays and black people  and thought it would make a lovely art project.On the other hand, even if there was no ill intent, the student that convinced an instructor to put their job at risk in this fashion can apparently sell ice to an Eskimo. Stay tuned for more on this bizarre story.Featured image via Instagram",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Samantha Bee Goes There In Funniest NSFW Takedown Of Trump’s Ego Yet (VIDEO),"When it comes to Donald Trump one thing is clear: he loves himself   a lot. He admires himself to the point where he may actually believe everything he touches turns to gold. He tells crowds of people, that for some reason believe him, that he s going to  Make America Great Again.  How? Pfft, who needs details? He s just going to do it, duh.Noticing what a braggadocios windbag the Republican presidential frontrunner is, is well, everyone, but taking to the next level is Full Frontal host Samantha Bee. On her Monday show she completely skewered the living heck out Trump and his speeches full of how much  winning  he is going to bring to the nation.During a rally in Albany, NY, Trump said: We re gonna start winning again. We re gonna win so much. We re gonna win at every level  We re gonna win economically. We re gonna win with the economy. We re gonna win with military. We re gonna win with healthcare and for our veterans. We re gonna win with every single facet. We re gonna win so much, you may even get tired of winning, and you ll say please, it s too much winning. We can t take it anymore. Mr. President it s too much, and I ll say no it isn t. Noticing how clearly this speech is more reminiscent of  Fifty Shades of Grey  than any sort of policy proposal, Bee appears in a blindfold asking Trump to  win me harder  win all over me  just, try not to win in my hair. Bee then says: Sorry, I thought I was listening to my audio book of Fifty Shades of Great. I listen to the audio book because I need my hands free  and the rest you ll have to see below.Let s just say, she hits the nail on the head on how much Trump loves himself, as well as how much he thinks we should all love him and his  ideas  and how much he s going to be  winning  for the country, and we should just take it, because you know, even if we hate it, we re gonna love it.Well done, Sam.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Rick Snyder Drinks Flint Water To Prove It Is Safe, Rachel Maddow Gives Him Bad News (VIDEO)","Michigan Governor Rick Snyder was thirsty to prove that the water in Flint is safe to drink, so he drank it and promised to drink more. But Rachel Maddow had some bad news to share.In response to an open invitation to drink some of the water he himself had declared poisoned after ignoring the man-made travesty for a year or more, the Republican told a reporter,  Yeah, I mean if someone, I m happy to look into that. But Snyder didn t exactly look happy about the prospect of voluntarily drinking tainted water that could make him seriously ill as he turned away. So, after many tests of the tap water in one home, Snyder took a drink and claimed to like it so much that he would keep drinking it for 30 days though it is not known how Flint residents will be able to verify that the three gallons he took with him is the same water he ll be drinking. I completely understand why some Flint residents are hesitant to drink the water and I am hopeful I can alleviate some of the skepticism and mistrust by putting words to action,  Snyder declared after drinking the water.  Flint residents made it clear that they would like to see me personally drink the water, so today I am fulfilling that request. And I will continue drinking Flint water at work and at home for at least 30 days. Flint residents certainly are not buying into the act. Not only should he and his wife drink it, they say, his whole family should drink it as well as bathe in it and cook with it.Indeed, that s what Flint residents were forced to do for a long time before state officials finally acknowledged that the water supply was poisoned and began to do something about it. It could have been avoided had Republicans not switched the city s water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which has been contaminated for decades as a matter of public record.And because state officials allowed the tragedy to unfold, thousands of children now face future health issues due to the high levels of lead in the water.But Rachel Maddow had some news for Snyder. He may have made sure that the tap water he was drinking was safe before ever taking a sip, but that doesn t mean it wasn t poisoned when he finally got around to drinking it. As best as we can tell, that house where Governor Snyder drank this water through the filter today, it s been tested for lead several times in recent months,  Maddow said. The federal danger threshold for lead is 15 parts-per-billion,  she continued. However, a test conducted on March 16, just over a month ago, revealed levels of 265 parts-per-billion.  More than 10 times above the federal threshold,  Maddow pointed out. So careful Governor. I hope it was a good lead day at that house when you filled up those jugs. Here s the video via YouTube.Make no mistake, despite his attempt to make Flint residents feel better, Snyder and other state officials should be sitting in a jail cell right now awaiting prosecution for all the lives they have ruined by their irresponsible management of Flint and the city s water supply. They literally put saving money above public health and safety and that is unforgivable.Featured image via screen capture",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Jared Fogle’s Pedophilic Texts Finally Released, And They Are Absolutely REVOLTING (VIDEO)","Former Subway spokesman and outed pedophile Jared Fogle is rotting in prison where he belongs, but the scandal surrounding the man who made his fortune by hawking sandwiches for the  Eat Fresh  chain is far from over. The whole world knows that the man is a sick old kiddie diddler, but thus far we haven t been privy to the extent of his depravity. That all comes to an end now, though.The Daily Mail has revealed text messages that Fogle exchanged with a pimp, asking for a 14-year-old girl.

Like 15 or 16? When the pimp inquires as to why Fogle was asking about young girls, he responds,  Because that is what I crave. If that s not sick enough for you, Fogle not only paid for sex with youngsters, he also was caught with a boatload of child pornography, involving as many as 12 innocent children.

 Samantha Bee Rips Tennessee Republican A New One For Calling All Rape Victims Liars (VIDEO),"A racist, anti-gay Tennessee Republican who thinks rape victims are liars was hilariously taken to the woodshed by Samantha Bee on Monday.GOP state Rep. Sheila Butt has made an ass of herself ever since taking office. She has openly called for the creation of a National Association for the Advancement of White People and is staunchly opposed to same-sex marriage and homosexuality. She has also viciously targeted rape victims, whom she thinks are lying about being raped just so they can get an abortion.In response to all of these hateful and bigoted stances held by this conservative  Christian  lawmaker, Bee hilariously skewered her. Right, those crimes are totally unverifiable,  Bee said of Butt s remarks about rape.  So we should go with the likeliest assumption that girls are lying whores that just like the prestige of claiming to be raped by their fathers? It s called Occam s Razor, libtards! And then she moved on to Butt s racism, suggesting that NAAWP could also stand for National Association for the Advancement of Walrus Penises and that we should all spread the word that Sheila Butt loves walrus penises. I mean, she does seem to think about sex a lot,  Bee noted before masterfully seguing to Butt s views on homosexuality.  In her Christian dating guide Everyday Princess, Daughter of The King, Butt comes down on a 3-year-old who married her two female Barbies, telling her,  Girls don t marry girls. God made girls to marry boys!  Look, Sheila, if you don t believe in homosexuality, you should never have supported a toy line that includes Ken. That guy is young, dumb and hungry for c*m. And then Bee finished the Tennessee Republican off by literally making her the butt of a seriously funny piece of advice for women. So, girls, next time you re tempted to have dirty sinful sex, resist the urge. Instead, do all the stuff Sheila Butt suggests, or as she may call it,  Butt Stuff.  This Tennessee state representative wants you to do lots and lots of Butt stuff. Do Butt stuff until it hurts! Here s the video via YouTube.Simply put, Sheila Butt is going to be the butt of many more jokes from now on thanks to Samantha Bee.

 Republican Fox Strategist Files A $4 Million Lawsuit Against Donald Trump,"Republican strategist Cheri Jacobus, who has appeared as a pundit on Fox News, filed a $4m defamation lawsuit on Monday in New York City against Donald Trump and his campaign (shocker). The suit alleges that the frontrunner and his campaign manager, woman batterer Corey Lewandowski, engaged in defamation aimed  with the purpose of making her an object lesson, to those who might question Trump and his fitness for office, to incite a virtual mob against her, to destroy her reputation, and to bully her. The bullying tactics occurred after Jacobus criticized the frontrunner on TV and Twitter. Jacobus approached the Trump campaign with the hopes of obtaining a job as communications director, but decided against it after finding Lewandowski  unprofessional  and a  powder keg,  meaning a dangerous or volatile person or situation.Well, Trump didn t like that. After she made her criticism public, Trump sent off the first hate-tweet, calling Jacobus  a real dummy.  When Jacobus attempted to reign in the drama with a cease-and-desist letter, the frontrunner took to Twitter yet again, referring to her as a  Major loser,  with zero credibility. Lewandowski then went on MSNBC to discredit Jacobus, saying: This is the same person, I ll just tell ya, who came to the office on multiple occasions trying to get a job from the Trump campaign, and when she wasn t hired clearly she went off and was upset by that. After that, Jacobus starting getting threatening, harassing hate mail from Trump supporters, and Fox News stonewalled the strategist. Jacobus also shows that Trump, who is friends with Roger Ailes, helped convince the network to drop her from appearing on their cable news programs. According to Jacobus, Lewandowski showed her the email where Ailes promised to be on Trump s side, not hers.So, Donald Trump resorted to bullying and intimidation to silence a female strategist who didn t agree with him? I m shocked I tell you, shocked! And of course the Trump campaign brushed off the lawsuit as  just another frivolous lawsuit and an attempt to gain notoriety at the expense of Donald Trump. Much like everything else, the Trump campaign just brushes everything off, and his band of backwards thinking supporters will eat it up.

While attempting to work up the audience by invoking the spirit of the emergency services workers, living and dead, who fought to save lives during the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001   Mr Trump said: I was down there, and I watch our police and our firemen down on 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down and I saw the greatest people I have ever seen in action. The audience are clearly somewhat confused. The misspeak makes it sounds as if Donald Trump was down at his local 7-Eleven store, and all hell kicked off   not that he witnessed one of the worst attacks on U.S. soil in history.https://www.facebook.com/ABC7/videos/10153504430897452/ Here are some of the finest tweets in response to the Trump gaffe:Donald Trump has spoken movingly about 7-Eleven. It reminded him, he said, of the way Americans came together in 1941 after Pearl Necklace.  Damien Owens (@OwensDamien) April 19, 2016BREAKING: Trump refers to 9/11 as 7/11, fans cheer, say they're ""fed up with the establishment telling us what dates things happened on""  Rex Huppke (@RexHuppke) April 19, 2016Trump talked down 9/11 to 7/11. He knows how to make a deal!  Chris Regan (@ChrisRRegan) April 19, 2016@AP @robdelaney This is no laughing matter. I lost my dad in 7/11; he said he was running in to get a pack of smokes and I never saw him aga  wade snook (@w_snook) April 19, 2016@itvnews @vine jet fuel can't melt slurpies  Pete Hutcheon (@daddymojorisin) April 19, 2016The best bit was, this wasn t even the first mistake of the night. This rally was a real low point for the candidate   at a time when his campaign desperately needs to regain momentum.Earlier in the  same speech, Trump thanked Buffalo Bills coach Rex Ryan for his introductory speech   which was itself a disaster. During the thanks, Trump attributed  championship  wins to the former Jets coach which never actually happened.From overselling the  winning  capability of himself and his allies, and repeatedly invoking the painful memory of the September 11 attacks  Trump is aiming to seize the New York primary from his rivals. More than 11,000 people attended the Buffalo hockey arena to hear Trump speak   which sounds impressive until you realize Bernie Sanders attracted three times this many people to his rally in Brooklyn s Prospect Park on Sunday.There is the unmistakable whiff of decay around the Trump camp right now, as his six never-changing soundbites grow stale, and he has nothing else to offer.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Buffalo Bills Coach Gives Donald Trump The Weirdest Rally Introduction Ever (VIDEO),"Buffalo Bills coach Rex Ryan has one job, to introduce Donald Trump at his rally in Buffalo, New York. But Ryan s rambling, creepy intro left the audience not knowing whether to laugh or cry.I fairness, Ryan did attempt to set dial expectations down to zero with the opening sentence of his speech, in which he warns: Obviously, we all know I m not a politician, I m not a public speaker. I m just a football coach. The crowd yells, screams and applauds in typical Trump-style frenzy    He s just like us! Yeah! But then Ryan moves into the words longest, most meandering personal anecdote   all to deliver a joke which raised little more than a trickle of laughter from the crowd. He went all the way back to the  80s, describing different players and a particular play. Ryan takes literally minutes to explain that his then team (the Generals) supplied the ball to a fullback instead of star running back, Herschel Walker, at the goal line.Trump owned the Generals at the time and called Ryan with a warning. The conversation went like this,  Ryan said, working up to his pay-off  The next time you give the ball to Maurice Carthon instead of Herschel Walker, you re fired!  That is a true story. Because no one s tired of The Apprentice jokes yet, right?The grand conclusion to Ryan s speech was meant to be his reasons for endorsing Donald Trump. So hold onto your hats, here it is. He ll say what s on his mind,  he said.  You ll see people that want to say the same thing, but the big difference is they don t have the courage to say it. Donald Trump certainly has the courage to say it, That feels more like the entry-level requirement to apply for any job in the world   the ability to speak. How will he attempt to sell Trump next? With the fact that he s potty-trained?Whelk the Trump rally was boring 11,000 folks to tears in Buffalo, Bernie Sanders was holding a 30,000-strong, energizing rally in Prospect Park over in Brooklyn. It was Hollywood actor Danny DeVito which delivered the introduction for Sanders, and it was somewhat different.  I doesn t take a genius to see where the momentum is heading as the race for President heats up.Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Kasich LOSES IT After Reporter Asks About His Only Win, And It’s Kinda Hilarious (VIDEO)","No one wants to admit that they re losing, especially if you ve been fighting really hard to gain votes, but Ohio Gov. John Kasich really doesn t seem to want to admit he is losing. After all, he s only won one state so far in the Republican presidential primary, and that one state is the state where he is governor.So, when Demetri Sevastopulo of the Financial Times directly asked Kasich about his potential path to victory, and reminded the Ohio governor that he s only won a single state, Kasich got rather angry and even snatch the voice recorder from the reporters hand.Sevastopulo asked: Governor, if you get to the convention in Cleveland and you have only won Ohio do you think you re qualified to be the nominee? Kasich bites back: They ll be no  if    there s not  if  in there. They ll be when, and listen, at the end of the day the Republican Party wants to pick somebody who actually can win in the fall Sevastopulo cuts in and reiterates: But if you ve only won Ohio Then Kasich turns to him and says: Can I finish? With Sevastopulo saying: If you answer the question. Kasich clearly losing his patience replies: I m answering the question the way I want to answer it. You want to answer it? It was at that moment that Kasich tears the voice recorder out of Sevastopulo s hand, points it at the reporter and asks,  What do you think?  With Sevastopulo perfectly replying,  I think you should answer the question. It seems fairly obvious Kasich doesn t want people to tell him that he s probably not going to be the nominee, despite his best efforts to stay in the race until the end. His best hope is a split convention where he can garner up the necessary delegate votes, but even then, with only one victory, it s not looking very likely people will choose him over other candidates.The truth hurts, and Kasich doesn t handle it very well.Watch the interaction here:In bizarre moment @JohnKasich snatches my recorder as annoyed at question about only winning Ohio @benmarinojourno pic.twitter.com/hSingCvpF4  Demetri Sevastopulo (@DimiSevastopulo) April 19, 2016Featured Photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images",News,"April 19, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Refuses To Meet With TX Muslims Because He’s A Complete Jerk (AUDIO),"Ted Cruz just keeps proving that he does not legitimately want to be president at every chance he gets. The latest dumbassery from his campaign came when his  national security advisor  Frank Gaffney, started lobbying members of Congress to refuse to meet with the people participating in the National Muslim Advocates Day.NMAD is an event where Muslim-Americans across the nation go to Washington, D.C. to meet with their representatives in order to voice opinions on public policy, and to also make attempts at outreach from the Muslim-American community to help bridge some of the cultural gaps that have developed in America.Seems pretty reasonable, right? We keep hearing how Muslims don t  do enough  to combat the threat of Islamic extremism in the United States from literally every Republican. However, when Republicans get their chance to meet with Muslims and do something productive, they turn coward, run and hide.And people say  they hate us for our freedom.  Yeah right The U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations released the following statement, regarding Cruz s outright cowardice of both him and his campaign staff in meeting with them:This evening, representatives of the US Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), a coalition of leading national and local American Muslim groups, will hold a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., to condemn the refusal of GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his congressional staff to meet with Muslim constituents during today s second National Muslim Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill.Some 330 Muslim delegates from 28 states are meeting with a third of the House of Representatives and almost half of the Senate.Earlier today, 14 Texas Muslim delegates to the National Muslim Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill tried to meet with either Sen. Cruz or a member of his congressional staff, but were told no one would meet with them. The delegates had tried to arrange a meeting for several weeks prior to today s event.Source: Right Wing WatchSo, if Ted and his entire campaign parade of idiots are too frightened to actually meet with some regular Americans who happen to be Muslim, how will they EVER find the courage to fight ISIS? It s a question that needs an answer.Ted Cruz can t stop reminding us how he loves religious freedom and the Constitution. However, he condemns people for their choice of religion and denies them their right to petition their government, which just happens to be in the Constitution. It really makes you wonder if Ted even understands that he s running for president and not on a reality show.When Trump wins the nomination, and Republicans act surprised, they can look at their golden boy Cruz and remember they have nobody to blame but themselves for losing 2016.Listen to the Cruz campaign explain why America would be insane to vote for him below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/258517130  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /] Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: What Trump Just Said About 9/11 Proves Republicans Still Don’t Get It,"Sprinting towards a likely win in New York s Republican primary, Donald Trump made the kind of flub about the September 11th terrorist attacks that would cause heartache for most other campaigns but is sort of what we ve now come to expect from the reality TV star turned presidential frontrunner.Appearing at a campaign event in Buffalo, NY, Trump referred to the 9/11 attacks as  7/11. Donald Trump, who has made his advocacy for New York City after the 9/11 attacks central to his candidacy, accidentally referred to it on Monday as 7/11   the ubiquitous convenience store. I wrote this out, and it s very close to my heart,  he said at the outset of his remarks on Buffalo on Monday evening.  Because I was down there and I watched our police and our firemen down at 7/11, down at the World Trade Center right after it came down. And I saw the greatest people I ve ever seen in action. This weird flub of course comes from the candidate who has claimed that he has a photographic memory and bragged a few months ago that he had  the best  words:I m telling you, I used to use the word incompetent. Now I just call them stupid. I went to an Ivy League school. I m very highly educated. I know words, I have the best words but there is no better word than stupid. Right?But Trump s respect for what happened on 9/11 has always been about an inch thick, despite his long time association with New York City.A conservative anti-Trump PAC aired an ad showing that Trump exploited a loophole in the law to access $150,000 in funds targeted towards small businesses who had suffered due to the attacks, even though   as he has gone on about at length   Trump has hundreds of millions of dollars at his disposal, along with businesses (well the ones who haven t gone bankrupt) generating considerable income.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald ‘War Criminal’ Rumsfeld Takes A Moment To Remind Us He’s Close To Death (TWEET),"There are some people in life that, if they are wise, will just keep their mouths shut and their voices out of public reach. Donald Rumsfeld is one of those people. Yet, he can t seem to keep his mouth shut on Twitter and likes to continue to remind us of what a horrific human being he is, and should likely really belong in prison.On Monday, Rumsfeld decided to tweet out in regards to tax day:At 83, I am close to losing hope that I will live to see a flat tax.  Donald Rumsfeld (@RumsfeldOffice) April 18, 2016Aww, how terrible for him that a regressive method of taxation will never come to fruition during his lifetime. He apparently isn t done screwing over the American people, and would prefer the wealthy to pay less and the poor to pay more. What a peach.We already knew this guy is a douchebag, though. He s one of the evil assholes who lied to get us into a war with Iraq. A war that has subsequently killed thousands of American soldiers, wounded thousands more, killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and gave rise to ISIS (but really, who s keeping track). He knew we didn t have enough intelligence to back claims that there were Weapons of Mass Destruction. Yet, he as the Secretary of Defense under former President George W. Bush, continued to lead the drumbeat towards war.So Rumsfeld, we as pissed off American citizens think your tweet should have probably read  At 83, I am close to losing hope that I will be tried as the war criminal that I am.  And if you go to Twitter and read the replies to his tweet, it seems many, many people agree with that sentiment. Probably not wise for a man who s actions lead to so many deaths to tweet he s close to death himself. Likely not gonna be received too well.He truly is a person who should keep his mouth shut, because if he had kept it shut in the first place, so much worldwide would be different to this day.Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin Trashes Fox ‘News’ For Not Seeking Facts Before Reporting,"Fox News is now part of the  lamestream  media as far as Sarah Palin is concerned, and that s not the only shot she fired at the conservative network.On Saturday, Palin responded to reports that she had dropped out of an appearance at the Wyoming Primary in support of Trump, who went on to lose all of the delegates in the state. No, despite reports, I didn t  drop out  of anything in Wyoming s GOP Primary today,  Palin wrote on her Facebook page.  I wasn t scheduled to be there, which can be verified by the Trump Campaign and our email exchanges from EIGHT DAYS AGO where it was agreed a trip to Wyoming wouldn t fit in with my prior obligations to work in DC and Nevada this weekend. Not satisfied with just accusing the media of issuing false reports, she threw an absolute temper tantrum to the point where she actually stated that she wants to put the media over her knee and spank them.But the most interesting part of Palin s rant came in the third paragraph when she threw Fox News under the bus and confirmed what we all already knew: that Fox News does not seek out the facts before reporting stories.Too bad reporters don t bother to seek facts before spewing their bull. (Here s to you even, Fox News.) I ve never had a PR team to correct the record for me, so within reason I try to keep up with constant misreporting  but it s impossible to do when I  have a life  and don t waste precious time perusing press clippings.Here s the full post via Facebook:As you ll recall, Sarah Palin was once employed by Fox News before they gave her the ax, only for her to return and then leave the position herself. Fox News and Sarah Palin have clearly not always been on good terms but it definitely looks like the GOP civil war now includes a newly sparked battle between America s village idiot and the propaganda arm of the Republican Party. Now we just need to grab our popcorn and wait for Fox News to respond.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Despite Whining, Trump’s Kids Actually Can Vote For Him In NY Primary (If They Weren’t Lazy)","Donald Trump s kids may support him in spirit (and terrible tweets), but they won t be going out to vote for him in the New York primary. Ivanka and Eric Trump both failed to register as Republicans in time to do so. According to Trump, this is because New York s primary registration rules were unfair. After all, the cutoff was in October, and at that point people   including, apparently, his own kids   still sort of expected Trump to have dropped out by now.On CNN, Ivanka claimed New York s voting regulations are  onerous. New York has one of the most onerous rules in terms of registration, and it required us to register a long time ago, almost   close to a year ago. And we didn t do that. We found out about it sort of after the fact. to which the millions of disenfranchised Democratic voters who have watched  Voter ID  laws sweep the country responded by playing the world s smallest violin.Trump himself told his supporters that Ivanka and Eric feel very, very guilty.  Adding:  They feel very guilty. But it s fine. I understand that. Except here s the thing: The Trump kids could probably vote for their dad if they really wanted to. It would just require a little work.In a highly informative piece on Gothamist, writer Nathan Tempey explained how someone who missed the primary registration deadline could still vote in the election. It s certainly not ideal, but it s not exactly rocket science, either.One is to try to get a court order stating you should be allowed to vote in a certain party s primary. As difficult as this sounds, the city Board of Elections actually stations judges at offices in each of the boroughs on Primary Day to do exactly this. For reasons unknown, this information doesn t appear on the board s website, but a spokeswoman provided a list of locations and hours judges will be at them Something tells me explaining to a judge  My dad s on the ballot  will be a good enough reason to get your vote counted. However, it s highly unlikely Trump s kids will reduce themselves to standing in a busy borough office waiting to have a judge hear their case, fill out the appropriate paperwork, then travel to a voting site. Why do that when they can simply complain about it on Fox News?Featured image via Grant Lamos IV/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox News A-Hole Spends Tax Day Shaming The Poor For Being Poor (VIDEO),"Fox News  raging pile of upper one percent garbage, Eric Bolling, decided to use his time on cable news shaming the working poor of America for having the nerve to still be poor over the course of this past tax season.Bolling raged incoherently about how unfair it is that poor people are helped by the government, they don t pay ENOUGH in taxes (yes a Republican is whining that people aren t paying enough taxes   but only the poor people of course), and how the rich jackasses like him have to shoulder the burden.He makes a good point, Right? A guy paid millions of dollars a year to sit in a chair for 1 hour a day and be an ass on national tv really has it ROUGH when he has to pay a portion of that in taxes to prevent the bottom 50 percent of the population from starving. I mean, after he pays his terrible 30 percent he only has millions of dollars left to live on. How can he survive this?Bolling went on to cite some statistics that he must have written down while drunk one night because they re so utterly stupid that it defies explanation how a  political expert  like him would think they sounded remotely accurate. He even went on to complain about the  death tax  which only affects people who literally have millions of dollars being HANDED to them as an inheritance.Only the wealthiest estates pay the tax because it is levied only on the portion of an estate s value that exceeds a specified exemption level   $5.43 million per person (effectively $10.86 million per married couple) in 2015.Source: CBPPThe top rate for it is 18 percent. If you are going to whine about having to pay 20% of a 5 MILLION dollar inheritance (literally free money), you re simply a greedy, terrible person who doesn t appreciate anything.The cherry on the sundae really was when Eric threw a second hissyfit over the fact that President Obama paid less in taxes than he did. He ignored the fact that President Obama doesn t make millions per year as president, unlike Bolling who makes a fortune warming a seat for 1 hour a day.Watch Fox News blame poor people for hurting the rich below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Calm Down, Politifact Confirms Majority Of Money Clooney Raised Isn’t Going To Hillary Clinton","Recently, liberal firebrands like George Clooney and his wife, Amal Alamuddin, have come under heavy fire from the left for their $353,000 per couple fundraising dinner to benefit the candidacy of Hillary Clinton for president.Some people were so incensed they literally threw dollar bills at Clinton.But here s the kicker: the majority of the money raised at the Clooney-Clinton dinners aren t going to Clinton   they re going to down ticket candidates to take back the House and the Senate.While appearing on Meet the Press, Clooney, who brushed off the notion that he is a  corporate shill  as  one of the funnier things you could say about me  told host Chuck Todd:It s [the money] going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress. And the reason that s important (is)   we need to take the Senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice, because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again. And that s why I m doing it.Politifact rated that as  Mostly True.  Here s how it goes:So only $2,700 out of $353,000 will go directly to Clinton. That s approximately 0.0076 percent   less than one percent.While leftists threw dollar bills at Clinton, Democrats across the country were getting the support they so need to take back two chambers (possibly three with the Supreme Court) thanks to George Clooney.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 McDonald’s Future Is Scary: Bottomless Fries And Automated Cashiers,"McDonald s in recent years has become an icon of gluttony and corporate greed, from the fight for NYC McDonald s workers to receive a $15 minimum wage, to the obesity epidemic, which still remains rampant throughout the country. Morgan Spurlock s 2004 documentary, Supersize Me, exposed to the public just how awful McDonald s food is for the human body, and how McDonald s manipulates consumers into thinking otherwise. Over the course of my McDiet, I consumed 30 pounds of sugar from their food. That s a pound a day. On top of that, I also took in 12 pounds of fat,  said Mr. Spurlock in the documentary.  Now, I know what you re saying. You re saying nobody s supposed to eat this food three times a day. No wonder all this stuff happened to you. But the scary part is: there are people who eat this food regularly. Some people even eat it every day. So, while my experiment may have been a little extreme, it s not that crazy. But here is a crazy idea: Why not do away with your Super Size options? Who needs 42 ounces of Coke? A half pound of fries? And why not give me a choice besides french fries or french fries? That would be a great start. But why should these companies want to change? Their loyalty isn t to you, it s to the stockholders. The bottom line: They re a business, no matter what they say. And by selling you unhealthy food, they make millions. And no company wants to stop doing that. If this ever-growing paradigm is going to shift, it s up to you. But if you decide to keep living this way, go ahead. Over time, you may find yourself getting as sick as I did. After the documentary was released, McDonald s removed their  supersize  option, but continued to develop very unhealthy menu items. Rather than adapt to the progressive reforms and changing cultural landscape in America, McDonald s has the audacity to fight back. In July, the company is opening up a new restaurant in Missouri with Automated Kiosk Cashiers to phase out several workers from employment. The restaurant, often an only resort for low income Americans for food, is also offering bottomless French fries.The company is spending $1.59 million on the new restaurant to resemble fine dining. Today s customers seek a comfortable and inviting atmosphere,  the owner of the franchise restaurant, Chris Habiger, told the St Joseph News-Press.  So we re committed to providing a modern look and feel to this restaurant.  Mr. Habiger owns six other McDonald s franchise restaurants, which requires non-borrowed resources of $500,000 to even be considered by McDonald s to own a single franchise.While McDonald s workers across the United States have been fighting to earn a livable wage, in 2015 McDonald s CEO more than tripled his salary from $1.69 million in 2014 to $7.91 million in 2015; a 368 percent raise.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trump Supporter Holds Armed Anti-Muslim Rally, But Nobody Shows Up (IMAGES/VIDEO)","Donald Trump s bigoted anti-Muslim rhetoric has inspired his equally hateful followers to hold all sorts of bigotry-inspired events to show just how much they hate everyone who isn t a die hard right-wing Christian. Case in point- one Jim Stachowiak who held an armed, open carry event to protest Muslims at the Georgia Capitol, which he dubbed United against Islam and Islamic immigration refugee. He encouraged attendees to come bearing as many arms as they like, and their intended activities included ripping up photos of President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch, and the Prophet Mohammed. If that isn t offensive enough for you, Stachowiak also intended to rip up a Qu ran.This bigot s so-called rally was an epic fail, though. Guess how many people besides the rally s organizers showed up? ONE. Yep, you read that right. Only one person showed up to the hate rally, when originally there was going to be a supposed 200 people in attendance. The people at the Capitol took what Stachowiak was doing seriously, and rightly so, since Stachowiak is a known right-wing gun nut. According to The Daily Beast:The right-wing agitator has been calling on the government to  STOP MUSLIM IMMIGRATION  for years, loves brandishing his large firearms, and wants you to know that  JESUS CHRIST WAS NOT A PACIFIST. He also enjoys referring to himself as a well-armed, proud  crusader  and  infidel  against the forces of  Islam, and any other Satanic Death Cult that would destroy our Liberty. Capitol Police Chief Lewis G. Young warned people who would have the misfortune of having to work near this insane demonstration that rally participants would liked have a bunch of guns. His warning also said: DPS is currently monitoring the threat risk and, together with GBA, is taking precautions to make Capitol Hill a safe environment. However, it was all for naught, because there was, according the social media evidence, one lone idiot out there at the Capitol protesting Muslims by himself. Here are a couple of tweets documenting that:Anti-Muslim protest setting up. pic.twitter.com/fpgbrBQWOt  Aaron Gould Sheinin (@asheinin) April 18, 2016From today's rally: ""We're not Against Muslims"" says the man who destroyed a Qur'an just minutes earlier. #gapol pic.twitter.com/01wiw6pRwy  Robbie Medwed (@rjmedwed) April 18, 2016So, in other words, this fool was out there in the hot Georgia sun all by himself, letting everyone in attendance   him and a bunch of reporters   see just how hateful and batshit insane he really is. The only silver lining to this disgusting display of hate is that this moron couldn t find anyone to marinate in his hate with him.Featured image via video screen capture from Twitter",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Conservatives Can’t Believe Canadian PM Would Understand Science, Accuse Him Of Faking It","Canada s new liberal Prime Minister went viral after he deftly answered a question on the importance of quantum computing to a room full of reporters. For many, the ease with which he broke down the science was a testament to his intellect, his curiosity, and his interests in promoting science and technology. Unfortunately, for conservatives, any display of scientific literacy is immediately viewed as either elitism or fraud.Conservative writer J.J. McCullough went with the latter.In a piece on his blog breathlessly titled  The North Koreanification of Canadian political reporting,  he floated the idea that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s answer was a con job meant to make him look smart. Moreover, he accused the media of helping the prime minister stage  the quantum computing incident like propagandists out of North Korea.In the reporting that followed, the Canadian media deliberately and pointedly did not place Trudeau s verbal essay on quantum computing in the context in which it occurred. They instead chose to present the story in a fashion that would ensure maximum PR benefit to the prime minister   namely, this idea that Trudeau confidently called the bluff of a patronizing reporter.To put it another way, the Canadian media has actually reversed the realities of the story 180 degrees. What is being falsely presented as a story of a scrappy prime minister resisting a hostile press is actually a story of a slavishly subservient press who are actively shaping their reporting to suit the government s needs.This would all be completely eyeroll inducing if not for the fact that professional media contrarian sites like Gawker   usually so good at holding the spewers of nonsense accountable   instead quickly grabbed the narrative and ran with it. In writer J.K. Trotter s own breathlessly titled piece ( Justin Trudeau s Quantum Computing Explanation Was Likely Staged for Publicity ), he concurs that Trudeau s display of rudimentary understanding of quantum computing is impossible to explain if it weren t a vast media conspiracy.Somehow, we ve gotten to place where an interest in science and technology and a willingness to unabashedly share a love for it are considered negative character traits. We ve crossed an intellectual Rubicon and on the other shore aggressively ignorant anti-intellectuals like Ted Cruz are waiting for us with open arms. It s true that under a President Cruz, we would certainly never have to worry about having him explain quantum computing (or evolution, or climate change, or renewable energy), but is that supposed to be a good thing?It s worth noting that Trudeau s office vehemently denies the fact that the prime minister set up anything. The reporter who posed the original question to Trudeau also contacted Gawker to essentially tell them to screw off. If this is a conspiracy, it s an incredibly subtle one.But let s apply Occam s razor for a moment. Instead of a  North Koreanification  of the press, perhaps Trudeau s excitement in learning something new about a cutting-edge field of technology allowed him to understand and explain the science behind it. Perhaps he approached the researchers with legitimate questions and listened to their answers with legitimate interests. Perhaps what we saw during that interview was exactly what it looked like.

Currently, polls have Hillary Clinton ahead by ten to seventeen points. Clinton, who is ahead nationally by more than 200 pledged delegates and hundreds more superdelegates, will need to win her home state to continue momentum after Sanders  string of wins in the previous weeks.A New York win for Clinton will mean more delegates she desperately needs, and with that will come superdelegate support.But the superdelegates have continued to cause controversy within the Democratic primary. Supporters who back Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have decried the system, feeling the individuals who make up the superdelegate system have been manifestly unfair as to how they allocate their support.Supporters within the Sanders camp have demanded that the superdelegates vote the same way as the pledged   at the will of the voters for that state.But that isn t how the superdelegate system is set up (another word for superdelegates is unpledged delegates).However, that hasn t stopped the demands. And it hasn t stopped the harsh criticism, either. While these delegates have been regarded as  shills,   bought-and-paid-for  and  establishment, one superdelegate wants to remind the nay-sayers of one thing: they are still human.Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Congress  first openly-lesbian senator, is also a superdelegate. And she s pretty fed up with the inquisitions. On MSNBC s Morning Joe, the progressive senator claimed if Sanders clinches the popular vote by the time the convention is held in July, she will cast her vote for him. However, as Clinton continues her popular vote lead, she s supporting the former Secretary of State. She added, nervously: I am a human being and a Superdelegate. To put it plainly, based on how the rules are set up, Baldwin is free to vote her conscience, and her conscience says Hillary Clinton for now. Those who back Senator Sanders point to the fact he beat Clinton by 13 points in Wisconsin, thus Baldwin is somehow obligated to back him.It is important to remember that these superdelegates are party leaders who, in their own right, have been elected within the Democratic Party   whether it be a position within the DNC, or a senatorial, gubernatorial or representative position. It s also important to remember these delegates have nothing but the best of intentions for their party and the future of the country.Baldwin hasn t reported any harassment, but other superdelegates have (one s 12 year old child received the brunt of hrrasment when they answered the phone).Here s Baldwin s appearance on MSNBC:  Featured image via Astrid Riecken/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Baseball Players Who Called Obama ‘F*cking Watermelon Eatin Baboon’ Won’t Be Punished (IMAGES/VIDEO),"A group of Saint Louis University baseball players won t be punished after an insanely racist conversation they had amongst themselves became public. While it might seem that a group of students in a position to represent the school might face some form of discipline if they were to, say. call the President a  baboon,  reference multiple awful stereotypes about black people, and complain that a  colored  is running the country. Unfortunately, the school is continuing a proud American tradition almost as ancient as the sentiments these students were busted expressing: protecting sports teams from facing the music for their actions.Last May, the team traveled to Washington, D.C., where the conversation in a pitchers-only GroupMe chat swiftly went from  where do we eat  to  Donald Trump s Inner Thoughts. One player suggested the  KFC in the White House    you know, because all black people eat fried chicken (har har). Another helpfully added that  They got rivers of the grape kind there,  another reference to a popular African-American stereotype among stupid people. I heard they got a colored running the country,  someone else said.  This Tru?  Another player replied,  Unfortunately.. It is.  The asker responded,  F*cking watermelon eating baboon. and Luke Sommerfeld needed a MacBook charger.via DeadspinIt s unclear if Luke ever found his charger, but one thing is for certain   the pitchers on the Saint Louis University baseball team are a bunch of racist f*cks.One of the players texted a screenshot of the message to his roommate, former team manager Brendan Twomey, who held on to it for almost a year until his girlfriend saw it on her phone. Together, the two filed a complaint to the university. Deadspin gives a brief rundown of the events that transpired: The report was filed on April 4On April 5, Twomey and his girlfriend spoke to a university investigator.On April 11, after not having heard anything about the status of the investigation, Twomey and his girlfriend sent the image to the Black Student Alliance, who posted it to their Facebook page. Dr. Mona Hicks, SLU s Dean of Students, said there had been a miscommunication and a meeting to discuss the case was supposed to be held the next day.But, according to SLU s bias-related incident report log, the investigation had been closed on April 7 and labeled not applicable for discipline. When I received that screenshot, obviously I knew it was wrong, but I was in a tough situation because I didn t want to necessarily hurt anybody,  Twomey said as he explained his reasoning for holding onto the screenshot for so long. You become close [to the players] because you do spend so much time with them, so you overlook [that]. At the same time, I felt extremely disrespected. I knew there should be some sort of punishment, but I didn t know how to go about that,  he added.Asked about her decision to fail to punish her racist baseball players, Hicks was full of excuses. If I were to directly state to you,  You suck because of all of your social identities that God gave you.  That would be wrong. That would require some adjudication,  Hicks said in defense of giving her school s pitching rotation a pass on the horrible things they said.  We also need to respect laws. This was a private conversation, or at least the perception of private between in-group parties. Hicks did not explain what privacy laws were broken, though the answer to that is  none.  One of the players sent the screenshot to someone who showed it to someone else. No one hacked anyone, no one took someone s phone without permission. All of the information was given willingly. But, hey   she was trying to protect these students  right to privacy rather than avoiding a disruption of the season that might lead to the team failing to make it to the playoffs two years in a row (ultimately, they did not), right?Instead, the players  chose  to participate in a  facilitated dialogue  about what they did and the team s four captains wrote a letter to the school newspaper apologizing for that racist thing their teammates did: The leaders and captains of the team would like to extend an apology to anyone offended by the bias messages. We, too, are frustrated and feel that the comments do not accurately reflect the values that we hold. So far, the only person to face any real punishment is Twomey, who has been harassed since he blew the whistle on the players  racist conduct. The Riverfront Times reports:Two days later, Twomey says he awoke to discover his roommate had sloshed chewing tobacco spit on the floor outside his bedroom door, as well as the kitchen sink. Fingernail clippings had been prominently placed on the towel Twomey uses to clean his glasses.(In a Wednesday Facebook post from Pulphus, Twomey s roommate was identified as SLU pitcher Brett Shimanovsky   in fact, Shimanovsky appears to be the very same player/roommate who earlier provided Twomey with a screenshot of the racist chat thread. Twomey himself declined to answer questions about his roommate s identity, but says the roommate has since voluntarily moved out. Shimanovsky did not respond to a message seeking comment.) I consider this retaliation for filing a bias incident report,  Twomey says in a video documenting Shimanovsky s actions:Twomey says he is disappointed that the university has not in any way punished the players, whom he says should have been forced to miss a conference tournament (but that clearly was not an option in the eyes of the school, of course). He calls the captains   letter an  insult,  though he notes that the team s coach, Darin Hendrickson, did take the time to discuss the issue with him. He said he was aware there was a culture problem on the baseball team, a culture problem of entitlement, privilege and immaturity. He also said it was one of his biggest regrets that he hadn t recruited more diverse players,  Twomey recalled. He adds that there are  racial issues  that need to be confronted.It started a dialogue and frankly it needs to be continued,  the student says.  Hopefully, this issue will light a fire under the university and get them to really dedicate themselves to the SLU mission of diversity and inclusion.

 Criminalizing Childhood: Tennessee Cops Arrest 6-Year-Olds For Not Breaking Up A Fight,"When I was a kid, I watched a number of fights on the playground, in the school cafeteria and just on my block. This was true when I was in elementary school and it continued to be true all the way to when I was in high school. If you would have told me that I could be arrested for not breaking up the fight, I would have looked at you like you were certifiably insane.But that was before America decided that criminalizing childhood was a good idea:MURFREESBORO  More than 150 people called for action Sunday after parents said at least five students, ages 6 to 10, were handcuffed at Hobgood Elementary School on Friday.The students were arrested, accused of not stopping a fight that happened earlier off-campus and later released from the juvenile center on FridayThese were not kids that participated in the fight, they just watched it happen and were arrested for it. Think about that for a moment: a 6-year-old child was HANDCUFFED for not breaking up a fight. What did the police think this kid was going to do? Attack them? What kind of thought process leads a grown man to handcuff an elementary school student? Even worse, what kind of society ALLOWS a grown man to handcuff an elementary school student and not immediately fire them as a danger to the public?But back to the flawed premise behind the arrest. I happen to have a 6-year-old of my own and she has a fairly forceful personality, but the idea of her leaping into a fight to break it up is ludicrous. She s 6! And even if she d been 10, when did it become a legal obligation for kids to break up a fight they re not involved in? Don t the police have anything better to do with their time than turn little children into criminals?The icing on the cake was arresting them at the school in front of their classmates. Because leading a 6-year-old out of school in handcuffs can t possibly leave any long-term mental scars, right? Again, we as a society allow this to happen.This is the direct result of a fundamentally broken law enforcement culture. They no longer see communities as made up of people, they only see potential criminals. It seems that the thinking is, if you get them into the system when they re young, you ll have an easier time throwing them in jail later. Never mind that most of the cops involved almost certainly watched a fist fight as a kid, or got into one themselves, it s criminal behavior these days.Oh, and you ll be absolutely shocked to know that the community this occurred in is .you guessed it: Mostly African-American. Because when little Timmy watches a fight, it s just boys being boys. But little Leroy? He s a goddamn criminal and needs to be taught a lesson!With this kind of ongoing behavior, the police are hard at work creating an entire generation of (mostly minority) children that fear and loathe them. And then the cops have the gall to rage at the Black Lives Matter movement? Unbelievable.Featured image via Getty",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Was The Secret To Donald Trump’s Hair Just Found Along The Shores Of Norway? (VIDEO),"There s an age-old question that has been haunting the American people for several decades now   is Donald Trump s hair real? And if it is real, how does it do what is does? And if it isn t real, where does he get it from?Well, folks, we may finally have our answer. It looks as though a Donald Trump  wig farm  has been spotted along the coastline of Troms , Norway. And of course he would outsource his hair to another country   what a hypocrite.Just kidding! The  hair  is actually just a form of bunch grass, but the resemblance to whatever that is on top of Trump s head is remarkably uncanny.There s currently a ridiculously hilarious video making the rounds from VGTV out of Norway that has been asking this hair-raising question. They, of course, explain what it actually is you are seeing, but the video itself it pretty damn gut-busting as they super-impose video and images of Trump defending himself over and over, telling people his hair is, in fact, real. Although, with as much lying as the Republican front-runner has been doing lately, who knows, really?Let s just say this is a nice break in the monotony of the insane that we ve had to endure for the past few months.Enjoy!Watch the silly video explaining it all here:Featured image via video screen capture  Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ted Cruz Is Forced To Explain His Bigotry To Gay Republican On National Television, It Didn’t Go Well (VIDEO)","A gay man cornered Ted Cruz on Monday and the Republican presidential candidate couldn t handle the simple question posed to him.During a forum on ABC s Good Morning America hosted by Robin Roberts, an openly gay Republican restaurant owner concerned about so-called  religious liberty  laws being passed by states like North Carolina and Mississippi asked Cruz how he would protect LGBT people from discrimination if he were to become president. I ve noticed a lot of religious freedom laws and somewhat institutionalized discrimination laws happening around the country. What would you as president do to protect me and my husband?  Todd Calogne directly asked.And Cruz didn t waste time going into spin-mode.The Texas Senator claimed that the anti-LGBT laws  protects everyone  even though they blatantly allow business owners to discriminate against LGBT customers and employees by shielding their bigotry with the Bible under the guise of religious freedom. Religious liberty, it applies to Jews, it applies to Christians, it applies to Muslims, it applies to atheists,  Cruz said even though he has repeatedly stated his intention to violate the religious liberty of Muslims and atheists. Also, being gay isn t a religion, it s a sexual orientation. And all of us, we want to live in a world where we don t have the government dictating our beliefs, dictating how we live,  Cruz continued.  We have a right to live according to our faith, according to our conscience. And we shouldn t have a right to force others to give up their faith and give up their belief. And I think that keeping government out of the way of your lives protects the freedom of every one of us. Cruz dodged Calogne s question but Robin Roberts didn t let him get away with it. A lot of people would say, doesn t everyone have the freedom to be treated equally?  she asked.  Don t we all have the freedom to be equal? Of course we do,  Cruz flat-out lied to the faces of every American watching. Cruz then declared that  the First Amendment protects everyone equally, it protects our faith  before launching into how he intends to push for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, which finally gave Calogne the answer he had been waiting for. Under the Constitution, marriage is a question for the states. And so if someone wants to change the marriage laws, I don t think it should be five unelected lawyers down in Washington dictating that. If you want to change the marriage law, convince your fellow citizens to change the laws. In other words, Cruz would NOT protect the rights of gay people as president. He would strip rights from them and treat them like second-class citizens.Here s the video via ABC: ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos Religious liberty  laws like those in North Carolina and Mississippi allow anti-gay business owners to openly discriminate against gay people. It s legalized bigotry similar to the kind experienced by black people in the 1960s during segregation. And Republicans are literally hiding behind religion to justify and protect their bigotry.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bad News, Republicans: Two Scholars Figured Out How To Defeat Your Gerrymandering","Named for Founding Father Elbridge Gerry who signed a law in 1812 as Massachusetts Governor creating distorted voting districts in shapes such as that of a salamander, gerrymandering has been the primary tool of the Republican Party to guarantee and keep power in recent years.Despite getting more votes from the American people, Democrats still wound up with fewer seats in the House of Representatives than Republicans. Republicans even gained dominance over state legislatures in Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, and several others   all thanks to deviously drawn voting districts that weaken the impact of Democratic voters while giving a total advantage to the GOP.Twelve years ago, the Supreme Court had difficulty deciding whether districts in Pennsylvania had been gerrymandered or not, leading Justice Anthony Kennedy to throw his hands up in frustration that the Court could not grant relief to those who were screwed over by conniving lawmakers. But he did call for seeking a remedy that would nail lawmakers to the wall for gerrymandering. And now Wisconsin Republicans and Republicans across the nation are panicking because a pair of academic scholars have finally found a solution and it all has to do with the nemesis of conservatives everywhere: math.According to ThinkProgress:In a paper published in the University of Chicago Law Review last year, law professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos and political scientist Eric McGhee propose a mathematical formula judges can use to identify suspect maps  an objective test that can be used by judges across the country to sort suspect maps from permissible ones. A hundred different judges can examine the same maps and, provided that they are all skilled at arithmetic, all reach identical conclusions about which maps fall within an acceptable range and which ones should be presumed to be unconstitutional.In other words, Republicans are f*cked if the Supreme Court adopts the formula to make rulings in gerrymandering cases.Wisconsin Republicans have launched legal attacks against the formula, but a three judge panel that includes two Republican-appointed judges have dismissed attempts by GOP lawyers to have the case killed before a full trial proceeds.If the formula is successfully adopted by the judicial branch as the standard of determining if lawmakers unfairly drew gerrymandered districts, it could mark a critical turning point that gives Democrats a chance to compete fairly in red states again, and that could devastate the Republican Party for many elections to conservative lawmakers will have to learn how to campaign competitively instead of relying on cheating to win.

 John Kasich Decides To Say EVEN WORSE Things About Rape Victims (VIDEO),"There was once a time that John Kasich seemed like the only sane, somewhat reasonable Republican candidate in the presidential race, but those days are long gone. Kasich is starting to sound more and more like Trump and Cruz as time goes on.It was just a few days ago that Kasich said that if women wanted to avoid being raped, they should just not go to parties where there is alcohol. He of course experienced tons of backlash for that comment, but instead of apologizing and admitting that it was a victim-blaming, insensitive remark, he s doubled down instead.In a Sunday morning interview on CNN s State of the Union, Kasich made an attempt to rectify his controversial comments, and ended up making it much worse. In trying to explain his misogynistic reasoning, Kasich said that having alcohol at a party makes it more difficult for justice to be rendered for a whole variety of reasons. Host Dana Bash tried to give Kasich another chance and pressed him further, but the Ohio governor just simply couldn t grasp why his comments would be so controversial or problematic. Bash was generous and even explained to the presidential hopeful that his comments would discourage women from reporting their assaults if they re told that the presence of alcohol makes their story less valid or believable. But Kasich once again failed to understand and continued to dig himself into a deeper hole. He said: Actually, I don t know how anybody would take it that way. Bash answered,  Because it s taken a while to change the stigma of getting people to come out. Kasich, apparently forgetting that the infamous, tragic Steubenville rape case took place in Ohio, shot back: Dana, I have led the way in the country to fight this and to get justice served in these conditions. I think even if, in fact, there is alcohol involved, you still have   you still can find the perpetrator. I just don t want justice to be denied because something comes up that a prosecutor looks at it and says, well, I can t figure this thing out. And no matter what Bash countered back with, Kasich had an equally offensive answer.Certainly, Kasich s speech would be much more effective in preventing sexual assaults if he told potential rapists to avoid alcohol at parties instead of victims. But, you know, that s just not the GOP s style.

 Nate Silver Forecasts An Easy Win For Hillary Clinton In New York,"New York is critical for both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders but only one of them seems poised for a big win. The other is predicted to suffer a serious setback in one of the few remaining states with a large delegate count.As of Sunday, the polling shows Donald Trump crushing Ted Cruz and John Kasich with 52 percent of the vote while Hillary Clinton Leads Bernie Sanders with 57.2 percent of the vote. If these numbers hold up, that will give Clinton an additional 39 delegates over Sanders, expanding her lead from 206 to 245.It s important to make note of this in advance because the last several races that Clinton has won have been met with howls of  election fraud.  Aside from the sour grapes aspect, this constant drumbeat of alleged  cheating  is a shallow attempt to delegitimize Clinton as a candidate. Republicans have been doing it to President Obama for years and it should be condemned as the shameful tactic it is.Regardless, there are a few obvious reasons that Hillary is poised for an easy win. First, New York is a primary state, not a caucus state. While Hillary has under-preformed in caucuses, on average, she s seriously over-preformed in primaries. In essence, the more people that vote, the better Hillary does. A hard fact to swallow but a fact nonetheless.Second, New York is a closed primary, meaning only registered Democrats can vote. This has been a source of outrage among Independents who have demanded the  right  to vote for the Democratic nominee. This, of course, begs the question of why people who chose not to join the party should have the  right  to dictate who that party selects as the nominee. If you think the answer is  democracy,  allow me to point out that caucuses exclude people that cannot spend 2-3 hours on a weeknight voting for a candidate. In terms of participation, millions vote in primaries while only thousands vote in caucuses.Glass houses and all that.Third, and most importantly, New York is a demographically diverse state that closely resembles the racial makeup of the Democratic Party as a whole. In states where Democratic voters are overwhelmingly white, Sanders has a strong  advantage. Everywhere else? Not so much. Here s an interesting data set for you to digest: In November, it s expected that about 54 percent of Democratic voters will be white, 24 percent will be black, 11 percent will be Latino and 7 percent will be Asian/everything else.In the Southern states where the majority of Democratic voters are black, Clinton crushed Sanders. Conversely, in states where the overwhelming majority of Democratic voters are white, Sanders crushed Clinton. Neither of these group of states is particularly representative of the Democratic Party so neither is a good predictor for more evenly mixed states.But, when you look at the 20 states most closely aligned with the demographic makeup of the party, you find an abundance of good news for Clinton: Of the 12 states that have voted, Hillary lost one by a hair, won two by a tiny margin, tied in another and utterly dominated the rest   5 of them by 29 points or more.Take a look:Even better for Clinton, all of the remaining states with large delegate counts are part of those 20. New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California represent 1,132 of the reaming 1,647 delegates. In order to close the significantly large delegate gap, Bernie can t just win those states, he has to win them big. But they re all closed primaries except for California. And even then, of the 18 open primaries/caucuses held so far, Hillary s won 11 of them so California dreaming is not much comfort to the Sanders campaign.And just to top it all off, Hillary is dominating the polls in all five states, anyway.It s possible that one or two of those states will have a Michigan style upset but considering how historically wrong the polling was going into that election, it seems more than a little more unlikely that we ll be seeing more of that. Does this mean Clinton voters should be complacent? Hellllll no. The more she wins by, the stronger her position and the longer her coattails will be going into the general election. Eyes on the prize.Everything else is just noise.Featured image via Eric Thayer/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 4 Insanely Great Ways One Idea From Obama Just Made Life Amazing For Millions Of Americans,"The New York Times has done a major new study on the effects of the Affordable Care Act   aka Obamacare   on the lives of Americans. The Times analyzed what happened in the first full year of the implementation of Obamacare between 2013 and 2014, and the results are mind-blowing in how they ve fundamentally altered the lives of some of the most vulnerable Americans for the better.The first full year of the Affordable Care Act brought historic increases in coverage for low-wage workers and others who have long been left out of the health care system, a New York Times analysis has found.Remember, Obamacare passed without a single Republican vote in the House or Senate, and has survived two Supreme Court challenges and other court challenges made up by the obstructionist Right. The last Republican presidential nominee ran on a platform of repealing it, and so has every GOP presidential candidate running this year.Obamacare has also survived dozens of Republican votes to repeal it, while six years later the GOP has still not offered a plan to replace it.After the passage of Obamacare, the amount of people insured in every slice of America went up in a major way. Between 2013 and 2014, this is how much those increases were, as a percentage:For decades the gap between the wealthy and poor on access to health care has been steadily growing wider and wider. But after the passage of Obamacare, that gap has stopped growing. It s the one area where inequality has actually been halted in its tracks:Nevertheless, the Times s analysis shows that by the end of that first full year, 2014, so many low-income people gained coverage that it halted the decades-long expansion of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in the American health insurance system, a striking change at a time when disparities between rich and poor are growing in many areas.Here s an infographic from the Times illustrating this amazing moment in American health care: Policies like Obamacare are just abstract ideas until they are implemented. But now we have one concrete example of what happens in just one city thanks to Obamacare. The St. John s Well Child and Family Center in South Los Angeles explained that 18,000 new patients were enrolled thanks to the new law   mostly black and Latino people who didn t have insurance before. The clinic has reported a 44% increase in cervical cancer screenings, 25% increase in tobacco cessastion therapy, and a 22% increase in the share of patients who now have their hypertension under control.That s in one clinic in one city.All of these improvements have happened even though Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid in many of their states, even with assistance in the form of federal dollars. That s why the law has helped far fewer blacks than it could have because blacks, especially in the south, tend to live in GOP-dominated states like Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi.Imagine if instead of stubbornly refusing to help Obama, those red states bought in and brought the kind of health care revolution being felt in that Los Angeles clinic to hundreds of thousands more people?Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 18, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Is Now Threatening A Lawsuit Over Copyright Violation Of His Penis (IMAGE),"The artist who painted a nude portrait of Donald Trump might be landing in a bit of hot water, due to the fact that Trump is now threatening lawsuits over the artist s work.Ilma Gore, the artist who painted the famous nude portrait of Trump, has been getting threats from Trump s legal team of impending lawsuits   plus they are also issuing Digital Millenium Copyright claims against her via Facebook. Facebook has actually been conceding to the claims and they have also warned her of legal action under the same premise.Think about it. Out of the oodles and oodles of Trump pictures online, the only one he can file copyright over is one showing his wiener.This means that Trump actually is claiming copyright on his penis. Let s think about that for just about five seconds or so Special note: The size of the pixelation is in no way indicative of the size of anything it may or may not be hiding.Ms. Gore told the New York Daily News,  I don t believe I did anything wrong. It s my work and I ll stand by it no matter what. Once the image hit the internet, it went instantly viral and has gotten bids for over  100,000 after it went on display this month in London at the Maddox Gallery.As hilarious as this is, for obvious reasons, Ilma Gore has had some very serious blowback that isn t funny at all.Ms. Gore also said that since the image of the painting hit the internet, she has also been receiving many threats of rape, death threats, and had to deal with several stalkers at her home. It s typical of a Trump supporter, or even just your average Republican   when a woman does something to make you angry, threaten her with physical violence, terrorism, and death. At least Trump s supporters are an accurate depiction of the man.The portrait got a big boost in publicity due to an unexpected development during the Republican primary season. Ms. Gore painted the portrait in February, but not long after that Trump started bragging about the size of his manhood during presidential debates. You literally couldn t buy a better publicizing platform for your work than that.As I see it, Trump has two options here. He can either claim the painting is defamation by visually proving in court that it misrepresents his genitalia in some disparaging way, or he can enforce copyright by proving it s identical. So, what s it gonna be, Donald?Featured image via Ilma Gore",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz Used #ScienceFacts Hashtag And Instantly Became Laughingstock Of Scientific Community,"Sen. Ted Cruz, a man whose climate science expertise extends no further than his ability to hold his arm out a window to see if it s raining, tried to troll Democrats by proving climate change was wrong in a single tweet   and it backfired massively.A vehement denier of climate change who once claimed he was just like Galileo because both held unpopular opinions (*eyeroll*) and who accused the 97% of scientists who say climate change is real of being liars, Cruz caused considerable damage to America s scientific community while he was in the Senate. Now he is poised to be in the White House, where he could downright derail it.With those stakes in mind, over the weekend the Democratic Party s Twitter account took a dig at Cruz for brushing off the idea that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming.Yesterday Ted Cruz said that ""carbon dioxide isn't a pollutant."" Someone needs to go back to science class  pic.twitter.com/cTp3QBxa2X  The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) April 16, 2016Cruz, whose philosophy appears to be  Well if I m already in a hole, I may as well dig,  immediately fired back with of a tweet of his own.Dems kill jobs, ignore facts. CO2 is what every human breathes out; every plant, in turn,consumes CO2. #ScienceFacts https://t.co/0eESF2Oz08  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) April 16, 2016To which the scientific community responded in unison:  You can t be that stupid, can you? Cruz may not be an avid reader, but even a quick google search can debunk his premise conclusively. In an article published in Scientific American in 2014 and aptly titled  The Worst Climate Pollution Is Carbon Dioxide , writer Gayathri Vaidyanathan walks us through the reasons why: as far as climate change goes, the gas that truly matters is carbon dioxide. Unlike its shorter-lived cousins, CO2 sticks around in the atmosphere for decades to centuries, wreaking climate havoc. It has become very clear that if you want to stabilize warming at any level, you have to start talking about phasing out CO2,  said Joeri Rogelj, a research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and lead author of the study.  Reducing other climate pollution can help in different ways and for different things, but in climate stabilization terms, it s noise on the fact that you have to phase out CO2. Here s a simpler experiment Ted can do in his own home. Take a blanket. Put the blanket over your head. Breathe in and out. Notice how it starts to not feel great? Now imagine that on a planetary scale. Too much CO2 can be a disaster and it wouldn t be a great place to live.The always on point science writer for Slate, Phil Plait, tackled this exact climate denier myth just a few months ago on his blog. CO2, so the deniers say, is harmless because it s just what we breathe out, and isn t carbon what all life is based around? How can that be bad?This is nonsense, says Plait:This is a stunning statement. Like most denier talking points, there s a germ of truth to it the carbon in living tissue does come in large part from atmospheric CO2 but to say that means it can t be a pollutant is pretty silly.For example, our bodies produce formaldehyde naturally; it s a byproduct of the metabolic process. Yet the Center for Disease Control and Prevention classifies it as a pollutant. Why? Because too much of it under the wrong conditions is a bad thing.As ever, Cruz managed to be both wrong and smug at the same time. He s not just ignorant, he s proud of it.Why does this matter?As you may have noticed, last October was the hottest October ever recorded. So was November. So was December. So was January. So was February. So was March. Climate change isn t just theoretically possible, it s happening now and more quickly than many scientists ever dared worry it would. This means the time for action is already here. President Obama has done several key things to help America play catch up on the war against climate change. First he dumped tons of money into researching alternative energy and America is finally getting serious about solar and wind power. But perhaps most significantly of all, we are beginning to work with other countries around the world to globally combat the worst effects.This all goes away with Ted Cruz. A President Cruz not only doesn t believe climate change is worth fighting, he doesn t believe it exists. For four to eight years, America will rollback and dismantle the progress it has made at this crucial time. What this means for the future is the stuff of nightmares.But on the bright side, if our cities are flooded and our crops are failing at least President Cruz can provide us have plenty of good, healthy carbon.Featured image via Darren Hauck/Getty Images ",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Polls Show The World Overwhelmingly Loves President Obama (IMAGE),"Pew Research Center, which conducts not just domestic but also international polls, released their newest findings with regards to President Obama and how the world sees him (more specifically, their confidence in him that he will do the right thing).Not surprisingly, it turns out that most of the world loves our president and has the utmost confidence in him. Take that, Republicans who call him  weak  in the eyes of the world.After gathering information from 40 states across six continents, a median of 65 percent say they have confidence in Obama to do the right thing and 27 percent do not.These are the top 10 countries that have the highest rating for President Obama:The president s  approval rating  has also skyrocketed in India, from a dismal 48 percent in 2014 to 74 percent now. The lowest approval rating Obama has in Africa is 65 percent, but it is important to remember African citizens loved President Bush as well.When President Bush left the White House in January 2009, western European confidence in America s president reached an all-time low, with some countries giving W. less than 10 percent approval. Today, western Europe remains inspired by our nation s president (unless you count Russia, where only 11 percent approve of him).Although the president has seen a slightly lower approval rating recently than when he entered the presidency in 2009, it should be noted that besides his sharp decline with Russia, he also has drastically declined in Israel. Just last year, his approval rating was a soaring 71 percent (Republicans ignored this while accusing him of hating Israel), and this year his approval rating has fallen to 49 percent.So Israel isn t too thrilled with him and Russia absolutely despises him. Other than that, the world loves him. In the U.S., the poll found that 58 percent of Americans feel he can do the right thing and have confidence in his ability to do so. Not too shabby considering (yet again), Republicans say the people hate him. The only other countries that seem to have no confidence in him are Jordan, Pakistan, Venezuela,  the Palestinian Territory, and Argentina.If the world loves President Obama, I can only imagine how much they ll love Bernie or Hillary.America, let s not wreck our standing internationally   for God s sake, we don t need President Trump coming in and making the world hate us (again).

 ‘God Is Gay’: SNL Destroys ‘Religious Freedom’ Laws In HILARIOUS Mock Film Promo (VIDEO),"What would you do if a gay couple requested that you bake a cake for them? Probably bake it because you re not a bigot, but what if you were? Would you take your battle to court? Would you fight for a legal right to discriminate? Well, Saturday Night Live takes us on the journey of one bigoted baker s fight to prove that  God is a boob man  and would not approve of gay cakes.This absolutely brilliant parody film promo points out the utter absurdity of the anti-LGBT laws so many states have put forward, and they went about it the most hilariously honest way possible.Those seeking legislated discrimination seem to think that the LGBT community wants special rights and privileges by just ordering cakes from bakers, or that they want everyone to think that  God is gay  as pointed out in this video. These bigots fail to see that they re not the ones being persecuted, but rather the ones doing the persecuting.LGBT money doesn t have cooties, despite what anyone may have previously told you. In fact, it spends just the same, and many gay couples often have a lot of it to spend since they re often dual income with no kids.Kudos to SNL for hitting the nail on the head with this video. It s probably one of the funniest things they ve ever put out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDDAa1If-u4Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 TV Host Rips Anti-Gay Christian Leader To Shreds For Using Religion To Excuse Bigotry (VIDEO),"If you want to watch an anti-gay conservative  Christian  squirm as he is torn to pieces by a TV host, this will make your day.In North Carolina and Mississippi, Republicans have passed anti-LGBT laws under the guise of religious liberty allowing business owners to discriminate against customers and employees.Other red states such as South Carolina and Tennessee are also trying to push similar bills into law, some of which allow discrimination against not just gay people, but also interracial couples and people who have pre-marital sex as long as the bigot claims that they have a sincere religious belief.Basically these so-called  religious liberty  laws are similar to the kind that were used during the 1960s when white business owners refused service to black people. Now states in the South are trying to legalize discrimination again by dubiously tying it to religious freedom.And when Family Research Council President Tony Perkins attempted to defend the laws, he got his ass handed to him for that very reason.Perkins argued that the laws were all about protecting public safety even though there is not a single example of a trans person sexually assaulting a woman or a child in the bathroom in the 17 states and over 200 cities across the nation that have passed anti-discrimination ordinances to protect the LGBT community.Perkins also stated that the laws are necessary to protect Christian business owners who refuse to serve LGBT people. Matter of Fact host Fernando Espuelas didn t hesitate to call out Perkins for spewing bullshit to excuse bigotry and hate. The idea that someone who has a business license can then discriminate against one group or another is something that was put to rest in the 1960s,  Espuelas correctly pointed out.Perkins then played the slavery card to claim that business owners who have to serve gay people are being forced to be servants. We re talking about forcing someone to take their creative ability, their talent and force them. This is almost forced servitude, saying that you have to be a part of this or the state is going to punish you. The problem is that nobody is asking the business owner for approval, only services that are paid for with money. Discriminating against customers because they are gay is a violation of civil rights. Espuelas didn t back down.  That s essentially the same argument as segregation,  he replied to Perkins.Perkins and Espuelas then proceeded to debate the bigoted laws further, with Espuelas masterfully countering Perkins at every turn.Perkind began by bringing up marriage and how it is a religious institution even though marriage existed long before organized religion. In fact, the early Christian church was hostile toward marriage. We re talking about marriage,  Perkins said.  That is a sacred institution. Just three years ago the president had the same view. But he didn t have the view that people should be discriminated against,  Espuelas replied before defining discrimination for Perkins.  How is it not discrimination if you pick one group, a specific group of people and have different rights for them? How is that not discrimination? No one can deny that marriage is a religious ceremony,  Perkins claimed even though history says otherwise.  And you re forcing someone to violate their beliefs. Perkins went on to claim that nobody is trying to prohibit gay people from getting married even though that s exactly what conservatives have been trying to do and are still trying to do despite the Supreme Court ruling last summer. Perkins said that gay people can simply hire a different photographer or cake baker if the photographer or baker they want refuses to serve them.Perkins said refusal of service is not discrimination, however, that s exactly what it is and Espuelas once again called him out for supporting legalized discrimination. No, and it s very clear, and the reason why you support is why? You support it because specifically these laws allow businesses to discriminate against gay people. Because you have a point of view regarding it. It allows people to live out their religious freedom,  Perkins desperately responded, telling Espuelas that religion shouldn t be kept out of the free market and that they should be allowed to refuse service at will and use religion as an excuse.Here s the video via YouTube:The problem is that Perkins is talking about a slippery slope. Because it s likely Perkins would whine like a petulant child and cry discrimination if an atheist or Muslim business owner refused service to a Christian customer. The outcry would ring out from every conservative corner of the nation. That s why these bills are really only meant to give Christian business owners the right to discriminate, which violates the Constitution because laws are not supposed to favor one religion over another. And the hypocrisy would be prominently pointed out by everyone who has criticized these  religious freedom  bills from the start as the bigoted unconstitutional bills they are.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 What Bill O’Reilly Just Said About Women Proves He’s A Certified A**hole (VIDEO),"Bill O Reilly has said some ridiculous things on his show over the years and his so-called conservatism has translated into outright bigotry and nonsense in many cases. That tradition continued with yet another nonsensical statement, this time about women. Watch the video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za05IPc8F-U]It all started with O Reilly s interpretation of what Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton said during the Democratic debates on the issue of abortion, believing that  both candidates say they want few limits on abortion.  During an interview with Fox News analyst Kirsten Powers, O Reilly said: If you are going to say that the two Democrats running for president both favor pretty much abortion at any time, for any reason, and they hide behind the women s health issue, but that could be a migraine headache, you know. OK, I don t want to have the kid, my boyfriend left me, my husband left me, whatever it may be, I got a migraine, kid is going to be born next week. Let s get- Powers interrupted, saying,  I don t think that many people get abortions because they have a migraine headache. O Reilly continued: OK, it doesn t matter. It s theoretical. When you have two candidates saying they don t want any limitations in the law place, they don t want any. That can happen. And we know what happened in Kansas, did that big investigation on Tiller you know what happened there. And so that s so radical and so far away from what the American people want. That s just one example. O Reilly has proven himself to lack any credibility whatsoever and his male privilege is disturbing to watch. When will people learn that a woman has a right to choose? After all, in the end, it s the woman s body and O Reilly s nonsense is typical of males believing they have authority over a woman s body as well as her choices.I m looking forward to the day when this guy s show gets cancelled.Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Is Now Officially Increasing The Chance Of A Nuclear Incident According To This Report,"Republicans aren t very smart about a lot of things, but one of their most unfortunate mental deficits is in their awareness of what they sound like to the rest of the world. Whether they simply are too dumb to know, or they just don t care, the way they portray America to the rest of the world is a damned embarrassment to the nation.One of the worst sources of this global shame is easily Donald Trump, for obvious reasons. His stupidity, empty talk, hate and chest beating are dragging us back to pre-Obama levels of global ridicule. However, now things are taking a departure from simple mockery and turning into a serious international incident.North Korea is now using Trump s rhetoric regarding nuclear proliferation, and the fact thath e is actually advocating using them, as justification for not backing down on their nuclear program. This is the same North Korea that only about a month ago wanted to have their nuclear weapons ready to fire at a moment s notice, and promised to expand their arsenal.Ri Jong Ryul, deputy-director general of the Institute of International Studies in Pyongyang had this to say: Donald Trump s remarks are totally absurd and illogical. The U.S. tells us to give up our nuclear program, is preparing a nuclear attack against us, and on the other hand would tell its allies to have nuclear weapons. Isn t this (a) double standard? Source: CNNNorth Korea was difficult enough to deal with on their best days. Now, they hear a person that could be the Presidential nominee of the most war-loving political party in modern American history advocating for more nuclear weapons to be developed, as well as the actual use of them against nations like North Korea. Perhaps one day Republicans will understand that people outside of the U.S. also do listen to our politics, but sadly that doesn t seem to be today.Featured image via Mother Jones",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 George Clooney Has A VERY Specific Reason Why He’s Supporting Hillary (VIDEO),"When running for President of the United States it s important to remember that you can t get anything you want to get done accomplished alone. Having great ideas means nothing if you don t have a Congress to back you up. That s why it s so incredibly important to make sure that we not only get a Democrat in the White House, but also turn the Senate and House of Representatives blue.With that in mind, there is really only one candidate running for president on the Democratic ticket that is taking this into account, and that person is Hillary Clinton. While Sanders is clearly out-raising Clinton in small donations, which is amazing in and of itself, in the first quarter alone of 2016, Hillary has brought in $15 million for the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties to make sure Democrats win across the board.Knowing how important it is to have a Democratic Congress to get anything done is actor/activist/philanthropist George Clooney. He fully recognizes that Bernie Sanders has it right that we need to get big money out of politics, but that he has it wrong when it comes to doing little to support down-ticket candidates. Only recently has Sanders begun raising money for congressional candidates, and only for those who have endorsed him.On Meet the Press, Clooney told host Chuck Todd why it s so important to also raise money for down-ticket Democratic races: It s going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress. And the reason that s important, and the reason it s important to me, is because we need   I m a Democrat. So if you re a Republican, you re going to disagree, but we need to take the Senate back. Clooney also made the very important point of noting that we need to take back Congress so that we can actually get a Supreme Court Justice who will help overturn Citizens United and get big money out of politics. So while yes, he did agree with Sanders that we need to get big money out, it s not going to happen unless there is support of Democrats nationwide, including monetarily. Keep in mind, Clooney remarks that what Sanders has to say is very important, including that he really likes the Vermont Senator, and if he were to get the nomination he will do whatever he can to get him elected, but as for now, he s supporting Hillary.Party strength is, quite literally, everything. Without it, you have nothing. You have a mighty platform to say things, but no means to get anything done. Those who seek to divide the Democratic party don t realize how dreadfully horrific their unintended consequences will be. That sort of myopic thinking, while in an ideal world would make no difference, it very clearly does in modern-day politics, and it s not about to change overnight.Kudos to Clooney for making this point be clearly known, and also for voting blue no matter who.Here s the video:Featured photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Punish Georgia Governor For Refusing To Legalize Anti-LGBT Bigotry,"Georgia conservatives really wanted to enshrine their hate and bigotry into law under the guise of religious liberty, and because their governor refused to do so they are punishing him.Unlike the Republican governors of North Carolina and Mississippi, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal refused to sign the anti-LGBT bill passed by the GOP-controlled legislature. Deal mulled over the bill while witnessing the economic backlash similar bills are causing other states.In North Carolina alone, corporations are threatening to leave or have cancelled plans to expand into the state, resulting in the loss of hundreds of jobs and money that could have sparked economic growth. Furthermore, the state also faces the loss of federal dollars. Mississippi is facing the same backlash and South Carolina has also suffered the loss of a corporate headquarters for just introducing the bill.Georgia certainly faced the same consequences. Disney and Marvel threatened to stop filming movies in the state and other corporations and businesses urged the governor to veto the bill.Realizing that the economic backlash was not worth it, Governor Deal vetoed HB 757. He angered conservatives but saved the economy of his state from ruin.But those conservatives were looking forward to being able to use their Bibles as a shield so they can discriminate against anyone they please.And so, they decided to send a message to Republicans and any Republican who sits in the governor s mansion in the future that not doing what they want is unacceptable and will be punished.Despite being urged not to do so, conservatives of the Georgia Third District voted overwhelmingly to censure Deal. According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution: Though it is purely symbolic, it s a startling sign of the conservative backlash to Deal s decision to reject the legislation   and another reminder that the debate over the measure never really ended. A censure is a formal statement of severe disapproval, which means Republicans literally just punished Deal publicly for refusing to support a bigoted policy supported by conservatives in his state.It s basically a warning shot to other Republicans that they better not veto future efforts to legalize discrimination in Georgia or they too could be censured or worse.This is why Republicans made a huge mistake by letting extremists have a mainstream seat at the party table. Because now they are beholden to do as the extremists desire or else.Featured image via  YouTube",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Rolling Stone released a six part interview the rapper conducted with Senator Sanders in December 2015. The rapper has introduced him at several campaign events, campaigned on behalf of Bernie Sanders, and participated in several other video discussions including a forum with Dr. Cornel West, Nina Turner, and Bernie Sanders on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in January 2016.After backlash in February alleging Killer Mike was sexist for remarks he made in quoting Jane Elliot, the rapper has focused more on his music career.Next week, Bernie Sanders supporters are putting on  Berniechella  in the same city Coachella is being held.

 Lewandowski To Fox News: Apologizing To The Reporter I Assaulted Is ‘Unrealistic’,"Corey Lewandowski got some good news last week when the state s attorney for Palm Beach, Florida announced that he was dropping the charges against him and is now saying he is ready to move on. But don t expect Trump s abusive campaign manager to admit he did something wrong or apologize for it.Lewandowski appeared on Fox News Sunday, and Chris Wallace asked if he had any intention of apologizing to Michelle Fields: In the interest of avoiding unnecessary litigation, which I know Republicans don t like, are you prepared here and now to apologize to Ms. Fields for touching her and for saying that she was delusioned? The campaign manager responded exactly the way you d expect Trump s right-hand man to respond: Here and now I d like to say I ve never spoken to Ms. Fields. I turned over my phone records to the Palm Beach County district attorney s office. It clearly shows I called her phone number that evening [after] I read about this on the Twitter feed. I d be happy to have a conversation with her. But to apologize to somebody I ve never spoken to and candidly don t remember ever having any interaction with is something that is a little unrealistic right now. He added,  This is a person I ve never spoken to and I d be happy to have that conversation if we can put this thing behind us. Just like his boss, Lewandowski is incapable of admitting that he was wrong. He still refuses to apologize to the woman he assaulted and called names even though there is video evidence proving he did it. He, like Trump, thinks that he can just walk through life and do whatever he wants without ever suffering any consequences and unfortunately, Palm Beach prosecutors reaffirmed this by not pursuing the charges.Ms. Fields has likely had her career ruined, while this jackass gets to proceed as if nothing happened.

 Texas Teen Fatally Shoots Himself 5 Days After NRA-Recommended Gun Safety Course (VIDEO),"According to the NRA, we have nothing to fear from gun-toting individuals who have completed a safety course. There is no way, if properly trained, that they can present a danger to themselves or others. Unfortunately, one Texas teenager s family learned the hard way that sending their child off to receive firearms training then giving him a gun probably isn t the best way to go about life.Weatherford High School senior Brennan Weikel dreamed of playing football in college. Unfortunately, he will never be able to do that because his stepfather gave the inexperienced 17-year-old a weapon and took him out in the middle of the night for what was supposed to be a fun Spring Break hog hunting trip. I know everybody says,  Oh, my kid s perfect.  He really was. He was a good kid,  said stepfather James Chambers. Chambers took Weikel out hunting just five days after the teenager had completed a gun safety course   one that gives him the legal right to hunt under Texas law, regardless of the amount of experience he has. Chambers also left Weikel by himself to hunt, according to the Weatherford Democrat: They were placed in individual ground blinds, the little wooden ones,  [Game Warden Penny Nixon] said.  His stepfather shot a hog and called the victim to ask him to help retrieve it. And the stepfather reported that immediately upon hanging up with the stepson, just seconds later, he heard a shot. It came from the blind where the young victim was. After getting no response to a text asking about the shot, the Weikel s stepfather, who was approximately 300 yards away, went over to the stand and found the teen crumpled up in the corner, his feet tangled up in a chair, according to Wise County Sheriff Lane Akin. There may have been some hunter inexperience involved,  Nixon explained.Akin says that the teen leaned over the rifle, which had a round chambered and the safety off, when he stood up after receiving his stepfather s text. When he reached for the grip of the rifle, he accidentally squeezed the trigger and fired a single round into his head. It was instantly fatal,  Nixon said.  It s a real tragedy. Yes, it is a  real tragedy    but the NRA and its acolytes will simply view this as an  accident  rather than a symptom of the problem that is  gun culture  in America. Simply put, this would have never happened if the teen s family had made the responsible decision not to place a gun in his hands. This would have never happened if the NRA and its Republican allies did not present arming teenagers as normal. This would have never happened if we would take reasonable steps to place age restrictions on firearm use, if we required more than a minimal amount of training, or if Weikel s stepfather had at least stayed by his side to make sure that he was using the gun properly.Contrary to the NRA s rhetoric, guns do not  keep us safe.  If they did, Weikel would still be playing football.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 North Carolina’s Governor Went On TV To Defend His Anti-LGBT Bill – And Got Royally Owned (VIDEO),"North Carolina s Republican Governor allowed his own sexual hangups to influence his state and it has cost tens of millions of dollars (and counting) in lost business, a PR nightmare, and a justifiably outraged population who think fixing a problem that doesn t exist is a massive waste of time. In short, he tanked his state and has nothing but headaches to show for it.Rather than, say, fix the screw ups by reversing the anti-LGBT bill that he signed into law and which allows North Carolina businesses to legally discriminate against transgender people, he has instead doubled down and focused on changing the narrative. It s not going well.On Sunday, Governor Pat McCrory desperately tried to repair his reputation by appearing on Meet the Press. Instead, he blundered into a series of cringeworthy  self owns  that make one wonder how he ever got elected in the first place. In almost slapstick fashion, McCrory managed to step on just about every rake in the yard as he stumbled from weak talking point to weak talking point.Putting on his tough guy voice, McCrory told host Chuck Todd that he wouldn t be bullied by the boycotts, the loss of business, the national condemnation, or his own citizens  desires. He also said he would stand against the Human Rights Campaign (which he misidentified as the  Human Relations Commission )   because if there is anything that will help prove you re not a monster, it s proudly attacking an organization that fights for human rights.In an awkward exchange, McCrory said his critics were trying to silence him by not holding a  dialogue  on the issue, which prompted Todd to point out that Republicans had repeatedly refused to debate the discriminatory bill before forcing it through the state legislature and hurriedly signing it into law.McCrory also acknowledged that he didn t meet with a single trans person before signing the bill, but that he has met a few at some point in his life. (He also claimed a guy at an all-you-can-eat buffet hugged him.) The fact that he didn t meet with the people who would be most affected by his legalized discrimination speaks volumes. Notably, South Dakota s governor had a similar bill on his desk around the same time. He actually spoke with the trans community   and ultimately decided to veto it. It s almost as if talking to the potential victims can impact the decision. Go figure.However, the best blunder came near the end: When finally pressed into a corner over the fact that North Carolina has become one of the least gay friendly states in the country under his eye, McCrory did the only sensible thing   he blamed Batman. This is basically a restroom privacy issue, versus equality. And these things need to be discussed, not threatened by Hollywood or anyone. You know, Hollywood, with all due respects to the Hollywood, the new Batman and Robin movie is playing in China, which has anti-gay, terrible, terrible human rights violations. The new Batman and Robin movie! The argument is complete and utter nonsense. It s safe to say that even his supporters were probably watching this interview with a mixture of bafflement and terror. When the greatest advocate for your hate bill is reduced to claiming Batman playing in Chinese theaters justifies his own intolerance, you might as well just hang a sign around your neck that says  We lost.

" Texas ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Brings REAL Weapon To Water Gun Fight, Shoots Teen Girl (VIDEO)","A teenage girl in Texas was sent to the hospital Saturday after one of her  responsible,  gun owning relatives turned a simple family gathering into an afternoon of terror. While the NRA encourages gun owners to take their weapons everywhere, to act as the last hope if a  bad guy with a gun  rears his ugly head, a simple Spring family barbecue serves as the latest example of why the hero-worship of everyone who straps a piece of metal to their thigh (or wherever) is not only irresponsible   it s dangerous. It was crazy, like you would never expect somebody to bring a gun to a barbecue or a family gathering at all,  said neighbor Micah Stewart, who witnessed the shooting.Neighbor Rasheed Seals says that the incident all began with two people at the gathering having a water gun fight. Unfortunately, one of the participants brought a real gun to the party: We come around here to get home and there s two people playing, like they re having a water gun fight. Stewart says that the  responsible gun owner  proved himself to be anything but responsible as he was drying off: The man went over there to his car to get his dry clothes and he must have had the gun so he started playing with it and tried to do this and I thought he probably had it on safety and he accidentally shot the girl in her collar bone area. The bullet struck a mere inch from the 15-year-old victim s neck. A stray bullet also hit a car about five houses away. Fortunately, no one else was hurt.Harris County Constable Lt. Daniel Garza explained that Cy Creek EMS  tended to the female who is reported to be in stable condition,  though it is not clear if the shooter   surely a  good guy with a gun  the NRA and its acolytes will immediately disavow   will be charged with a crime.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured Image via screengrab",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This ‘Do Your Job’ Video Is Humiliating GOP Senators With Straight Truth And A Bucket Of Laughs (VIDEO),"We pay our senators $174,000 per year. For that money, we get any and every bill that might actually help the middle class and the working poor blocked. We get new legislation to take away our voting rights, expand protections for Christians, limit a woman s ability to make decisions about her own body and life and a whole slew of nothing when it comes to anything else.That s okay, because at least they do what they re supposed to when it comes to constitutional duties like confirming federal judges, right? Yeah, sure they do. In their ultimate wisdom and probably in hopes that some conservative lower court judges will hand some Democratic victories to Republicans in November, the senate has decided that our nation s highest court should be deadlocked at a 4-4 tie for at least a year, probably five if Clinton or Sanders wins the election.Republicans aren t just refusing to confirm the most qualified man on the beltway for the job, they re refusing to even sit down and talk with him. In other words, they have once again refused to do their jobs. This video, put out by VidMe and already viral, explores with simple truth and just enough humor what would happen if other people refused to do their jobs.It would be one thing if the senate had a reason to ignore the perfect nomination but they just don t. They are refusing to sit down and go through the process because they know that C-Span covers those things and they will look exceedingly stupid as a nominee who has a record of fair adherence to the law is exposed as the right man for the job but gets trashed just because he was nominated by a black man the Republicans despise.It s just business as usual for the failure we call the Republican party.https://www.facebook.com/vidme/videos/10154596375275942/Featured image from screen capture ",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Hillary Clinton Gave The PERFECT Response To Trump’s Childish Insult,"Hillary Clinton isn t letting the latest childish nickname from Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump get under her skin. Appearing on ABC s This Week, the Democratic candidate was asked about Trump calling her  Crooked Hillary. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqT3quvHfss He can say whatever he wants to say about me, I really couldn t care less,  Clinton said on ABC s  This Week With George Stephanopoulos,   I don t respond to Donald Trump and his string of insults about me. Clinton went on to emphasize why she isn t afraid of Trump s schoolyard insults, but is more than willing to take him on head-first. I can take care of myself,  Clinton said on  This Week  when asked to respond to Trump s jab.  What I m concerned about is how he goes after everybody else. He goes after women. He goes after Muslims. He goes after immigrants. He goes after people with disabilities. He is hurting our unity at home. He is undermining the values that we stand for in New York and across America. And he s hurting us around the world. Trump is trying to make noise in the media about Clinton at the exact same time he s stuck in a delegate fight with Senator Ted Cruz. Trump has been repeatedly out-hustled and out-campaigned at state delegate events where Cruz has organized to secure delegates ahead of the Republican Convention in Cleveland. Trump faces the prospect of the nomination being snatched away from him, even though he has a very big lead over Cruz, because Trump may have problems hitting the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination.Even if he succeeds there, polling indicates Trump is in for a nightmare election if he goes head to head with Clinton. Polling shows that Trump s unfavorable are so sky-high he would lose to Clinton by double digits in a national election. Trump also shows considerable weakness in state polling, where he pulls up even at best with Clinton in strong Republican states like Mississippi and Utah.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin May Have To Bust Out The Crayons And Draw Her Own Invitation To The RNC,"Sarah Palin knows she s a political outcast. She s proud of it. She thinks because nobody cares what she thinks besides a handful of dense Trump supporters who are at his rallies to listen rather than wait for the chance to beat someone up that she qualifies as some kind of revolutionary.She actually qualifies as a has-been as well as a never-should-have-been, but I digress. There is nothing revolutionary about Sarah Palin. Assuming that she ll be able to just walk into a secure facility without an invite because you can see Russia from a remote island off the coast of Alaska or because your ever-so-pure Christian family are pros at losing custody battles, beating women and having children out-of-wedlock is a bit naive.Palin says she s going, however, and not even Paul Revere ringin  those bells and warning the British that they r uhhh not gonna take our guns will stop her. In an interview with the Associated Press, Palin said she may have to invite herself.  I can t see any of them inviting me,  she said, adding that the leaders of the RNC are  afraid of what I might say. Ya think? Every time this woman opens her mouth yet another round of inane rambling comes out. She has no clue how to prepare for a successful public appearance, which is why she s had so few. She doesn t deserve a stage or a microphone, even if it the Republican clown convention we re talking about.Palin also warned that the RNC had better not mess with Trump, who she called  so reasonable  and  full of common sense.  She says the people will rise up if they deny their candidate the nomination: How dare they   these arrogant, arrogant political operatives. Under the wisdom of the people, we will rise up, and we will say our vote does count, our activism does count. And for those who would try to warp that, those are the ones who need to leave   we don t need to leave. Looks like Sarah Palin is gonna jump onto the Trump train as it crashes into Cleveland, which will be nothing short of hilarious   especially if they tell her to beat it.Time will tell. I wonder if the grandkids will be helping her forge an invitation with construction paper and crayons.Featured image from Aaron Bernstein/Getty Images ",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republicans Are Now Threatening To KILL Transgender Students At This University,"Republicans at the University of North Carolina have gone completely off the rails and are now literally threatening transgender women who use the women s restrooms on campus with the penalty of death.Sadly, there is no amount of exaggeration in that statement. College Republicans have already made direct threats to the life of one transgender female on campus and are asserting that they will defend  their daughters and sisters,  with equal force against anyone else they declare a threat.The student who received the threats posted the exchange to Reddit while redacting her name. College Republicans have completely denied that the exchange occurred, which is not surprising.Portions of the attack, taken from the thread, are listed below: First of (sic), you are a mentally-ill man, no amount of surgery or hormones will change that. Second, if a tranny like you goes into the women s restroom, then what about the rights of them? If you value your life, you shouldn t have made this sick choice and settled with the gender God gave you. Playing into your delusions would make us no better than someone who tolerates pedophiles. You will never be a woman, and so you should stick with the man s room, as that is what you are, a mentally-ill man. you are sick and disgusting for mutilating your own God-given body, so a tranny like you find no pity with us. If you ever dare to set foot into the women s room I will make sure to give you a lesson not to harass our women, you freak of nature. We will make sure that you trannies do not molest our daughters and sisters. This comes on the heels of North Carolina passing a license-to-bigot law, otherwise known as a  religious freedom  law. Among the usual mundane items of people being protected from the sin of baking gay wedding cakes, it also places restrictions on transgender individuals   forcing them to use the bathroom that is associated with their physical genitalia.The UNC College Republicans released a statement denying everything about the incident, claiming that it s a fake story and they never threatened her. Yeah, I m sure that it s far more likely a transgender student decided to make death threats against herself, rather than just simply pee and go on with her business.The law, despite its utter failures on so many levels, seems to have had its desired effect. It has now legitimized every phobia and bit of hate that the good moral Christian right-wingers had inside themselves. They now think that they are within their rights to use deadly force to defend  their women.  Thanks, Republicans. We couldn t have gone full-Christian Sharia in America without you.Featured image via wikicommons",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Seinfeld’s ‘Elaine’ Wants Bernie Sanders To Clarify A Few Things In SNL Cold Open (VIDEO),"If you watched the most recent Democratic debate between candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, you may have noticed that things got a bit brutal, with the crowd noises even seeming reminiscent of a WWE showdown.Clearly noticing this were the folks over at Saturday Night Live, who literally had Hillary (played by Kate McKinnon) and Sanders (played by Larry David) going head to head.""Are you feeling THAT Bern?!"" #SNL pic.twitter.com/oRXmSAN2Tz  Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) April 17, 2016During the SNL reenactment of the debate they had a members of the audience ask the candidates questions, and since the debate took place in New York City, one of the trusty citizens was  Elaine Benes  from the hit show Seinfeld played by this week s SNL host Julia Louis Dreyfus, who perfectly reprised her famous role.Elaine wanted to know how exactly Bernie was going to break up the banks, and lets just say, she wasn t too fond of his answer. Bernie answered: Once I m elected president, I ll have a nice schvitz in the White House gym, I ll sit them down and yada yada yada, they ll be broken up. With Elaine replying: You can t yada yada at a debate. Of course,  yada yada yada  also being a famous line from Seinfeld   and seeing Julia Louis Dreyfus back with Larry David who co-created the show alongside Jerry Seinfeld was definitely amazing.Elaine, clearly annoyed, asked Hillary: Doesn t it suck to be the only girl in a group of guys? And when Hillary said yes, Elaine added,  Don t worry, because everyone thinks you are by far the funniest I mean, the most qualified. There were also questions from  Rachel Green  from Friends, but Elaine had one more question for Sanders: Senator Sanders, you believe the super-rich should pay more in taxes? But wouldn t that be bad for actors who made a lot of money on a certain very successful sitcom? even worse for the person who created that sitcom? Of course, speaking of herself and David.David s Sanders responded: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you should vote for her. All in all, it was definitely a lot of fun to see Elaine back in action. Now, if only she would do her infamous dance.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Supporters Shower Hillary’s Motorcade With Actual Money At Clooney Fundraiser (VIDEO),"An unfortunate part of modern-day politics is the fact that money is far too involved in our elections. Yet, until Citizens United and big money is no longer allowed in elections, it s a necessary evil. Even President Obama held    and still holds   fundraisers. Another such fundraiser was thrown for Hillary Clinton by George Clooney and his wife Amal, and even Clooney himself said the price of attending, alongside the practice itself, is  obscene. Clinton s rival in the Democratic race, Sen. Bernie Sanders, has definitely shown that it may not be necessary to hold such big money fundraisers so long as you have enough grassroots support behind you. So, whether or not he wins the nomination, his legacy will be an example of things to come in the future, and how elections should be conducted as far as raising funds. But until Citizens United is overturned, and until we can get big money out of elections, there will be fundraisers. It is what it is. It s the nature of the beast.However, with this latest fundraiser thrown by the Clooneys came a counter-fundraiser thrown by Clooney s neighbor Howard Gold, whose family founded the 99 Cents Only chain of stores. Part of the fundraiser/protest was a moment when the crowd threw money at Hillary s motorcade as it passed by.And it was very real money that, according to Dan Merica of CNN, was $1000 withdrawn by Howard Gold himself.The money was real. And was withdrawn from a bank today by Howard Gold, the Sanders counter fundraiser host. https://t.co/CMRGr7RBJQ  Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) April 17, 2016It seems, however, that these protesters didn t throw the money on Clinton, but rather her Secret Service agents:Funny part about this: The car that was showered the most was full of Secret Service agents, not Clinton. https://t.co/CMRGr7RBJQ  Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) April 17, 2016Yet, the point was still clearly made.The Clooneys have every right to hold fundraisers for their candidate of choice, just as the protesters have every right to speak up in dissent of big money fundraisers. And as so long as they are invited, as they were by Gold, and not trespassing on private property, more of these protests are bound to pop up as the election heats up towards a potential Democratic nominee.This has definitely been an entertaining election cycle to say the least. Watch the video here of the money being thrown:Sanders supporters outside Clinton s Clooney fundraiser in LA shower her motorcade in $1,000. pic.twitter.com/ivbu024IcG  Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) April 17, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 17, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

While we know who can school who in reality, Curry took it all in stride as the president showed him how to shoot a basketball as the two teamed up to highlight the importance of mentoring.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atm3P3XsAag] The president didn t just teach Curry a few moves in basketball: He also schooled the talented shooter in Connect Four, and taught him how to make a model volcano erupt.It was all in good fun for the president who is in his last few months in office and the NBA great, who is in the prime of his career and is looking for a second consecutive championship after helping the Golden State Warriors to the best regular season record in history.To learn more about mentoring opportunities, read and click on the link below: Mentoring creates meaningful connections that can positively impact the lives of both mentor and mentee. Those who receive mentorship are more likely to see improved academic, social, and economic prospects. Those who mentor are able to build important leadership and management skills, while giving back to their community.There are 46 million young people, aged 8   18, living in America. 16 million of them are growing up without a mentor. That s one out of every three young people who, outside of their family at home, don t have a trusted adult who they believe they can turn to for advice and guidance. Of those young people, 9 million face a variety of day-to-day challenges that put them at-risk for falling off track. That means that every mentorship matters.

 Nate Silver: Hillary Clinton’s Wins Most Resemble The Democratic Party,"As the New York primary draws closer and closer, Hillary Clinton, current front runner in the Democratic Party, is slated to win by a comfortable margin (for now). New York, a solid Democratic state when heading into the general, is also a very diverse state   which is good for Clinton.According to Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, New York s diversity is why Clinton will most likely win on Tuesday. In fact, according to Silver s measures, Clinton s wins in heavily diverse states like Texas, Nevada, Florida, South Carolina, etc. most closely represents the Democratic electorate in the general election.Silver predicts, through meticulous exit polling data and election trends, that the citizens who cast their vote for the Democratic nominee in November will be 54 percent white, 24 percent black, 15 percent Latino / Hispanic, and 7 percent Asian. That s a pretty diverse electorate, something Democrats should take pride in.Silver also says this is why Clinton will most likely be the nominee. As Silver writes, Clinton s major wins in states like Florida and Texas are embody the  coalition  Democrats need to win:In addition to being important to the Democratic Party s electoral present and future, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Texas are quite diverse. They re diverse ideologically   Miami and Austin aren t exactly  the most conservative part  of the country   and they re diverse racially. They contain not only a substantial number of African-Americans but also Hispanics and, increasingly, Asian-American voters.In fact, these states are among the most demographically representative of the diverse Obama coalition that Clinton or Sanders will have to rely on in NovemberThe states whose primaries most resemble the real Democrat electorate are:One of Clinton s strengths comes from the black vote, which carried her to an impressive sweep of the South.Summed up:In other words, Clinton has won or is favored to win almost every state where the turnout demographics strongly resemble those of Democrats as a whole. This shouldn t be surprising   Clinton is winning nationally by about 14 percentage points in the popular vote. So if you re in a state that s well-representative of Democrats  national demographics, you might expect her to win it by a solid margin too.This isn t to say Sanders hasn t won some diverse states that vote Democratic   he crushed Clinton in Hawaii, and pulled off a major upset in Michigan. Should he win the nomination, he ll win virtually every demographic versus any Republican candidate   as will Clinton if she s the nominee.

 CHAOS: Sarah Palin Promises To Lead GOP Revolt If Trump Denied Nomination,"Failed Republican vice-presidential candidate and reality TV star Sarah Palin is threatening to lead an open revolt at the Republican convention this fall if her candidate, Donald Trump, is not chosen as the nominee. Palin issued her threat to the party in an interview with the Associated Press:The 2008 vice presidential nominee told The Associated Press that GOP voters have the right to decide the party s nominee and will rebel if House Speaker Paul Ryan or some other  white knight  is chosen at a contested convention. Ryan said this week he will not seek or accept the nomination.Palin said voters know better than to be fooled by party leaders. How dare they?  Palin asked, denouncing  arrogant political operatives who underestimate the wisdom of the people. If party leaders try to intervene at the July convention,  we will rise up and say our vote does count, our activism does count,  she said.Palin infamously announced she was riding the so-called  Trump Train  at an event in January, praising Trump for  going rogue left and right,  allowing him to  tear the veil off this idea of the system. Her comments come as the Republican establishment continues to try to stop Trump from winning the nomination since they believe   and polling backs them up   he would be a disaster for the party in the fall against either of the Democratic candidates.Texas Senator Ted Cruz has tried to set himself up as the defacto Trump alternative, but Ohio Governor John Kasich has continued to run despite only winning one state (his home state). As a result, the anti-Trump votes have been diluted in primaries, even as Cruz operatives have worked in other party meetings to snipe as many Trump delegates away as possible.Currently Trump needs 1,237 delegates to secure the nomination. Right now he has 755, which is 210 more than Ted Cruz s 545 delegates. Trump is widely expected to win upcoming primaries in New York and Maryland, which will add to his lead.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Simple Graph Blows The ‘Media Has A Liberal Bias’ Myth Completely Out Of The Water (IMAGE),"There is a popular belief among Republicans that the mainstream media is in cahoots with liberals. The theory, as they tell it, holds that liberals run the  mainstream  media, and therefore give favorable political coverage to Democrats and demonize conservatives. The belief is so common, in fact, that Fox News, the country s most watched news network is seen by many as restoring the  balance  between the two sides. Republicans have Fox and liberals have everything else   or so the thinking goes.It s a convenient fantasy if you re a Republican. If the media has a  liberal bias  then what they report is inherently suspect. When, say, reporters find that there was absolutely no evidence that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong during Benghazi, conservatives can sleep well knowing that it s just because those reporters are covering for her. If Republican lawmakers then waste millions of dollars and thousands of hours on that particular witchhunt, well that s fair game because the  mainstream  news wouldn t give Americans the full story.A new report done by social media analytics company Crimson Hexagon has taken that conservative narrative and blown it completely out of the water. Running a deep analysis of how much negative vs. positive media coverage each of the still active presidential candidates has received, the team found the exact opposite of what Fox News viewers might expect. Who has been viciously attacked the most during this campaign?Hillary Clinton.Which two candidates received the least amount of positive coverage? Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.Vox turned the data into a simple graph, and the results are startling.Crimson Hexagon looked at hundreds of thousands of online stories published since January of 2015. The data is nothing if not comprehensive. What this means for you and me is that for a year and a half now, we have been more-or-less constantly bombarded with negative stories about Democrats and less so about Republicans. On the flipside, an average American is more likely to hear a positive story about Kasich or Trump than they are about either of the two Democratic options.Trump may complain about how unfairly he is being treated, but from this analysis it s clear that the only ones with legitimate gripes are Sanders and Clinton.This  unfair and unbalanced  coverage of the election may explain why Hillary Clinton is seeing bafflingly high unfavorability polling, even while Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, publicly endorses things like waterboarding, religious-based discrimination, and violence towards protesters. America s a sponge and it s been soaking up the negativity for years.This may come as a shock to Fox News viewers, but their  media has a liberal bias  worldview is built on a lie. How do you convince someone to watch your network and no one else s? Tell them the rest are frauds. Fox has been beating that drum so long that at this point even they can t control the conservative base any more. Chat with a Trump or Cruz supporter and you may soon learn that Fox News is  too liberal  these days. Too. Liberal.In reality, the mainstream media has very few party loyalties. The only idol they worship is that of ratings and the best ratings come when they are drumming up controversy by promoting scandal. If that means going after Donald Trump, they ll do it. But oftentimes it also means going after Clinton and Sanders for reasons that otherwise objective reporters would see almost immediately as manufactured nonsense. Recently, just to take one egregious example, the Washington Post ran a story that claimed nearly 150 FBI agents were looking into Hillary Clinton s emails. A lot of ink was spilled over it over the next 24 hours making Clinton look very bad. And then someone bothered to track down the source: It was a Republican lawmaker. The story was nothing more than a fabricated hit piece started by a GOPer looking to hurt Clinton and used an all-too-eager Washington Post reporter to do it.Reality may have a liberal bias, but news networks sure don t.Featured image via Regine Mahaux/Getty Images",News,"April 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 These DISGUSTING Trump T-shirts Are EXACTLY What’s Wrong With His Supporters (IMAGES),"Trump s supporters have proven time and time again that the reason they re able to stand behind The Donald with a completely clear conscience is because they re exactly like him. The pro-Trump crowd is just as Islamophobic, racist, irrational, angry, vulgar and self-involved as the Republican frontrunner himself. The majority of Trump s supporters also share another trait of Trump s   they, too, are misogynists and this couldn t have been more evident than his supporters  choice of attire at a recent rally.While at Trump s campaign event in Syracuse on Saturday, Jill Colvin of the Associated Press managed to snap a picture of this disgusting t-shirt, proudly worn and modeled by one of the candidate s young Trump bros.If you need any more convincing that the  Trump That B*tch  slogan isn t a misogynistic, disrespectful attack on women, just wait until you see what the front says:Misogyny at its finest. Not only was there a completely despicable message on the back of the shirt, but the front makes a disgraceful, tasteless reference to former POTUS Bill Clinton s infamous affair with Monica Lewinsky. There couldn t be a more immature, vile way to disrespect Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton than this.These t-shirts were being sold outside of the event, and it s shameful to think that even one person would buy one. But then again, what else can you expect from someone who believes that Trump is worthy of being the next President of the United States?These people have stood by Trump through every single one of his attacks on women. Not including Trump s extremely long (and forever expanding) history of misogyny, these morons have supported the disgraced candidate through his horrific abortion remarks that stated women should be punished for terminating a pregnancy, his unprovoked attacks on rival Ted Cruz s wife, an incident where Trump s own campaign manager threw a female reporter to the ground (and Trump did NOTHING about it), Trump s one-sided feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, his awkwardly incestuous comments about his own daughters, and so much more.These people have absolutely NO moral compass between right and wrong, and they ll do anything just to get some attention   just like Trump himself. Trump s misogynistic messages are becoming more and more terrifying, and his followers are going to stand behind him one hundred percent. The GOP has been terrorizing women forever, but Trump s particular brand of hateful rhetoric is especially dangerous.

 College Ad Welcomes New Students And Apologizes For Their Impending Rape,"It doesn t matter how loudly Fox News protests, the fact is that there s an epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses all over America. Compounding and enabling the problem is the phenomenal resistance college administrations have to actually dealing with it. The preferred method is to intimidate the victim into silence and sweep the whole thing under the rug.But the Don t Accept Rape campaign has a much different idea:A print ad appearing in Harvard University s student newspaper on Saturday has a controversial message for students: The trauma of trying to get school administrators to take sexual assault seriously is becoming a routine part of the collegiate experience.The ad buy is timed to coincide with the school s accepted students weekend, when many high school seniors who are considering attending Harvard in the fall visit the campus. Styled like an acceptance letter that lets a prospective student know they ve been admitted, the ad makes the case that sexual assault may be one of the college memories in store for them.I imagine that Harvard s administration is none to happy about it but tough shit. If they d put more effort into treating rape victims like actual victims instead of potential embarrassments, this genius ad wouldn t be necessary:The Don t Accept Rape website also has several clever, if highly depressing, videos showing both male and female students reading their college acceptance letters explaining how they ll be sexually assaulted and then ignored or witness a rape and be pressured to keep quiet about it. I ve always been mystified by the impulse of colleges to cover up rapes on their campuses. I would think that making a huge stink about it and having law enforcement prosecute to the fullest extent of the law would be a selling point, not a potential public relations negative.But what do I know? I m just some guy on a computer and I m not being paid millions a year to protect the reputation of a school over the safety of my students.Featured image courtesy of dontacceptrape.com ",News,"April 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Racist North Carolina Hospital Volunteer Loses Her Sh*t After She Meets A Black Family (VIDEO),"Republicans claim that racism doesn t exist anymore. But if that is true, why does this sh*t keep happening? An African-American man in North Carolina posted a horrifying video to YouTube that shows a crazy white lady UNLOADING on him and his family simply because they have skin darker than a freshly-bleached Klan hood. A volunteer at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center at Winston-Salem was captured on video screaming at Isaiah Baskins and his family when they visited the center.Before Baskins began filming, he says the woman called him a  n*gger  and ordered him to leave. At the start of the video, the woman is on the phone demanding that someone (apparently security)  come up here and TAKE THESE PEOPLE OUT OF HERE.  After she slams the phone, she begins pushing and shoving the man, who simply asks what is wrong with her, baring her teeth like someone just spilled grape juice on her freshly-washed robes just before an important cross burning. Get your damn underwear out of here,  she screams.  Gray underwear.  Apparently, the color of Baskins  underwear, which may or may not have poked above the waistline of Baskins  pants, makes him a  dirty old creep.  She demands that the family be removed because she doesn t  want to see it.  On YouTube, Baskins sums up the situation:Went to Baptist hospital for my daughter appointment and went into the family resource center and became a victim of racism before I started recording she called me a nigger and said get my black kids out We wasent bothering anybody I was just taking to someone I just met in the hospital. After i grap my camera she say my pants and gray underweare keep it real u called me a nigger and my kid little black kids. Out of no where she flips and put me and my kids out them pushes me and kicks me Racism is still real Wake forest baptist medical center.In a statement provided to FOX8, Wake Forest explained that the woman is no longer a volunteer with the organization: Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center is shocked and appalled at the behavior demonstrated by our volunteer in this video. We deeply regret this and have apologized to those affected by this behavior. This behavior does not reflect our identity or our values. This individual is no longer a volunteer with our organization.Wake Forest Baptist is dedicated to providing an inclusive environment for all, with respect, dignity and compassion. This commitment is unwavering and reinforced every day by our dedicated faculty and staff.

 ‘Satanic Giants Built Stonehenge’ Is Now A Thing With Creationists (VIDEO),"There are times I want to just get up from my computer, walk out of my apartment, find a cave in the woods and live there until the human race inevitably wipes itself out. After reading about this Creation scientist  expert s  scientific bat-shit insane  theory  about how Stonehenge was built, I was two miles down the road before deciding it would just be easier to sit at home and wait for the end to come.In the meantime, I will torment you with the following:Televangelist Jim Bakker invited Dr. Dennis Lindsay on to his program on Wednesday to discuss Lindsay s latest discovery in the realm of Creation Science: the truth behind Stonehenge.Hold on to your hats: Stonehenge, it turns out, was built by giants who were created by Satan.Lindsay told Bakker that these giants were tools of the devil, who seeks to destroy Israel because  he s out to destroy God s creation and his whole plan of redemption and contaminate the human race. Yes, I just deliberately inflicted permanent brain damage on you. No, you will never get those brain cells back. They re gone. Dead. Burned out for all time.After making my eyes bleed with this, it occurs to me that Creationists hate human achievement. The very idea that primitive humans could accomplish the wonders of Stonehenge or the pyramids of Egypt infuriates them. Especially if they occurred before or independent of Christianity. These bible-humping freaks have a startlingly low opinion of humanity and would prefer to believe that giants and demons were responsible instead of human ingenuity and genius.Oh, and just to get in a bit of Muslim-bashing (because of course), he referred to the mosque on the Temple Mount (one of the most holy sites in Islam) as a  squatter s hut  because why stop at being a douche when you can go all the way to  raging dickhead?

 Berkeley Student Kicked Off Southwest Flight For Speaking Arabic (VIDEO),"A 26-year-old University of California, Berkeley student is accusing Southwest Airlines of discrimination after he was kicked off a flight because an ignorant passenger claimed he was making terroristic threats in Arabic.Khairuldeen Makhzoomi and his family came to the USA after his father, an Iraqi diplomat, was killed under Saddam Hussein s regime in 2002. He and his family fled to Jordan and lived there until the United States granted them asylum. Unfortunately, he has now experienced what it is like to live in a country that is filled with Islamaphobia thanks to the constant fear mongering from the right.Makhzoomi said that he was speaking to his uncle on the phone before his flight took off and telling him about an even he attended the night before with Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. At the end of my call I said,  Inshallah, I will call you,  and he was like,  Call me when you get home.  I was like  Inshallah, Inshallah,  which means God willing. He said that after he hung up with his uncle another passenger was staring at him suspiciously.  She kept staring at me and I didn t know what was wrong,  he explained.  Then I realized what was happening and I just was thinking  I hope she s not reporting me.  A few minutes later he was escorted from the plane after the woman claimed she d heard him say martyr  in Arabic.The student says that after he was humiliated and kicked off the flight, security searched him and the FBI spoke to him. He also says that Southwest denied him service. All because some imbecile misunderstood his language.The airline defended their actions in a statement, saying: Prior to gate departure of Flight 4260, our Flight Crew decided to investigate potentially threatening comments made onboard our aircraft. Based upon the reported comments and further discussion, our Flight Crew made the decision to deny boarding to this Customer We wouldn t remove passengers from flights without a collaborative decision rooted in established procedures. Makhzoomi is rightfully angry and expressed his frustration about the fear that has gripped this country. This is what Islamaphobia has gotten this country into,  Makhzoomi said.  Anyone can report anyone. Indeed.Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, fear of Muslims has spread through our country like a plague. And if it were even possible, it seems to have gotten worse in the last year with Donald Trump s campaign for the Republican nomination fanning the flames. The GOP frontrunner is whipping his supporters into a frenzy with ideas of banning all Muslims, opening internment camps and forcing them to carry IDs. This constant flow of hate is causing a rise in hate crimes and incidents like this. This bigotry goes against everything this country was built upon, but don t expect Trump s  poorly educated  voters to admit that.As for this latest example of Islamaphobia, Makhzoomi says he just wants an apology: All I need is an apology to say,  We are sorry we singled you out because [of] one person who felt threatened.

 Kids Hilariously Impersonate And Mock Donald Trump On Jimmy Fallon (VIDEO),"It s quite hard to laugh at what Donald Trump plans to do if he becomes president, especially since he s been winning in the polls for the Republican nomination for president. However, when kids actually say some of the crazy things Trump has said he plans to do, it all becomes hilarious. In fact, these kids actually show us how ridiculous Donald Trump actually is.Jimmy Fallon compiled videos of kids imitating some of the silliest statements Trump has made during his nightmarish run for the GOP nomination and then perfectly mocks him. In one example, a girl in a New York accent hilariously said: If you don t want to build a wall, you re a loser. Vote for Trump and make America great again. Or, you re gonna be a loser. In another skit, a Trump impersonator brags about his performance in the polls, saying: I m doing so good and I m going to win and once I win, we will win so much that everyone will be sick of winning. The funny skits genuinely prove just how ridiculous Trump s statements are when put in the context of kids saying them. The hope is that Donald Trump, along with Ted Cruz, will just be a funny memory come November.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtG3h44Ls1o] Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"April 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 CNN Segment Turns Into A Shouting Match As ‘Apprentice’ Alums Spar Over Trump (VIDEO),"To say that Donald Trump is a divisive figure is quite the understatement. His racism, sexism, xenophobia, and all-around assholery have been on full display ever since he announced that his candidacy for the GOP 2016 presidential nomination. At this point, even former contestants from his reality show, The Apprentice, have turned against him, and are saying so publicly. Three alumi from the show appeared on CNN in a segment with host Don Lemon on Friday night, and things quickly turned ugly, because two of the former contestants, both of whom are black men, were openly criticizing the business mogul, while a contestant who is a supporter also came on and expressed his support for Trump for president.Kwame Jackson and Randal Pinkett lit into Trump at the beginning of the segment, calling out his many frightening qualities and all the reasons he d make such a terrible president. Pinkett commented on the fact that while on the show, the contestants had no clue that Trump was such a bigoted extremist, saying: We ve seen the campaign evolve from when Donald announced and talked about Mexicans as rapists and criminals to what we ve seen more recently with the violence at his campaign rallies. We ve all grown increasingly concerned that the Donald we knew when we competed is not the Donald we know as a candidate. Pinkett continued on with his criticism, saying that while Trump continues to be the same  bombastic personality  that they came to know as their host on The Apprentice, that there s a side that has come out during his presidential campaign that they were unaware of before, saying, What we didn t see was how extreme his views have evolved as he has become a political candidate. That was when Jackson joined the fray and said what all sane people have been thinking, which is that We are bordering on the precipice of fascism. Andy Dean then spoke up as a Trump supporter, and insisted that nobody in Trump s camp is responsible for the violence at the rallies. He went on to accuse the former contestants of not being appreciative of Trump s putting them on his television show. Dean then pivoted to the go-to Trump talking point, which is that The Donald is a rich, successful businessman. Jackson, countered that remark and said,  Being rich don t make you right, Andy. The thing is, Trump s supporters, be they the backwoods, ignorant types who act as if they couldn t pass an eighth grade civics class or the rich assholes like Andy Dean, seem to be completely oblivious to how dangerous Donald Trump really is. He s a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, and really just an out and out fascist. That is the LAST thing this country needs, and his rise to the top is nothing short of terrifying to those of us who see what he is doing to the nation, even without so much as securing the GOP nomination.These contestants are right. Trump needs to go. Opportunities he gave them aside, they were right to say what they said.Watch this trainwreck of a segment below, via Raw Story and Mediate:https://youtu.be/fXqjEhNopCkFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"April 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Bill Maher: Tax The Churches, Why Are We Paying For A ‘Homophobic Magic Act’? (VIDEO)","It s no secret that the comedic host of HBO s Real Time, Bill Maher, is no fan of religion. In fact, it s safe to say that he really pretty much hates the practice. He is one of America s most outspoken celebrity atheists, and Friday night s edition of his show saw him once again ripping religion for the amusement of his largely secular audience. What Maher had to say this time, though, wasn t just making fun of people who believe in god(s). He actually called for the Internal Revenue Service to make these institutions pay taxes.During his  New Rules  segment, Maher began: Why, in heaven s name, don t we tax religion? A sexist, homophobic magic act that s been used to justify everything from genital mutilation to genocide. You want to raise the tax on tobacco so kids don t get cancer, OK. But let s put one on Sunday school so they don t get stupid. Maher went on to say that the fact these churches owned billions in property got him, quote,  hopping mad.  He also pointed out something that likely has most religious people either panicking or in complete denial: religious belief is largely on the decline in the United States, which is traditionally seen as the most religious country in the developed western world. In fact, the youngest generation of Americans   Millennials   largely not only aren t actively religious, but they are uncomfortable with most mainstream religion, mostly due to the homophobia, misogyny, and other harmful ideas and practices therein.Maher continued on his rant: Almost a quarter of us are being forced to subsidize a myth that we re not buying into. Why am I subsidizing their Sunday morning hobby? They don t subsidize mine. After that brilliant closer, Maher flashed a photo of himself getting high with a friend on what is presumably one Sunday morning.The thing is, Bill Maher is right. We shouldn t be subsidizing churches. These people push all kinds of horrible things, including lobbying, at least indirectly, to enshrine bigotry into law against people they believe to be  sinners.  Our tax dollars should not be spent to uphold religion. People can believe what they like, but the rest of us shouldn t be paying for it.Thank you, Mr. Maher, for another hilariously brilliant   and oh so true   monologue on the truth about the tax-free status of America s religious institutions.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:https://youtu.be/Mw8MLub4siUFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"April 16, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Letter From The Fed Warns Of The Next Great Recession And NOBODY Is Paying Attention,"In case you weren t paying attention: Just as George W. Bush s disaster of an administration was coming to an end the effects of his policies combined with a horrible deal pushed on Bill Clinton by a Republican congress to balance the budget caused the greatest economic collapse since the great depression. From the first signs of the housing bubble bursting in 2007 to the market crash of October 2008, we watched as financial institutions failed to cover their horrible bets hedged with credit swaps from other horrible bets, sending the global economy into a tailspin. It wasn t until March of 2009 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a rock bottom of 6459 points, a 54 percent loss from the day of the crash, that the economy began its slow but steady recovery.In the meantime, 401Ks were decimated. Homes purchased for $200K were worth half of that seemingly overnight The ability to pay back the loan was already suspect, as banks used the deregulation and repeal of imperative portions of Glas-Steagall to loan money to anyone applying for credit, with those debts sold for debt that was leveraged with debt and so on   until the pile collapsed in on itself. Builders who borrowed $100K to build a small spec-house were issued millions of dollars instead to build entire neighborhoods, some of which are still empty or incomplete to this day. The actual cash value of American real estate plummeted, killing a massive chunk of working and middle-class construction and service jobs.All of that because the first big bank to fail didn t have a sufficient plan to secure its debts if it needed to wind back, tighten credit and use protections in place to stay the course and weather the storm. This time, there would be none of that. This time, the people who held the country s economy hostage without even knowing it were the same ones who lost their jobs and found themselves standing there with their arms outstretched wondering what the hell just happened.For years we suffered. Our newly elected president got to preside over an economy handed to him in ruins. People who lost everything had to grit their teeth while congress handed the big banks the money to loosen the credit that had come to a halt and provide the upper class and one-percenters with the lavish lifestyles they d grown accustomed to. One would imagine that with a track record like that, the big banks would update their plan B; the drop back nine and punt with a solid strategy to cover their investments and hedge their losses should things start to tumble.According to a letter sent by the Fed and the FDIC, the agency that secures deposits with federal funds, the nation s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, is far from the goal of being able to save itself without another catastrophic incident. An independent blog run by a former Wall Street operative and a professional publisher called Wall Street on Parade analyzed the letter and found the contents extremely disturbing:At the top of page 11, the Federal regulators reveal that they have  identified a deficiency  in JPMorgan s wind-down plan which if not properly addressed could  pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States.  Why didn t JPMorgan s Board of Directors or its legions of lawyers catch this?It s important to parse the phrasing of that sentence. The Federal regulators didn t say JPMorgan could pose a threat to its shareholders or Wall Street or the markets. It said the potential threat was to  the financial stability of the United States. That s frightening. JPMorgan is worth more than $2 trillion with $51 trillion in notional amounts of derivatives, it s total value as a leveraged asset. That means that without stop-gaps in place to catch a fall in progress, the collapse of a single bank could potentially cost more than a quarter of the value of the entire US economy. Sound familiar? What happens next is a domino effect, as JPMorgan ranks number one in  risk of contagion  to other institutions. In other words, 2008-2009 all over again far too soon for the country to put on the brakes and stop the inevitable recession and possibly depression that will follow.This is NOT a joke or an episode of Alex Jones. This is the Federal Reserve telling the kingpin that a ball is spinning in its direction and the best thing it can hope for is a seven-ten split; something for some innocent people to hold onto as the rest fall off into a dark abyss. Why hasn t the mainstream media picked up on this? Bernie Sanders is supposed to be the watchdog making sure big banks don t destroy what the people have managed to rebuild. Hillary Clinton is supposed to be all about reform, applauding Dodd-Frank and reporting that she s personally scolded Wall Street for its nefarious activity. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, well, they re idiots. Where is CNN, ABC, and NBC? Not even the doom and gloom seekers of Fox News can remove themselves from Donald Trump s rear-end long enough to make note that even though they ruined countless lives less than a decade ago, big banks aren t taking measures to stop it from happening again.Bad things are happening downtown.

 Bernie Sanders Consoles Sister Of Police Violence Victim In Emotional Backstage Discussion (VIDEO),"On April 11th, before he spoke at his rally in Albany, New York, Bernie Sanders met with local Black Lives Matter activists.  The local police department has a long history of corruption and abuse. In April 2015, Albany Police Officers killed unarmed 39-year-old Dontay Ivy. While he was walking home from an ATM they tasered him and beat him to death with police batons. Mr. Ivy was mentally ill. In the video, his aunt takes Bernie Sanders through what happened. No officers were charged in the death and a grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing because of a lack of witnesses. Allegedly the dash cams in the patrol cars were turned off. I worried about my brother all the time. I thought outside elements would hurt him. But the people who were supposed to protect him, they re the ones who hurt him,  Dontay Ivy s sister, Johnson, told Senator Sanders in tears.Bernie Sanders has lead the call for police reform in the Democratic Primaries. He was the only candidate who called for a Department of Justice investigation in December 2015 after it was announced there would be no indictment of the police officers involved. He was the only candidate who called for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign over his administration s overt cover up of unarmed teenager LaQuan MacDonald s death. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who has proposed that the Department of Justice investigates every death caused by police involvement or in police custody so police departments can t cover up the incidents or protect their own from being held accountable for their actions. I got the racial profiling issues, I got it. And I got the need for police reform. What we should be doing is training police officers to deal with issues, although this doesn t seem to be a terribly difficult issue, this is not like somebody with a weapon or anything. It s a guy walking down the street, right? Going home. It s not exactly a major crime,  Bernie Sanders told the group backstage. What we don t have yet is a culture in this country that says to the police departments that lethal force, in this case using a Taser several times is a last resort, not a first resort, right? Clearly, in this particular case, it can be dealt with in a hundred different ways. The full video below, released by the Albany chapter of Black Lives Matter, shows the group s entire discussion backstage at the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, New York. https://www.facebook.com/BLMUpstateNY/videos/1084906804903398/Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mainstream Media Completely SILENT As Obamacare Makes Yet Another Historic Achievement,"President Obama made history yet again by making the rate for Americans without health insurance reach another historic low. However, you wouldn t know about it because virtually none of the mainstream media have talked about it on any level.Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index was updated on April 7th with new data for the first quarter of 2016. The statistics have now been released, and it shows that the uninsured rate for American adults dropped to 11 percent, which is the lowest ever recorded in the poll s history.This unmitigated success has followed a trend since the third quarter of 2013, which is the last one before the Affordable Care Act s mandate for health insurance took effect.The graph below shows the virtual bottoming out of the uninsured rate. Considering where we were as a nation only three years ago, coupled with the stubborn resistance of many in complying with the new requirements, the results are simply amazing.Not only are the results on the uninsured rate historic overall, but the largest benefits are among African-Americans, Hispanics, adults under 34 years of age, and adults making less than $36,000 per year. If Republicans really want to  repeal every word of Obamacare  as they promise to do, it would literally make their party go extinct. Young and minority voters will be lost to Republicans for a generation or more, and doom them extinction.The Republican  plan  during the 2016 election has been more of the same. Repeal, repeal, repeal   with no plan to replace as usual. However, there has been a lot less talk of repeal as of late. Even Ted Cruz, who could have  I will repeal every word of Obamacare  chiseled on his tombstone, has been strangely silent on the issue. Votes to repeal have seemed to be drying up, and you hear hardly a peep coming from Senate Republicans on the matter these days.Perhaps the GOP has finally reached the last stage of grief   acceptance.Featured image via Getty",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 These ‘Christian’ Parents Literally Want To Play The ‘My God Is Bigger Than Your God’ Game (VIDEO),"Some people just don t understand  freedom of religion  whatsoever. The First Amendment separates church from state for two reasons: to protect the church and the state. Religious Freedom is the ability to worship how you choose on your own time. However, if a public school, funded by public taxpayer dollars that is for all citizens regardless of religion, has something that puts one faith over another, that s not  freedom,  it s promoting a Theocracy.So, when the Freedom From Religion Foundation sent a letter about removing a Bible verse from a website to the Troup Independent School District in Troup, Texas   mind you, a public school district open to all   this sent many ill-informed people into a tizzy.One of those ill-informed people, who still has every right to worship her God on her time, is Brittany Taylor. Taylor is the parent of two kids that go to Troup ISD. She was beyond angry that the public school district would take down the Bible verse that read,  As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him.  She thinks that even though public and held to the Constitution to separate any church from any state-run place, the school should be able to promote Christianity.Taylor said: We support our school fully, they kind of had their hands tied in the situation. We wanted to fight back for them. There s literally nothing to fight back about. Yet, what did she do? Make T-Shirts that read  Our God is bigger  for students, including her own children, to wear. She s literally putting out the argument that many often satirize of  my God is bigger than your God  in the clash over religion and religious freedom.Sam Grover, Freedom of Religion Foundation, said: Under the federal constitution, a government entity like a school district can t endorse one religious belief over others or religion generally over non religion. Which is exactly correct.Quite honestly, her kids should be free to wear whatever they want, but the school itself cannot and should not promote any religion. Public school is not a church, and thus not the time nor place for public worship of any God. Yet everyone is still perfectly free to worship on their own time. No one is losing any form of freedom. No one.Of course, Taylor believes she s being  told  what to do, because you know, she doesn t understand how the Constitution actually works. She said,  It will be in our children s hearts and they will not stop praising God because a group told them to.  No one told your kids not to worship. Nope. Not at all, but okay.All that these parents are doing is making a point they clearly don t need to make. But really, if you re gonna be stupid, the least you could do is leave your kids out of it.Watch the coverage of this story via KYTX: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ben Carson Really Just Compared GOP’s Nominating Rules To ‘Jim Crow Era’ Laws (VIDEO),"Ben Carson, who was once one of the more promising Republican presidential candidates before his insanity and outlandish remarks ruined his campaign, is sounding more and more like front-runner Donald Trump as the days go by.In an interview with Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC, the former candidate and loyal Trump supporter complained about the Republican National Committee (RNC) convention rules   a predictable move considering how much Trump himself has been whining about them ever since he lost every single Colorado delegate to his rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz.Mitchell appropriately brought up the discussion, reminding the retired neurosurgeon that the RNC had been rather transparent about their nominating process, and that those rules had been in place for quite a while. Mitchell pressed Carson: The rules surrounding the delegate selection have been clearly laid out in every state and territory and while each state is different, each process is easy to understand for those willing to learn it. Take note, Donald Trump is the PS, unspoken. Let s keep in mind that Trump has no one to blame but himself for not being prepared, and he made it easy for Cruz to win the state. Yet, Trump s team and his supporters are still crying foul, and Carson has been jumping on every bandwagon ever since Trump bribed him with a job in return for his endorsement and unwavering loyalty. In trying to criticize the guidelines, Carson made a startling comparison between the GOP s nominating rules and Jim Crow laws. Implying that the delegate process really was crooked and  rigged  against Trump, Carson said: During the Jim Crow era, those were the rules too. They were written everybody knew about them. Didn t make them right. And I m not saying this is the same. But, you know, I think you get the point. just because rules are there, just because they re written by somebody doesn t mean that they re right. It doesn t mean you can t review the system. There s some things we need to look at from a historical perspective. Why do we need the electoral college anymore? Stop and ask yourself, why was that put in place and do some same circumstances apply? Actually, they do not. We need to look at a lot of different things. You can watch Carson make this idiotic comment below:For Carson to compare Trump s completely fair Colorado loss to what African-Americans were forced to endure under Jim Crow is absolutely despicable. And yet, it might as well be expected of Trump and anyone who supports him  Carson isn t the only one to make this Jim Crow comparison. Another one of Trump s die-hard fans, Alex Jones,  also attacked the delegate -selection process in a similar manner. Jones said that Colorado s selection process  makes Jim Crow look like a blessing.

 Facebook Employees Asked Mark Zuckerberg If They Have A ‘Responsibility’ To Stop Trump,"Earlier this week, Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, long may he reign, praise be his name, holy is he, we bow down before him, subtly denounced racist, xenophobic hatemonger, Donald Trump, during a keynote speech at the company s annual F8 conference. While he never mentioned Trump by name, the tech god had plenty to say about Trump s nature. As I look around the world, I m starting to see people and nations turning inward, against the idea of a connected world and a global community,  Zuckerberg told the crowd. But then he targeted his verbal beatdown to Trump: I hear fearful voices talking about building walls  It takes courage to choose hope over fear. Instead of building walls we can help build bridges. Instead of dividing people we can connect people. We do it one person at a time, one connection at time. That s why I think the work we re doing together is more important than it has ever been before. Trump, and his moronic horde of jaded, hateful Teanuts, have all said these things, and worse. It takes courage to choose hope over fear,  Zuckerberg added.  People will always call you naive but it s this hope and optimism that s behind every important step forward. Zuckerberg s powerful words obviously struck a chord with employees, who voted to ask their CEO a very important question in a recent weekly Q+A: Do they have a moral obligation to stop Trump from rising to power? Gizmodo reports:Every week, Facebook employees vote in an internal poll on what they want to ask Zuckerberg in an upcoming Q&A session. A question from the March 4 poll was:  What responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017? A screenshot of the poll, given to Gizmodo, shows the question as the fifth most popular.It s not particularly surprising the question was asked, or that some Facebook employees are anti-Trump. The question and Zuckerberg s statements on Tuesday align with the consensus politics of Silicon Valley: pro-immigration, pro-trade, pro-expansion of the internet.This question could mean many things, depending on the level and nature of  help.  In the 2010 congressional elections, Facebook used its considerable influence to convince voters to show up at the polls. An estimated 340,000 extra people vote (unfortunately, not many of them were Democrats, who largely stayed home rather than perform their civic duty. Hint, hint, guys) thanks to an aggressive, one-day campaign that strong-armed users into getting off the couch to head to the polls. Could Facebook wage a similar war on Trump by utilizing a similar strategy to inform conservatives that he s the only man in recent history who chances being unfavorably compared to Hitler one day? Would such a thing be ethical, no matter the motivating reason?In 2014, the social media giant experimented with manipulating users  emotions. In a move that was widely decried by everyone the company removed either all positive or all negative posts from a good number of its users  news feeds in an effort to see how it would affect their emotions. Technically, we have all agreed to this sort of thing when we agreed to the data use policy, but no one was warned that they were part of the experiment, either. The result was as one would expect: more negative posts caused people to produce more negative posts. More positive led to more positive posts from users, and so on.Could the same be done with posts about Trump? Would showing people more negative Trump posts cause the overall sentiment   even among the most vapid who reside in Stupidville   toward Trump to shift? Could they use this method to influence voters? Once again, would it be ethical, even if it would accomplish something good? Gizmodo notes:What s exceedingly important about this question being raised and Zuckerberg s answer, if there is one is how Facebook now treats the powerful place it holds in the world. It s unprecedented. More than 1.04 billion people use Facebook. It s where we get our news, share our political views, and interact with politicians. It s also where those politicians are spending a greater share of their budgets.And Facebook has no legal responsibility to give an unfiltered view of what s happening on their network. Facebook can promote or block any material that it wants,  UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh told the publication.  Facebook has the same First Amendment right as the New York Times. They can completely block Trump if they want. They block him or promote him. Volokh says that the only way Facebook could legally overstep would be to collude with any candidate. If they were to choose to stamp out positive Trump posts, to create a blackout, they would have every legal right. If they were working with Sanders or Clinton, however, it would be a different issue: If Facebook was actively coordinating with the Sanders or Clinton campaign, and suppressing Donald Trump news, it would turn an independent expenditure (protected by the First Amendment) into a campaign contribution because it would be coordinated and that could be restricted.But if they re just saying,  We don t want Trump material on our site,  they have every right to do that. It s protected by the First Amendment. It is very clear that Facebook could take a number of actions to ensure that Trump stays as far from the White House as his fans are from reality. But, what if Zuckerberg decides the company does have a moral obligation? Unfortunately, given the secretive nature of the news feed (and their history of manipulating users), we likely won t know what, if anything, he would decide to do   at least not until after it has happened.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 National Republican Just Blamed Women For Assaults — Again (VIDEO),"Republican presidential candidate and current Ohio governor John Kasich made strange remarks about sexual assault during a town hall event in New York. Kasich echoed many conservatives and laid the blame on women for these crimes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8FqEIgQMW0Asked about the risk of campus sexual assault during a Friday campaign event, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) advised a female student not to  go to parties where there s a lot of alcohol. The Republican presidential candidate was hosting a town hall in Watertown, New York when a freshman student from St. Lawrence University asked how he would help her  feel safer and more secure regarding sexual violence, harassment, and rape,  according to ABC News.Simply going to a party where there s a lot of alcohol is not any kind of excuse for a woman being assaulted. Yet conservatives, who repeatedly have denied that there is a rape culture on many college campuses, have regularly cited how women are dressed or what sort of parties they attend when addressing this vital issue.By comparison, the Obama administration launched the  It s On Us  initiative to highlight the role men have to play in stopping sexual assault on campus. Vice President Joe Biden, who helped to author the Violence Against Women Act has often served as a spokesperson for the initiative.Despite the conservative pushback, progressive groups spearheaded by women s leadership have placed campus sexual assault on the top tier of issues to be dealt with by college officials as well as elected officials at the local, state, and federal levels.Increasingly views like Governor Kasich s that put the onus of responsibility on female victims are becoming the minority, while fathers, sons, and brothers have come to realize that blame is a weak and ineffective response.Republicans have found out more often than not, that their insensitive remarks about rape, abortion, and other issues affecting women have fed into the larger story of a  war on women,  and they end up losing elections.

 Former ‘Apprentice’ Contestants Unite AGAINST Trump – Issue BRUTAL Statements,"When you want to learn more about what a person is really like, talk to the people they have been around a lot. It s one thing to push a persona into the spotlight that has been sculpted to how one would like to be perceived,while it is quite another to get to the truth behind the actual person.So, when half a dozen former contestants from Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump s reality show  The Apprentice  come forward to issue statements condemning the candidate, we should all probably listen. Some of those who have come forward are the winner from Season 4, Randal Pinkett alongside Kwame Jackson who was runner-up in Season 1. They are also planning a press conference.According to Bloomberg: In statements, the contestants slammed Trump s rhetoric as divisive and accused him of running a  campaign of sexism, xenophobia, racism, violence and hate. Winning Project Manager from  The Apprentice,  Marshawn Evans Daniels said: Trump is passionately and strategically reigniting a dirty and divisive culture soaked in a history of prejudice, fear and hate. It is unpatriotic, anti-American, self-serving, regressive and downright lazy. Pinkett stated: As alums of  The Apprentice,  we have had the opportunity to work with Donald in various capacities, including as employees of the Trump Organization. Based on that experience and Donald s campaign, we do not believe he is worthy of becoming president of the United States. Of course, Trump responded to these criticisms in the most Trumpian way possible, and said the group of former contestants are  six failing wannabes. He said: How quickly they forget. Nobody would know who they are if it weren t for me They just want to get back into the limelight like they had when they were with Trump. Total dishonesty and disloyalty. They should be careful or I ll play hours of footage of them individually praising me. Ask how successful they ve been since they left. Six failing wannabes out of hundreds of contestants   so sad! A statement in response that pretty much proves the former contestants point of what a hateful, vindictive person Trump is. As you may have noticed, in Trump s mind, he s never wrong. It s always someone else s fault. It s always someone else doing something to him, and never ever the other way around. This is a true sign of an egomaniacal narcissist. It s amazing that he can fit his giant, braggadocios head through any door.We need to listen to these former contestants. They ve had to work with him, and aren t afraid to tell it like it is. Donald Trump cannot be our next president. It wouldn t only be bad for the nation, but the entire world.Featured Photo by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GQ Magazine: Obama Is One Of The Greatest Presidents Of Our Time,"Like Rolling Stone before them, GQ Magazine is hailing President Obama as one of the greatest presidents of our time. Calling him  20 dollar bill  great and  Mount Rushmore  great, GQ s Jim Nelson puts it plainly:Something is dawning on us it s almost too soon for us to admit, but it s there, a half-considered thought only now blooming in our brains. Maybe we dismiss it with one of those quick cognitive fly swats. Nah, too early to say or I hate that guy. But the truth is coming, and it sounds like this: Barack Obama will be inducted into the league of Great Presidents.In fact, Nelson is so confident that President Obama will be remembered as one of greatest presidents, that he predicts, in due time, Obama will overtake Clinton as the best one since FDR.Now that s a lot of confidence. But how can Nelson be certain of such a grand prediction? It s really, really simple: he got stuff done. He helped save the world and United States  economy, he signed into law Obamacare, his character was paramount in the face of unprecedented obstruction, and yes, he is the first black president. But there was one special, electrifying quality that President Obama gave us that the best of best have given us: his speeches. His ability to communicate and relate to the average American was unlike any other:With Obama, each thoughtful step of the way, from his soaring acceptance speech ( The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep ) to his epic speeches on race and religion, his responses to the shootings in Tucson and Newtown, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the opening of Cuba ( Todos somos Americanos! ),and countless other momentous occasions, he knew how to speak to our better angels at a time when it was hard to locate any angels.With his mesmerizing clout, President Obama was able to do what other before him   like LBJ, Clinton and FDR   did, and that was get things done. In an era when  getting things done  is a thing too often out of reach, President Obama overcame the odds.I agree completely with GQ   President Obama is one of the nation s finest presidents, and history will be very kind to him. As it should be.Photo by Joshua Lott/Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Israeli PM Netanyahu Quoted In Full Throated Support of Ethnically Cleansing Palestinians,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has always advocated for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, but has dressed himself up as someone who wants peace, all the while continuing to steal Palestinian land for Jewish settlements and to deny Palestinians their civil and political rights on lands in which Israel controls. In a November, 1989 speech, Netanyahu said: Israel should have exploited China s suppression of the demonstrations [Tienanmen Square], at a time when the world s attention was devoted to events in that country, in order to conduct mass expulsions of the Arabs [sic] of the Occupied Territories. However, to my sorrow, they [government ministers] didn t support the policy I espoused and whose implementation I continue to recommend. Most of the world knows Netanyahu is not a peace maker. Yet, Israeli apologists will argue that if only Israel would elect someone from other  moderate  parties in Israel, then he/she would take a softer stance on Palestinians and thus peace could be achieved. However, those who believe this nonsense are naive. Israel has a deep rooted culture of ethnic cleansing that dates back to the early Zionists and it is at the very core of today s Israel.When the first Zionist delegation came to Palestine from Europe in the 19th century looking to colonize the country and create their Jewish state, they declared that the  Bride is beautiful but she s married to another man,  meaning that there was already an existing people and culture in the country   the Palestinians. However, that didn t stop the Zionists from pursuing their agenda of wanting to create a Jewish state despite the fact that 97% of the population wasn t Jewish. We must keep in mind that the ideology of Zionism advocates not only for a Jewish state but the state must be majority Jewish. Thus, a major dilemma for the Zionists was how to create a majority Jewish state in a country where the majority of the population wasn t Jewish. The answer was to bring European Jews to the country on the one hand and to pursue the policy of ethnically cleansing Palestinians on the other.That Zionist culture of ethnic cleansing came into fruition in 1948. Despite massive European Jewish immigration into the country for 50 years, the Jewish population never reached a majority, accounting for about 30% of the population. Thus, in order to attain the majority Jewish state, David Ben-Gurion, who would later become Israel s first prime minister, unleashed Operation Plan Dalet, a campaign of ethnic cleansing that saw the destruction of hundreds of villages and the forced expulsion of close to a million Palestinians out of the country. Today, they and their descendants number in the millions.In 1967, Israel conquered the remaining 20% of Palestine, taking the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Despite the fact that close to 300,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed, the majority managed to remain on their lands and today the West Bank s 2.5 million Palestinians are a thorn in the side of the Zionists who have been building settlements in the heart of Palestinian communities throughout the West Bank and thirst for more Palestinian land. The United Nations considers Israel s presence in the West Bank and Gaza to be illegal and their building of settlements to be in violation of the fourth Geneva Conventions. Yet, Israel continues building, confiscating lands, blowing up Palestinian property to make way for Israeli expansion and then killing Palestinians when they complain and labeling them as terrorists when they resist.Calls for the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians continues to this day. While Netanyahu is currently the prime-minister, a new generation of Israelis have called for the violent removal of Palestinians. The calls for crimes against humanity are thus not isolated to a few politicians in Israel but are at the very fabric of the ideology of Zionism and its adherents.

 ‘Nobody Cares’: Watch Ted Cruz’s Humiliating Shun At Swanky NY GOP Fundraiser (TWEETS),"Thursday night saw the three remaining candidates for the GOP 2016 presidential nomination trying to woo high rolling donors at a swanky $1,000 per plate dinner at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan. This particular endeavor did not go well for creepy Texas Senator Ted Cruz. In fact, it was downright humiliating for him.You see, it seems that Cruz s  New York values  comment from the GOP debate when he was trying to slam Donald Trump has come back to bite him in the ass. While many people many have let the comment go, as it happened quite a few debates ago, Trump made sure that the New Yorkers at the dinner remember it clear as a bell. Trump, who spoke first, reminded the crowd, as he shamelessly used 9/11 to bolster the donors  pride in their city, as well as to slam Cruz: In our darkest moments as a city, we showed the world the very, very best in terms of bravery, heart and soul of America. These are the values we need to make America great again   to bring America together again  to heal America s wounds. To his detriment, Cruz was the last candidate to go on stage, and social media site Twitter lit up with photos and videos of the appalling lack of attention people were paying while he was speaking. There were people chatting, walking around, playing on their cell phones, and doing everything but listen to Cruz speak. Buzzfeed reporter Rosie Gray, who was at the event, tweeted: It s legitimately loud in here with people talking and eating and ignoring Cruz while he speaks. The Daily Beast s Olivia Nuzzi tweeted, It s sort of painful to watch someone speak passionately to a crowd who wouldn t even notice if he killed himself onstage,   with a picture of an attendee paying no attention to Cruz and surfing the web on his phone. Nuzzi went on to say,  Nobody cares. The Washington Post s Philip Rucker tweeted: Reaction at #nygop dinner to Cruz is embarrassing for both Cruz and the guests. Folks walking around, chatting w/ each other as he speaks. Here are shots of those tweets, complete with video:Reaction at #nygop dinner to Cruz is embarrassing for both Cruz and the guests.

 Five Women Donald Trump Allegedly Slept With And How They Utterly Humiliated Him,"Donald Trump obviously has a knack for purchasing beautiful women. His first wife, Ivana, was a model from the Czech Republic who was famous for gaudy accessories and over-spending. Trump cheated on her and eventually married Marla Maples, who may have actually loved him for some reason but grew tired of him and moved on with a good chunk of his money. His current wife, Melania, is yet another Eastern European model who loves the lavish lifestyle he provides for her.In between the women who have allowed him to buy them, after the millions of dollars in divorce costs, Trump has always declared himself something of a ladies man. He and his ahem giant hands have been telling stories of his conquests for decades. The problem is, just like everything else about Trump, the stories are mostly exaggerations, outright lies or rumors that he enjoyed a little bit too much to dispel in good conscience like a decent human being. Go figure. Here s a list of five of the famous women Donald Trump has lied about dating and how they humiliated him when they had made his list:The former Olympic champion ice-skater was 41-years-old and happily married when her supposed affair with The Donald happened. After The New York Daily News reported her as a possible Trump fling, she felt she needed to respond since Trump decided not to dispel the rumor: The reason I m going public with my outrage over this allegation is that I had hoped that Donald Trump would issue his own statement of the rumor being completely unfounded, and that has not happened quickly enough,  she said.  I ve been around Donald Trump four times in my life. I wouldn t even call him a good friend. Ouch. Even though that happened in 1990, you just know it still stings the orange man s ego.The Dynasty Star who played Princess Diana in two TV movies told People that there was no truth at all to the rumors she and Trump were an item. Again Trump remained silent, allowing himself to be associated with yet another beautiful woman far out of his league: [He s] a complete joke as far as I m concerned. I hardly know the man,  Oxenburg told People in 1990.And another one down. No wonder he allowed his actual affair with Maples to go public. His reputation was taking a severe beating.The cosmetics mogul refused to give any credence to the rumor she and Trump were a thing, dispelling it with a simple  I don t know what you re talking about,  when asked by People. Trump never attempted to call her out, because the rumors he allowed to continue were obviously not true.The prominent swimsuit model and wife of NHL star Ron Greschner never bothered to answer the allegations she was into Trump. She allowed her manager, Steve Gutstein, to do it for her instead: Donald Trump is a fortunate man, but he s not that fortunate. That s another one that had to just hurt. Trump could very well have avoided all of the humiliation by telling the truth about these rumors when they happened   or by not starting them if he was the source   but he instead rode the wave of ignorance that has carried him towards the Republican nomination 26 years later.The socialite and designer who was married to Trump s billionaire acquaintance Henry Kravitz (it s a well-established fact that Trump doesn t have friends), said the rumors were  ridiculous.  She added,  I m married to the greatest man in the world.  Those are words Trump has probably heard quite often himself   after he buys something extravagant.To his credit, there was one rumor Trump decided to debunk on his own. In the prime of Mike Tyson s career, Trump was accused of a fling with Robin Givens. It s not too difficult to figure out why.

 Cliven Bundy’s Cows Are Starving To Death Because He’s A Greedy Jackass,"Because he was such a greedy prick that decided that profiting was more important than smart conservation and management of resources, Cliven Bundy s herd of cows is rumored to be facing starvation: Since the early 1990s, cattle have been left to fend for themselves in the desert after Cliven Bundy, a private rancher, lost his privilege to graze on federal public lands that belong to all Americans. This once-small herd of around 150 animals has grown to hundreds or more over the course of 20+ years and now badly exceeds the ability of the land to feed and nourish them. They range over an immense area about half the size of the state of Rhode Island. While the area is large, it only receives about 4 inches of precipitation a year and vegetation is very sparse. Once upon a time, the west was wild and cattle ranchers let their cows do whatever the hell they wanted. And what cows want to do is eat. And eat. And keep eating until there s nothing left. This is called  overgrazing,  and it s really REALLY bad for both the land and the cows. If you eat all the grass, it stops growing and the dirt blows away (Think  Dust Bowl ). And then it takes a very long time (if ever) for the grass to come back which means the cows go hungry.The ranchers, being all rugged and individualistic, originally thought that they could keep a handle on it. After all, the ranchers knew that overgrazing was bad so they would have an incentive to conserve the commons.But then the ranchers learned that even though people as a group were smart enough to conserve, there was always individual assholes that would take advantage of the situation. They would let their herd graze an area to death s door and then move on to do it somewhere else, getting rich off of hogging the resources that was supposed to be shared by everyone.Enter the Bureau of Land Management. These awful evil big government types exist to keep the aforementioned assholes in check. What bastards!Of course, this infuriates people like Bundy who only see dollar signs and to hell with everyone else:Rob Mrowka, a senior scientist with the center, said by phone that Bundy had given up his grazing rights in 1993 and simply let his cows loose to reproduce, leading to the situation where hundreds are starving now. .Normally areas of the range are rotated for grazing, with periods of rest to let it grow back, but Mrowka said the cattle  are there 24/7, 365 days.This is why Bundy was forever letting his cows go onto public land to eat OUR grass for free. Why worry about keeping your own land in good condition when you can make money by stealing the resources (grass is a staple food source for cows, making it a resource) from the public?In the process, Bundy is destroying the habitat of the endangered desert tortoise, but so what? He was making a hefty amount of money and that s all that mattered to him.This sense of entitlement and narcissism is why he s rotting in jail and will probably be there for the rest of his life. So sad.Meanwhile, now we have to deal with his starving cows before they actually start to die. Letting them suffer is unconscionable. We just have to hope that no one starts shooting at the federal agents that go to round them up before it s too late.Featured image of a random starving cow via Getty ",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch Bill O’Reilly Lose It After A Fox News Poll Delivers Terrible News For The GOP (VIDEO),"Bill O Reilly refused to believe the findings of a poll conducted by his own news organization on Thursday night, because it was simply too bad for him to contemplate. According to the poll, Democraict candidate Bernie Sanders would beat ALL current GOP contenders for President.While endorsing all other sections of the poll, which supported his views, O Reilly flat out loses it with the section which doesn t. The section shows that that Sanders beats Trump by 14 points, Ted Cruz by 12 points, and narrowly defeats John Kasich by 4 points.  It s also not the first poll to show this sort of result.Nevertheless, O Reilly wasn t willing to tolerate such information, which flies in the face of his own views on the electability of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. He appeals to his fellow Fox News veterans Geraldo Rivera and Dana Perino to join him in denouncing the results. Rivera immediately obliges, calling the findings:  pie in the sky,  while Perino makes sympathetic noises.But it s not enough to quell the perplexed O Reilly, who turns to camera saying: I don t believe it, And I have to say, with all due respect the Fox News poll has been good I don t believe this. I just don t. The incident is a perfect example of the phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance. As Chris Mooney explains in Mother Jones:the concept of cognitive dissonance has been well established in psychology and even, to some extent, embedded in public consciousness. Basically, when the mind is faced with an idea that is threatening to one s identity or sense of self an idea that induces unpleasant dissonance one tends to try to either avoid the thought or, perhaps, reinterpret it into something unthreatening or positive.This urge is also known to affect conservatives to a far greater degree than liberals.This doesn t mean every conservative is less likely to open their minds to information which challenges their world view than every liberal, it simply follows the overall trend.It is a major obstacle in the way of liberals seeking to change the minds of conservatives, as whichever way they appeal   it is rejected. If liberals appeal in terms of reason and evidence   their case is rejected the moment it creates cognitive dissonance. However, if liberals move into more emotive arguments, these are often rejected on the basis of confirming to  naive idealism  stereotypes by conservatives. So liberals are painted as either policy wonks with no humanity, or airy fairy liberals with no common sense.Meanwhile, the most ridiculous arguments put forward within the normalised conservative worldview go unchallenged, requiring minimal or no evidence, such as Mexico paying for Trump s border wall for example. Mexico has stated on the record this will not happen, and yet it remains fact among Trump supporters. There is little doubt that if the Fox poll had shown Donald Trump or Ted Cruz beating Sanders and Clinton in a head-to-head   O Reilly would have considered it water tight.This is something for us to all watch in our own behavior. Do we demand the same level of evidence for arguments that conform to our world view, as those which do not? If the answer is no, then we are no better. If we want a cleaner, better politics   it starts with us.

 81-Year-Old Cuban Run Over By Racist A$$hole,"Florida continues to lead the nation in head shaking insanity after 81-year-old Luis Angel Dominguez, affectionately known to his neighbors as  Papi,  was deliberately run and killed over by a 26-year-old after an argument.As reported by the Washington Post:According to Broward County police, Dominguez and a younger man got into an argument at Everglades Holiday Park on Wednesday night. The younger man, whom police have identified as 26-year-old Kyle Christopher Hannover, was at the park fishing when he allegedly started yelling racial slurs at Dominguez and threw a rock at Dominguez s car.Hannover then allegedly got into his Ford Ranger truck and drove directly toward Dominguez, striking him. He was completely rolled over from the suspect s car and trailer,  a witness told ABC.  When I called 911 it was,  No ambulance.  It was,  Get a trauma chopper out here as quickly as possible. Unsurprisingly, Hannover has a history of violence. In 2015, he was arrested and for allegedly threatening his girlfriend with a shotgun. Considering how disturbed he is, it s amazing that she survived long enough for him to be arrested. As a result of his threats, his guns were confiscated as part of his plea deal this past March. I can only assume that s why Hannover didn t simply shoot Dominguez instead of sadistically running him over.The cause of the fight is unclear and, honestly, is irrelevant. There is literally no justification for a 26-year-old to run over a senior citizen in a rage. The only upshot to this entire incident is that Hannover will probably be about the same age when he gets out of prison.His step-granddaughter Damaris Riveron expressed her gratitude to the police: We re extremely happy there has been an arrest, Thank you to the police department for all of their hard work and for everyone who contributed. Domiguez is survived by his wife, his children and his grandchildren.Featured courtesy of Vivian Sanchez",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Maddow DESTROYS Trump’s ‘Dangerous’ Move In His Most Hateful Campaign Stop Yet (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is running a campaign that does nothing but tap into the hateful underbelly of American populism. However, this time, it seems the guy has gone to a new low, when nobody believed it possible. Rachel Maddow took Trump to task for a disturbing campaign stop he made in Suffolk County New York   which just happens to be where a Latino immigrant was murdered in an anti-immigrant hate crime. The crime happened in November 2008, just as we were electing President Barack Obama for the first time.Maddow says of Trump s decision to stop there: In presidential politicking, symbolism is a deliberate choice. And racial provocation is something with a deep and resonant history. It is one thing to do that as a small-fry politician; it is another thing to do it as a front-runner for a major party s presidential nomination. Being a presidential front-runner is a powerful thing. It can also be a dangerous thing if you want it to be. Trump chose to stop in Patchogue, New York, right near where 37-year-old Marcel Lucero was murdered by a gang of racist teenagers. One of the teens, Jeffrey Conroy, is currently serving 25 years in prison for manslaughter. The prosecution also got him convicted of a hate crime. Further, it was discovered, aftr Lucero s death and the reasoning behind it came to light, that it was just the most brutal in a long line of attack on Latino immigrants. Maddow continued: Patchogue s history of racist and fatal hate crimes against Latino immigrants is not necessarily a nationally-famous story. But it is a New York-famous story. Donald Trump has not yet won the Republican nomination   he s still trying to win the New York primary   but campaigning in Patchogue today on the street where Marcelo Lucero was murdered, it means something specific in New York. Now, considering what happened at that site and considering Trump s heavy, divisive, and dangerous anti-immigrant rhetoric, there can be no questions what kind of message the current GOP frontrunner was trying to send with that particular campaign stop, and it is a dangerous one.If even one immigrant winds up being attacked by a Trump supporter after this, The Donald himself needs to be held responsible.Watch the video below, courtesy of MSNBC. The Trump remarks start at 11:43.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch ‘Donald Trump’ Hilariously Push Cruz To Booze On The Tonight Show (VIDEO),"With all the candidates from both parties in New York preparing for the primary next Tuesday, it s no surprise that they are making the late night talk show rounds. Appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Ted Cruz  got a call  from  Donald Trump  offering him advice for the show appearance, and questioning him about some of his policy positions.As crazy as Cruz is, the sketch actually turned out pretty funny with digs being taken at both the GOP candidates. One of the funniest moments was when Cruz mentioned that the party is starting to unify behind him, yet Trump cut in to remind Cruz that the party is also unifying behind himself   unifying against him. Which is becoming more and more obvious as the weeks and months go by leading up the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.When  Trump  questioned Cruz on his  New York values  remark, Cruz responded by saying that what he meant to say was that he  values New York,  but he was just speaking like Yoda from Star Wars.At one point in the sketch Trump was offering Cruz some advice on how to get around New York. When Trump asked the Texas senator if he was writing it down, Cruz responded in the affirmative, but then pulled out a bottle of booze, poured himself a glass, and then took a sip. Something that likely needs to be done while speaking with the actual Donald Trump, or for that matter, Cruz as well.All in all, no matter how much you may loathe Cruz, and if you re like me you loathe Cruz, it was still a pretty damn funny sketch with Fallon s Trump getting better and better. However, hopefully after November we won t need to see him play the Republican frontrunner anymore, because a Democrat is going to win.Watch the silly sketch here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 North Carolina ‘Christian’ Left Death Threat As ‘Tip’ For Gay Waitress,"Recently, North Carolina passed dangerous legislation that blocked anti-discrimination ordinances. Many have expressed fears that the new legislation, which arose in response to the city of Charlotte taking steps to ensure that the LGBT community would enjoy equal protection under the law, would embolden the more extreme segments of the alleged  Christian  population to act out their hateful fantasies. Unfortunately, any who feared this may be the case were correct.On Tuesday, one group of Christian bigots proved the need to establish anti-discrimination laws when they left a chilling note for a lesbian waitress at a Charlotte restaurant   a death threat in the form of a Bible verse.Alexandra Judd, a waitress at Zada Janes, says that the group of stand-up, God-fearing individuals showed their Christian love by leaving the disturbing note in lieu of a tip. Instead of $3.45, the customary 15% tip on a $23 order, they simply wrote  Lev. 20:13. This verse is special among religious bigots, and it is often used to allow them to express their hatred and even threaten people while  excusing their actions by claiming they are simply exercising their First Amendment right to religious expression. If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination,  the verse reads.  They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. In other words, the group of loving  Christians  told the waitress she should be executed   something that might land anyone else in jail if they said that sort of thing to a random person on the street. But, since they were just expressing their  religious freedom,  this sort of horrific statement typically gets a pass in our society. Praying for you,  the Christians added at the bottom   a statement that often accompanies this sort of violent and hateful expression. I never expected a hateful gesture like this,  Judd said.  I ve had a guest leave me a pamphlet to their church as a tip one time, but I didn t feel as if they were being hateful towards me. The ladies that came in were very rude, and would hardly talk to me   but I never expected this. I ve heard of people leaving fake money, or writing funny stuff in the tip spot of a check but never believed it would happen to me, in the way that it did,  she added.Christians often leave fake $20 bills (and other denominations) to trick servers into thinking they have received a great tip. When the server unfolds the bill, he or she discovers a Bible verse. This is horrible, especially given the low wages in the service industry and the unfortunate fact that waitstaff often depend on tips to survive, but nor nearly as bad as a thinly-veiled death threat.Despite what could easily be called a hate crime if North Carolina did not enact legislation to protect the Faithful who choose to do this sort of thing, Judd remains resilient. I don t care what anyone says, this is the most disrespectful thing you can do,  she wrote on Facebook.  Don t pray for me darling, I have everything I could possibly want and need in my life.

 Hillary SLAMS CNN For Ignoring One Of The Most Important Issues In The Election (VIDEO),"At the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday night, Hillary Clinton brought the event to a complete standstill as she called out the CNN debate moderators for ignoring and downplaying the critical issue of abortion. The debate had gone on for nearly an hour and a half by the time Clinton made her statement, and the vital woman s health issue had gone unmentioned, as it mostly has for all the previous debates.Clinton wasn t having it, and she let loose: We ve not had one question about a woman s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question,  Clinton said.  And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women s rights. We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished and we are never asked about this. The statement was greeted with loud applause and cheers.Clinton noted the issue  goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.  Senator Bernie Sanders added that as president he would  take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman s right to choose. Unfortunately, on the Republican side, abortion has come up as a topic of discussion. Donald Trump said that under a scenario in which abortion had ideally become illegal, there would need to be some sort of mechanism in place to punish women who have undergone the procedure. At the same time, Senator Ted Cruz has been campaigning alongside anti-abortion extremists who have spoken out in favor of anti-abortion terrorists. And Cruz is on record as opposing abortion in all circumstances, even in the case of a pregnancy caused by rape or incest, provisions which past anti-choice Republicans have even given in on.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 15, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Oops! Trump’s Top Surrogate Can’t Even Vote For Him – Because He’s a Democrat (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has had a hell of a week having to accept that his closest friends and loved ones are abandoning him in his mission to single-handedly destroy America.Earlier this week, Trump s own kids   Ivanka and Don   broke the news that they won t be voting for their father in the primary. Today, another harsh blow was delivered to Trump   his top surrogate, Michael Cohen, has just revealed that he won t be voting for the business mogul either   because he s actually registered as a Democrat!Cohen made this confession on Thursday night to CNN hosts John Berman and Kate Bolduan, who were absolutely shocked by this news. In speaking about RNC chair Reince Priebus and the nominating process, Cohen let it slip that he wasn t really on Trump s side after all. Cohen, who is actually the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, complained about the so-called  rigged  delegate rules and said: I think Reince Priebus has an obligation not just to the RNC but really to the American people.  . He s supposed to keep the Republican Party unified. That s what his job really is. And he s not doing that, and he s doing a terrible job at it. Do I personally, as a voter, as a supporter of Mr. Trump, believe that the process is rigged? I do. I think that the   establishment does not want Mr. Trump to be the nominee. Me, personally, I m actually a registered Democrat. So I don t really care about Reince Priebus. Berman and Bolduan hardly expected this response and freaked out. Berman cried, Wait! You can t vote?!   and Bolduan did a double take, asking,  You re not voting for Donald Trump?! Cohen pretty much dismissed their questions and simply replied,  Not in the primary. Amused, Berman recalled how strange it was that Trump s biggest so-called supporters wouldn t actually be supporting him at all. Berman said, So his kids can t vote, and you can t vote in the primary. Cohen tried to cover up how baffling the entire situation was by launching into a bizarre conversation about how he wished Trump could be his father. Cohen said: Well, I d like to be one of his children. I d like to be one of them, but no, I m not voting in the primary. I m a registered Democrat. Berman still couldn t get over how the candidate s own family and supporters wouldn t be voting for him. Berman shook his head and said: Man, he s losing votes from his family and the people who work for him. Then, in a rant ignorant enough to be mistaken for something Trump himself might say, Cohen dismissed Berman s concerns and claimed that Trump didn t need those votes anyway. Cohen, who previously supported Obama in 2008, bragged: You don t have to worry about Mr. Trump. He s polling at 50 plus percent. This is his hometown.

 Trump Just Sunk Himself In Pennsylvania With This Gaffe About A Child Sex Scandal,"Trump made a visit to the Keystone State in an effort to bolster his numbers for the upcoming Pennsylvania Republican primary election. While there, he managed to prove just how utterly CLUELESS he is about literally anything that happens in the state in two very huge ways, which you will see below.First came Trump s incredibly outdated remark about bringing back the steel industry s lost jobs to the state. Pennsylvania had a long history of major steel manufacturing, but the majority of it was lost decades ago. The jobs literally have been gone in many areas of the state for more than 20 years, and Trump thinks that him arguing with China will bring them back.As a Pennsylvanian myself, I can tell you it s really something that blue-collar and middle-class people do not forgive easily. Making what amounts to an ignorant mockery of an issue that many in the state still feel betrayed over due to massive outsourcing of industry from America, will hit Trump badly   especially among his somewhat aged voter demographics that lived through those days of economic collapse.If you thought that was bad, you haven t seen anything yet. Trump then went on to say something even more offensive about Penn State Football.Trump asked people at the gathering,  How s Joe Paterno? Are we gonna bring that back? How about that whole deal? The silence afterwards could have been cut with a hatchet.Here is just a short list of what s wrong with Trump s statement. Joe Paterno died in 2012. We won t be bringing him back. That  whole deal  Trump is talking about is a child sex scandal that was covered up within the Penn State football program, where a member of the staff was literally having sex with children on campus property. Joe Paterno was forced out over it.Literally EVERYONE in PA knows this. Penn State football is like a religion to many in the state, and for Trump to say what he did shows how ignorant he is about Pennsylvania. Insulting Penn State football is something literally nobody ever did in order to win an election in the state. I can t wait to see how this turns out for him on primary day. What a joke.Watch Trump suggest he wants to bring back a child sex scandal below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Join Forces To Sue Arizona For Voter Suppression,"While the New York primary election has unleashed harsh sentiments from both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns, it appears that the two are putting their differences aside to join forces in suing Arizona over its suppressive tactics with regards to voting in March.According to the Washington Post, the suit will focus exclusively on Maricopa County, where citizens had to wait as long as seven hours to vote due to a drastic cut in polling locations   from 200 in 2012 down to 60 this election.The suit accuses Arizona officials of launching a massive effort to suppress the vote, saying the  alarmingly inadequate number of voting centers resulted in severe, inexcusable burdens on voters countywide, as well as the ultimate disenfranchisement of untold numbers of voters who were unable or unwilling to wait in intolerably long lines. The suit also singled out the fact that black, Hispanic and Native American voters were especially burdened, and will ask the Court to  review the polling location plan for the November election  to ensure that mass disenfranchisement doesn t happen again.The suit is being filed in the US District Court in Phoenix by Marc Elis on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Arizona Democratic Party and individual Democratic leaders in the state. After it s filed. both the Sanders and Clinton campaign will sign on.Elias is a member of Clinton s general counsel and is a prominent DC elections lawyer, who formally worked a general counsel position with John Kerry and Al Franken. Elias also was a litigator on voting rights and redistricting lawsuits in Virginia, Ohio, Nevada, Minnesota, New York, Wisconsin, Texas, Florida and North Carolina.A Department of Justice investigation is currently underway, a move lobbied by the Democratic mayor of Phoenix Greg Stanton.When Democrats join forces, this what happens   they tackle the issues that effect average Americans who want to get ahead and be a part of the process. While Republicans openly celebrate suppressing the vote, Democrats want to expand it.Perhaps Democrats should do a little less fighting and a little more unifying like we re seeing in Arizona.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Sarah Palin Humiliates Herself By Picking A Fight With Bill Nye: He’s ‘As Much A Scientist As I Am’,"After learning that Bill Nye had been very publicly demolishing her new climate change denial movie, Sarah Palin lashed out at the beloved science communicator with the ultimate insult   saying he s as dumb as she is.In what might be the most mismatched battle of intellect in history, Palin and Nye have recently gone toe-to-toe over an upcoming documentary meant to prove climate change is a lie called  Climate Hustle.  The film is produced by infamous right-wing climate denier Marc Morano and is billed as the long-awaited  response  to Al Gore s Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth. Palin, a woman whose catchphrase is  Drill, baby, drill  is the film s chief promoter.For a brief moment it appeared that Nye would actually get a chance to debate Palin over climate science face-to-face, however the deal quickly fell through. The two sides have been trading barbs online ever since. Nye seemingly put the matter to rest with a final Facebook post in which he explained: Marc Morano did not invite me to his movie but he said I refused to come after he did invite me   he was making that up,  Nye said in a video posted on his Facebook page. It s disingenuous, at best. Morano did interview Nye and a clip in which he humiliates himself by refusing to put his money where his mouth is with a simple $20,000 bet quickly went viral.Never one to know when to keep her mouth shut, Palin has now jumped into the fray and hilariously tried to attack Nye s credibility by comparing it to her own.As The Hill caught at an event on Capitol Hill:Palin, the former governor of Alaska and the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, said the man known for his show  Bill Nye the Science Guy,  is using his position of authority to harm children by teaching them that climate change is real and man-made.Palin said behind the  alarmism  that the climate is changing is a  predetermined  and political agenda  of those, I think, who are controlling the narrative right now on changes in the weather. The irony of a half-term governor and now reality television star criticizing Bill Nye for his science credentials is rich. And while Nye doesn t currently work as a research scientist, he received a Bachelors of Science from Cornell in mechanical engineering and spent his early career teaching astronomy and ecology courses at the college level. Furthermore, he s been honored with dozens of prestigious awards for his work at being an effective communicator of science (a job that is sorely needed). He s dedicated his life to passing along oftentimes complex scientific ideas in a way that is digestible and fun.In terms of climate science, Nye isn t a leading authority doing the cutting edge research   but he listens to the people who are. Palin, of course, hasn t bothered to listen to a scientist once in her career. Instead, she s latched onto Morano, a man who viciously smeared respected climatologists to push his climate denial agenda. Before being humiliated by Nye during his own interview, Morano s last claim to fame was appearing on Fox News to complain that Google was unfairly discriminating against his articles by fact-checking them.Who would you trust?Featured image via Getty ",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fox News Will NEVER Be Able To Say ‘Fair And Balanced’ Again After What Hannity Just Did (AUDIO),"There is a saying    In Politics, a gaffe is when you accidentally tell the truth.  With that in mind, Sean Hannity just committed the most epic of gaffes during his own radio show when he forgot everything and admitted the truth about not only himself but Fox News as well.The issue being discussed was Hannity s softball interviews with Donald Trump. While most of the Republican establishment are doing everything they can to stop Trump, Hannity has been practically turning over his own show to Trump for his propaganda purposes in every interview he conducts with him.Hannity has gotten some recent blowback on this behavior and took it VERY personally. It got him so worked up and upset, that in a moment of anger-fueled honesty he blurted out,  I m not a journalist!  Well, look who hit the final stage of grief   acceptance.Sean finally admitted the thing he s been denying for years; the fact that he s nothing but a screaming loser who has as much journalistic ability as a rotten egg. I ll be honest, if I m interviewing Hillary Clinton, it s going to be 100 times harder than any Republican, because I believe the Republicans have a far better vision, one that I agree with. I just have less disagreement with them. I m not a journalist, I m a talk show host. Fair and Balanced?   The hell you say!It surely has to be uncomfortable for the Fox News executives in charge of Hannity to be put into this pickle. He s a huge cash cow for them, yet now he s admitting that not only himself   but Fox News by extension in their employment of him   are nothing but hacks stirring a huge stinking pot of propaganda stew that they force feed gullible Americans every night.Listen to Hannity destroy that final scrap of his credibility below:Featured image via youtube screen capture",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary’s ‘Environmental Justice’ Plan Is The Kind Of Kick Ass Policy We’ve Been Waiting For,"On Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate and front runner Hillary Clinton released a clear and very detailed plan for dealing with the epidemic of lead and toxic waste poisoning that is affecting millions of Americans, many of them poor and/or minorities:Exposure to pesticides and chemicals has been linked to childhood cancer, and the likelihood of such exposure can depend on where children live. For example, in the Manchester neighborhood of Houston, which is 85 percent Latino and where 27 schools are within one mile of a high-risk chemical facility, children who attend public schools are 56 percent more likely to get leukemia than those who live 10 miles away.Simply put, this is environmental racism. And the impacts of climate change, from more severe storms to longer heat waves to rising sea levels, will disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities, which suffer the worst losses during extreme weather and have the fewest resources to prepare.Undoubtedly, this will be sneered at as pandering but since Clinton s strongest supporters are, in fact, minorities and the poor, the word  constituents  seems more appropriate.The title of the blueprint is Hillary Clinton s Plan to Fight for Environmental and Climate Justice, and contains several concrete steps that are guaranteed to leave corporate polluters foaming at the mouth:Here, Clinton cites the man-made disaster unfolding at Flint, Michigan in which (insanely) no one broke any existing laws, a judge giving polluters in West Virginia a slap on the wrist and Donald Blankenship receiving only 1 year of jail for killing 29 miners by ignoring safety regulations. Each example is a case of the system coddling corporate criminals and throwing the public s health and safety under the bus.Here s the solution:Clinton will work with Congress to update our environmental, public health, and safety laws by enhancing the criminal provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act, adding criminal provisions to the Lead Disclosure Rule, improving the lead inspection standards of the Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule, and increasing the penalties for violations of the Mine Safety and Health Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act so that they are felonies that carry the possibility of serious jail time.In other words, no more free passes to corporations that poison us to make a little more profit. Big government? Damn right it is! We formed a government to protect us from the depredations of the rich and powerful. It s about time it started to take that responsibility seriously.America has a serious infrastructure problem. Specifically, Republicans have stopped allowing us to keep our infrastructure from crumbling. Why? Because infrastructure spending, while vitally important, is also really REALLY good for local economies. You can t outsource replacing old pipes so all of that money spent goes right into the economy instead of the pockets of a few multinational corporations.Republicans also don t care because rich communities don t suffer from this problem:Aging and inadequate wastewater systems discharge more than 900 billion gallons of untreated sewage a year, posing health risks to humans and wildlife, disrupting ecosystems, and disproportionately impacting communities of color. Clinton has a $275 billion plan to invest in modernizing American infrastructure, including drinking and wastewater infrastructure, and will work with states, municipalities, and the private sector to bring our water systems into the 21st century and ensure that all Americans have access to clean, safe drinking water.That s $275 billion to make our drinking water clean again AND help the economy at the same time. Republicans will fight it but how much more political damage can they take? Is blocking clean water for children really a hill to die on?Flint is not the only place to suffer from lead poisoning and drinking water is not the only way to get it. Old schools and buildings still have lead paint, placing children at risk:The ongoing tragedy in Flint has put a spotlight on the urgency of this crisis, but Flint is not alone. More than 535,000 children are poisoned by lead in the United States, and children of color are more likely to be poisoned than white children.Clinton is pledging $5 billion just in federal spending to deal with this blight. And, again, as a bonus, all of that money spent goes right into the local economy. .There s (a lot) more and it s just as well thought out. I encourage you to read the entire thing, it s fantastic. From expanding public transportation to investing heavily in green energy, Clinton has developed a comprehensive strategy to dealing with several major issues confronting America. This is the kind of leadership we can expect from someone who s spent a lifetime serving the public and something we can all get behind.Featured image via Getty ",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" When Asked What His Favorite Bible Lesson Is, Trump Settles On The One With Facial Mutilation","Of all the biblical teachings Donald Trump could choose from, the Republican front-runner landed on the one best known for telling people to be vindictive.Donald Trump was a guest on WHAM 1180 AM when he got a question that by now he should have prepared for and somehow still clearly hasn t: What s your favorite Bible verse? Trump s flailing response speaks volumes.When host Bob Lonsberry asked him what passage particularly  informed  his character, Trump stumbled around before finally landing on  eye for an eye. Well, I think many. I mean, when we get into the Bible, I think many, so many. And some people, look, an eye for an eye, you can almost say that. That s not a particularly nice thing. The adage goes that crimes should be punished by committing an equally severe punishment on the transgressor. If a victim loses an eye, then the assailant should have his ripped out. Notably, the New Testament is steadfastly against this form of justice. Even worse, Trump may very well think the founder of Christianity was weak for not agreeing with him. Jesus Christ famously condemned the practice and instead suggested people learn to turn the other cheek. You have heard that it was said,  AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.  But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. The  eye for an eye  model isn t even unique to Judeo-Christian tenets. Long before Judaism, the Sumerians were doing the same. Needless to say, in the intervening thousands of years, legal codes and moral philosophers have evolved beyond this crude form of punishment. It seems part of Making America Great Again means rewinding ethical progress by about 4,000 years.During his interview he pivoted from the Bible to saying America is an embarrassment for not being more vengeful. If you look at what s happening to our country, I mean, when you see what s going on with our country, how people are taking advantage of us, and how they scoff at us and laugh at us. And they laugh at our face, and they re taking our jobs; they re taking our money; they re taking the health of our country.And we have to be firm and have to be very strong. And we can learn a lot from the Bible, that I can tell you. Astonishingly, this isn t even the first time Trump has gotten a softball religious question and managed to strike out. Earlier, he said his favorite quote from the Bible was  never bend to envy  a line which does not appear in the Bible. In this respect, Trump is getting a bit better. At least the things he s citing now actually exist   even if they are the values Jesus deliberately spoke out against.But then who can blame Trump for being biblically illiterate, isn t there something in there about Heaven, camels, eyes of needles, and billionaire real estate tycoons?Featured image by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Meet The Man Behind All The Anti-LGBT Laws Nationwide, You May Recognize Him (VIDEO)","When hatred takes human form, it looks a lot like the founder and chairman of the Liberty Counsel Mathew Staver. You may recognize him as the lawyer for the infamous Kentucky County Clerk Kim Davis who refused to do her job because her hatred was too big a burden to bear so she chose prison instead. She just couldn t stand the thought of two loving people of the same gender getting married, so she showed us just a taste of what was about come in terms of hating the LGBT community. And she had Staver as her equally bigoted lawyer.What s come since Davis  hissy fit has been a string of anti-LGBT bills disguised as  religious freedom  laws, and Staver is the man behind the hate nationwide. CBS News investigated and came to find out that it s been Staver leading this zealous crusade. From laws prohibiting transgender individuals from using the proper bathroom to allowing businesses the right to refuse service to the LGBT community, Staver has been there through it all. Yet, he cleverly words his hatred as such: It is only about being free to pursue your faith. We have no interest in discriminating against anyone. No, Staver, the First Amendment already guarantees your freedom to pursue your faith, what you re doing is helping states all across the nation write laws to specifically discriminate against LGBT individuals. You are making it legal to deny service or evict tenants based on sexual orientation. This legislated hate is taking away the freedom of LGBT citizens to grant the freedom to legally discriminate to religious zealots afraid gay money has gay cooties. And God forbid a transgender person needs to pee.Oh, and get this, Staver doesn t think businesses are really going to pull out of the states that have enacted these laws. He s supposedly calling their  bluff.  He s about to be in for a rude awakening, because being on the wrong side of history has never boded well for any bigot. His hatred for the gay community is bizarre. If he wants freedom, live and let live. It really can be that easy.Watch the story from CBS News:Featured Photo by Ty Wright/Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" TIME Magazine Runs Pro-Trump Propaganda Cover, Stuns Everyone With Sheer Stupidity","What happened to TIME Magazine? The iconic news periodical has reached what may be an all-time low with a cover so bloated with pro-Trump agitprop that it s astonishing it ever made it off of the editor s desk. Yikes.This week, TIME readers will be greeted with a bright red cover with huge letters proclaiming, as Trump has often said, that America is bankrupt and needs pay off its debt or else face doom. To make the connection to Trump even more explicit, the subtitle is: Make America Solvent Again.The problem, as economists were quick to point out, is that almost everything about this cover is meant to terrify the ignorant and obscure the truth. It s fear-mongering plain-and-simple. It plays right into Trump s hands.New TIME cover addresses the national debt. pic.twitter.com/Ty4wyCBbdV  Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) April 14, 2016For economists, the cover is mind-numbingly stupid. As Mat Yglesias at Vox carefully explained, there are major problems with every facet of the argument. For starters, given how wealth inequality works, averaging the debt across all Americans is a nonsensical way of calculating how debt-ridden the country is. You don t owe $43,000, and companies and billionaires (like Trump) owe even more.Under the circumstances, it s true that dividing up the debt burden evenly among all households would be an enormous burden on many Americans. But there is no reason to divide the burden up this way. The way the federal government finances things is it collects more money from the people who have more money.There s also the fact that this  debt  is often owed to other Americans. The United States borrows from itself a lot giving the illusion of a deep deficit to foreign powers, when really the money is changing hands within the boundaries of the country the whole time. Part of paying off our debt would include cutting a check to ourselves.But perhaps worst of all,  solvency  doesn t mean what TIME wants you to think it means. The American economy is the most powerful in the world (and has grown a lot since the darkest days of the Great Recession), which means paying our debts hasn t been a problem. In fact, the only time creditors began to panic over America s debt was when Republicans in Congress floated the idea of defaulting on them to prove a political point. The antics earned America a drop in its credit rating   not because creditors believed it couldn t pay, but because they worried Republicans simply wouldn t pay.Unfortunately, none of this is made clear by TIME. Instead, people who glance over to a magazine rack in the coming weeks will see the kind of message that Donald Trump has played up: America is broke and pathetic and needs to be made  great  again with his powers of dealmaking. This is simply not true. And on the flip side, many economists have warned that a Trump presidency would hurl the world into crisis, as he has routinely floated the idea of starting trade wars with countries he doesn t like. An event like that really could have the power to destroy America s economy in a way that would be difficult to ever recover from.By enabling a Trump talking point, TIME owes the country an apology. Scare tactics and misleading information are what Trump does best, and he doesn t need any help from a magazine many people trust.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Occupy Wall Street Is Getting The Band Back Together To Rally Behind A New Leader,"It s been five years since Occupy Wall Street was torn apart by order of New York Mayor Bloomberg. After the arrest of 240 members and their official eviction from Zuccotti Park, the original occupiers went their separate ways, many to form other grassroots political movements all across America. The Occupy name has since been used for protests not just across the country but all over the globe, making the movement one of the most influential in recent history.Those original organizers, who seemed so disorganized and impromptu, have decided to come back together to carry the banner of their new leader, Bernie Sanders, a man who gives their movement more meaning and a new ray of hope. Sanders, whose favorite talking points include breaking up Wall Street and the big banks, talks of the one percent with the same contempt as Occupy, making them a perfect fit for one another.Where there was little but banners and protests there is now an impressive organization forming that will work closely with the senator s campaign to help get out the vote for the New York primary next week. They plan to engage in a massive canvassing campaign that will ultimately turn into a banner waving, occupy-inspired march through Manhattan this weekend. Organizer Winny Wong, one of the original campers in Zuccotti Park said: This is the place where the message of income inequality resonated across the country and across the world   it s where it really began. He s bringing it back home. Wong is the creator of the  people for Bernie  movement that sparked the flames of hope for so many and inspired the  Feel The Bern  hashtag. Together with other now-famed activists like Charles Lenchner and Beka Economopoulos, the occupy movement has a new home in their favorite city, a new leader and a boatload of hope. Lenchner told CNN: Occupy was a reaction to the financial collapse, to what happened because of Wall Street s power to destroy the economy, and Bernie s campaign is the one that has been consistently focused on the role of the  1 Percent,  large corporations and financial institutions. It s a very natural connection. So it is. The Sanders campaign has raised oodles of money from small, private donors giving what most candidates see as pocket change, with none coming from massive super PACs that have been raising money since the dawn os time. Sanders has proven time and time again that he s a man of the people and he has the voting record to prove it. Had it not been for the senator from Vermont, the occupiers might have been a group of soul discorporated from their body of beliefs forever,Featured image by Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch These Fox Hosts Get REALLY Mad They Can’t Force Themselves On Women (VIDEO),"It looks as though there are still men who think forcing themselves on women should be perfectly acceptable. There are clearly also still men who feel the need to defend men who force themselves on other women, and speak out against programs that require consent.Yes, folks. This is the United States of America in the year 2016.On Thursday, Fox News Business host Stuart Varney had fellow Fox flunky Andrew Napolitano on to discuss the  yes means yes  movement and Harvard s secret society of all-male clubs who stated that women can t be involved because men can keep it in their pants. I m sorry, because the men may be falsely accused of sexual assault. And because men may go after women, it s best to just continue the tradition of keeping women as second-rate and exclude them from the clubs.And of course, Varney completely agreed with Harvard: They are faced with the possibility of admitting women or are forced to admit women then they are therefore increasing the likelihood of a lawsuit. Because if a man in this day in age holds the hand of a woman on a date without first asking permission, that is an assault. In come the lawyers. Yeah, making light of rape is always a wise thing to do. For f*cks sake.Varney apparently thinks,  the real story here now is, the law is now controlling intimate relationships between men and women. Lawyers [and] the law should not be in the middle of an intimate dating relationship between the sexes. Yes, women, stay quiet and let men have their way with you. Stupid lawyers and their wanting to uphold the law, keeping women safe and holding abusers accountable.Varney then goes on to complain about how  no means no  has turned into  yes means yes  because clearly getting consent in the affirmative is an overwhelming concept for him.Then Napolitano agrees with him, saying that the whole thing  is insane,  and thinks that  not every un-consented to touching is any of the business of the government. Adding: I can t imagine that the failure to say  yes  is a criminal assault. Actually, Andrew   that s exactly what it is.The fact that these men are sitting here and defending unconsented touch is not only deplorable, but horrific. If they want to be able to force themselves on women, they should at least be forced out of a job.

 Bernie Sanders And His Wife SHUT DOWN Supporter After He Disrespects Hillary Clinton (VIDEO/TWEETS),"On Thursday, Bernie Sanders  wife Jane Sanders didn t hesitate to defend her husband s rival, Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton after she became aware that a supporter had disrespected the former Secretary of State.In an interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo, Jane completely dismissed a sexist comment that was made at a Sanders campaign event just the day before. Cuomo asked Jane what she thought about Sanders campaign surrogate and healthcare activist Paul Song making complaints about  corporate democratic wh*res  who wanted to change the healthcare system. Song s direct comments were: Medicare-for-all will never happen if we continue to elect corporate Democratic wh*res who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry instead of us. Jane handled those comments with the same amount of class we ve seen from her husband during his entire campaign. Cuomo pressed Jane on Song s remarks, asking the Democratic candidate s wife: That was translated as being code for something about Hillary Clinton. Do you believe that, and what do you want to say about that choice of words? Basically, Jane didn t give Song s comments the time of day. She beautifully dismissed and condemned them at the same time, stating: I m sorry, I didn t hear it at all. Strange choice of words. And I can t imagine anybody was speaking about Secretary Clinton that way. I don t know who said that. She added,  All the campaigns really need to take some responsibility for what surrogates say. You can watch Jane masterfully shut down Song s comment below:Bernie also joined his wife in her criticism of Song s remarks on Thursday. Bernie, who has throughout the length of his campaign insisted on keeping to the issues and not engaging in the sort of childish in-party fighting that the GOP candidates have participated in, tweeted, Dr. Song s comment was inappropriate and insensitive. There s no room for language like that in our political discourse. After receiving backlash to his comments, Song apologized for his remarks, taking responsibility for their  insensitive  nature:Later, Song stated that his comments had not been in reference to Hillary Clinton, but to Democrats in Congress.

 Crowd Boos GOP Governor Off Stage For Not Supporting LGBT Protection Bill (VIDEO),"It should be the easiest question in America to answer, especially in Massachusetts, but the Republican governor flubbed it and drew the ire of the audience.Massachusetts  new Republican governor proved that he is just like every other bigoted Republican in the country after he failed to throw his support behind a bill moving through the state legislature that would provide anti-discrimination protection to LGBT people.As Governor Charlie Baker took questions during a corporate networking event, he was asked whether he would sign the bill into law unlike other Republican governors in the South who signed laws legalizing discrimination in their states.Again, this is an easy question to answer. This is the United States and discrimination is not a value this nation holds.Of course, being a Republican, Baker chose to sidestep the question instead and refused to give a definitive answer. We should not discriminate against anyone here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,  Baker said. But then he declared that he would listen to both sides on the issue, which means he would allow bigots the chance to persuade him to enshrine bigotry in the state, likely using the guise of religious liberty as the excuse of choice.That s when the audience turned on Baker and began booing him and shouting him down until he left the stage and the building.Lorelei Erisis, who attended the event, slammed Baker for not distancing himself from the extremist Republicans in states like North Carolina and Mississippi, which passed anti-LGBT laws that have brought economic backlash. I mean that s not even a very brave thing to say, to say that he would sign a bill, if it came before his desk. And if he had done that, it would have given him the moderate Republican image that he s trying to have,  Erisis said.Here s the video via YouTube.All Baker had to say is that he would sign a bill protecting LGBT people from discrimination. That s it.But he didn t. Instead, he teeter-tottered and angered the audience. And to add insult to injury, Baker s office issued a statement claiming to support a 2011 law that expanded protections but still refused to say that he would support the new bill, saying only that he would review it.To be blunt, Baker is a coward who had a chance to distinguish himself as a moderate Republican who has no connection to the bigoted Republicans who dominate his party at the moment. Governor John Bel Edwards certainly didn t shy away when he had a chance to sign an executive order protecting LGBT people, and he s a Democrat in the deep red state of Louisiana.And when the Governor of Louisiana is more courageous on the issue of LGBT rights than the Governor of Massachusetts, that s a sign that Massachusetts voters picked the wrong candidate to lead them.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Beatles Drummer Ringo Starr Will Not Perform In Bigoted State Of North Carolina,"North Carolina Republicans who are fans of The Beatles will be disappointed to learn that Ringo Starr won t be performing in their state next month.Due to North Carolina s discriminatory anti-LGBT law which makes bigotry legal across the state, the legendary Beatles drummer released a statement through his management company Beautiful Day Media & Management that he has cancelled his upcoming June 18th concert at Cary s Koka Booth Amphitheatre. I m sorry to disappoint my fans in the area, but we need to take a stand against this hatred,  Starr said.  Spread peace and love. This law opens the door to discrimination everywhere by limiting anti-discrimination laws against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Ringo adds,  How sad that they feel that this group of people cannot be defended.  He asks that we all support organizations that are fighting to overturn this law in whatever way we can. As Canned Heat sang,  Let s work together.  And The Beatles said,  All you need is love.' And Republicans only have themselves to blame. Ever since they jammed HB2 into law the state has suffered economic blows that are only getting worse. Ringo Starr is just the second major artist who has cancelled a concert rather than perform in a state that sanctions discrimination. Bruce Springsteen cancelled his own scheduled concert in a statement condemning the law earlier this month.Even corporations are hitting North Carolina hard over the new law, which bans transgender people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity and gives employers the ability to hide behind their Bibles to justify firing an employee or refusing to serve a customer. It also bars cities and counties from adopting their own anti-discrimination laws or minimum wage increases.Paypal recently shut down a major expansion project that would have brought more jobs to North Carolinians and the NBA is considering taking the All-Star game out of the state. Deutsche Bank also put the brakes on a project that would have created 250 jobs.Despite this economic backlash, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory is digging in his heels in support of the discriminatory law, even going so far as to distract everyone by offering a token repeal of the part of the law that bans workers from bringing a discrimination lawsuit to the courts while ignoring the other parts of the bill that are just as or more bigoted.Apparently, Republicans won t get the message through their thick skulls until North Carolina s economy is razed to the ground and maybe that s what needs to happen for a more inclusive and liberal state to rise from the ashes.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz’s Daughter Reveals A Shocking Family Secret Live On CNN Town Hall (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz got a brutal lesson in why he should keep his children out of politics on Wednesday night, when his daughter let slip a family secret during a live television interview.The Texas senator and GOP Presidential candidate appeared alongside his wife Heidi and two young daughters for a live Town Hall on CNN on Wednesday night. During the interview, Cruz s daughter revealed that there is video footage of her father in women s underwear and a feather boa. The pronouncement left Cruz visibly nervous and no doubt has his PR team doing some immediate damage limitation among Cruz s Evangelical base.The Cruz family was on stage with Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night, and the whole scene is a perfect reminder of the phrase: Never work with children or animals. This week s Town Halls have placed their focus on the personal lives of the candidates more than the political views, and in a later segment of the event, Cruz began a harmless tale of a recent Daddy-Daughter picnic at school. Thrilled with the reception, Cruz went a little further, in an attempt to up his credentials as a folksy, involved Dad   telling them that he often plays dress up with his daughters. She got to dress up Daddy in a pink boa and these like, big goofy-looking underwear he grinned at his daughter Caroline.However, Caroline then chimed in with a revelation that left the Senator briefly stumped. And [inaudible] it was on a videotape the whole time,  she said, as millions of Americans watched the scene unfold from home.  And that was a class video that they re sending out to all the parents. Cruz could only muster a brief  Oh oh.  while Heidi attempted to prevent her daughter revealing anything else ad lib. While host Cooper can t withhold a laugh, the audience is clearly as uncomfortable as the Cruz parents. You can almost hear Ted sending out a prayer to his Lord and PR team to double, triple and quadruple check that if that video footage exists, it gets disappeared immediately.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40fYlwHFCRgWe at Addicting Info suspect that far from Caroline making a naive PR stumble here, it might actually be a brutal attack of revenge for this campaign moment a while back.It s beginning to look like Caroline is reminding her father that if he continues to try and milk her for political ends, she will continue to kick him firmly where it hurts.Featured image via screen capture",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 This Woman’s Post About Her Teenage Daughter’s Sexual Assault Is A Warning Every Parent Should See (VIDEO),"When we think of rape, often we think of someone pulling a woman into a back alley while wearing a ski mask, or some creeper in a van snatching a child from a playground. It rarely happens that way, though. Usually, sexual assaults and other kinds of abuse happen at the hands of those we know. This is something that one Colorado mother learned the hard way, when her own husband sexually assaulted her 15-year-old daughter.Catherine St. Germain bravely posted the video of her daughter s story to Facebook in a beautifully haunting video. The background music was from the Beatles song  Yesterday.  The post went viral, as, using homemade cue cards, St. Germain revealed the identity of her now- ex-husband who turned out to be her daughter s attacker, Aaron Scott. Scott is not only a former officer of the law, but he also served in the U.S. Navy. Sometimes those charged with serving and protecting can be the people we need to fear the most. The worst part of all of this is that Scott denied what he did until DNA proved t hat he was a damned liar. Even worse than that, he took a plea deal that only got him 90 days in jail. St. Germain told local station KUSA-TV, He got 90 days   we got life. She went on to say,  via the cards in her video: I IMMEDIATELY kicked him out. Our divorce was final Sept. 1, 2015. He maintained his innocence until the DNA evidence came back POSITIVE. Only then did he accept a plea bargain. Another card warns parents: Stranger Danger  is a joke. MONSTERS look and act NORMAL. Speaking to KUSA-TV, St. Germain finishes: I keep saying I didn t do anything brave my kid did. My kid did the bravest thing,  St. Germain told KUSA.  She spoke out against the person who sexually assaulted her within 24 hours. Here is the video, via YouTube:This is one brave lady, and her child is even braver. Parents, if you kids tell you something horrible has happened to them, please listen. Do not sweep it aside. Do not act like they are trying to get attention. Let me tell you   it s usually true, and you owe them protection. That is your job as a parent.Watch the news report on this powerful story below, via KUSA-TV:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 People Are Queuing Up To Get This Trump Tattoo And Donald Is NOT Going To Like It (IMAGES),"A Florida man recently had a tattoo of Donald Trump inked onto his leg, and the current GOP frontrunner really isn t going to like it. It s a naked portrait featuring the trust fund tycoon s reportedly tiny manhood.Tattoo artist Spooks Joya, who created the tattoo, spoke to VICE about how the artwork came about, saying in an email: I actually saw the original picture by Illma Gore and thought it was awesome I researched what the piece stood for and couldn t resist not doing it, so I offered to do it for free on anyone who wanted. It started out as a joke but I was surprised people seriously wanted to get it done. Men and women. It was nuts!! It seems men and women were literally queueing up to pay the ultimate insult to Donald Trump   and it really is a monstrosity. The tattoo is up on the thigh of a man who remains anonymous, but we do have pictures of the tattoo being completed.This might be the appropriate moment to ask: who on earth would do this to themselves? And WHY?!For those unaware of the background, Trump has been smarting for a quarter of a century over a slight made against him by journalist Graydon Carter. The Vanity Fair writer wrote a negative piece on Trump, in which he called him a  short-fingered vulgarian . Last October, Carter published a piece in Vanity Fair entitled: Why Donald Trump Will Always Be a  Short-Fingered Vulgarian - in which he detailed Trump s thin-skinned response to the criticism, and his refusal to let the matter go. He writes:Like so many bullies, Trump has skin of gossamer. He thinks nothing of saying the most hurtful thing about someone else, but when he hears a whisper that runs counter to his own vainglorious self-image, he coils like a caged ferret. Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a  short-fingered vulgarian  in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago. To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers.And so it was, that Trump decided that a Primary debate to decide the Republican nominee for President of the United States, was the appropriate place to brag about the size of his penis. After Marco Rubio referenced the sight in a March debate, Trump told the crowd: Look at those hands. Are they small hands?  holding his (admittedly stubby) fingers out towards the audience and the cameras. He referred to my hands,  if they re small, something else must be small.  I guarantee you there s no problem. I guarantee. It seems for one person in particular, the comedy pay-off was worth it.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bill Nye CRUSHES The A-Hole Who Started The Rumor That He Would Debate Sarah Palin (VIDEO),"The internet went giddy with anticipation earlier this week when a story came out of Variety Magazine claiming that Bill Nye had been invited to debate Sarah Palin on the subject of climate change after the debut of the climate-denier propaganda film Climate Hustle in early May. Before Variety could update their article after being contacted by a Nye spokesperson with the truth, media outlets across the web had picked up and reported on the story.Before long it was trending all over social media. Even with the story being updated with the information that Nye would only appear in pre-recorded clips, the excitement of Palin going down in flames in what would have been the butt-kicking of the century continued to spread far and wide. Unfortunately, it isn t going to happen. The clips of Nye will most likely be heavily edited to make it look like he s hiding something as if there s some kind of profit to be made on the  hoax  that the earth is getting warmer.According to Nye, the man behind the movie and the panel of  experts,  Marc Morano, is the guy who started the rumor in the first place. Morano apparently used the idea of a debate between The Science Guy and the Queen of the Ditzes to promote his film. Nye says he was never invited to any such panel to debate anything: Marc Morano did not invite me to his movie but he said I refused to come after he did invite me   he was making that up. It s disingenuous, at best. The video is yet another beautiful and punishing blow by Bill Nye to yet another anti-science buffoon. There s been no response from Morano, but rumor has it he s in Kentucky drinking biblical mead and licking his wounds with Ken Hamm. Enjoy the video below, courtesy of Bill Nye s Facebook Page:https://www.facebook.com/billnye/videos/vb.48947135361/10154211049280362/?type=2&theaterFeatured image by Frederick Brown/ Getty Images ",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Campaign Manager Won’t Be Prosecuted For Assaulting A Woman,"Once again, it seems as though someone associated with the Trump campaign will receive special treatment. According to reports, the billionaire s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, will not face the music for manhandling former Breitbart  reporter  (we use that term loosely, given the nature of the right-wing garbage dump), after roughly grabbing her during a campaign event after mistaking her for a member of the  liberal media. Palm Beach County State Attorney David Aronberg says that, despite the attack being caught on video, the billionaire s right-hand man will not be prosecuted for what is clearly a crime because reasons.After Fields asked Trump a question, Lewandowski grabbed her, apparently attempting to throw her to the ground. Fields says she was able to maintain her balance, but she was left with bruises after the attack.Lewandowski initially denied the allegations, but after video surfaced he had no choice but to admit to what he did. But, of course, he says it was OK to physically assault a woman because he thought she was a member of the  mainstream media  he hates so much. Prosecutor s office told me they would inform me of decision tomorrow. If reports true, guess they decided to leak to reporters first. Ugly,  Fields tweeted after news of the decision leaked. For those asking, office of prosecutor asked 2 weeks ago if I d be ok with an apology from Corey. I said ya but haven t heard back about it. With evidence of the attack, an admission, and a video that clearly shows the assault, one must wonder why Aronberg would refuse to prosecute Lewandowski, who was charged with a misdemeanor count of battery last month.You can bet that if it was anyone else, that person would have had to face what he did.Watch the attack below:Featured image via CNN",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 President Obama Will Sing On Coldplay’s Next Album (VIDEO),"Normally, the thought of listening to Coldplay is the stuff of nightmares, just behind spooning with Sarah Palin and spending more than 20 seconds staring at Ted Cruz s face. But something is happening that, for a few seconds, might just make what would normally be an act of self-torture tolerable: Coldplay has announced that the President s moving rendition of  Amazing Grace  will be included on their next album.The band s frontman, Chris Martin, says the singing voice of President Barack Obama will make an appearance on upcoming album,  A Head Full of Dreams,  which is due to be released next month. He told British tabloid The Sun: We have a tiny clip of the president singing  Amazing Grace.  Because of the historical significance of what he did and also that that song being about,  I m lost but now I m found . The publication notes that the band has obtained both Obama s personal permission to use his voice, and that of the church in which the golden words were recorded.A source close to the band added:  Barack Obama wouldn t let just anyone feature his vocals on the record, especially considering what a deeply emotional moment it was for him. But he clearly loves Coldplay and is happy to be a part of their music history. The band were obviously thrilled. They needed to get permission from Obama himself and the Charleston church it was recorded in. I met Barack Obama in the summer and one thing he said to me was,  Oh I have your songs on my iPod,  but I just thought,  Oh I bet he says that to every pop star he meets,  Martin says. I can t get my head around the notion that the President of the USA would have any of my songs on his playlist. It is just too surreal. While many would question the President s choice in music, none can deny that it would truly be an honor for any band to obtain the President s personal permission to use his voice in their songs.Watch the President show off his dulcet tones below:Featured image via Getty",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" WATCH: Someone Actually Bought And Drank Trump Vodka, Here’s What Happened","Donald Trump made a big stink a few weeks ago because it was pointed out that many of the products he has lent his name to have turned out to be complete and absolute  losers,  quickly discontinued and removed from the market. Those products include Trump Water, Trump Steaks, and Trump Magazine.Buzzfeed decided to get in on the action and spent $200 to buy a bottle of Trump Vodka. Here s what happened when they got some people to actually taste it:As pointed out in the video, the vodka from the man who has promised to  make America great again  in his campaign was actually a product of Netherlands. This follows a pattern of several other Trump products, like his discontinued neckties, being sourced and manufactured in other countries (the ties were from China). It shows that when it came to his own products that he stood to make a cut of the profits from, Trump was more than willing to make a  deal  to produce them cheaply overseas, adding to his personal bottom line.Trump said he got into vodka because  A great friend of mine was a founder of Grey Goose and what we re going to do is to top it. I want to top them just because it s fun to top my friends.  Despite Trump s grandiose predictions of success for the drink, it was not to be (sound familiar?):The only trouble was, nobody bought it. By the end of 2007 it barely registered among the top-selling vodkas, badly trailing the likes of Smirnoff and no threat whatsoever to Grey Goose. Go figure that customers wouldn t line up for a product that existed for the sole purpose of one-upping Trump s friend.By 2011, Trump Vodka was gone.The reviewers in the video were not optimistic. They told Buzzfeed they thought the alcohol would taste like  self-tanner  or  misogyny. While one drinker said it  burned like a UTI,  another said it tasted  surprisingly good.  Another woman said it tasted good,  but not $200 good.

" PROOF: Republicans Are Blocking Black Voters, This Court Case Is Exposing Them","Voter identification laws (aka Voter ID) are an attempt by Republican lawmakers to suppress the vote with demographics that often vote for Democratic candidates   young voters, minorities, the poor. Often, when confronted with this, conservatives claim that the laws are in place to protect the integrity of the ballot against so-called  voter fraud,  but time and time again studies have shown that  voter fraud  happens so infrequently it is almost nonexistent.In Wisconsin, failed Republican presidential candidate Governor Scott Walker praised the recent implementation of voter ID in Wisconsin s presidential primary. But one case shows that the law is just a fancy, modern version of Jim Crow:Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said his state s strict new voter-ID requirement worked  just fine  in the April 5 primary, but thousands of Wisconsinites were unable to cast a ballot because of the new law. One of them was Eddie Lee Holloway Jr.Holloway, a 58-year-old African-American man, moved from Illinois to Wisconsin in 2008 and voted without problems, until Wisconsin passed its voter-ID law in 2011.  I never miss voting,  he said. He brought his expired Illinois photo ID, birth certificate, and Social Security card to get a photo ID for voting, but the DMV in Milwaukee rejected his application because the name on his birth certificate read  Eddie Junior Holloway,  the result of a clerical error when it was issued.The Nation goes on to report that Holloway ended up spending $200 on records, made trips between two states, and was still unable to vote in Wisconsin. The U.S. Court of Appeals is currently reviewing a case brought before it on behalf of Holloway by the ACLU. The ACLU estimates that there are thousands of people in Wisconsin who have been disenfranchised like him.This is exactly what Republicans want. They ve said it on the record, multiple times, that voter ID helps them because it suppresses the vote. Their party best succeeds when less and less people get to exercise their Constitutional rights.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 14, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Still Butthurt About 2011 Event, Trump Refuses Invitation To Correspondents’ Dinner (VIDEO)","If you were one of the many political junkies crossing your fingers and hoping Donald Trump would attend the White House Correspondents  Dinner this year, you are about to be disappointed. The Republican frontrunner recently announced that he has turned down all of the invitations he has received because of the media. I was asked by every single group of media available to mankind [to attend this year]. But I ve decided not to go. Do you know why? I would have a good time and the press would say I look like I wasn t having a good time. Donald Trump attended the 2011 Correspondents  Dinner and President Obama hammered him over and over and over. He even had a photo of what the White House would look like if the billionaire was ever elected president, complete with  Trump  scrawled across the top of it.Image via screenshotBut Trump is claiming that his decision not to attend has nothing to do with President Obama repeatedly making him the butt of his jokes; it was instead the mean press  fault: I had a great time. I was very honored by all of the attention. The president told joke after joke and it was good. They were all very nice and delivered nicely and I had a great time and told the press. For four years, I ve read what a miserable time I had The press is dishonest. If the press would be honest, I d go because I d have a good time.   But no matter how good a time I had, the press would say,  Donald Trump was miserable. What would I need that for? Honestly, it really doesn t matter if it was the president trolling him or the media talking about his angry face throughout the dinner that is keeping him from attending   it speaks to a much larger problem he has: Trump is completely incapable of taking criticism   even in jest. He claims that he wants to run this country, but he can t handle anyone who isn t kissing his ass talking about him. And when people do say something about him, he lashes out like a toddler who was just told he cannot swing on the curtains. How is he ever going to deal with the scrutiny that comes with the highest office in the United States if he can t brush the big bad press off?Watch President Obama roast Trump at the 2011 Dinner:Featured image via Kristoffer Tripplaar-Pool; Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Republican Leaders And Activists Plan To Back Third-Party Candidate If Trump Is Nominated,"Political contributor and conservative editor Erick Erickson, along with numerous Republican activists and leaders, are planning on rallying behind a third-party candidate should Donald Trump, the current GOP frontrunner, secure the nomination in July.Erickson, former editor of RedState, in a statement on his newest website The Resurgent titled  #UnelectableDonald Will Make America Blue Again,  said:As economic, defense, and faith conservatives, we oppose Donald Trump and will not vote for him in the coming general election. Our objective is two-fold: the election of a conservative president and averting the debacle of a Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders administration. To achieve these objectives, the candidacy of Donald Trump must be defeated.Slamming Trump over his  liberal  positions and his  authoritarian  approach, the group of leaders and activists pledged they would vote and, if they lose, carry on until the next fight:We will vote. Sitting out an election is not an option. The Republican Party has before it several candidates with the record and ability to serve as president with honor and distinction. In the coming months, we will devote ourselves to ensuring the nomination goes to a candidate who will strengthen our economy, national security and, above all, the conservative values on which all else depends. Should this effort fail, we will join with other faithful conservatives to find new candidates and institutions to carry on the fight for conservative principles and policies.This is he third meeting between Erikson and his band of plucky conservatives. In March, when the first meeting adjourned, the group called for the creation of Unity Ticket to thwart Trump, and as a second option opted for a third-party candidate should the Unity Ticket fail.Other members of Erickson s group, which totals about a dozen Republicans, includes columnist Quin Hillyer, George W. Bush adviser Bill Wichterman, and Mike Farris, a conservative activist and candidate for lieutenant governor in Virginia.Although Erickson s group is seemingly one of a kind, there have been numerous Republicans coming out to say they would refuse to vote for Trump, including Joe Scarborough (who at one point supported him), former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, Dana Losech,  Mel Martinez, Sen. Ben Sasse and others.

 Civil Rights Legend Switches Endorsement And Primary Vote From Sanders To Clinton,"On Tuesday, Tom Hayden, one of leading dirty hippies that drove Republicans (and Democrats) completely insane in the 1960s wrote a lengthy editorial in The Nation to announce that he was dropping his support of Bernie Sanders and voting for Hillary Clinton in the California primary. While not sparing a critical eye towards Clinton, he explains that despite not being an angel, she has successfully worked within the system for almost 50 years to affect change. According to Hayden, she has the best chance to beat the Republicans and advance her agenda through both a hostile Congress and an unsure electorate.Hayden actually agrees with most (all?) of Bernie s end goals, as do many of Hillary s supporters. We all want universal healthcare, more taxes on the rich, less guns on the street, equal pay for women and an end to income inequality, but where the problem comes is HOW to get there:The populist clarity of Bernie s proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that  political revolution  will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic.Hayden is worried Bernie has done nothing to ensure he will have the political muscle to make his plans work. A one election revolution won t cut it without  a Plan B, which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections. Take fracking for example. Hillary has been condemned for not calling for a total ban. But Hayden, a much more plugged in activist, is more impressed by Clinton s long term goals and less so by Sanders  absolutist stand:But Hillary s position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she  has pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate plan  and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years.Meanwhile, Bernie s total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term.And it s not just Bernie s policies that Hayden is concerned with. There s also the question of his vulnerability as a candidate. Hayden, quite correctly, points out that Republicans have almost completely ignored Bernie:My second worry about Bernie s candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If he s the nominee, that will be merciless.I ve had this discussion a number of times with Bernie supporters who think that Republican attacks will roll right off. But Republicans managed to convince a significant portion of the country that the center-left Obama is actually a far-left Socialist bordering on Communist and that Obamacare was a  government takeover.  The right-wing media machine is a propaganda tool that would make the totalitarian government in George Orwell s 1984 weep in pure jealously. By the end of the first month, Bernie would be labeled a Marxist. By the end of the second month, he would be the reincarnation of Stalin. And that would be among the nicer things they would say about him.Just to be crystal clear, a certain number of Bernie supporters insist that Obama is a center-right Republican. Yet it is undeniable that he s been successfully labeled a far-left radical by the right. How would Bernie be immune to this? There s no clear answer.Even worse, the automatic response from Bernie supporters is  They ll do the same thing to Hillary!  as if that would change the character assassination to come. But even that answer is unhelpful because they ve BEEN doing this to Hillary for longer than many of Bernie s supporters have been alive. The Clintons are the most scrutinized politicians to ever live, bar none. There are literally no new scandals to dig (or make) up. The Corporate Media has been trying to claim her scalp since the 90s and the right has spent millions upon millions on opposition research with only rumor and innuendo to show for it.What are they going to do? Hold some more Benghazi hearings? Good luck with that.But the main reason Hayden says he s supporting Hillary is that the black community is overwhelmingly supporting her:I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust.Some of Bernie s (overwhelmingly white) supporters have taken the not-so-subtly racist attitude that the black community doesn t know any better. But Hayden correctly points out that Bernie himself made the choice not to appeal to them:Bernie s campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.Blaming black people for not supporting Bernie when Bernie deliberately chose to focus his energy elsewhere is a deeply problematic attitude and a shirking of responsibility.There s (a lot) more and Hayden does not pull punches with either candidate, but his overall message is clear: Vote for whatever candidate you want in the primary, but at the end of the day, stopping the Republicans is more important than hero worship. If you want real change, you have to do more than vote in presidential elections, sit back and wait for it to come.Featured image via Getty",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Megyn Kelly Caves To Trump, Holds Secret Meeting Rumored To Be Interview Request","Donald Trump has spent this election demeaning Megyn Kelly in shockingly sexist ways. After the first Republican debate demonstrated that Kelly wasn t afraid to call Trump on his nonsense, the front-runner floated the idea that she was so aggressive because she was menstruating. In the following months, he has repeatedly viciously attacked her   even on her own network.For her part, Kelly has always tried to take the high road. She has argued that her goal is to move past the feud with Trump and get to a place where the two can treat each other like professionals. Trump didn t seem to get the memo. As his campaign has picked up (and Kelly s dream of watching Trump simply flame out dimmed), he s lashed out at her in interviews and on social media..@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2015The constant barrage has certainly done damage to Kelly. For years, she was seen as the rising star of Fox News and big things were lined up for her. The fight with Trump has undermined a lot of that. Trump s fans, many of whom were dogmatic Fox News watchers, have taken his side and Kelly has become their public enemy number one. The sexism he hurls at her is dished out ten-fold by his rabid supporters.However, there is one tenet of Fox News that is placed above pride, integrity, self-respect or logic: Ratings. Kelly herself admitted to PBS s Charlie Rose that Trump would probably be back on her program at some point despite his low opinion of her because  that will be a big moment. Do you think that will be a big television moment? Apparently, the moment is now. Sources at Fox News confirmed today that Megyn Kelly secretly snuck into Trump Tower to hold a private meeting with Trump and it s easy to guess what the agenda was. She wants him back.Kelly reached out to Trump s office to set up the meeting, one of the sources said.The face-to-face chat raises the possibility of a Kelly-Trump interview sometime in the future.Kelly is known to be seeking high-profile guests for a Barbara Walters-style prime time special on the Fox broadcast network in May.Fox released an official statement that seems to support this.FOX News Chairman & CEO Roger Ailes has spoken to Donald Trump a few times over the past three months about appearing on a FOX Broadcasting special with Megyn Kelly airing on May 23. Kelly requested a meeting with Mr. Trump, which took place at Trump Tower this morning. The results of that meeting will be revealed on tonight s Kelly File at 9PM/ET. Kelly has acknowledged in recent interviews that Trump is a fascinating person to cover and has electrified the Republican base.This is a strong about-face from just a month ago, when she confided to Variety that she s been desperate to get him back on but there was never a moment where he wasn t attacking her. To be honest, every time I prepare an invitation to sit down with him, he attacks me on Twitter or elsewhere. I had always been hoping I could reach out to him at a time when he wasn t angry. I don t think it would be a good interview if he was angry at me   but then he never stops with the attacks. As we ve seen repeatedly, Fox News has only the thinnest veneer of integrity easily wiped away with profit considerations. Trump has been ruthless in going after Kelly and other Fox hosts who don t openly grovel at his feet (and many of them do), but the network is more than willing to swallow their pride if they need to promote, say, a  Barbara Walters-style prime time special  and would love the ratings Trump attracts.Featured image via Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Cosmopolitan Magazine and WME Live",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Louisiana’s Dem. Governor Steps Up, Signs Executive Action Barring LGBT Discrimination","Could anyone, in a million years, ever see Bobby Jindal doing the right thing and barring discrimination against LGBT citizens? That would be a no, because the rabidly anti-gay governor would rather pander to the religious right.But thankfully, Louisiana s new governor, a Democrat, has morals. And those morals include protecting all citizens from hurtful discrimination.John Bel Edwards, who was elected last November against serial adulterer David Vitter, signed a non-discrimination executive order which overrode an executive order put into place by Jindal that expanded provisions in a bill that allowed for a more rigorous approach to  religious freedom.  Edwards slammed Jindal as pandering to  a narrow political agenda. Although the anti-discrimination executive order doesn t pertain to private businesses, it does ban discrimination against state employees and workers hired by state contractors.The action, however, does allow exemptions for certain religious organizations and churches. Edwards addressed this concern, saying in a statement:While this executive order respects the religious beliefs of our people, it also signals to the rest of the country that discrimination is not a Louisiana value, but rather, that Louisiana is a state that is respective and inclusive of everyone around us.Contrast John Bel Edwards to Governors Pat McCrory and Phil Bryant. If this isn t enough evidence as to why it s so important for Democrats to get out and vote, I don t know what would be. As LGBT citizens across the South (and elsewhere) face intense attacks on their identity, Louisiana s Democratic governor stepped up and did the right thing.  In  heavily conservative and unpredictable state, Edwards risks not just his own career, but those who support his actions risk theirs as well.That s real leadership. Like Jindal s pandering, Bryant and McCrory serve only to do just that   pander. In their conservative states, they are safeguarded by the religious right and the Tea Party activists who cheer on discriminatory legislation.If the deeply religious, Catholic John Bel Edwards can see past religious pandering to do the right thing, so can any other politician.Featured image via screen shot from Campaign Ad",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump Uses Eric Garner’s Dying Words To Mock Mitt Romney; His Supporters Roar With Laughter,"Republican front-runner Donald Trump decided a visit to New York would be a good time to try out his comedy routine by delivering a stunningly tasteless joke at the expense of a man who had been recently killed nearby by New York police.In a performance that recalled the time he mocked a physically disabled reporter, Trump cast his arch-nemesis Mitt Romney in the role of police brutality victim Eric Garner because, as Trump tells it, both were known for  choking. Unbelievable. The last election should have been won, except Romney choked like a dog. He choked,  Trump said, before mocking Romney with his hands in a choke position.Trump shouted  I can t breathe, I can t breathe,  mocking the last words of Garner, who died in police custody on July 17, 2014, when officers tried to arrest him for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes across from Tompkinsville Park.The moment stunned reporters on scene, but what was perhaps even more surprising was the response Trump got from his fans. Rather than find the idea of aping the words of a man who recently died just a few miles away repulsive, the crowd of Trump-heads roared with laughter. The mockery was the funniest thing they had ever seen.'Like a dog': Donald Trump impersonates Mitt Romney 'choking' in the 2012 election https://t.co/dX9r9HADCA pic.twitter.com/Ny7ULsOIhW  Business Insider (@businessinsider) April 12, 2016Like every offensive thing Trump does, this may have been a finely-tuned tactical maneuver. For many in New York, the story of Eric Garner s senseless death is still raw and infuriating, but the small but vocal Fox News crowd has always taken a different opinion on it. In the aftermath of Garner s death, Fox repeatedly booked guests who pushed the idea that Garner deserved it.Neil Cavuto and guest Bishop E.W. Jackson concluded as much: It s the result of a young man having made the decision to resist arrest. And when you do that, things are not going to end well. It s tragic, it s terrible. But how about teaching the young people when the police make a request, cooperate with them rather than resisting them? Rudy Guliani   also on Fox News   agreed, claiming Garner killed himself by struggling to not be arrested.Many of the people who felt the same, now attend Trump rallies where they count on the candidate to stoke racial fears and push the kind of xenophobic nationalism that s gotten him so far with the Republican base. Mocking Eric Garner   and linking him to Romney, whom Trump views as weak and pathetic   is a way of playing on feelings of white pride that enthralls many of Trump s fans.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump’s Policy Adviser? A Former Lobbyist With Ties To An African Warlord,"Who is Paul Manafort? Well, for starters, he s a former principal lobbyist with the firm Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly (BMS & K), a firm that had close ties to the Reagan and Bush White House and works closely with Republicans on Capitol Hill.But that s not where the firm has made most of its money. Before merging with Gold & Liebengood to form BKSH & Associates in 1996,  BMS & K was renowned for representing a multitude of sketchy African dictators, warlords, guerilla warfare groups and individuals responsible for the most reprehensible human rights violations in the world.One of their most notorious  clients  was Angolan war lord Jonas Savimbi, who oversaw what The Daily Beast documents as mass-amputation of those they deemed the enemy, and state-sanctioned rape. Savimbi and his guerilla army sought to take back control of the Marxist dominated, Soviet Union backed government in Angola through UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). A bloody civil war, over two hundred people died a day, and Manafort s lobbying firm oversaw a  negotiations for the continuation of warfare. Senator Bill Bradley, in his memoirs, noted that had it not been for Manafort s heavy lobbying, a ceasefire would have been reached sooner.As John Prendergast wrote in a 1999 essay for the United States Institute of Peace:The government s branding of Jonas Savimbi as a war criminal creates a thin but important precedent for reversing the state of total impunity that exists presently. Savimbi is indeed responsible for a litany of crimes against humanity, but of course he is not alone The Human Rights Watch documented the horrors of child soldiers at he hands of Savimbi, writing that those forced into the guerilla warfare were robbed of their childhood and forced to fight in one of the most violent civil wars in world history:Both the largest opposition group, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and the government used child soldiers in the war. Children s rights groups have estimated that as many as 11,000 children were involved in the last years of the fighting. Some children received weapons and arms training and fought in the conflict. Many others acted as porters, cooks, spies and laborers .UNITA soldiers regularly beat children for infractions and assigned them hazardous duties. UNITA combatants also sexually abused girls and assigned them as  wives  to soldiers.Now where did Manafort come into play? Well, Savimbi courted his lobbying firm to get United States leaders on board with the coup (after all, the United States was still heavily invested in the Cold War). And through their lobbying efforts quickly got President Reagan and Congressional Republicans to convince the CIA and other American intelligence agencies like the State Department to fund and support Savimbi.Between 1985 and 1989, Savimbi and UNITA paid Manafort and his associates over $850,000 while the United States supplied $42 million for their efforts.Even though using child soldiers was (and still is) banned by International law and Angolan law, the  freedom fighters  (as Reagan called them) were still in the business of heavy exploitation. And Manafort and his associates didn t care, so long as they got their paycheck.And now he s an advisor to Donald Trump.

 Sanders Campaign Begins To Raise Money For Down-Ticket Democratic Candidates,"After months of criticism from the Clinton campaign over down-ticket candidates, the Sanders campaign has begun to raise and distribute cash to Democratic candidates across the country.But there s a catch: the only candidates who are receiving funding are those that have publicly come out and supported him, a trio of new wave progressives including New York s Zephyr Teachout, Nevada s Lucy Flores, and Washington state s Pramila Jayapal. But there s another catch: all three candidates are currently waging primary battles against more  establishment  candidates.Sanders, who has run on an a vehemently anti-establishment platform, wrote in his email:  When we talk of political revolution, we also need people who aren t beholden to special interests,  before introducing Zephyr Teachout as an outsider who  literally wrote the book on political corruption. Teachout ran in the Democratic primary for Governor of New York, gaining 34 percent of the vote but ultimately losing to incumbent Andrew Cuomo.Lucy Flores was a member of the Nevada State Assembly for four years and ran for the position of Lieutenant Governor in 2014, losing to Republican Mark Hutchison. For the 2016 election, she will run to replace Republican Cresent Hardy in the 4th Congressional District.Pramila Jayapal is currently a member of the Washington Senate and will be running in Washington s 7th Congressional District to succeed retiring Democrat Jim McDermott.Sanders  website sent out fundraising emails which encourages donors to split their donations between the Vermont Senator and the trio of candidates.Democrats hit the Sanders campaign heavily for raising over $109 million for his campaign while giving almost no money to Democratic candidates, while the Clinton campaign dispersed more than $15 million in 2016 alone.The money that is collected for down-ticket candidates goes straight to a fund called the Victory Fund, and will be distributed to Democrats who win their primaries heading into the general election.Featured image via Kenneth Gabrielsen/Getty Images",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Student Haz A Sad After Everyone Mocks Him For His Trump Hat (VIDEO),"Now, typically no one should be mocking a teenager in their place of education, but since it is a place of education, perhaps this can be seen as the child learning something valuable. And while it s never okay to bully, pointing out to someone that they re wearing the hat of a bigoted bully should be mandatory.That being said, one high school sophomore in Portland, Maine, is catching a lot of criticism for wearing his Donald Trump  Make America Great Again  hat, and rightly so.Conner Mullen says that everyone is wearing their  Bernie pins,  so he should be able to wear his Donald Trump hat. However, his fellow classmates are apparently relentless in their taunting, and even a teacher called him out, allegedly saying,  Thank God you can t vote.  When Mullen took his grievance to the assistant principal s office, the solution offered was simply to leave the hat at home.Mullen said: I knew kids would pick on me about it, that s just kids being kids, but when the adults started doing it I thought that s problematic. This is a school that preaches equality. Oh dear. Yes, he actually said that. He just equated himself to the plight for equality because he s being teased for wearing a bigot s hat. The irony is palpable.According to Mullen, the reason he wants Trump to be president is: I want a job  where you can help people, and I ve heard Trump say how important he thinks veterans and (people in law enforcement) are. Oh, dear boy, please, oh please don t believe the pandering nonsense that comes out of Trump s mouth. And as far as his love for veterans, how much he s been supposedly giving veteran groups is highly questionable.Here s the thing, the school isn t telling him he shouldn t wear the hat, but they are suggesting if he d like to stop being relentlessly mocked for such a poor fashion decision, that he should probably just leave the hat at home. Trump is a bigot and probably the worst choice this country could ever have for the role of Commander-in-Chief.The bigger concern here is, what is this student being taught that he believes Trump is a good option? Maybe that should be the real story.Watch the story via WCSH out of Portland, Maine:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NASA Publicly Humiliates Right-Wing Climate Change Deniers On Facebook With Real Science,"Don t mess with NASA because they will burn you.When a climate change denier made a comment on a post made by Bill Nye the Science Guy, he made a huge mistake by dragging NASA into his rant.Nye was mocking a climate change denier for refusing to take bets on whether climate change is real or not  cause he knows what s up re: global temperatures. Here s the post via Facebook.In response, a right-winger named Fer Morales made a complete ass of himself by disputing climate science by invoking NASA. Morales attributed several of his claims to NASA, including one about how fossil fuels cool the planet. Riiiiight, despite NASA confirming that fossil fuels are actually cooling the planet s temperature, and that there s more ice than in the last century in the polar caps. And the fact that the so-called rises of the sea levels have not materialized, and that any real scientist doesn t back up man-made climate change at all, since it s a cycle that has existed even before we did. Yep, solid science, leftards. This didn t sit well with NASA Climate Change, which spotted Morales  comment and brutally shut him down with a humiliating educational response. Do not misrepresent NASA,  NASA warned.  Fossil fuels are not cooling the planet. Here s a screenshot of the exchange:And the humiliation just grew from there as other Facebook users cheered on NASA for smacking down an anti-science nut job.This was an epic shut down by NASA. The fact that NASA actually took the time to respond is simply amazing. But NASA was not done yet. They also responded to two other right-wing idiots who accused the space agency of  fudging  the numbers and  deleting data. Then NASA proceeded to further educate everyone.Which led to this suggestion by another commenter.This is what it looks like when anti-science conservatives get owned.Featured image via NASA",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Anderson Cooper SMACKS DOWN Trump For Whining About Colorado Rules: ‘Didn’t You Just Get Outplayed?’ (VIDEO),"It wouldn t be the first time CNN anchor Anderson Cooper has smacked down Trump, and he just gets better every time.Just last month, Cooper called Trump out on his childish behavior when the business mogul launched an immature, misogyny-fueled attack against rival Ted Cruz s wife. When Trump defended himself using a  he started it  argument, Cooper destroyed the Republican front runner by telling him,  That s the argument of 5-year-old.  And at last night s town hall, Cooper didn t disappoint.Cooper began the interview by criticizing Trump for his ridiculous complaints about the delegate voting system in Colorado. Ever since Cruz beat Trump in getting every last one of the 34 delegates  support in the state, Trump has been whining and moaning about how  unfair,   rigged  and  crooked  Colorado s system is. Cooper completely shut Trump down when he asked the sore loser, The rules are the rules, didn t you just get outplayed on the ground? Trump, continuing to insist that he was aware of the rules (even though he clearly wasn t), kept complaining that the voting system was some sort of anti-Trump conspiracy that was stacked against me.  Cooper wasn t having ANY of Trump s bullsh*t, and reminded him that Cruz had actually put time and effort into going out, reaching out to people who wanted to be delegates, to run the process  in Colorado   unlike Trump.Cooper told the business mogul,  You could ve had a better organization on the ground,  reminding him that he d had  months to prepare.  Cooper then called Trump out on his egotistical overestimation of himself and said: For somebody who touts himself as somebody who s an organizational genius, as someone who s created this amazing business organization, that you couldn t create an organization on the ground that could beat Ted Cruz s organization.

" Ted Cruz Is Against Adult Toys, But His College Roommate Knows That’s Hypocritical (TWEET)","Likely the last thing you d ever want to envision is Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz with adult toys, or doing things to himself, but hey, this is America, and hypocrites need to be called out.As Mother Jones just reminded us, Ted Cruz defended a ban on adult toys. In fact,  he helped defend a law criminalizing the sale said toys. You see, Texas, the state where the senator is from (besides Canada), has a law that outlaws these  obscene  devices. Ted Cruz found it un-American to self-stimulate yourself with such a thing, and according to The Week: Cruz s office defended the obscenity law by saying that  any alleged right associated with obscene devices  is not  deeply rooted in the Nation s history and traditions. I m sure this is what the Founders of our nation were thinking about when declaring war on England, and writing up the Constitution. Jefferson was probably all like,  oh, yes, we mustn t forget the devices used for self-pleasure. They must be strictly prohibited.  Probably not.Anyway, all of that aside, enter Craig Mazin, Ted Cruz s freshman roommate at Princeton. He just took to Twitter with likely the best burn ever to be written calling out the Texas junior senator s hypocrisy. He wrote:Ted Cruz thinks people don't have a right to ""stimulate their genitals."" I was his college roommate. This would be a new belief of his.

 WATCH: Anti-Gun Group Absolutely DESTROYS NRA For Marketing Guns To Kids,"The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence released new videos depicting the danger of guns in children s hands in response to the National Rifle Association s (NRA) and the corporate gun industry s disgusting marketing of guns to children. The videos depict Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan as victims of gun violence.Watch videos here:Peter Pan[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoAuvmRH2Yk] Alice in Wonderland[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDrQlHx7GK4]A report by the Violence Policy Center (VPC) Start Them Young    How the Firearms Industry and Gun Lobby Are Targeting Your Children, documents how the gun industry and the gun lobby markets guns to children. The comprehensive 54 page report lists the many slick approaches marketers use to make guns attractive to children despite the lethal consequences which include mass murder, suicides, fatal unintentional shootings, and  mass murder. The marketing approaches of guns include: The promotion of 22 caliber assault rifles that often incorporate plastic in their design (leading to less recoil and lighter weight). The result, according to Shooting Sports Retailer, is guns that  bring the coolness and fun of the tactical rifle to kids and less serious shooters. Marketing guns in child-friendly colors, including: pink rifles and pistols intended for girls and women from a wide range of manufacturers; Smith & Wesson 22 caliber AR-15 style assault rifles in Pink Platinum, Purple Platinum, and Harvest Moon Orange; and youth rifles from Savage Arms that come in crayon-box colors that include red, yellow, orange, and blue. In the search for a gun-based  reality video game  to compete with the appeal of actual video games, the industry has embraced 3-Gun competition, described by one gun writer as being  as close to a real-life first person shooter video game as you ll get without joining the military. The NRA, which is considered the most powerful lobby group in Washington along with other groups that promote violent activities like Israel s AIPAC, has a leash on Washington GOP politicians despite the fact that its promotion and profiteering off of guns has made America one of the most dangerous countries on the planet.The Brady Campaign, named after James Brady, who was permanently disabled after the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981, is a non-profit organization that has advocated for gun control for decades.

 Major Corporation Leaves South Carolina After Republican Introduces Anti-LGBT Bill,"South Carolina Republicans just introduced an anti-LGBT bill similar to laws passed in North Carolina and Mississippi, and they are already paying the price for it.GOP state Senator Lee Bright thinks trans people are a threat to the safety of women and children in bathrooms despite there being zero evidence of it across the country. I mean, years ago we kept talking about tolerance, tolerance, and tolerance, and now they want men who claim to be women to be able to go into bathrooms with children,  Bright said on the floor of the state Senate while introducing his legislation.  And you got corporations who say this is okay. But Bright s claim is a complete lie that is not based in fact. In 17 states and over 200 cities across the country that have passed protections for LGBT people against discrimination, there has not been a single recorded instance of a trans person entering a women s bathroom to sexually harass anyone.Yet Republicans have made the claim to justify their anti-LGBT bills anyway, making discrimination legal under the guise of religious liberty. North Carolina passed the odious law last month, and Mississippi did the same this month. So far, both states have faced a severe backlash and it is costing both states dearly.Businesses and corporations are threatening to pull out of the state and many have already done so or cancelled plans to expand into the states. Both are also facing the loss of billions of federal dollars.And corporations aren t even waiting for South Carolina Republicans to pass their own bill into law. Just introducing it was enough for one CEO to move his company to California rather than remain in a state that still embraces bigotry.Uphold is a financial services industry that allows users of the service to transfer deposits of bitcoin into reserve-backed currencies such as the dollar. It s a fast-growing business that has handled nearly $1 billion in transactions in just the last two years.CEO Anthony Watson is so disgusted by Bright s bill that he has decided to move his company, which is headquartered in Charleston, out of the state. Uphold is founded on the key pillars of transparency and accountability, and at our very core, we stand for fairness, inclusion and equality,  Watson wrote in a statement on the company website.  Just as Uphold brings financial services to everyone, everywhere, we ve also built a company that brings the principles of fairness, inclusion and equality to everything we do. Watson then proceeded to rip South Carolina Republicans a new one and announced his decision to launch a preemptive exodus out of the state rather than sit and watch as bigoted Republicans jam the bill into law. As the openly gay, British CEO of an American company, I have watched in shock and dismay as legislation has been abruptly proposed or enacted in several states across the union seeking to invalidate the basic protections and rights of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) U.S. citizens.Some of you may be aware that Uphold s U.S. headquarters is based in Charleston, South Carolina. In recent days, we have been made aware that South Carolina Sen. Lee Bright has introduced a bill largely mirroring North Carolina s controversial law that blocks local governments from passing LGBT-inclusive anti-discrimination ordinances. As such, we feel compelled to take action to oppose the discrimination being proposed in South Carolina and protect our LGBT employees.Today, Uphold has taken the difficult decision to move its U.S. corporate Headquarters from Charleston, South Carolina to Los Angeles, California.We will stand firm in our commitment to fairness, equality and inclusion and our strong conviction that we can make a difference by living our core values. It s the right thing to do for our members, employees, partners and the communities in which we live and work. The bold move will cost South Carolinians hundreds of jobs and will likely be a major blow to the state and local economies. It s just a taste of what South Carolina Republicans can expect if they continue on the path of taking the state backwards.Featured iamge via Wikimedia",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Bernie Sanders Receives First Endorsement From A Current U.S. Senator,"The conversation regarding super delegates has been very divisive in the Democratic Party. Hillary Clinton supporters cite her overwhelming super delegate support as evidence Hillary Clinton is the best candidate, while Bernie Sanders supporters cite it as evidence of corruption and an out-of-touch party, as many of those super delegates pledged allegiance to Secretary Clinton before the primaries even began.Super delegates don t cast their votes until the convention, so counting their votes before then when they can change until then is pointless, but it is noteworthy that Bernie Sanders finally received his first endorsement in the U.S. Senate. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon wrote an op-ed in the New York Times outlining why he supports Bernie Sanders for president. In the op-ed, Senator Merkley said how he thinks both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are great candidates, but only Bernie Sanders will help us rethink how our economy and our politics work. Under President Obama s leadership, our country is fairer and more prosperous for all than it was seven years ago. But as we look toward the next administration, there is far more work to do. We need urgency. We need big ideas. We need to rethink the status quo,  wrote Senator Merkley.  It has been noted that Bernie has an uphill battle ahead of him to win the Democratic nomination. But his leadership on these issues and his willingness to fearlessly stand up to the powers that be have galvanized a grass-roots movement. People know that we don t just need better policies, we need a wholesale rethinking of how our economy and our politics work, and for whom they work.

Her poor leadership and lack of impartiality as Chair of the Democratic National Committee has disenfranchised millions of Democrats around the country, and has inspired thousands of progressive independents to not only support Senator Bernie Sanders for president, but her Democratic Primary Challenger, Tim Canova, as well.Refusing to take money from corporations or Super PACs, Mr. Canova has raised over $550,000 in the first quarter of 2016 from small donations averaging $20 each. Ms. Wasserman Schultz s flailing public image began its downward spiral after allegations surfaced she rigged the debate schedule of the Democratic Primaries to shield Hillary Clinton, on whose campaign she served as co-chair in 2008, from exposure.Now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is shielding herself from exposure by refusing to debate her Democratic primary challenger. On April 11th, Tim Canova tweeted a video clip of a Debbie Wasserman Schultz s District Director, Jodi Bock Davidson, swatting a cell phone out of one of Mr. Canova s campaign staffers hand after asking Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she would agree to a debate. Most staffers of politicians would have lost their job after such an incident, but Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is no stranger to dirty politics, most likely applauded the response. Mr. Canova told a local South Florida newspaper he has sent three letters to the Debbie Wasserman Schultz campaign requesting to schedule a debate and has yet to receive any response. He has also started a petition on his campaign website for Debbie Wasserman Schultz to debate him. Debbie Wasserman Schultz continues to remain silent regarding his inquiries. She has often dodged questions about her primary opponent, hoping his surge will go away on its own if she ignores it. She told the Miami Herald Tim Canova won t change her campaign strategy, which makes little sense as she has never been challenged in her Democratic Primary since she entered Congress in 2004 until now, and her congressional district consists overwhelmingly of Democrats. It s no different than any other election I have. I have been on the ballot virtually every time. I do the same thing no matter whether I have primary opposition,  she said in the interview.Ms. Wasserman Schultz also dodged a question regarding why she thinks Tim Canova has gained the popularity he has. I really don t know,  answered Ms. Wasserman Schultz.  I am focused as I usually do on my own campaign, doing the best job I can to represent my constituents and that s my first responsibility is to do my job in Congress, to help elect a Democratic president and to make sure that in running for re-election people know the work I have done on their behalf. I m not remotely paying attention to what my opponent does. Apparently, not remotely paying attention to her opponent is synonymous with ignoring their requests to debate so voters can grasp a sense of where the two candidates differ on important issues to the constituency base. Ms. Wasserman Schultz s failure to engage with Tim Canova in a debate setting is undemocratic and sets a terrible example for the rest of the Democratic Party from its own Chair.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Clinton Campaign Has Been Collecting Dirt, Ready To Take On Donald Trump","Even though not all the states in the Democratic Primary have been accounted for, the Clinton campaign is feeling pretty confident as a surrogate reveals they are ready to take on Donald Trump in the general election.Their method? Release hell on the Donald Trump campaign with their copious amount of  opposition research.  David Brock, who spoke to Politico reporters, said:We [Democrats] can knock Trump Tower down to the sub-basement. American Bridge is building a database of all the regular people, from unpaid vendors to harassed tenants to defrauded students at Trump University, who got screwed over for one reason only: they took Trump at his word.American Bridge, as Brock refers to, is a group of private progressive donors who funnel money to Clinton s campaign through their PAC, and have apparently been collecting data and research on Trump since the summer of 2015. According to Brock, they have discovered a multitude of issues that Republicans missed when vetting the frontrunner. They also claim they have discovered  harmful information  that the media too has missed.What could be worse than what the media already knows? How much worse can he get after being exposed as a sexist, racist, xenophobic, bombastic, sensationalist fraud? Apparently that isn t enough to turn off voters, Brock warns. Instead, Democrats need to  be cautious, saying beating Trump will  not be a cakewalk,  but is possible if they paint him as  a danger to the Constitution, a menace to democracy, and a threat to the nation as a whole. Considering he s all three, this might be a cakewalk for Democrats. And what s even better is that American Bridge is as meticulous as Clinton herself, and has collected equally damaging evidence on rival Ted Cruz, should he squeak out a win at the Republican National Convention.As Brock puts it, should it come to it, this campaign will be a  bare-knuckles  campaign for the White House. And who better to come out swinging than Clinton?

 This Important Video Sums Up Why Donald Trump MUST NOT Be President,"Despite the damage that the presidency of George W. Bush and his war mongering administration did to the reputation of the United States, the world continues to look at America as a place of hope and great possibilities. This can clearly be seen with the excitement and electricity generated when Barack Obama ran for and then won the presidency. The world realizes the influence the United States exerts on the planet and thus looks very closely at our political developments, especially when it relates to presidential candidates.Thus, much of the world has been alarmed and scared by the rise of Donald Trump, a man who has promised to do all sorts of crazy thing once he becomes president. He won t rule out using nuclear weapons, he s repeatedly insulted and threatened Mexicans with his stupid wall, he wants to kick start an arms race, he wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Islamophobia would be state policy, and he wants to punish women who have abortions.As is stated in the video below: If Trump actually makes it to the White House, there s only one thing you can predict about this wholly unpredictable man: There will be a surge in what people will call anti-American-ism. People will mock the nation as dumb, vulgar, and aggressive. It will be like it was in the Geroge W. Bush years, only much much worse. We don t need another Bush, or someone who can actually be worse if that s even possible. Let s help keep America safe from this man by doing what we can to make sure he does not become president.Watch and share this video:Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Racist Vandalizes Bernie Sanders Supporter’s Car Then Brags About It Online,"A Bernie Sanders supporter s car was vandalized by Andy Hallinan. The man put two stickers over top of the woman s Bernie Sanders stickers. The stickers say  WARNING: This car is an MFV.  The letters  MFV  are short for  Muslim Free Zone.  The owner of the car saw photos of her vandalized car online. Hallinan posted two photos of himself before and after he put the stickers on the car, then posted them to them his businesses Facebook page. Hallinan is the owner of Florida Gun Supply, a gun store in Inverness, Florida. He has previously made headlines when he posted a video on his store s Facebook page, where he declared that the gun shop is a Muslim-free zone. The Council on American-Islamic Relations called on the Department of Justice to investigate the matter, claiming that banning Muslims from his store is a violation of federal law.The owner of the car wrote a post on Facebook where she said: I was at a Barnes and Noble today in Millbury Ma. I was drinking coffee and using my computer and posting and reading lots and lots of things about Bernie Sanders like I have been doing for some time now. Anyhow I come out to my car to find 2 stickers over my Bernie Sanders stickers. As soon as I got to an internet connection again I went to look up what the fuck the stickers where for and then I found a pic of my car on their website  Not only did they vandalize my car in my opinion they were trying to use my car to promote hate. And posted to their own FB page The sticker says Warning This car is a MFZ which means a Muslim Free Zone The car owner confronted Hallinan on his Facebook page where she was mocked by the page s fans:Social media is a powerful tool that lets people come together from all over the world to share ideas. Unfortunately, some of those people are only interested in spreading hate. Hallinan is not only interested in spreading his bigoted message   he s actually trying to profit from it by selling bumper stickers and promoting his store.Featured image from screenshot via Facebook ",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 It’s On: GOP Chairman Just Declared WAR On Trump With This Tweet,"Leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been bashing party leaders for several days after rival Ted Cruz has successfully maneuvered himself into securing several delegates. As Trump sees it, its unfair and undemocratic for Cruz to obtain delegates via state party meetings, arcane rules governing who receives delegates from primaries and the like.As a result, Trump has been loudly whining to the media.During an exclusive interview with The Hill at Trump Tower, Trump said,  It s a disgrace for the party. And Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself. He should be ashamed of himself because he knows what s going on. Trump is furious with several aspects of the Republican nominating process, including how Colorado recently awarded all of its 34 delegates to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) without having a primary or a caucus. He doesn t agree that some delegates aren t bound to vote for their state or district winner at this summer s GOP convention in Cleveland. It should go to a vote in Colorado like other places.   The best way to do it would be just a vote, should be a vote of the people. That s the way it should be done. The delegate situation is a very unjust way of doing things. After months of sucking it up, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus finally spoke up, releasing a tweet that   without naming any names   ridiculed the argument that Trump has been making.Nomination process known for a year + beyond. It's the responsibility of the campaigns to understand it. Complaints now? Give us all a break  Reince Priebus (@Reince) April 13, 2016With those few words, Priebus gives establishment oxygen to the so-called #NeverTrump movement. The party does not want Trump to get the nomination, as he loses to both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders with double-digit percentages, while also he has already become a drag on down-ballot House and Senate races.The tweet shows that they may be willing to use every obscure party rule at their disposal at the convention in Cleveland in order to knock Trump off the ballot and turn to a candidate like Cruz, John Kasich, or even Mitt Romney, in order to stop a likely loss of the presidential election from becoming a complete bloodbath for the Republican Party.At the same time, Trump has shadowy figures in his corner like Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist radio host Alex Jones, who already plan to protest in Cleveland, and have proposed a plan to confront delegates in their hotel rooms in order to keep pro-Trump votes in line.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 13, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Ben Stein Hilariously Bashes Trump, Tells Him To ‘Man Up’ And Stop His ‘Whiny Bitchiness’ (VIDEO)","Ben Stein is on a Trump-bashing spree again, and it s even more amazing than before. Just a week after he blasted the Republican front runner s sheer idiocy  in economics, Stein gave The Donald an epic tongue-lashing for his non-stop complaining about losing Colorado to his rival Ted Cruz.In an interview with Neil Cavuto on Tuesday afternoon, Stein didn t bother to mince his words as he condemned Trump for all of his  whiny bitchiness  after losing every single one of Colorado s delegates. Calling Trump a  big sulking baby , Stein hilariously pointed out that it was Trump s own fault for not reading the state s rules on the delegate process.While Trump s campaign b*tched and moaned about the  Gestapo tactics  that had supposedly caused Trump to suffer such a humiliating loss, Stein insisted that nothing of the sort had happened. Colorado s delegates had not been stolen, the system was not  crooked  or rigged, or anything other sorry excuse that Trump is claiming. Trump just sucks, and wasn t smart enough to read the rules beforehand. Stein mocked the ignorant business mogul: He didn t have one paid staffer on the ground. I assume he knows how to read. He s supposed to be so rich. Can t he hire someone to read the rules? What a great point. You can watch Stein s hilarious Trump attack below:To say that Stein likes bashing Trump is an understatement   he clearly loves it. Last month, Stein described Trump as a  big sulking baby  in a previous appearance on Cavuto s show, and he did so again last week. It looks like Stein has been holding his true feelings about Trump in for a long time, and is just getting started.But in all seriousness, Stein is terrified of the possibility of President Trump. In an interview with CNN, the conservative economist confessed that although he s been a life-long Republican voter, he would rather vote for a Democrat than see America s economy become destroyed under The Donald. Stein said: In all of my years as an economist, which is roughly 50 years, I ve never seen such nonsense as we just heard from Mr. Trump. And it breaks my heart, it makes me want to cry because I m Republican, I ve never voted for a Democrat, and to think the guy who s our likely standard bearer has such nonsensical ideas on every single aspect of the economy is just breathtakingly horrible.

 Fiscally Conservative GOP Governor Begs The Public To Pay His Bills For Him,"Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has blown so much money on his vanity presidential campaign that he put himself $1.2 million dollars in debt. An odd accomplishment for a  fiscally conservative  Republican who says that our government s debt is the most evil thing ever.Walker is trying to sell off the surplus garbage campaign merchandise that nobody wanted to buy the first time around, in order to cover his debts. He sent out an e-mail begging people to buy t-shirts from him for $45. If you really want to wear a t-shirt which will announce to everyone how stupid you are, you can find similar Walker merch online for about half the price.Walker isn t even able to fulfill color or size requests due to a  lack of resources.  He wants you to pay 45 bucks for something you may not even want to, or be physically able to, wear properly. Don t worry, though! If you get a shirt that is 3 sizes too small or a hideous color, he also said in the e-mail that the shirts can be framed or used for  crafty things  like a pillow cover or bag.That  exactly what I d do; Lay my head on a Scott Walker pillow as I stare at a Scott Walker framed t-shirt on my wall.Walker dropped $90,000 a day on his 70-day presidential run, which is a fact he isn t divulging to the people he s asking for cash. 70 days is pretty impressive to go from the great white right-wing hope to  Scott who? In the e-mail that he sent out to the people who are now upset that they forgot to unsubscribe from his mailing list months ago, Walker made some strange statements about how careful he is with money. If there is one thing the American people learned about me during our presidential campaign, it is that I am thrifty. Source: APWalker then went on to cite how he uses coupons and loves hitting up the discount racks when shopping. Do they give coupons for failed presidential vanity campaigns intended for boosting speaking fees and book deals?There s $1,200,000 worth of irony to be found in a  thrifty  guy, who is against big spending, asking people to waste 45 bucks on what is essentially an  I m with stupid  t-shirt. He would need a little over 26,000 people who are bad enough with their money to think this is a good deal, in order to cover his debt.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty ",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mark Zuckerberg Masterfully Takes Donald Trump Down A Peg During Facebook Speech,"If there s anyone right now worthy of complete and utter condemnation, it s Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. So, while speaking at a tech conference in San Francisco, Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid into Trump   hard.Zuckerberg said: I m starting to see people and nations turning inward against this idea of a connected world. I hear fearful voices talking about building walls  It takes courage to choose hope over fear. Instead of building walls we can help build bridges. Instead of dividing people we can connect people. We do it one person at a time, one connection at time. That s why I think the work we re doing together is more important than it has ever been before. This, of course, is a direct jab at Trump s ridiculous idea that the United States should build a giant wall spanning the entire length of the U.S./Mexico border. And Zuckerberg is right   we shouldn t be building walls, we should be tearing them down and building relationships that will foster future growth and development between the neighboring nations.Zuckerberg also said: Our lives are connected. Whether we re welcoming a refugee fleeing war or an immigrant seeking new opportunity. Whether we re coming together to fight global diseases like Ebola or to fight climate change, we have the courage to see that the path forward is to bring people together, not push people apart. Which is exactly right. We don t need a leader of our nation that is going to build walls to keep the world out, and in essence, keep us in. This sort of isolationist, xenophobic and nonsensical fear-baiting serves absolutely no one. It doesn t keep us safer, and it most certainly doesn t foster relationships with the rest of the world. Hopefully the nation will come together this November who will seek to build bridges and not walls.Featured Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images via Flickr",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 NC Governor Just Slapped The LGBT Community Even Harder With This Horrific Executive Order,"After North Carolina passed their new bigoted anti-LGBT law and Governor Pat McCrory signed it into law, he alongside the state has received a massive amount of backlash against the legislated hate.Taking this backlash into account, McCrory released a statement: After listening to people s feedback for the past several weeks on this issue, I have come to the conclusion that there is a great deal of misinformation, misinterpretation, confusion, a lot of passion and frankly, selective outrage and hypocrisy, especially against the great state of North Carolina. Based upon this feedback, I am taking action to affirm and improve the state s commitment to privacy and equality. Which basically is a non-answer and he s just pissed people are pissed at himself and his state. What exactly does his executive order include? A whole lotta nothing.Here s what McCrory s executive order states: Common sense gender-specific ?? What does that even mean. He s literally taking his hand, raising it up, and slapping the transgender community in the f*cking face with that load of bullshit. And he s still letting private businesses be bigoted jerks if they so choose, even if they serve the public at large   14th amendment be damned. Then as an ultimate cop-out he s leaving anything to actually be done about the hate to  local governments.  The only thing that maaaybe could be considered decent and humane is to expand the employment policy and seek legislation. However, he s seeking legislation in the same damn state house that wrote the legalized discrimination in the first place. So, all in all   this executive order is a big ole piece of useless horseshit.McCrory honestly doesn t seem to see the error his state legislator s ways or his own. He s, in essence, doubling down on anti-LGBT hate, and not doing a damn thing about the law itself. What needs to happen is for the law to be entirely repealed and protections enacted not for religious zealots, but for LGBT individuals.North Carolina s governor ought to be ashamed of himself. This is nothing but just another giant slap in the face to the LGBT community.Featured Image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Scarborough Shreds Last Bit Of Credibility By Floating This Insane Obama Conspiracy Theory (VIDEO),"In the last several months, Joe Scarborough   a one-time Republican politician and now host of MSNBC s Morning Joe   has gone so deep into Trumpmania and anti-Obama hysteria that it s hard to imagine his reputation ever recovering. On a recent Morning Joe broadcast, viewers got to watch as he torched the last bit of his integrity to take yet another cheap shot at President Obama at the expense of both common sense and objective reality.In the episode, Scarborough poured over Obama s recent interview with Fox News and concluded that the president was giving investigators probing Hillary Clinton s email servers coded, hidden messages through the airwaves. Tin foil hat firmly in place, Scarborough accused Obama of tampering with the investigation.Obama  said he wasn t going to talk to the attorney general about the pending investigation, but he just did,  he lamented. Talk about a rigged process. Scarborough s frequent guest and occasional yes man Bloomberg editor Mark Halperin agreed. It seemed ill-advised to say,  OK, I ve got no connection to this, but here s what I know about it and here s my conclusion,    Halperin said on MSNBC. He should just say,  I shouldn t talk about it,    Halperin added.    There s a pending investigation and I should keep myself away from it in every way and leave this to the independence of the Justice Department.  I don t know why he went on at such length defending her, because, in theory, he shouldn t really know the facts of the case. Both men seem to have very little understanding of the investigation or the context in which Obama stated his opinions. Scarborough in particular seems to have gotten his information from right-wing memes he read online. At one point, he claimed  over 100  agents were working on investigating Clinton s wrongdoing   a figure based on a long-debunked right-wing lie started by a Republican politician (for obvious reasons).Equally bogus is the idea that Obama could influence the investigation by stating his personal opinion in a Fox News interview. Given the fact that the president has repeatedly stood by his former Secretary of State, the premise that FBI agents would be oblivious to which way Obama leaned is laughable. He, like most of the country, finds the email  scandal  a waste of time, resources, and money (a lot of money). It s not exactly exposing nuclear launch codes if he tells reporters that Clinton s emails were mostly harmless   that s public record.Not that Scarborough would ever admit it, but even Republican presidents tend to side with their political allies and employees. George W. Bush, he might recall, was a fierce defender of Vice President Cheney s chief of staff  Scooter  Libby even after he was found guilty of lying about his boss s leak of an undercover CIA operative. Bush would later go as far as to commute Libby s sentence just before he left office.Unlike the tangible damage, Cheney s office did to national security, Clinton s email controversy is vague to the point of meaninglessness. The public has had a hard time getting itself worked up over the scandal because as far as anybody can tell, nothing truly damaging happened. As both Obama and Clinton have acknowledged, using a private email was  careless  but it wasn t exactly harmful.And thus Scarborough once again has embarrassed himself with a wild haymaker that failed to land.Featured image via MSNBC",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Watch: Another Black Protester Is Brutally Attacked By A White Trump Fan (VIDEO),"On Monday, what has unfortunately become a routinely occurrence at Donald Trump rallies has happened yet again: a black protester was violently attacked by one of the Republican front runner s insane racist fans.The incident happened at a rally in Albany, NY and was posted to social media by The Daily Gazette s Kate Seckinger. In the short clip, a group of protesters were being confronted by several of Trump s loyal fans when things suddenly got out of hand and took a turn for the worst. One of the men from the crowd lunged forward and grabbed one of the protesters (an African-American male) in the face. Other rallygoers tried to control the attack and pull the enraged Trump fan off of the protester, but not before he struck the protester across the face again. You can watch the disturbing attack below:Fight breaks out at @realDonaldTrump rally at the @TUCenter pic.twitter.com/YMZh60seGp  Kate Seckinger (@KateSeckinger) April 11, 2016The attacker, who later identified himself as  Mike , explains why he attacked the protester in the baffling clip below, courtesy of MSNBC. Basically, his justification for the violence was: I have my personal rights and my personal space. They re gonna start yelling about some bullsh*t, I ll snatch your *ss up. That s all. Mike claimed the supporter was  yelling in my face , but if you watched the clip of the attack, it s clear that the protester wasn t anywhere near Mike s personal space   Mike had to push through several people just to get close enough to attack the protester. It s also interesting that he would make a direct beeline for the only African-American protester. But anyway, here s Mike justifying his senseless act of violence and racism:It s unclear if any charges will come of this attack, and according to police no arrests were made.When MSNBC s reporter asked Mike if he was a Trump supporter, his answer explained everything. Mike said: Hell yeah! He s no bullsh*t. All balls. F*ck you all balls. That s what I m about. These kind of attacks at Trump s rallies are so unfortunately common. They are not only racially motivated and many times brought on by nothing at all, but they are encouraged by the disgraceful candidate himself. Trump has continually denied that his rallies are peaceful and safe enough for children to attend, however there is more than enough evidence to prove otherwise. Trump is running an irresponsible, anger-fueled campaign, and his supporters are just as racist, irrational and dangerous as he is. People like Trump and Mike are a disgrace to not only America, but humanity itself.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Mississippi Baker Who Made Cake For Republican Governor Publicly Humiliates Him,"Mississippi Republicans should worry about the billions of federal dollars they are about to lose but they should also worry about the Christian bakers they have pissed off.Just a few days ago, bakery owner Mitchell Moore blasted Republicans in his state for passing an anti-LGBT law that allows bigoted Christians to discriminate against employees and customers at will for any reason as long as they hide behind a so-called  sincerely held religious belief  to do so. The assumption that they think that they re looking out for us   that s not what they are doing,  Moore said during an interview about the new law, known as HB 1523.  We rank number one   our state government is the most dependent on federal money. We are the third most obese state. We rank at the bottom in unemployment, in education. We ve got crumbling infrastructure. None of them are being tackled. Instead, we are passing, hey-let s-discriminate bills. And now, a baker who made a cake for Governor Phil Bryant s inauguration is humiliating him and his Republican allies for making it difficult to be proud of Mississippi. Look Governor Bryant, we will make cakes for anyone!  Biloxi Cake Artist Extraordinaire Jennifer Noble wrote on Facebook underneath an image of her posing with Bryant.  Including backwards thinking politicians that make it hard to be proud of being a Mississippian. We never wanted this. Quit using our industry as an excuse to deny the separation of church and state. She then announced that she had removed the picture she took with Bryant and said she regrets posing for the photo now and is embarrassed she ever posted the picture on her page.Here s the full post via Facebook:So far, Noble s Facebook post has drawn nothing but positive responses and applause while Governor Bryant is still getting hammered for signing the discriminatory bill into law.And rightfully so. Bryant and his fellow Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for passing such a law and they should work to repeal it as soon as possible before Mississippi businesses decide that denying services to Republican lawmakers is their own  sincerely held religious belief.

 Paul Ryan Wants You To Know Once And For All: He Is Not Running For President,"The 2016 crop of GOP Clown Car candidates is simply awful. We have Donald Trump, who is a cartoonishly violent bigot with bottom-feeding imbecilic bigots for a base of supporters, and we have anti-gay, anti-woman neanderthal Ted Cruz, who is hellbent on turning America into his personal Evangelical church. Then there s John Kasich, who is seemingly a bit more moderate, but not really. At any rate, it s not like he stands a snowball s chance in hell at this point of snagging the nomination anyway.These sad facts have led to a literal civil war within the Republican Party, and many whispers that current Speaker of the House Paul Ryan might nose his way into the race at the last minute, should the Cleveland convention become contested. There s just one problem with that pipe dream for establishment Republicans looking to save their party, though: Speaker Ryan has absolutely zero intention of running for President.On Tuesday, Ryan said of the prospect of his running in a radio interview, via Alan.com: I am not going to be the nominee, I don t want to be the nominee,  Ryan said during a radio interview Tuesday.  If I wanted to be president, I would have run for president. This is a very scary thing for the GOP, because Cruz is a universally disliked extremist who is known to do things such as embrace an idiot preacher who once tried to perform an exorcism on President Obama, and Trump is a flagrant racist and misogynist who gets off on starting wars with female Fox hosts with whom he disagrees.Paul Ryan is set to make a statement at 2:15 PM CST ( 3:15 PM EST) on Tuesday to put to rest the untrue rumors that he has any interest whatsoever of attempting to put himself into the Oval Office due to the fractured nature of his party.Good luck, GOP.

" President Obama Wants A Woman To Be President, And That’s Not All (VIDEO)","The road to full equality for women has been long and it s been arduous, and we re still not there. Women are still not paid equal amounts to men for the same work in professions all across the nation. And to this day, women are still put down for their ambition, or seen as less than even if they hold superior experience and knowledge.One person who is definitely tired of this rampant inequality is President Barack Obama. He s been talking about women s equality since day one. He wants a nation where his daughters are treated the same regardless of gender. He wants their dreams to be just and big and bold as any boy s as they grow in to amazing young women.While speaking at the new Belmont-Paul Women s Equality National Monument, Obama stated: I want young girls and boys to come here 10, 20, 100 years from now to know that women fought for equality, it was not just given to them. I want them to come here and be astonished there was ever a time when women could not vote. I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women earned less than men for doing the same work. I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the boardroom or in Congress, that there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the Oval Office . I don t know how long it will take to get there, but I know we re getting closer to that day, because of the work of generations of active, committed citizens.

 Boeing Cuts 10% Of Jobs After Receiving $8.7 Billion In Government Tax Breaks And Subsidies,"The Commercial Airplane Corporation, Boeing, announced job cuts for 2016 are likely to reduce the company s workforce by ten percent, roughly 8,000 jobs lost, according to Seattle Times. The company cited operating and labor costs as the reason for the job cuts, but that is inexcusable given the company received $8.7 billion in government subsidies and tax breaks in 2013 for building the 777x in the state of Washington. The company has already eliminated 9,000 jobs in the region since 2012.Boeing epitomizes how the economy is rigged to favor corporations and the wealthy. Boeing is assisted by the government to increase production and built new operations, and in return the government does not receive any share of the profits. In the company s efforts to increase profits, the workers and their families carry the burden. There is no accountability or terms of conditions for companies like Boeing who receive government handouts. This is corporate socialism.Robert Reich told Rolling Stone in an interview this past October about the building blocks of capitalism,  every one of these building blocks has been altered over the last 30 years by very powerful money interests who have succeeded in changing these building blocks so that they improve the finances and enhance the profits of big companies   Wall Street and the very wealthy   but make most other people worse off. He added in the interview a free market cannot exist without government setting the rules, but the government has been setting the rules to favor wealthy corporations who have been insulating themselves from the competitive market.What we have seen in the past few decades, and has worsened in the wake of the Citizens United SCOTUS ruling, is corporate and wealthy influences have pushed for government to set the rules in their favor so they can maximize their profits while the working and middle classes in this country. Politicians now have to worry more about who is going to fund them or their opponent in an election, leaving little to no time to focus on what is actually best for the public interest.Featured Image via Flickr",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Elementary School Goes On Lockdown After Right-Wing Dad Threatens Teachers Over Sex Ed Class,"If there is one thing conservatives hate more than President Obama, it is the thought of their children receiving a well-rounded education   especially one that involves comprehensive sex education. In fact, an Iowa father was so enraged about the health class being taught that he caused an elementary school and others to go into lockdown.Decorah police say Bruce  Deano  Divers, Jr.  has been arrested and charged with three counts for causing the lockdown when he threatened two teachers on Facebook and sent an email promising to retaliate against the school because of health classes. The Decorah School District released a statement on Sunday night telling parents that schools would be in lockdown on Monday as a precautionary measure.According to KWWL News after they ran the original story, Divers reached out to them and sent them a copy of the email he sent the school. It read: Decorah schools spiritually declared war against my house today. When I retaliate Monday morning Apparently, this right-wing nutjob believes that a holy war has been waged because his child was given health information. Ironically, he could have avoided the entire situation if he d done his job as a parent months ago, according to Superintendent Mike Haluska. Interestingly enough, we have paper work available at the beginning of the school year for anyone who wishes to have their children exempted from any conversations that have to do with that type of subject matter. So what exactly were the kids learning about that pissed him off so much? It had to be about sex, right?WRONG.Superintendent Haluska said that the fourth-grade students were learning about puberty and human body growth. He freaked out because his kid was taught about puberty. Seriously. That s how crazy science-hating conservatives are. Let s forget for a minute that comprehensive sex education is vital to reducing the occurrence of sexually transmitted diseases and reducing the rate of teen pregnancy, learning about their bodies in a health class is absolutely vital to be able to function in society.We ve all seen the movie Carrie, do you remember when she got her period but had no idea what the hell it was because of her crazy religious mother kept her sheltered?That s what right-wing, anti-education parents what to subject their kids to.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Trump May Have Just Killed This Vile Conservative Anti-Woman Crusader’s Career,"Supporting Donald Trump was a senile move too far.Back in the 1970s, conservative Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly became an enemy to women across the country by leading the charge to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment which would have enshrined gender equality in the Constitution.For decades since, Schlafly has made it her mission to degrade and reduce women to submissive household slaves who have no other duty than to take a husband, be an incubator for fetuses, and leave jobs, politics, and education to the men.All of that should have been enough to make Schlafly a national pariah banished to the extreme fringe of society where she would never be seen or heard from again, but it apparently wasn t.But now it appears her downfall is finally near.Say what you want about Donald Trump, but the one thing he seems to be doing best during this campaign season is splitting the Republican Party and causing political civil war within the conservative ranks.Even among the leadership of the Eagle Forum, Trump has created a divide that has resulted in a power struggle that could at long last rid America of one of the most hated conservative power players.As it turns out, Schlafly s own daughter and several members of the Eagle Forum board who support Ted Cruz are making an effort to oust the 91-year-old because she supports Donald Trump, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reports. It s disloyal and it s terribly shocking, and I m completely depressed about it,  Schlafly whined before a meeting that resulted in the axing of Eagle Forum President Ed Martin, a longtime Phyllis Schlafly minion who believes the  hostile takeover  is due to  Schlafly s endorsement of Trump. The attendees purported to pass several motions to wrest control of the organization from me,  Schlafly claimed.  They are attempting to seize access to our bank accounts, to terminate employees, and   to control the bank accounts and all of Eagle Forum. Gee, you re being treated like shit and think it s unfair? Congratulations! You feel the same way that millions of women in this country have felt since you aided in cheating them out of a constitutional amendment that would have mandated equality and fairness. And it s about time karma came knocking at Schlafly s door to bite her in the ass.Here s the video of Schlafly endorsing Trump in St. Louis last month via YouTube.Donald Trump is an anti-women ignoramus who would be a complete disaster for our country if he were to become president. But now he can claim to have done at least one good thing for women and our nation as a whole by duping Phyllis Schlafly into supporting him and destroying her own power in the process.

 Anonymous Posts Video Of Donald Trump That Shows How CRAZY It Would Be To Elect Him President,"Donald Trump has shown his true colors time and time again while running for the Republican nomination for the presidency. Thus far we ve discovered that he advocates for violence at his rallies, he has racist tendencies, and he says many creepy things about women, including his own daughter. While all of these factors have put a dent in his possible nomination, he still has a comfortable delegate lead and he polls well in upcoming contests. Despite the overwhelming evidence that Trump is a certified douche bag, there are voters out there who find his insanity appealing. Now comes another video that the hacker collective Anonymous posted that proves just how absurd it would be to elect this man as the representative of our country and the symbol of our nation.Watch video here:The clip was taken in 2007 at Wrestlemania, and it shows Donald Trump tackling  professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon and then beating him to the ground. Trump then triumphantly pumps his fists in the air. A disgruntled McMahon is then tied to a chair and Trump is shown shaving his head as the crowd cheers him on.While this video is quite entertaining, it s very hard to imagine that the guy  we just watched clotheline and shave Vince McMahon s head could be the leader of our military, the planner of our economy, and the guy who represents America to the world.Let s hope that Donald Trump running for president is just a short and funny clip in America s history and nothing more.

 This GOP Lawmaker Is A Bigger Threat To Women’s Safety Than The Trans People He Hates,"An official investigation into a Tennessee Republican found him to be more dangerous to the personal safety of women than the LGBT people he wants to ban from using public restrooms.Tennessee state Rep. Jeremy Durham has sponsored a bill similar to anti-LGBT laws passed in North Carolina and Mississippi, which Republicans claim are necessary for the security of women.But according to an assessment by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery, Durham himself represents the true threat to women.During an investigation that is still ongoing, Slatery felt that he should warn Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell that Durham has engaged in inappropriate contact with female employees of the legislature and is threat to their safety. Based upon the information gathered thus far, Representative Durham s alleged behavior may pose a continuing risk to unsuspecting women who are employed by or interact with the legislature,  Slatery reported.Slatery went on to list the information gathered from interviews with 34 women Durham has interacted with, including that he held  a superior position of power to the women,  obtained their contact information under false pretenses, tried to meet with the women alone and contacted them  about non-legislative matters,  tried to serve them alcohol, and made inappropriate comments and  engaged in inappropriate physical contact with some women. Durham s bill would ban transgender people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity because he thinks they pose a danger to women.Of course, there is not one example throughout the 17 states and over 200 cities that have protections in place for transgender people of a trans person doing anything in a women s bathroom other than using the facilities.Durham, however, has been labelled a real danger to women and his own access to entire buildings has been restricted. These proactive steps include reassigning Rep. Durham s office from the War Memorial Building to the ground floor of the Rachel Jackson Building, and limiting his access to the Legislative Plaza, War Memorial Building, Rachel Jackson Building, and 2nd floor of the State Capitol for official legislative business only. These actions will be taken immediately,  Speaker Harwell announced via email to The Tennessean.In short, Republicans are hypocrites and perhaps there should be laws to protect women from them.Featured image via Facebook",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Poverty Kills As The Rich Live Longer Than Ever (INFOGRAPHIC),"The Republican war on poor people has been killing Americans and now we have the proof. A study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows clearly that poverty compounded by Republican refusal to spend money on the poor is unnecessarily shortening the lives of millions of people. We know that it s unnecessary because in the parts of the country where the poor are not treated like animals, they live longer.It s so bad that in some of the poorer parts of America, people have a life expectancy on par with developing African nations:The poor in some cities   big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.   live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.Meanwhile, the rich continue to live longer because in America, even longevity is for sale to the highest bidder: the gap in life spans between rich and poor widened from 2001 to 2014. The top 1 percent in income among American men live 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women, the gap is 10 years. These rich Americans have gained three years of longevity just in this century. They live longer almost without regard to where they live.Here s the map put together by the New York Times color coded for average lifespan. Notice that most of the low-end life expectancy is located squarely in Republican controlled states:This is a direct result of Republicans refusing to lift a finger to help those most in need. Between refusing to expand Medicaid, savage cuts to food stamps and a general attitude of  die quickly,  conservative politics are killing people with their greed and inhumanity.But it s more than just a lack of access to doctors that is killing the poor. By denying them any kind of economic help, the poor are forced to eat junk food because that s all they can afford. By denying them a proper education and job opportunities, the poor are highly stressed, already bad for your health, and have been turning to drugs and alcohol to cope:Life expectancy for the poor is lowest in a large swath that cuts through the middle of the country, and it appears in pockets in the rest of the country, in places like Nevada. David M. Cutler, a Harvard economist and an author of the paper, calls it the  drug overdose belt,  because the area matches in part a map of where the nation s opioid epidemic is concentrated.The good news/bad news is that in the places where the poor are not treated like lepers, they love much longer and healthier lives. Birmingham, Alabama took numerous measures to improve the public s health and, shockingly, it helped:In the area in and around Birmingham, Ala., the life span for adults in the bottom quarter of income rose 3.8 years for men and 2.2 years for women from 2001 to 2014.Clearly, they must have used the big government to tell you what size soda to drink, right? Well, not so much:The county expanded availability of preventive health care like vaccinations and mammograms by opening clinics in poorer neighborhoods in the 1990s and early 2000s (though recently it has closed some of the clinics). Although a relatively high percentage of the population lacks health insurance, a portion of local taxes goes to hospital care for those who cannot pay. The county has been ahead of the rest of Alabama in banning smoking in restaurants and workplaces, with a law enacted in 2012. And philanthropic foundations backed by old industrial money have funded campaigns to make people healthier in the Birmingham area.If the Republican-controlled legislature of Alabama had expanded Medicaid instead of throwing a temper tantrum, these measures would be even MORE effective. Still, Birmingham proves that even with a state government dedicated to hurting the poor, local governments can, and do, still mitigate much of the damage.The bottom line here is that while the rich reap the benefits of better doctors, less stress and access to healthy foods, the poor in large swathes of the country are denied the same, mostly by the rich and their puppets in the Republican Party. The net result is that millions of people are dying before their time so a small group of people can amass more wealth and power. Sadly, this drive to succeed at the expense of others is the new American Dream.The only silver lining here is that many of those same poor people have finally, finally figured out that Republicans are not going to help them. Sure, they turned to Donald Trump for leadership but even after he s gone, they ll remember who s been stabbing them in the back for decades. They may never embrace the Democrats but maybe, just maybe, they ll start demanding Republicans stop catering to the rich while throwing the poor the crumbs.We can only hope.Featured image via NY Times",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Samantha Bee Takes On The NRA And Its ‘Asinine’ Mascot And It Is GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"The National Rifle Association (NRA) is opposed to any and all sensible legislation when it comes to purchasing firearms. They want there to be no background checks, no questions   and definitely no waiting periods whatsoever. According to this nutty group, anyone and everyone should be able to have as many guns as they want, whenever they want, and however they want. This is most curious, though, considering that they are much more strict with how difficult they make it to dress up as their mascot, a large bird-like creature known as Eddie Eagle.Investigating this phenomenon is Full Frontal host Samantha Bee. You see, this awesomely hilarious lady wanted to dress up like the mascot, only to find that the NRA forces a 20-day waiting period for dressing up as Eddie Eagle, and bans resales of the costume on the interwebs. Bee says of the experience: There s something about that costume   so mockable. So asinine. I had to have one. Bee soon discovered that she d be better off just trying to get a gun online than trying to dress up as that silly bird: But you know what I could buy online without a big hassle? A used shotgun on armslist.com from a random guy down the road from the TBS headquarters in Atlanta. So I had one of my employees buy it from him in a parking lot without a background check from the trunk of his car. This just goes to show how ridiculous the NRA s stances are. They d rather you be able to buy a killing machine than dress up in their precious bird costume. None of the people running that organization need to have firearms or any sort of weapons whatsoever, because they clearly lack basic sense.Bravo, Ms. Bee for exposing this absolute insanity.Watch the video of Samantha Bee and Eddie Eagle below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 GOP Senator Loses His Sh*t On Twitter Over Trump’s Colorado ‘Temper Tantrum’ (TWEETS),"On Monday morning, Donald Trump appeared on Fox & Friends and raged over his loss in Colorado. The Republican frontrunner s tantrum was so bad that it caused a GOP Senator to absolutely lose his shit on Twitter.Senator Cory Gardner was livid that Trump has been bashing the state after his loss, especially since the rules for delegate counts were set up months ago. However, it was only after his embarrassing defeat that he decided he no longer wanted to play by the rules   typical Trump. After all of the whining, Senator Gardner decided to put The Donald in his place in an epic rant:If you can t figure out the Colorado GOP delegate process how can you figure out how to balance the national budget?  Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016 If you cannot navigate the @cologop convention what is your plan for Putin? #copolitics  Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016How can you protect Israel at the UN when you re completely baffled by the @cologop convention process? -CG #copolitics  Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016 How on earth are you going to defeat ISIS if you can t figure out the @cologop convention? -CG #copolitics  Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016The answer to those questions, of course, is that he has no plans. He never has. He tells his  poorly educated  supporters that he does, but he can t give out all of his secrets because someone might  steal  his ideas. His supporters, in turn, tell everyone else this load of baloney as if it s completely normal that a man who is running for President of the United States is refusing to tell people what he is going to do for the country. The senator had a lot more to say:Spoke to dozens of Trump supporters this weekend, listened to his surrogate speak twice, not 1 person complained abt process until he lost.  Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016 .@tedcruz showed up to the @cologop convention. @realDonaldTrump only sent a surrogate. Cruz swept. Elections are won by those who show up.  Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016Darryl Glenn came out of nowhere to win @cologop convention for US Senate. That should be the story. Not @realDonaldTrump s temper tantrum.  Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016I ve attended CO GOP conventions for years. It requires organization & attn to grassroots to win. Cruz had it. Trump didn t. End of story.  Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016That should be the end of the story, but Trump is a terrible loser. Instead of just admitting that Cruz won fair and square, someone must have cheated. It s a conspiracy!The reality is that Trump throws these fits because it furthers the narrative that he is the underdog fighting against the big, bad GOP establishment. And because his supporters do not have the common sense of a toddler, they believe him.It s not every day that a Republican senator so thoroughly owns Trump, so we must give credit where credit is due: bravo Senator Gardner.Featured image via  Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images (altered)",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Trevor Noah Just Came Up With The Perfect Job For Donald Trump, And It’s Not President (VIDEO)","On Monday night s Daily Show, host Trevor Noah wrestled with the problem facing Americans in any election cycle: we want both a president and a drinking buddy. Someone who can get the job done, but someone to whom we can relate. But it s ok now, because Noah solved it.Noah s sensible and hilarious conclusion is that America  must elect both a president and a mascot. Think how much time and embarrassment candidates would save if they didn t have to run around pretending to be normal people? Noah runs through the shambles of Hillary Clinton s subway ride, Bernie Sanders singing along to Hamilton, and John Kasich stuffing his face like an idiot (a focus group must have discovered gluttony is now an attractive trait in a candidate). Voters need a brilliant policy mind..but at the same time, Americans want a leader who s just a fun best friend.And I get that. But maybe, we shouldn t demand that these two be the same person? Isn t it a stroke of genius? Someone with capability, intellect and knowledge   who can devise and execute smart and effective policy. And someone to wave their arms about, shouts encouraging cheers, kisses babies and generally just pump everybody the hell up.But where, Noah wonders, would we find a  brightly colored cartoon character  with  a giant head and weird-sized hands ?Then he lands on it. We already found him. He s the current GOP frontrunner.While Donald Trump may not be fit to be American President, he would make a damn fine American Mascot.Even better, we would never have to watch Hillary Clinton attempt to Whip or Nae Nae ever again.

 This Moving Message To Trump Supporters Might Just Make America Great Again (VIDEO),"What started as a prank to annoy Trump supporters has turned into a viral vide which may just help Americans  come back together again   and that really would be great.A group of Muslim men walk into a Trump rally It sounds like the set up either to a joke, or a news report. But actually, it s a true story. As Patheos reports:Peace House, a media, art and activism group, sent a few Muslims  undercover  to a Trump rally, where they acted like Trump supporters themselves, to get to know the supporters and see how they would be treated. As they said in the video produced from their experience, they thought they d come away with footage that would prove funny and show supporters to be the caricatures many others thought them to be.The group entered the Donald Trump rally wearing  Muslims for Trump  T-shirts. They had seen protesters violently assaulted and evicted from previous rallies, and they arrived to get a good laugh at the expense of some dollar store racists.They began by hamming up the Islamophobia. You should be scared standing next to me right now  one of the men tells a concerned looking Trump supporter. I ve gotta be extra careful, I ve gotta look at myself in the mirror every morning and say  Don t do anything stupid.' But when they started actually talking with people in the crowd, they stopped laughing, as something dawned on them. These people weren t monsters. They were justifiably angry, but their anger had been misdirected. It made them want to make a very different video, one that would bring people back together, rather than separate them further. As they explain in the video: What happened to us completely changed our view of Trump supporters We went expecting the worst. But all of us were pretty surprised to see how loving and good intentioned these people were. If you voted for Trump, or you re planning on it, please watch this video. We wanna reach out to you. What follows is a truly extraordinary insight into how America might begin to heal itself from one of the most divisive and brutal electoral cycles in its history.https://www.facebook.com/PeacehouseUS/videos/527339194115003/The video has already racked up over 8 million views in around 24 hours, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

 Hillary Clinton And Bill Blasio’s Racist ‘Joke’ May Have Just Lost Her The Black Vote (VIDEO),".New York City s Inner Circle Dinner is typically an event where politicians and journalists rub elbows to raise money for charity by participating in parody skits for the enjoyment of donors. People who go expect to see some famous faces, have some laughs and do some good for their city. What they don t expect is for things to turn racist, which is, sadly, what happened when Mayor Bill Blasio and Hillary Clinton took the stage to perform a skit about Blasio s endorsement of the former Secretary of State taking a little too long for her liking.That s when the unfortunate happened. Like most public appearances by politicians, these things are typically scripted by a speech-writing team. How this one slipped past the goalie without anyone realizing how incredibly derogatory it is is baffling. It s unclear which of the pair s team came up with the  joke,  but what is clear is that it was NOT funny. Clinton starts by razzing Blasio for taking too long to endorse her, to which Blasio responds,  I was on C.P. time.  Clinton jumps in and adds that it means  cautious politician time. C.P. time  is actually a slang term for  colored people time,  intended to make fun of black people for being late. It s a horrible stereotype by itself, but when you add the insult of  colored people,  you have a joke that was destined to fail from the get-go.Blasio, whose wife is black and whose children are mixed-race, has been known to make racially charged comments in the past, perhaps believing that his own family demographics give him a pass, but Secretary Clinton, who isn t known as a racist, most certainly should have known better than to take part in that skit. She will certainly struggle to explain it and the apology machine will have to move swiftly to make this right. With the Democratic primaries already devolving into a mudslinging match, the last thing Clinton   or the party   needs is to fuel the fires of Bernie supporters who already classify her as a Republican.It would be extremely hypocritical for us as Democrats and liberals to overlook the incident completely and attempt to brush it off as  merely a joke,  considering what we would do and say if it were Ted Cruz or Donald Trump on that stage. This was a massive gaffe that shows that no matter how progressive our leaders are, even they can be insensitive to the racial tensions we face as a nation.Here s the scene, courtesy of the New York Post:Featured image from screen capture",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Secret Documents Reveal Connection Between Planned Parenthood Terrorist, Anti-Abortion Movement","In the immediate aftermath of the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs that killed three people and injured nine, conservatives did their best to distance shooter Robert Dear from the anti-abortion movement.First they tried to claim that the shooting didn t even occur at the clinic and was part of a bank robbery attempt. When that fell through they tried to say Dear wasn t motivated by abortion, but then he made comments in court about  body parts,  echoing the series of videos from the anti-choice Center for Medical Progress that were deceptively edited to allege misdeeds at Planned Parenthood.And now we are learning about a direct line between Dear and past anti-abortion terrorists, thanks to court documents that were unsealed on Monday.The documents give the deepest look yet into Dear s seething disdain for abortion providers.He told police he admired Paul Hill, a former minister, who was executed in 2003 for the 1994 shootings of abortion provider Dr. John Bayard Britton and his bodyguard, a retired U.S. Air Force officer named James Herman Barrett, outside the Ladies Center in Pensacola, Florida.Hill himself said he was inspired by the shooting death of another abortion doctor in Pensacola a year earlier. At the time of Hill s execution, some urged that he be spared for fear the extreme wing of the anti-abortion movement would turn him into a martyr.As these documents come out, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is campaigning with the support of an anti-choice activist who has praised the killing of abortion providers, while Donald Trump has said that women who receive abortions must be punished in some way if the anti-choice movement has its dream of an abortion ban.The line between the mainstream conservative movement and the terrorism of the anti-choice movement is continually blurred as the Republican Party continues to do all it can to appeal to this bloc of voters who are well beyond the mainstream of American thought.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 12, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Bill O’Reilly’s Bizarre Racist Rant On Fox News Surprised Even Trump,"Fox News Channel s top-rated host, Bill O Reilly, is once again attracting controversy to the conservative network for racially charged comments. On the April 11 edition of The O Reilly Factor, during an interview with Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, O Reilly decided to make some bizarre remarks.Discussing Trump s poor showing with black voters and his attempts to appeal to that demographic, O Reilly let loose:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOLp3bdurYBILL O REILLY: But how are you going to get jobs for them? Many of them are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads, and I hate to be generalized about it, but it s true. If you look at all the educational statistics, how are you going to get jobs for people who aren t qualified for jobs?The implication that blacks are  ill-educated  and  have tattoos on their foreheads  adds to the well-worn history of racist comments on Fox News, particularly from O Reilly himself.At a 2003 benefit for at-risk black children, O Reilly said,  I hope they re not in the parking lot stealing our hubcaps. In 2007, when visiting the New York City restaurant Sylvia s, which is in a predominantly black neighborhood, O Reilly said he was  surprised  it was like every other restaurant, and that shockingly when he went inside, nobody was  screaming,  M-Fer, I want more iced tea. He has also used the term  wetback  to refer to immigrants.O Reilly has also attacked groups like Black Lives Matter, who he claimed,  basically hate their country. Overall, Fox News has been home to multiple incidents of race-baiting over its long history, which reflect the values of network founder and president Roger Ailes. Ailes was part of Richard Nixon s campaign to ride racial resentment to the White House, and he later had involvement in the creation of the infamous Willie Horton ad that was used to attack Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988.O Reilly is just toeing the party line.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hillary’s New 404 Page On Her Website Is Actually Pretty Damn Hilarious (IMAGE),"Every website has a 404 page that you land on if you type in the wrong address. They re usually generic with a big  404  to let you know the error of your typing, but some websites like to be clever and let you know you re not where you re supposed to be by making a funny 404 landing page.One of those websites happens to be HillaryClinton.com.If you accidentally type in the wrong web address while looking for something on Hillary s website, you ll be taken to a page that asks: Trying to get where you want to go? This page isn t it. But while you re here, how about signing up to volunteer? via HillaryClinton.comHowever, to get the full effect, one needs to visit the page, because the image is actually an animated GIF.Of course, this is a play on her inability to get her New York City subway Metrocard to swipe through the reader to grant her access to the trains. However, if anyone rides the NYC subway frequently, they know the disdain most have for those readers and how often they re a huge pain in the ass. The former Secretary of State finally got the card to swipe after five tries.Many people after it happened took to Twitter to actually relate to the former New York senator:Oh man. It took Hillary five swipes. Welcome to the struggle https://t.co/3RGrZVUeVc  Brett LoGiurato (@BrettLoGiurato) April 7, 2016Yes, it took Hillary Clinton three or four swipes to get through the turnstile.

" Infamous Climate Denier Falls Apart After Bill Nye Makes Him A $20,000 Bet He Knows He’ll Lose (VIDEO)","Bill Nye was this close to participating in a debate on climate change with Sarah Palin, only to find out that he wasn t invited to the panel  But in a recently aired teaser for an interview with Marc Morano, the organizer of the climate denial panel, it s obvious to see why the group was terrified to let Nye on the stage with an intellectual lightweight like Sarah Palin   Nye mopped the floor with Morano s tired arguments and didn t even break a sweat.In a two-and-a-half minute clip of a lengthier interview, Nye gets Morano, a man whom Media Matters named the  Climate Change Misinformer of the Year  in 2012, to admit that the world is warming. Then he asks the outspoken denier to put his money where his mouth and winds up demonstrating just how little confidence Morano has in his own radical position.Nye: Would you take the bet? 2016 will be among the hottest of the last 10 years and that [between] 2010 and 2020 will be the hottest decade on record?Morano: No. I would agree with both of those, but I would say it s a meaningless stat because it s tenths of a degree.Nye points out that even tenths of a degree each year means major changes in climate over the next few decades. Morano, who comes from the school of  Let future generations worry about it  is again stumped when Nye flips the narrative by focusing on his children and the future he is building for them. Bear in mind, your reputation in the mainstream is a guy who will do almost anything to win. Your children go to school, they have access to the internet, they see your history, what you ve said about people. Your publishing of emails. You ve even encouraged harassment. I agreed to do this interview because I think it will expose your point of view as very much in the minority, and very much not in our national interest and not in the world s interest. And as I say again, I m very concerned about your kids. Morano is known as the guy who most vehemently pushed the bogus story that climate scientists were faking data to promote the climate change agenda. He operates almost exclusively outside of reality. Last year he threw an epic temper tantrum on Fox News after learning that Google planned to tweak their search algorithm to account for  factual validity  because he assumed (correctly, let s be fair) that his work would be pushed to the very bottom.The full-time propagandist recently produced and hosted a new documentary called  Climate Hustle  which he and friend Sarah Palin have billed the right-wing s response to Al Gore s Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth. Morano said the film  delivers a powerful presentation of dissenting science, best of all, in a humorous way.  Adding:  This film may change the way you think about  global warming.' According to an exclusive by Variety, Palin will be participating in an event that features a screening of the film and then a panel discussion afterwards. It will be hosted by Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas (another denier) and Palin   who once described oil, gas, and minerals as  those things that God has dumped on this part of the earth [Alaska] for mankind s use instead of us relying on unfriendly foreign nations. They re not exactly playing with a full deck.Nye has a reputation for tearing ignorant opponents to shreds during debates. He recently put on a master class during a much-publicized debate with creationist theme park owner Ken Ham, in which he not only emerged the victor, but probably even changed a few minds in a crowd of deeply religious Ham fans.Nye already seems pretty confident that despite not being invited to appear in person, his interview with Morano says it all. On Twitter, he trolled Morano after the teaser for the contentious interview between the two aired showing that Morano would not accept Nye s bet of $20,000.Climate denier (extreme doubter) won't take the bets 'cause he knows what's up re: global temperatures. https://t.co/OJfUoDPOMB  Bill Nye (@BillNye) April 11, 2016It was originally reported that Nye would be in attendance at the event to square off against Palin, this unfortunately isn t true. Instead, audiences will get to listen to Palin ramble on about polar bears and drill, baby, drill with nobody there to call her on her misinformation. It is, without a doubt, a major missed opportunity.Featured image via Getty",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 North Carolina Passes Anti-LGBT Law So This Porn Site Blocked The Entire State,"North Carolina is facing even more backlash for their anti-LGBT law Monday after a popular adult film site has decided to block the entire state in protest.XHamster.com went offline in the state at 12:30 p.m. EST today, leaving thousands of fans without their favorite porn site. When residents of North Carolina go to the webpage they are greeted with a black screen that the site s spokesman, Mike Kulich, says will stay there until lawmakers repeal House Bill 2. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Kulich explains why the company decided to pull out (no pun intended) of the state: We have spent the last 50 years fighting for equality for everyone and these laws are discriminatory which XHamster.com does not tolerate. Judging by the stats of what you North Carolinians watch, we feel this punishment is a severe one. We will not standby and pump revenue into a system that promotes this type of garbage. We respect all sexualities and embrace them. He went on to say that even though lawmakers rammed a bill that discriminates against transsexuals through, the viewers of XHamster seem to be far less bigoted than Republicans would like them to be: Back in March, we had 400,000 hits for the term  Transsexual  from North Carolina alone,  he said.  People from that state searched  Gay  319,907 times. That is actually quite common in Southern Bible Belt states, believe it or not. Although many of the voters in these states proclaim that they love their holy book and do not believe gay people deserve the same rights as everyone else, in the privacy of their own homes they frequently watch gay and lesbian pornography. Earlier this year PornHub (another popular XXX site) released the most popular categories by state and the South overwhelmingly preferred lesbian porn:Hypocrisy run deep in the South, doesn t it?Kulich says the company plans to replace the black screen with petition to repeal HB2 in the near future: Hopefully, it will get as many signatures as the  transsexual  searches,  he said.XHamster is just the latest in an expanding list of companies and entertainers who are protesting the state s ignorant law. One thing is becoming very obvious: Bigotry does not pay. Hopefully, the Republican lawmakers in North Carolina figure this out before they completely destroy their state, but until then, thousands of their voters are going to be a whole lot less satisfied.Featured image via Fallout Wiki",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Biden Says He’s ‘Ready’ For A Woman President (VIDEO),"Vice President Joe Biden has been careful to give Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders their fair share of lauding and criticism. Like President Obama, Biden has not endorsed any candidate for the 2016 race, and has pledged to stay neutral until a nominee is decided at the convention.But in a telling interview with Mic   in which his staffers tried to shut down   Vice President Biden may have hurled a veiled endorsement towards Clinton s way when he said he would  like to see a woman elected president. His comments, more specifically:This country s ready for a woman. There s no problem. We re gonna be able to elect a woman in this country. I would like to see a woman elected.After his staffers tried to cut the interview, Biden said he had no issues discussing the 2016 election, and reminded Mic that  the president and I are not going endorse because we both, when we ran said,  let the party decide.' Although he did not mention Clinton by name, there is only one woman in the running for the White House (unless Sanders picks a female VP or the Republicans do)  and that s Hillary Clinton. After brushing off his staff, Biden added that both candidates are qualified, but then added,  Hillary s overwhelmingly qualified to be president. Biden s comments will be an uplift to Clinton, who suffered a public humiliation after the Vice President branded her as  new  to the issues of income inequality, a staple of the Sanders campaign.Surprisingly, Biden told Mic that he does not believe Clinton is held to a higher standard because she is a woman, even though social psychology shows people do, in fact, hold women in politics to a different   higher  standard than men.Although not an official endorsement, is Biden ready for Hillary?Here s the interview, via YouTube: Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Hundreds Arrested At Democracy Spring Protest At U.S. Capitol,"Today, several  Democracy Spring  protesters were arrested at the US Capitol.  The protest appears to have broken the record for the number of people arrested at the US Capitol,  reported Reuters.Thousands of people concerned about the widespread corruption in politics due to big money interests, voter suppression, and dysfunction in Congress participated in the protests, which began ten days ago at the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. Organizations such as Greenpeace, the AFL-CIO, NAACP, and the National Nurses Union were part of a coalition of organizations participating in the protests. People are fed up with the system, they are fed up with the corruption, and we want free and fair elections,  Cenk Uygur, host of the TV show Young Turks and one of the participants in the protest, told Reuters in an interview.  This is our core American right. The fight begins today. It doesn t mean we win today. But in the end, we always win,  Uygur said.  Progressives have never lost. We won in civil rights, we won in women s rights, we won in gay rights, and we re going to win in getting our democracy back. The protest organizers are pushing Congress to pass four bills: Government by the People Act, Fair Elections Now Act, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 & Voter Empowerment Act of 2015, and the Democracy for All Amendment. The massive sit-in protest was peaceful, but buses were brought in to transport the activists who were arrested for demonstrating. Most media outlets have not covered the protests at all, and conservative media outlets have alleged the protests are just a re-branded version of the Occupy movement, which is false. Democracy Spring is being organized and run by well-educated individuals from various large and well-respected progressive organizations. Those wealthy elites who own mainstream media outlets don t want to give credence to the mass movement against corruption and the influence of corporate and wealthy interests taking over the United States government.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" With Zero Liability, A Gun Was Just Made To Look Like This Toy (IMAGES)","When you re given a free pass by the government to pretty much make whatever you want with no responsibility if something devastating were to happen because of your product, you d probably make whatever the hell you wanted with no remorse. After all, profit is more important that human life, right? At least, that s what the government is telling gun manufacturers with the  Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The law,  prohibit(s) civil liability actions from being brought or continued against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages, injunctive or other relief resulting from the misuse of their products by others.  With one of the reasons for the law literally being,  To prevent the use of such lawsuits to impose unreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign commerce.  In other words, they don t want any silly lawsuit to get in the way of profit.On paper, it may look like it makes sense to not hold gun manufacturers liable for how their product is used. After all, it s not their fault if a gun is not handled properly or used to harm someone else. However, what so many fail to see is the fact that with no responsibility it gives gun manufacturers a free pass to basically make whatever they want, regardless of public safety. If they can make it, people will buy it, and after that, well, they re off the hook.So, with all that being said, gun manufacturer Precision Syndicate, LLC made a gun for a client to look like the gun from Nintendo for the game  Duck Hunt.  Calling it the  Nintendo Glock.  The gun literally looks like a toy.via Facebook Here s the toy for comparison: It was always fun Duck Hunting and then Switching to Super Mario Bros. For some reason I would panic when I thought I shot the poor pup! ??? who else had fun with this? #retro #retrogaminglife #nintendo #nintendocontroller #nintendozapper #zapper #supermariobros #duckhunt #nintendocartridge #1985A photo posted by [CXG]Conspiracy Xtreme Gaming (@conspiracyxtremegaming) on Mar 5, 2016 at 11:35pm PSTHowever, after posting the picture to their Facebook page about the gun, they apparently got two reactions; request for purchase, and/or outrage. All in all, the image got over 8,000 comments, and nearly 150 thousand shares. They then had to make a follow-up post stating:In light of the  Nintendo Glock  drama, we feel that the media and our fans need to know that this firearm will not be mass produced nor will it ever be. This is a one off custom build for a friend of ours. Do to the thousands of emails and messages we have received in the past 2 days we have been unable to contact everyone in a timely manner, please be patient we will get to you as soon as possible. Thank you all for your support! Oh, and please.. keep your guns locked up and away from children, it s common sense.via FacebookHow nice of them to be condescending enough to remind people to lock up their guns to keep them away from children. If only they could use that  common sense  know-how to think twice before making a gun that looks exactly like a popular toy that children would want to play with.Now, say this gun were to get into the hands of a child for any number of reasons. This gun manufacturer is essentially off the hook, because assuming it functions properly and has no mechanical faults that cause injury, if someone were to just use the gun, the maker has no liability according to the law.There will certainly be people who disagree that gun manufacturers should have liability over how their product is used, but when something is made that so obviously could be mistaken for a toy, a toy that a child could point and shoot, there needs to be better  well regulated  standards to guns. After all, the Second Amendment was written for the intent to arm the state militias, not so gun enthusiasts can have firearms that look like toys or so that gun manufacturers can make as much profit as possible.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 ‘Christian’ Author Rants That Women Who Masturbate Are Going To Hell,"Christian fundamentalists just can t keep their mouths shut, and they wonder why people are turning away from organized religion.A supposed  Christian  author took to Facebook on Saturday to condemn women who use sex toys and masturbate to Hell, claiming that both are a  direct path to Satan  and declared that any Christian who disagrees should be ashamed. Too many Christian women are losing their salvation because they masturbate.  author Mack Major wrote. Dildos and all of those other sex toys have been used for thousands of years in demonic sex rituals. It s one of the main ways ancient pagan societies worshiped their demonic gods.Masturbation is a direct path to Satan. There s nothing normal about it. And shame on any Christian that says so. Hypocritically enough, Major seems to only take issue with women achieving sexual pleasure by themselves while avoiding the topic of male masturbation. Apparently that s acceptable.Mack goes on to warn on his blog that women are inviting demons into the world by masturbating. Many of you who are reading this have sex toys in your possession right now. And whether you want to accept it as fact or not: those sex toys are an open portal between the demonic realm and your own life. As long as you have those sex toys in your home, you have a doorway that can allow demons to not only access your life at will, but also to torment you, hinder and destroy certain parts of your life as it relates to sex and your relationships. Major also has a problem with women getting tattoos and piercings and tells them how to dress in church.This is the kind of crap women have to put up with from conservative  Christians  every day and it s only getting worse as some  Christian  pastors have gone so far as to call for women to lose voting rights and for women to be confined to the home.Again, it s bewildering how these same  Christians  can complain about dropping church attendance and fail to see that they are the ones causing people to walk away from the church in the first place.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Donald Trump Shames Kids For Not Registering To Vote For Him: ‘They Feel Very, Very Guilty’","Donald Trump is currently leading in the polls in New York State, but he won t be receiving two votes from his own kids. On Monday, Donald Trump admitted his son, Eric, and daughter, Ivanka, forgot to register to vote as Republicans before the deadline in March to be eligible to participate in the New York primaries on April 19th. They were unaware of the rules and they didn t register in time,  Trump told Fox News.  So they feel very, very guilty. They feel very guilty but it s fine. As we reported over the weekend, both Ivanka and Eric are registered to vote, but not affiliated with either political party. Their oversight is illuminating to the disorganization of the Donald Trump campaign.When Donald Trump first announced his presidential campaign in the Republican primaries last year, media outlets couldn t stop covering the circus sideshow of the Republican Party, which has taken over as Donald Trump is on track to win the Republican Presidential nomination. The funniest thing about it is he barely had to try. A few racist speeches, vague promises, and egotistical rants about how America needs to be great again, and only Donald Trump, a winner, can make it that way, and the majority of Republican voters have rushed to get behind this fascist demagogue. The remainder of the Republican Primary is now left between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, both vying for who can fearmonger more Republicans into supporting them while Republican establishment candidate and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who has his own brand of crazy, tries to hold onto being considered viable.In the defense of Trump s kids, voter registration should be automatic, as states such as Oregon and California have done, and the entire voting process, from registration to casting a ballot should be facilitated. They aren t the only two people who have been shut out of the Democratic process because they either lacked the information necessary to ensure their participation or weren t responsible enough to take the time to register with a party affiliate.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" God Gave Me Illegal Stock Shares At Dairy Queen Fair and Square, Claims Texas AG Accused Of Fraud","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, already facing intense scrutiny for securities fraud in one case, was just slapped by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with three additional charges of fraud based on an alleged illegal kickback deal Paxton and a company had used to entice investors and enrich Paxton by hundred of thousands of dollars.But let s not bury the lede here: His defense for these pretty clearly illegal actions is bonkers.Paxton is accused of raising nearly a million dollars from prospective investors for a company called Servergy Inc. and illegally keeping it a secret that he would be directly benefiting from these deals. After he persuaded some wealthy friends to put $840,000 into the company, he got 100,000 shares of stock in the company. To outsiders   and investigators at the SEC   this looked like a pretty clear example of quid pro quo securities fraud. It s very illegal to raise funds for a company without disclosing that you are benefiting from said funds for obvious reasons.Paxton, a Republican elected by 2014 under Governor Greg Abbott, claims what he did wasn t what it looks like because he had always intended to pay for the shares until a miracle happened while innocently chowing down on some hot eats, cool treats at a Dairy Queen with the CEO of Servergy Inc., William Mapp. During the meeting, according to Paxton, Mapp apparently heard the voice of God telling him not to accept a penny for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of shares. Instead, Mapp said they would be a gift to Paxton.This apparently is the defense Paxton   an accomplished attorney   is going with.The SEC said Paxton told investigators that the shares were a gift from Mapp, not necessarily a commission. According to the complaint, Paxton claimed he accepted the shares only after Mapp refused to accept an offer from Paxton to invest $100,000 of his own money in Servergy. I can t take your money. God doesn t want me to take your money,  Mapp told Paxton during a meeting at a Dairy Queen during the summer of 2011 in McKinney, according to the SEC.It s unclear if the  God wanted me to have a strong investment portfolio  defense has ever been attempted in a securities fraud case, but it seems unlikely many juries would be persuaded. And it will be a particularly steep uphill climb for Paxton in particular, who is already facing separate felony charges for similar crimes at the state level.Texas s state government has become a baffling menagerie of incompetence, corruption and scandal. Governor Greg Abbott, when not endorsing fringe theories about Obama invading the state, has allied himself with anti-pharmaceutical Scientologist groups who not only believe Texas shouldn t money combating mental illness, but that mental illness doesn t exist. Its previous governor, Rick Perry, recently barely escaped his own legal challenges after a lengthy court battle over his use of vetos while in office. The woman assigned to head the state s Board of Education is a home schooler who doesn t believe in science. Another woman running for the Board of Education accused President Obama of being a gay prostitute.In any other state, saying a technology company CEO channeled God to make you rich would make you a laughingstock. In Texas, he s just one of many.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Meet Zari, The First Feminist Muppet From Afghanistan","This is awesome on so many levels it s hard to know where to begin:Afghanistan is getting its first home-grown  Sesame Street  Muppet   a six-year-old girl called Zari.Zari, a curious and lively girl whose name means  shimmering  in the Dari and Pashto languages, makes her debut on Thursday on the  Baghch-e-Simsim  Afghan local co-production of the long-running U.S. educational TV show for pre-schoolers.According to Sesame Worksop, the goal behind Zari is to teach Afghani girls that there is more to life than being a wife and mother, a tall order for a country besieged by Islamic fundamentalists dedicated to reducing women to little more than broodmares. But that doesn t mean they re not going to give it their all:Zari will be featured in  Sesame Street  segments about health, exercise and well-being, and will interview a doctor and other professionals to find out what she would need to do to become one herself. The exciting part about Zari is that she is modeling for young girls that it is wonderful to go to school and that it s ok to dream about having a career,  Sherrie Westin, Sesame Workshop s executive vice president of global impact and philanthropy, told Reuters. It s so powerful that the first Afghan Muppet is a girl,  Westin added.Sesame Street is a very powerful tool to teach those evil liberal values of fairness and equality and how to be a better human being. Or did you think Republicans wanted to cut its funding for no reason? I imagine that the Taliban, sill very active in Afghanistan, will take the same dim view of Zari as Republicans take of Sesame Street in general. These are, after all, the same people that shot Malala Yousafzai, a 15 year old girl at the time, in the head for daring to go to school and encourage other girls to do the same.But if Zari seems like propaganda, you d be right:She joins  Baghch-e-Simsin  at the beginning of its fifth season. The show, which receives funding from the U.S. Department of State, is the most watched TV program among young children in Afghanistan, where 81 percent of children aged three to seven have seen it, according to Sesame Workshop.The idea is to overcome cultural taboos against girls going to school and building careers for themselves. And apparently it s working according to Westin. This is how you defeat religious extremists; not with bombs and blood but with joy and love. In a war of ideas, freedom will win out. It s not as  cool  and doesn t make the military-industrial complex rich, but it s far more effective.Featured image courtesy of Sesame Workshop",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fuming Trump Calls His Colorado Loss ‘The Biggest Story In Politics’ After Cruz Wins All 34 Delegates (TWEETS),"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump does not lose gracefully. In the past, he s threatened riots and violence if he were to lose the GOP nomination, but now that Ted Cruz is starting to close in on him, the business mogul is upping the ante.After a humiliating loss in Colorado, where Cruz took every last one of the state s 34 delegates, Trump is whining about the  crooked  and  corrupt  way America chooses party nominees. Ever the sore loser, Trump cried foul because Cruz was able to get all of the delegates  support, even though residents couldn t vote. Calling this perceived injustice  the biggest story in politics , Trump complained that the  people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians.  And of course, he made all of these accusations over his favorite news platform   Twitter: This unusual nomination process in Colorado state was explained by The Denver Post last year: Colorado will not vote for a Republican candidate for president at its 2016 caucus after party leaders approved a little-noticed shift that may diminish the state s clout in the most open nomination contest in the modern era.The GOP executive committee has voted to cancel the traditional presidential preference poll after the national party changed its rules to require a state s delegates to support the candidate who wins the caucus vote.The move makes Colorado the only state so far to forfeit a role in the early nomination process, according to political experts, but other caucus states are still considering how to adapt to the new rule. But Trump really can t get over it. Trump complained even more while speaking to thousands at a rally in New York yesterday, insisting that the GOP nominee should be whoever wins the most votes, not delegates. Trump said: What they re trying to do is subvert the movement with crooked shenanigans. We should have won it a long time ago. But, you know, we keep losing where we re winning. This morning, Trump continued to b*tch and moan on Fox & Friends. He said: I ve gotten millions   of more votes than [Sen. Ted] Cruz, and I ve gotten hundreds of delegates more, and we keep fighting, fighting, fighting, and then you have a Colorado where they just get all of these delegates, and it s not [even] a system. There was no voting. I didn t go out there to make a speech or anything. There s no voting. He also called some of the ways candidates try to win delegates  crooked : They offer them trips   they offer them all sorts of things, and you re allowed to do that. I mean, you re allowed to offer trips, and you can buy all these votes. What kind of a system is this? Now, I m an outsider, and I came into the system and I m winning the votes by millions of votes. But the system is rigged. It s crooked. Clearly, Trump has forgotten all about that time he bribed former candidate Ben Carson with a job so the retired neurosurgeon would endorse him. Talk about  crooked. Whether Trump likes it or not, he s going to have to play by the rules and if he doesn t the nomination is going to keep slipping away from him. He s going to have to appeal to delegates instead of people like his easily influenced racist, misogynistic supporters. Trump delegate chief Paul Manafort reports that Trump is going to implement a strategy similar to what Cruz has been doing. Manafort said: A more traditional approach is needed and Donald Trump recognizes that. In order for Trump to get enough delegates to get the Republican nomination by June 7, he will still need to win 60% of the remaining delegates. Right now, Trump is winning 45%. According to the Associated Press, Trump has 743 delegates compared to Cruz s 545.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Joel McHale Performs In Bigoted North Carolina, But Then Did Something EXTRAORDINARY (IMAGE)","When faced with deciding if you re going to perform or not in a state that decided to make discrimination legal, many performers are left feeling there is only one option   boycott. And while very effective, because not only does it remove revenue from the state surrounding the performance, it also pisses off a lot of people who were looking forward to the show. People, who will then want to know why one of their favorite performers decided not to show up, if they didn t know already.Comedian Joel McHale, however, went another route to combat the hatred of the new bigoted North Carolina anti-LGBT law.

However, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,  hate is too great a burden to bear,  it s actually easier to love, and hopefully the lawmakers in North Carolina realize this sooner than later.Kudos to you, Mr. McHale, this gesture will not be forgotten.Featured Photo by Angela Weiss/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Rock Legend Bryan Adams Tells Bigoted Mississippi Republicans To Go F*ck Themselves,"Everything he does is definitely NOT for hateful Republicans, as rock singer Bryan Adams just cancelled an upcoming concert in Mississippi rather than perform in a state where discrimination is legal.Mississippi Republicans passed a bigoted law earlier this month giving business owners and religious organizations the ability to fire employees and refuse service to customers who don t meet their extreme religious standards.So if you are gay or have pre-marital sex or are involved in an interracial relationship, businesses can discriminate against you and hide behind their Bibles to do so.Because of the law they passed, Mississippi Republicans may have cost their state billions of federal dollars, which they desperately need considering Mississippi is the top state in the nation when it comes to getting more money from the government than it pays in taxes.Corporations have also condemned the law and are threatening to no longer do business with or in the state as long as the law remains on the books. And now concerts are being cancelled.Just as Bruce Springsteen cancelled a concert in North Carolina over a similar law passed by Republicans there, Bryan Adams has cancelled his concert in Mississippi for the same reasons. Mississippi has passed anti-LGBT  Religious Liberty  bill 1523,  Adams wrote in a statement on his website. I find it incomprehensible that LGBT citizens are being discriminated against in the state of Mississippi. I cannot in good conscience perform in a State where certain people are being denied their civil rights due to their sexual orientation. Therefore i m cancelling my 14 April show at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. Using my voice I stand in solidarity with all my LGBT friends to repeal this extremely discriminatory bill. Hopefully Mississippi will right itself and I can come back and perform for all of my many fans. I look forward to that day. If any Bryan Adams fans are angry about the singer s stand against discrimination and bigotry, they only have Mississippi Republicans to blame for legalizing hate in their hate in the first place.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Kasich Was Just Embarrassed By Republican Lawmakers In His Own State,"Ohio Governor John Kasich has had a pretty difficult time getting his message out during the Republican race for the White House. Many of us assumed it was because he is being overshadowed by Trump and Cruz, but apparently this is a problem that he is facing in his own state as well   and it is quite embarrassing.Last week, the governor gave his annual State of the State Address and laid out his plans for the state. Instead of Republican lawmakers rallying behind their leader like you would expect them to   especially since he is running for president   they brushed him off just like voters have nationwide. According to The Columbus Dispatch: After he called on legislators during his State of the State address last week to revamp the way Ohio s congressional districts are drawn, his fellow Republicans who lead the General Assembly panned the proposal.Senate President Keith Faber   who represented the Kasich campaign this weekend in Michigan as GOP convention delegates were picked   said the legislature has higher priorities. .Even on modest Kasich proposals, such as altering state income-tax withholding tables that would get money to Ohioans faster but not provide an overall tax cut, the Republican leaders  biggest commitment was that they would consider his ideas.Ouch. That s rough. The Republican legislature apparently has no interest in listening to their leader. Kasich has spent his entire campaign telling the American people what an effective governor he has been, but if that were true wouldn t Ohio lawmakers be a little bit more enthusiastic about his proposals? Instead, they are like, Nah bro, we got this. Go away. Not only are lawmakers in Ohio wondering what the hell he was doing there, but Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are treating him the same way in the race for the White house. Both of his fellow candidates have been very vocal in the last week or so about their desire to see him drop out of the race, but Kasich said that isn t going to happen. Instead, the governor is continuing to sell himself as the  adult  who will be able to get the job done in the White House.I m not entirely sure how he expects to get anything done if he is president when he can t even get the Republicans in his own state to work with him. If his own party in his own state treats him like an annoying gnat, imagine how ineffective he d be in the Oval Office. This is just further proof that all of the GOP candidates would be horrible for the country and we need to vote blue in November.

" White Crowd Chants ‘Donald Trump, Build That Wall!’ And Then The Black And Latina Players Did This","At a Wisconsin high school soccer game, players from the visiting team walked off the field as the home team crowd disgraced themselves with racist chants of  Donald Trump, build that wall! :BELOIT, Wis.  Officials from the Elkhorn Area School District are investigating racist taunts directed at Beloit Memorial High School soccer players by a group of its students attending a game.The incident happened Thursday night as the Beloit Memorial girls varsity soccer team visited Elkhorn.Beloit Memorial girls soccer coach Brian Denu said the Elkhorn students taunted black and Latina girls soccer players with racial slurs and chants like  Donald Trump, build that wall. Considering the young age of the students doing the chanting, it s hard to say if they actually meant what they were saying or if they just thought it would be a clever way to distract the opposing team. Either way, the effect was devastating: They came off the field and weren t able to finish the game because they were too upset and distraught over what happened to them,  Denu said. One of the girls was cradled in the arms of one of our assistant coaches for a good 15 to 20 minutes. Denu said even though the chants came from a small group of Elkhorn students, their words had a big impact on his players. I could just see the hurt and pain on their face and know that this was obviously something that they hadn t seen before,  Denu said.I want to give the benefit of the doubt but in all likelihood, this is the Trump Effect spilling down. It s not difficult to imagine that the parents of these students are ardent Trump supporters that have been gleefully teaching their children that it s OK to hate if the other person has dark skin. That is, after all, the core of Trump s popularity. It s not just that he s openly racist, he s telling his followers that it s permissible, encouraged even, for them to openly hate as well.School officials are looking into the incident but it s unclear if they will be able to do anything about it. At the very least, it would be nice if the other students from Elkhorn publicly shunned their fellow classmates for their racism.Featured image via AI archives",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 John Oliver Gets Revenge On The Most Hated Section Of The Financial Service Industry (VIDEO),"John Oliver has taken aim at the section of the financial services industry which has seen the most complaints registered with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau   and it s beautiful.Credit reporting agencies like Experian, Equifax and TransUnion are responsible for providing an accurate assessment of a person s credit worthiness. Their verdict decides whether a person can get a loan, buy a house, rent an apartment, or even get a job. But something has been going very wrong in the industry.Oliver notes that over half of employers are now conducting credit searches before choosing to hire prospective employees   even though someone s credit rating has zero link to their job experience or skill level.What s worse, is that this largely unregulated industry has been found to supply false information up to 30% of the time. And those affected won t even know that the company is attributing false information in their name until the report has been submitted and the damage has been done.A faulty credit report caused by some clerical error has the potential to reap havoc in your life   and yet, it is happening all the time. Oliver cites the case of a man attempting to rent his dream apartment  who ended up fighting allegations of being a terrorist  after the credit company s faulty criminal background check.No surprise then that more people complain about credit report agencies to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that anyone else. Yet, the industry recently boasted about being right 95% of the time. Oliver explains exasperatedly: But when you are holding records for more than 200 million individuals, that 5 percent error rate affects 10 million people. They re basically saying,  Great news everyone,  we only f*cked up a group equivalent to the entire population of Sweden! We re the f*cking greatest!   Oliver takes revenge by setting up new websites for the leading companies in this remarkably dodgy industry.Experian becomes Experianne.com: a company that specializes in whispering passages from  Mein Kampf  into the ears of babies, without the permission of parents or the babies themselves.  With the important disclaimer:  Please do not mistake us for Experian. What they do is unforgivable. TransUnion becomes Tramsonion.com:  We re a company whose only business is selling steaks made out of dead orcas from SeaWorld!  And of course:  We are not affiliated with TransUnion. We are not monsters. Equinox becomes Equifacks.com: a company which  Takes an animal from a shelter that needs a good home, lets it come to your house to lick peanut butter off your dick, and then immediately returns it to the shelter.  Make sure you don t mistake them for Equifax though, because  Those f*ckers are evil. Nice work Mr Oliver, nice work.

 Ken Burns Explains Donald Trump Mania In Five Perfect Little Words (VIDEO),"Filmmaker Ken Burns appeared on The Late Show this week, and explained to host Stephen Colbert why a section of America has fallen in love with Donald Trump, in just five words: America has always been racist. I think the American question of freedom is a big one, the tension between individual freedom and collective freedom is a big one, but I think the sub-theme of American history is race,  Burns said. We were founded on the idea that all men were created equal, but oops the guy who wrote that owned more than 100 human beings and didn t see in his lifetime to free any one of them; didn t see the contradiction or the hypocrisy. And so it set us on a journey where we are constantly having to struggle not with race, but racism. Burns  latest film focuses on the life and trials of Jackie Robinson, one of the greatest players in baseball history   and the first non-white player in the professional leagues. He makes the parallels between how many of the same problems faced by Robinson, and dismissed as  historical  are actually still alive and well in modern America. We thought it might be possible to liberate him from the barnacles of sentimentality that attach, because what Jackie Robinson has to teach us now is exactly the same as when he was alive,  he says. So, if we re curious, but are not comfortable talking today, having a courageous conversation about race, let s look at Jackie Robinson s life and see how many of the same tropes that are part of our life today Jackie addresses. [He s] not only the most important person in baseball, but the most important person in American sports. Burns certainly has a point. Whether we look at incarceration rates, unequal prison sentences handed down for equal crimes, stop and frisk, the pay gap (African American men earn just 74.5% the pay of white men), police brutality, felony disenfranchisement, or the school to prison pipeline   it s abundantly clear that racism still permeates American society in a way that hurts the life chances of non-whites.Now that latent racism has a candidate willing to put a voice to it   and to some such-minded people, it feels like liberation.But they should not confuse the collective release of unspoken privilege, with an honorable quest for freedom. Trump supporters have more in common with Hitler s brownshirts than the Freedom Riders.They are angry and vengeful, worshipping a leader who looks like them, blaming everything wrong with their lives on people who don t look like them. They are nothing new. Their bigotry is as old as the constitution. They ve been outnumbered and defeated in previous generations, now they ve risen again to fight for their right to be racist in this generation  and the scoreboard is not in their favor.

 Watch What Happens When This Guy Tries To Pick Up Girls Using Trump Quotes (VIDEO),"Usually, men have all the advantages   they make more than women, are automatically considered more competent (whether or not this actually the case) than women, have higher promotion prospects, can walk down a public street without worrying about random passersby sexually harassing them, don t have to worry about things being blamed on the way they were dressed at the time, and even can practice religion without the dogma of their faith placing them in subjugated roles. But one area in which men have more problems is the dating world.According to experts, men feel significantly more anxiety about dating than do women. But since Donald Trump is so awesome, YouTube prankster Ari Blau tried channeling the billionaire 2016 presidential candidate to see how much that helped (hey, Trump says that everybody loves him, right?). In short, it was as much a disaster as Trump s presidential campaign.Blau used actual Trump quotes while  trying  to score a date. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best. They re not sending you. They re not sending you. They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems to us,  he tells one woman, who responded much in the same manner as the rest of the country when Trump initially made those remarks.  I m just saying we need to build a wall. That one got him slapped.Blau told a Muslim woman he is  calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.  When she pointed out that he said he doesn t like Muslims, he informed her that she and her friend look like  nice ones. Surprisingly, neither of them were interested in hanging out after those remarks.Another woman walked away when he assured her that his hair is real and offered to allow her to feel it, while he elicited a  What the fuck?  response from an African-American lady who had just been informed thatBlau doesn t like black people counting his money (he d prefer a Jewish guy). Another African-American woman who had just been informed that  Barack Obama s birth certificate is a scam  told Blau exactly what America has been telling Trump for years: You seem like a terrible person. Tell me about it. He was emulating one of the worst people.Interesting, one of Blau s colleagues, Vanessa Elgrichi, had much better success in getting some digits while dropping Hillary Clinton quotes on guys, even when she literally barked like a dog (yes, Clinton did that) for about 10 seconds and paraphrased the plotline of right-wing cinema treasure,  13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi  (technically not a quote, but it was funny).Guys just don t give a f*ck. You can see that happen below:No word on the effectiveness of Bernie Sanders quotes yet.Featured Image via screengrab",News,"April 11, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Report: Turns Out Most Of Trump’s ‘Charity’ Was Giving Free Golf To His Business Friends,"Given the fact that Donald Trump has often bragged that he intentionally used his numerous bankruptcies as a way to exploit the government (and taxpayers) into paying his debts, it s not exactly surprising to learn that the billionaire business mogul has a spotty track record with philanthropy, but the scope of his greed, revealed in a new deep dive analysis by the Washington Post, is shocking.Trump loves to brag that he has given over $100 million to charity in the past five years, but like nearly everything the Republican frontrunner says, the truth is much different. Trump published a list of 4,844  contributions  he s made, which seems impressive until you actually start to look at what the donations are.As the Washington Post discovered: many of the gifts that Trump cited to prove his generosity were free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles.Trump s campaign also counted a parcel of land that he d given to New York state   although that was in 2006, not within the past five years.The Donald J. Trump Foundation, Trump s biggest charity, was especially notable for its lack of well Trump. Between 2008 and 2014, Trump didn t donate a single penny of his own money to the foundation, instead he leaned on rich friends to give their money and he then sent out the checks to the charities under his name. What a guy.And while some of that money undeniable went to good causes, Trump also used a lot of his  donations  to shore up his political and business interests. The Washington Post again:His foundation, for example, frequently gave money to groups that paid to use Trump s facilities, and it donated to conservatives who could help promote Trump s rise in the Republican Party. The foundation s second-biggest donation described on the campaign s list went to the charity of a man who had settled a lawsuit with one of Trump s golf courses after being denied a hole-in-one prize.Trump s campaign had a truly stunning response when asked to explain why Trump s charitable giving was so weak: They didn t want to make Trump an easy mark for other charities. We want to keep them quiet,  said Weisselberg, who is also treasurer of the Trump Foundation.  He doesn t want other charities to see it. Then it becomes like a feeding frenzy. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.And while Trump certainly isn t the only rich person to horde his money for himself, his friends, and his business interests, it s worth noting that other billionaires have rejected this egregious level of greed and actually given vast amounts of their wealth to real, world-changing causes. Bill Gates, for example, has given $28 billion already and he says he s not done. It wasn t given to give friends free tickets to a game of golf, either. Gates and his wife have spent years fighting to eradicate the scourge of polio off the face of the earth, something he calls  a gift for the rest of time. Likewise, Warren Buffett set a charity record in June 2015   around the time Trump was teasing his presidential run   by donating $2.8 billion in one lump sum.Donald Trump has gotten pretty far in the election by impressing his supporters with his wealth. Many cite his business skills (debatable as they are) as the primary reason they will vote for him. However, is it not just as important to see what he does with the money once he has it? Unlike other people fortunate enough to have billions, it s clear he believes giving away his money to fight disease, poverty, or other social causes is a waste. He s repeatedly taken advantage of his wealth to influence people and get ahead.Somebody might want to pull him aside and let him know that money isn t something you can take with you when you die. He may even thank you for the advice with a free golf pass.Featured image via Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Cruz Is Grabbing Delegates From Trump And Trump Supporters Are FREAKING OUT Like This,"As the Republican Party establishment continues to ratchet up its support of Ted Cruz and his campaign in order to stop Donald Trump from capturing the party s presidential nomination, a backlash appears to be growing amongst Trump supporters.One Trump fan took to YouTube to reveal his anger at the establishment s machinations:According to the video s description, the man is a Republican Party State Delegate in Colorado, and he burned his party registration card in protest of the recent party event because he was  removed from his position because he voted for TRUMP. The video is in response to the recent event in that state where Cruz was able to engineer a maneuver where he got all the delegates available. Cruz took all 13 of the delegates up for grabs on Saturday to complete a clean sweep of the state. Delegates endorsed by his campaign swept all seven congressional district conventions held over the last week as well, which added another 21 delegates. Another three slots are reserved for state party officials. Today was another resounding victory for conservatives, Republicans, and Americans who care about the future of our country,  the Cruz campaign said in a statement Saturday night.Trump was completely out hustled at the event, and repeating that campaign s habit of being ill-prepared, handed out incorrect fliers and forms advising their supporters how to get through the delegate process.In response to the effort to deny Trump the nomination on the first ballot at the Republican Convention, where he is required to have 1,237 delegates in support, Trump ally and professional Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone recently announced that in cooperation with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, he plans to hold rallies in Cleveland during the convention. Stone also said he was encouraging Trump supporters to go to the private hotel rooms of delegates in order to intimidate them into backing Trump.Despite the theatrics, Trump still has a nearly 200 delegate lead over Cruz. Trump has 743 delegates, Cruz has 545, and John Kasich has 143. Trump is expected to do very well in the upcoming Republican primary in his home state of New York.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Muslim Woman Who Turned In Paris Terrorist Shares Important Thought With The World,"Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the planner of the terrorist attacks that hit Paris on November 13, 2015, was killed after a raid led by French authorities who stormed an apartment in the town of Saint-Denis. It has now been revealed that police found Abaaoud in part thanks to information given to them by a Muslim woman.She has now revealed her faith because she wants the world to know the following:But until now, the public has been unaware that the critical tip in the hunt for Abaaoud came from a Muslim   one of millions who now face a backlash in Europe fueled by anger over the attacks in Paris and Brussels, as well as fear and resentment of a rising tide of refugees. It s important the world knows that I am Muslim myself,  the woman said, citing that as a reason for being willing to speak to The Post.  It s important to me that people know what Abaaoud and the others did is not what Islam is teaching. Too often after terrorist incidents, people   particularly conservatives   act as if Islam is the only faith that extremists use as justification for mass murder, ignoring the history of other faiths (including Christianity) being perverted.When terrorists have hit America the hardest, their attacks did not discriminate by faith. In fact, one estimate says that 32 Muslims were killed in the 9/11 attacks.Ironically, even though his administration declared war on Iraq, it was President George W. Bush who often went to great lengths to point out there was a distinction between those who practice peaceful Islam, and the terrorist hijackers. And that sentiment has continued with President Obama, who pointed out that when discussing Americans and those with Islamic faith, it s  not them or us, it s just us. This woman s example shows that blanket condemnations of Muslims, as agitators like Donald Trump have engaged in, are backwards and just flat-out incorrect.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Arizona GOP Speaker Invokes 911 To Ban Press From House Floor In Retaliation For Negative Story,"Arizona Speaker of the House David Gowan (R) enacted a new policy to punish members of the press for the fact one of them published a story that exposed him for repeatedly violating state law.The new rule states that any member of the press who wants to cover the legislature from the House floor has to undergo draconian background checks, including examinations of their criminal, civil, and even their driving records. It s absolutely insane that driving records, or other unimportant misdemeanors, can automatically disqualify a member of the press from being on the house floor for up to 10 years.Press members, so far, have refused to consent to these background checks. As a result, they have to now cover the proceedings from the balcony.My view from the house today. floor privileges revoked after reporters declined to sign background check form. pic.twitter.com/4g0lOCdWm0  Alia Beard Rau (@aliarau) April 7, 2016As usual, Republicans want you to think that their use of the government to attack its own citizens is a good thing. Gowan has tried to say that it s  all about safety  when justifying his childish actions   despite that there have been zero incidents in 34 at the Arizona State House that would suggest a policy like this is necessary.Gowan actually invoked 9/11 to justify this garbage: There had never been an attack on 9/11 either, like that occurred either, before on our shore, but it did. Source: Arizona Daily StarRight. We can t be too careful these days because they surprised us on 9/11. I m not sure you can make a more offensive comparison.Here is what caused all this ruckus. Hank Stephenson of the Arizona Capitol Times ran a piece about Gowan s use of a state vehicle during approximately a 20-day period, where he traveled 4,800 miles. Some of the locations he traveled to were related to Gowan s campaign for his election to Congress. After the story ran, Gowan was forced to reimburse the state $12,000 dollars and now he s currently under investigation for further misuse of public resources by the Arizona Attorney General.It s been suggested that this entire charade was done just to get back at Stephenson personally, who was convicted of trespassing after a bar fight a few years ago. The rule immediately screwed over this reporter in a very personal and retaliatory way, along with every other person who might have some issue with which the new rule is at odds.The constitutionality of the new rule is to be determined. A statement by ACLU of Arizona said that the new rule might not be unlawful because it doesn t fully ban the press from the House. It only prevents them from being on the floor. It s a skirting of the constitution that might allow Gowan to get his way, unfortunately.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Texas Youth Pastor Exposed As Demented Child Predator (VIDEO),"Until his arrest on April 5, Willie Lee Bell Jr. was the children s pastor at First United Methodist Church of North Texas, located in Cedar Hill, a suburb of Dallas.Pastor Bell got his ass kicked by a group of concerned citizens who caught him in the act of molesting a six-year-old boy behind an apartment complex in Dallas.Police later connected Bell to at least two other child molestations at a different apartment complex in Dallas.Unlike many child predators, Bell didn t know his victims at all. It appears that he approached them as they were playing outside, and then lured them to a secluded area where he carried out the molestation.It s believed that Bell preyed specifically on children who were not associated with his church, and therefore would not be able to identify him to police.The mother of the six-year-old Bell was in the process of molesting says she s grateful that the bystanders intervened when they did. If it wasn t for them, he probably would have done more to my child,  she told Fox News 4 in Dallas.While leaders of the First United Methodist Church say they re not aware of any abuse that took place in the church, the question of how Bell was allowed to become a youth pastor has yet to be answered.According to police, Bell was previously accused of showing pornographic videos to children in the state of Tennessee. Had the church done a background check, that information would have been readily available.According to school officials, the child sexual predator also tried to establish himself as a mentor at Bray Elementary School.School officials sent out letters to parents after news of Bell s arrest first broke. The letter said that Bell had met with school officials to discuss setting up a mentorship program there. The program never happened, but school officials alerted parents to the fact that he had been inside the school, during regular school hours, when their young children also would have been in attendance.While schools are required to screen all volunteers and employees during the interview process, the law doesn t require every person who enters onto school property to have a background check first.Worse, background checks for church workers and volunteers are not required under the law. Churches are left to determine for themselves whether it s necessary to screen people who will be allowed to interact with children.Bell is currently charged with two counts of criminal sexual assault of a child. Given the circumstances, it s very likely more victims will be identified and more charges will be filed.Here s more on this story from Fox News 4 in Dallas.Featured image via video screen capture Fox News 4",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Fabulous 7-Year-Old Protests Transphobia For His Trans Best Friend (IMAGE),"Children are proof that hate is taught and learned. We are not born with prejudice. It is our upbringings that make us hate those unlike ourselves. Case in point   a 7-year-old boy and his little sister, who is 5, who are protesting North Carolina s sweeping anti-LGBT legislation, because their best friend, who is transgender, is being directly affected by it.

He asked me to take him to this rally because his best friend is Transgender and for her privacy and age, she was not able to attend. My son is a beautiful, kind and intelligent soul. He was fully aware of why he was there this day and not only did he know what his sign said, he knew which song it references and can tell you every word of that song and just about any other Beatles song you can throw at him for that matter. That s his dog in the picture behind him. HIS name is Rigby, after the Beatles song. He s our newest rescue and he was proud to be mistaken for a girl all day while my Daughter Starkey Jude was mistaken for a boy. She didn t mind either and knew why she was there as well, she s 5. Guess I got pretty lucky to get the amazing, loving, accepting children I was blessed with. Oh, and they are both vegetarians and go to animal rights protests too. I m pretty sure I m winning at Momming these 2 amazing humans. If you doubt that feel free to ask them their opinions, they will definitely tell you.We need more citizens like Janna Harris Cadenas and her children. The sweep of anti-LGBT legislation across the southeast by bigots in power is nothing short of shameful. These lawmakers need to take a cue from these children, and realize that hate is not the way. It is not a family value or a Christian value, and it is certainly not an American value.You re awesome, Mrs. Cadenas, and thank you and your children for your support of our vulnerable community.Featured image via screen capture from The Gaily Grind",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
" Hooded Men Spray-Paint Racial Slurs, Pro-Trump Graffiti At UCSD Campus (VIDEO)","Students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) are demanding campus officials identify the individuals responsible for spray-painting racist graffiti, along with pro-Donald Trump messages, on campus property overnight on Saturday.According to the local CBS affiliate, the vandalism was carried out by five men wearing hoods, who were seen by UCSD students.This weekend UCSD is hosting prospective students from around the world, who will be making a decision about which school to attend in 2017.Cultural buildings on campus, which faculty says are there to help racially diverse students  feel welcome  at UCSD, were specifically targeted with the messages.The graffiti included messages directed at Muslims, Jews, LGBTQ people and other groups.CBS8 visited the campus as the graffiti was being removed. According to their report, some of the language used by the vandals was too offensive to show on camera.One message was clear, however. Spray-painted on the sidewalk outside of a main campus building were the words  Build the wall  and  Deport them all.   #DonaldTrump  was also spray-painted on the walkway, along with the words  The Mexicans will pay for it. Watch the video, courtesy of CBS 8.CBS News 8   San Diego, CA News Station   KFMB Channel 8The graffiti incident has served to escalate longstanding racial tensions on UCSD s campus.In 2010, incidents of racism came to a head after videos of the infamous  Compton Cookout,  were shown on a campus television program. The  ghetto-themed  party, organized by white students, was designed to make a mockery of Black history month.After a noose was found hanging from one of the buildings on campus, a student walk-out, accompanied by large scale protests on campus led to the declaration of a  racial emergency. In order to diffuse tensions, university officials accepted a list of 32 student demands presented by member of the Black Student Union.In the years since the  Compton Cookout,  students have routinely criticized campus officials for failing to live up the 2010 agreement.The rise of Donald Trump has led to an increase of similar racist activity at Universities across the country.Trump has lent his stamp of approval to hate speech and to the kind of race-hatred that is only expressed by hooded men, under the cover of darkness.Featured image via video screen capture CBS8",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: Fox Host Jeanine Pirro Just DESTROYED Karl Rove And GOP Chair Reince Priebus,"The folks at Fox News are getting crazier on a minute by minute basis and although it s quite sad that this organization calls itself a news outlet, it s nonetheless quite entertaining watching Fox eat its own.In the latest of her rants, so-called   judge  and Donald Trump supporter Jeanine Pirro is ticked off at her cohort at Fox, nut-job extraordinaire Karl Rove and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus  for their recent statements about a contested Republican convention and Donald Trump.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qINfdIhqzXM]Pirro usually reserves her outrageous statements for Democrats or Muslims, but this time she unleashed her fury on Rove and Priebus for their perceived anti-Trump stances. In response to Rove s suggestion that it would be acceptable for the Republicans to take the nomination away from Trump, even if he goes into the convention with the most delegates but not enough to secure the nomination, unhinged the Fox contributor. She said: The Republican establishment, desperate to stop Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, is still working to nullify our vote. If ever there were a time to not take away our vote, it s now   at a time when more people than ever are invested and voting. You want to keep your status quo   the one where one hand washes the other, and we pay for the soap. Pirro also reacted to Rove s remarks where he said a  fresh face  may be needed to beat Clinton in November. Pirro said: You want a fresh face? Aren t you the guy who kept bringing us one Bush after another? Continuing on her tangent, Pirro also attacked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, calling him out for refusing to tell Sean Hannity  whether the presidential nominee for Republicans will be one of the top vote-getters   Trump or Cruz. Pirro said: Whatever happened to  your vote matters?  Not only is that infuriating, it is un-American. Watching all of these so-called conservatives and Republicans implode before our very eyes comes at just the right time as we head into the elections for November because it helps clarify that the GOP of today should not be in charge of this country.

 WATCH: President Obama Absolutely PUMMELS The GOP On Fox News,"The Republican Party has been a thorn in the side of the president since he took office. They have challenged his policies at almost every corner and at times just for the sake of it, thus preventing the country from running smoothly. Even now, as the president is close to the end of his final term, the GOP is not letting up. In their latest attempt at obstructionism, the Republican Party is attempting to scuttle the president s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. President Barack Obama appeared on Fox News Sunday for the first time as president and had a few things to say about Republican obstructionism.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHqWf81IbDA]The president wants the GOP to simply do one thing, which is to give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing in order for the American people to be given an opportunity to see what his nominee is all about. The president said: I think that people will evolve as they get familiar with Judge Garland s record, as it becomes apparent that the overwhelming majority of the American people think that the president should nominate someone to the Supreme Court and the Senate should now do its constitutional job and give him a hearing  Our goal is to just make sure that the senate does its job and treats him fairly. The Republicans want the next president to nominate a justice to the Supreme Court, hoping that a Republican president would appoint a conservative justice. The president went on to add that never has a Republican nominee for the Supreme Court not at least had a hearing. Yet, here are the Republicans yet again scuttling by preventing the president from doing his job and not doing their constitutional duties as well.The Republicans continue to obstruct but let s hope that they remain on the sidelines come November and we don t have to deal with a GOP presidential administration.

 President Obama Reveals What Clinton’s Private Email Server Did To National Security (VIDEO),"Hate to disappoint the naysayers of Hillary Clinton who would love for her to be tossed out of the presidential election, but the short answer for what her private server did to the nation is   nothing. Scandalous, right?While appearing on Fox News Sunday ,President Obama told Chris Wallace that while not a good idea, when it comes down to if national security was ever at risk in regards to then Secretary of State Clinton s private email server, there was never any risk.He also stated: I also think it is important to keep this in perspective. This is somebody who has served her country for four years as Secretary of State, and did an outstanding job. He also said: There s carelessness in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes. Clinton certainly has owned up to the carelessness of her private server on several occasions between countless interviews and debates, and insists that she will be cleared of any and all alleged wrongdoing.Obama also made a special point of saying,  I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department, or the FBI, not just in this case, but in any case,  because many on the right have already been implying that Clinton is somehow receiving special treatment, which is simply just not the case. The president said: Nobody is above the law. How many times do I have to say it? Republicans and those opposing Hillary are holding tight to the verrrrrry slim possibility that she will somehow be indicted for having a private server and emails that changed classification status after the fact.According to HuffPo: The State Department said this month it has suspended plans for an internal review of whether classified information was properly handled in Clinton s emails at the request of the FBI. The department, complying with a judge s order, has released more than 52,000 emails from Clinton s private server. Clinton, quite literally, is complying with everything that is being asked of her, and she alongside the president seem pretty damn confident that she will be vindicated. Which will likely be exactly what happens.

 Watch This Lunatic ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Discipline Her Children With A Shotgun (VIDEO),"Have you ever seen something so stupid that you wish you could just go back to bed on the off-chance that it was a dream? That s how my day has gone so far. You know, we regularly hear from the NRA that gun owners are  responsible  individuals ready to leap into action and save us from all the ISISes, Commies, and other assorted (largely imaginary)  bad guys  who are lying in wait to attack us while we re walking around a grocery store or eating at Chipotle (though, of course, the food there might be seen as a reasonable threat these days). In some incredibly rare circumstances, it might be useful to have a gun. But, as usual, one of the NRA s Chosen has reminded us that the risks of universal gun ownership far outweigh the benefits.A woman who reportedly lives in the Southern United States didn t like that her kids disobey her, practically live on social media, and basically are teenagers. While most parents would take their children s electronics to teach them some respect, this unnamed woman decided a SECOND AMENDMENT SOLUTION was in order   so she grabbed her shotgun and began shootin  stuff while someone else recorded. I hereby denounce the effects that social media have on my children,  the mom shouts at the beginning of the video, her trusty boomstick ready to dish out some justice. Their disobedience and their disrespect.  She then takes aim at her children s iPhones and fires a shot, blasting them to bits. She then instructs the man behind the camera to place the broken bits of electronics back on the tree stump because she isn t quite through with them yet.Up to this point, the kids have been quite disrespectful, cursing at her and even flipping their mother  the bird.  In other words, she is likely right that they deserve punishment   but she continues to take things to the extreme I refuse to be cursed,  she bellows.  I refuse to be disobeyed. I take back my role as your parent.  This shining example of much of what is wrong with America then instructs the cameraman to make sure the kids are on camera   and they can be seen standing with their arms crossed as their mother continues to go insane. One of them throws up both middle fingers because he s exactly the sort of kid someone like this would raise. She fires another shot, blowing the already-destroyed cell phones to even smaller bits. Anything left put it on top,  she tells the cameraman who dutifully obeys. Mom then announces that she refuses  to have them influenced in negative ways    like, hypothetically, if their mother were to line them up and force her children to watch her shoot their belongings while screaming like a crazy woman. She wouldn t stand for that. Oh, wait To emphasize her point, she grabbed a sledgehammer and beat the fragments of the phones with it. I m done,  she yelled as she dropped the hammer and walked away.It s easy for some to imagine a world in which everyone is armed   but they fail to realize that people like this woman exist, who think a Second Amendment Solution is appropriate for even the most mundane of scenarios. She was not defending her home, saving lives, hunting, or even fighting back against an oppressive government. She used her weapon in an apparently failed attempt to intimidate her children (but let s face it: everyone in this scenario is an asshole). Fortunately, no one was hurt, but someone could have been.

 Bernie Criticizes Israel’s ‘Disproportionate’ 2014 Slaughter Of Palestinian Civilians (VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders mildly criticized Israel s actions during the 2014 massacre of over 1400 Palestinian civilians by describing it as  disproportionate.  I m going to stress the word  mild  here because it will be held up as an extreme attack on Israel because that s where our political system is today. Any politician that even slightly disagrees with Israel s tendency to shoot first, ask questions never is labeled as the next coming of Hitler by the rabidly pro-Israel right and the slightly less rabid pro-Israel left. A fact that did not escape CNN s Jake Tapper:Tapper then inquired why Sanders, who like many American Jews identifies as Jewish but says he s  not very religious,  was taking a  critical  position on Israel. It is interesting that the first Jew in American history to win a delegate, much less a primary, is taking a position on Israel that is Usually in American politics everyone just supports Israel and whatever Israel wants to do. You re taking a more critical position,  Tapper said.It s rare for anyone, much less a journalist, to put it so bluntly so kudos to Tapper as well. Bernie, not one to shy away from controversy, gave a perfectly reasonable response that will in no way mollify his pro-war critics: A more balanced position,  Sanders interrupted.  Whether Jewish or not Jewish, I would hope that every person in this country wants to see the misery of never-ending war and conflict ending in the Middle East. It s a difficult issue. Other people have tried to deal with it for years. All that I m saying  as somebody who is absolutely pro-Israeli, absolutely 100 percent supports Israel s right to exist in peace and in security  I think that the only way we succeed is of course the United States supports Israel, but you cannot ignore the needs of the Palestinian people. You can t just be concerned about Israel s needs. You have to be concerned about the needs of all the people in the region,  Sanders added.Ohhhhhh .he s going to pay for that. One of the basic tenets of the pro-Israeli worldview is the Palestinians are not real people. They re all  terrorists  and  terrorist sympathizers,  even the small children. Keeping them deprived of food, medicine and other basic human needs is only natural since they re little better than animals. If you think I m exaggerating, you must not have spoken to many strident Israel supporters or listened to how the Israeli government and people talk about a Final Solution to the Palestinian Problem.Here s Bernie completely crazed, anti-Semitic (but not really) rant:Featured image via screen cap.",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Laura Bush Stuns Republican Party – Hinted That She Plans To Vote For Hillary Clinton,"It s no secret Republican women hate Donald Trump. The GOP frontrunner has a net negative rating of 42 percent amongst Republican women (and a net negative of 50 amongst all women). Bottom line: women hate Donald Trump, and if Republican women revolt against the sack of hot air, he loses in a landslide to Hillary Clinton.Well Clinton may have gotten a boost from an unlikely source: former First Lady Laura Bush.Speaking to the Women in the World Summit in New York, Bush, who recently published a book on Afghan women, told the crowd: I want our next president, whoever he or she might be, to be somebody who is interested in women in Afghanistan and who will continue U.S. policies and that we continue to do what we re committed to do as a country. That s who I want   or the kind of people that will do that and will pay attention to our history, and know what s happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world. Considering Ted Cruz wants to  carpet bomb  the Middle East to see if sand can glow and Donald Trump wants to ban Muslims fleeing oppression from entering the United States, it doesn t take a genius to see what kind of candidate Bush is looking for.And when it comes to the issue of refugees, more than half of which are women. She stated she wanted the next president to protect the rights of women in Afghanistan. This eliminates both Trump and Cruz, so who s left?The Summit, focused on empowering women in a time of war, is a staple in Clinton s campaign message   empowering all women, all across the world.Jenna Bush, Laura and George s daughter, was more candid. Holding her 6 month old baby, she bluntly said:I m worried about her future.Laura Bush, who objected to her husband s  family values  oriented 2004 campaign, has taken a more moderate approach to politics than her husband and his inner circle.

 Arkansas State Troopers Surprise 10-Year-Old On His Birthday After No One Shows Up,"Toxey, a 10-year-old in Hot Springs Village, Arkansas had a birthday party on April 2nd. He invited 21 of his other classmates. No one showed up. After his mother, Angela Andrew, wrote a heartbreaking Facebook post about the party, two days later Arkansas State Troopers came to surprise the boy. Scared and at the same time trying to figure out why they were here,  the boy told local news outlet THV11. The troopers came bearing gifts and spent the day with the kid.  They showed me all the keys to do the sirens and the horn. I also got to see the cage with the dog in it,  he said. They had come to give me all that stuff and make up their own birthday party for me. I cried a little bit because they did that for me. The boy added it was the first birthday party he can remember people showing up. Just heartbroken and helpless. It s the last thing you want to feel for your kid, that no one cared enough to come,  his mother told THV11.  On Saturday night, I knew no one was coming, and I posted on Facebook just kind of like an outcry to parents. Just please if your kids get invited to birthdays take them. She told the Arkansas State Troopers,  I don t even know where to start because saying  thank you  just doesn t seem good enough! Saturday, I posted on my personal Facebook page that my son, Toxey, was disappointed that no one came to his birthday party. I guess an Arkansas State Trooper heard about the post, and what ensued is the stuff dreams are made of. This afternoon, after Toxey got home from school, a caravan of 5 state troopers pulled up at our house, K-9 included. Not only did they bring him a birthday cookie cake, but they also brought him all kinds of presents, let him play with Rhino, the K-9, and play with the sirens in their cars. They ate his cake with him and played basketball with him. All out of the goodness of their hearts. They made my sweet baby s day, and his year!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will never be able to repay the kindness you showed my family today!! Come on friends, let s make these guys famous! They deserve to be recognized for the wonderful people they are!! According to WHIO, the officers were identified as Cpl David Forthman, with Troopers Terry Sawyer, Kyle Sheldon, Brandon Cook, and Tim Callison.

 Bernie Sanders Has PERFECT Response To Man Ranting About ‘Zionist Jews’ At NY Rally (VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders smacked down a man at his Harlem rally on Saturday when he tried to imply that the senator was a supporter of Israel s war against Palestine.At the end of the event, a man grabbed the microphone from someone and brought up Sanders  religion and the fact that he once spent a year in Israel before saying: As you know, the Zionist Jews   and I don t mean to offend anybody   they run the Federal Reserve, they run Wall Street, they run every campaign. Bernie, realizing where the question was going, shook his head and said,  Brother, brother, brother.  The man finished his question: What is your affiliation to your Jewish community? That s all I m asking. No, no, no,  Sanders shot back.  That s not what you re asking. He s right, what the man was really doing was trying to imply that the Senator is just like the Republican Party and blindly supports what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people. He wanted people to think that just because the Democratic candidate is proud of his ancestry and religion, that he s totally cool with Benjamin Netanyahu s reign of terror on Palestine in his quest to steal all of their land. That s what the man was doing.Instead of rising to the bait, Bernie took the opportunity to discuss his position on Israel and Palestine: I am proud to be Jewish. But you re not going to find any candidate running for president, for example, talking about Zionism and the Middle East. I am a strong defender of Israel, but I also believe that we have got to pay attention to the needs of the Palestinian people. There are wonderful people, I ve met them, on both sides of that issue and there are bad people on both sides of that issue. And if we are gonna bring peace, hopefully, God willing, in the Middle East we are gonna have to treat both sides with respect and equality. So while it is unfortunate that our lawmakers support Israel (they really shouldn t) the reality of the current situation makes it impossible not to   even Senator Sanders knows that. But it is important to realize that you would never, ever hear Donald Trump or Ted Cruz say that we need to treat the Palestinian people with respect. They are too busy calling them  terrorists  and kissing Netanyahu s ass.Watch: Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Donald Trump Could Be Running The Greatest Scam In American History,"Donald Trump likes to promote himself a shrewd businessman, but many who have done business with the man have been cheated and lied to.While few people are under any illusions as to Trump s honesty or integrity, a closer look at his campaign finance scheme suggests he may be running an enormous scam on all of us.From the time Trump announced that he was entering the race for the republican presidential nomination, Trump has been telling his supporters that his campaign is mostly self-financed.That s true, and it s not true.Donald may want people to think he s a multi-billionaire, but as Addicting info reports here, his actual net worth is estimated to be much lower.As it turns out, Trump is  self-financing his campaign  by lending money to himself. As of February, the Trump campaign had loans totaling $17.5 million, more than 70 percent of all the money his campaign had brought in to date.As this graph from Sunlight Foundation shows, Trump has actually given very little to his campaign.Image credit: Sunlight FoundationDetails on the terms of these loans appear to be a well-kept secret. It s hard to imagine a profiteer like Donald Trump not charging interest on $17.5 million in loans.Then there are revelations that the Trump campaign is spending large sums of money at Trump owned businesses.As The Daily Beast reports here, between the time he entered the race and the close of 2015, the campaign had paid more than $2 million to Tag Air Inc.Trump owns a commercial-sized plane, a Boeing 757-200, which is equipped to safely transport 43 passengers in seat belts plated with 24-carat gold although they might prefer to sit in the dining room, one of two bedrooms, or in the shower, (or they might prefer to travel in his smaller jet or one of his two helicopters).His aircraft ferry him around the country, from New York to Des Moines to Manchester to Biloxi, at a steep cost.Steep is right. The bill ran over $500,000 for a single day, in June of 2015.There were also huge bills paid out to Trump owned restaurants like Trump Cafe and Trump Grill, while Trump Restaurants LLC got a $74,000 all on its own.The campaign paid rent and utilities to Trump Tower Commercial LLC, along with in-kind rent to Donald J. Trump, Trump CPS LLC, and Trump Plaza LLC.The Daily Beast also reports:Trump even has his own companies to manage payroll, Trump Payroll Corp. and Trump Tower Commercial LLC, where tens of thousands of dollars are regularly funneled before landing in the pockets of his well-compensated staff.Campaign finance law bars candidates from profiting off their own campaigns.Yet at least one FEC expert told The Daily Beast that Trump s financial scam is unprecedented.According to Paul Ryan, of the Campaign Legal Center This is sort of a strange gray area of the law that I don t think the FEC has ever addressed. As Olivia Nuzzi of The Daily Beast reports:Were Trump to profit from, say, the sale of 15 Ivanka s Salads, Ryan said it would be a  technical violation  of FEC law,  but it doesn t make sense for it to be a violation. Why should it matter, in other words, if it was his own money to begin with, if it is being recirculated back into his pocket throughout the course of the campaign?Trump once vowed to be the first presidential candidate to make a profit from his campaign.Back in February, The New York Times reported that he may be closer to doing that than anyone realizes.But in the end, Donald Trump s campaign may up being little more than a costly political commentary on the shady way that corporate America functions.If Trump is an expert at anything it s privatizing profits, while transferring losses onto U.S. taxpayers.He s filed multiple bankruptcies, so many in fact, that according to CNN Money, Trump s casino empire surpasses every major U.S. company when it comes to the number of bankruptcies filed over the past 30 years.The idea that Trump could walk away from his presidential bid with millions of dollars in profits, while leaving the taxpayers holding all the bills, is not all that far-fetched, especially given his expertise in the world of shady corporate finance.Image credit: Gage Skidmore",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Here Are Just A Few Things America Could Afford If The Wealthy Actually PAID Their Fair Share,"It isn t much of a secret these days that rich people do not pay their fair share of taxes. I m not even talking about the small business owner who loves to complain about having a higher tax bill than some. I mean the offensively wealthy. Multi-millionaires and billionaires that draw a salary they don t need just so they can have a larger pile of money to sit on top of while throwing a middle finger at the middle class.Did you ever wonder,  What could we do in this country if everyone actually paid their fair share of taxes on a progressive scale? The short answer is, we d have about $124 billion extra per year for the government to use.Thanks to a leak of the Panama Papers, which detail just how much money is being hidden by corporations, the wealthy and even world leaders, we can now start to answer that question. Here are a few examples of what we could do with the money:1: Help to reduce the deficitRepublicans always say the federal deficit is the great evil of our time. It prevents everything from your business succeeding to sunny days from happening. $124 billion dollars a year would be able to negate nearly one quarter of the federal deficit. Republicans are strangely silent on this obvious remedy.2: Help to protect the elderlyThanks to Republican shenanigans, Social Security has some budget problems. Currently, it s experiencing a shortfall of about $182 billion because people like Ronald Reagan couldn t keep their hands out of the Social Security lockbox. Rather than consigning our seniors to complete and total poverty for generations to come, $124 billion extra a year could help resolve the Social Security problem until another method can be used to patch the rest and protect 80-year-olds from having to work full-time jobs.3: Fund universal preschoolUniversal pre-k would cost about $90 billion a year. We would actually have money left over from this one. The Economic Policy Institute has already put forth a plan to establish preschool and childcare for parents of infants and toddlers up to 4 years old for just 10 percent of their income. The government would pick up the rest of the tab. The plan would end up paying for itself in the long-term because younger children educated earlier in life will earn more and avoid the need for social welfare programs and have fewer run-ins with our drastically expensive criminal justice system.4: Pay the full salaries of all of our troopsThe Pentagon s personnel costs in 2014 totaled $116 billion dollars. Here we are again with some absolutely huge and important thing being paid for with money to spare, yet Republicans are silent. Strangely enough, even the troops don t motivate them on this one. Republicans LOVE our troops. Right? Sadly no, they don t. They only love having flag draped coffins for photo ops.5: Make sure nobody in America goes hungryAt its recent peak, food stamps cost $80 billion dollars in 2013. It has since lowered as the economy has steadily improved and people have gotten off the program at a modest pace. However, instead of screaming  cut! cut! cut!  as Republicans are inclined to do, we could fully pay for it and have a little over $40 billion a year left to do other things with.Here is a chart showing the costs of a few things, and where the extra money falls in comparison. It s so embarrassing. We could do two of the cheapest ones at the same time and still have a little money left over. But, Republicans are bound and determined to make sure America can t have nice things.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 WATCH: President Obama Absolutely DESTROYS Trump and Fox News In One Simple Statement,"President Obama has a few months left in office and at this stage in his presidency, he wants to make sure that the likes of Donald Trump is as far away from the most powerful position on earth as possible. The president had his opportunity when he sat down with the Republican mouth piece Fox News in an interview with the conservative organization that has given Donald Trump free press for months. The president wasn t shy about pointing that out.During an interview on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked the president if he felt any responsibility for angry constituents, who have not seen a change in their economic situation and are now attracted to Donald Trump. The president said: There s no doubt that I feel frustrated about it. Number one, we re still shell shocked from what happened in 2007-2008  People lost homes, lost jobs, lost life savings and they still don t fully know how that happened and was the system fixed in a way they can have confidence in. Wallace asked why Obama had not  fixed that in eight years.  The president responded: The perception is going to be changing over time as people see results. But   and this is the big but   nobody is going to be 100 percent satisfied in a democracy like ours with every outcome. And I think the danger both among Republicans and among Democrats who just listen to each other or they just listen to people that already agree with them   you know, Republicans have their own TV station. Go ahead,  Wallace said,  You can say Fox News. Of course it s Fox News. Is the president correct? Yes he is. Trump has received at least $30 million dollars of free airtime from May, 2015 to the end of 2015 alone. Mikey Mouse would be leading the Republican race if he would be given a major news outlet as a personal mouthpiece.Let s hope that the damage Fox has done by giving this demagogue a platform will not go beyond this year and we can look back at all this and sigh in relief that we won t be seeing Trump s demagoguery on display as president of the United States.Watch video here: Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Ted Cruz: I’m ‘Honored’ By Support Of This Demon-Obsessed Exorcist Preacher (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz is a dangerous extremist who regularly surrounds himself with equally deranged right-wing loons. Case in point   his bragging about receiving the endorsement of Colorado Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt. That s not all, either. Klingenschmitt is actually on Cruz s Colorado team of leaders for his presidential campaign.Nick named  Dr. Chaps,  this particular character is not just a Colorado State Representative. He is also a certifiably crazy preacher. In case you ve managed to miss Klingenschmitt s many, many controversies, here s a rundown of some of his more outrageous antics, complete with video proof.In 2006, Klingenschmitt was a chaplain in the U.S. Navy. However, he got himself kicked out for appearing at a right-wing political rally in his military garb, which is against policy. After that, he became a notoriously extremist preacher and far-right lunatic activist. Instead of admitting that he f*cked up, Klingenschmitt instead insisted that he was being attacked because he is a Christian   complete with the ludicrous claim that God made a hurricane happen because of the military s persecuting him for his beliefs.Two years ago, the good people of Colorado, likely oblivious to this loon s antics, elected him as a state representative. That is when the crazy really started to show. He didn t even make it a year before he was forcibly removed from the House Health, Insurance and Environment Committee after going on his  Pray in Jesus Name  program, and saying that a viciously violent attack on a pregnant woman in which her fetus was removed from her womb was punishment for America s legalization of abortion. Here is video of that rant:This man is also a self-identified exorcist, and he once tried to perform an exorcism on President Obama. Here is a report from Rachel Maddow on that crazy story:Unsurprisingly, Klingenschmitt is also viciously anti-gay, and says that the government should discriminate against gay people because they will all burn in hell. He admitted to once attempting a cleansing of a woman of the  foul spirit of lesbianism. Here is video of some of Klingenschmitt s insane and foul views on LGBT people:And finally, Klingenschmitt also insists that Jesus will overturn gay marriage rulings, and that judges who uphold them are  imposing the devil s law upon people.  As for the repeal of  Don t Ask, Don t Tell,  this idiot says that gay people should not be able to be soldiers because of taking breaks on the combat field to change diapers all because their treacherous sin causes them to lose control of their bowels. Now, bearing all of this in mind, here is what the #2 frontrunner for the GOP presidential candidate has to say about Klingenschmitt s endorsement, via Right Wing Watch: I am honored to have the support of so many courageous conservatives in Colorado,  Cruz said in a press release celebrating the formation of  his Colorado Leadership Team with the endorsement of 25 current and former elected officials and key grassroots leaders,  including Klingenschmitt.If this doesn t tell you what kind of president Ted Cruz would be, I don t know what will. He might be smart enough not to say this stuff so blatantly himself, but if he didn t share these same extreme views, he wouldn t surround himself with these people.Be afraid, be very afraid of the possibility of a President Ted Cruz.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 10, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Idiot Pastor Loses His Damn Mind – Refuses To ‘Pledge Allegiance’ To ‘Sodomy’ (VIDEO),"There are apparently still folks who believe that because the LGBT community is gaining more and more equality, and because women have the right to make their own medical decisions, they are being forced to promote being gay and apparently forcing abortions on everyone.Case in point   Arizona Pastor Steven Anderson of Faithful Word Baptist Church.Anderson seems discontent in knowing the United States is offering too much freedom for all. He seems to think the rule of his God should be the ruler of all. And now, he s even going after the Pledge of Allegiance, because he somehow thinks that by reciting it he s being forced to promote homosexuality and abortion.During one of his sermons, he said: One nation, corrupt, perverted, promoting abortion and homosexuality to all. Not gonna do it, my friend. Get mad at me. Quit the church. Umm  granting equality under the law to people who are part of the LGBT community or letting women have control over their own bodies is not  promoting  anything   it s freedom. Something the United States kinda prides itself on. He doesn t seem to understand that he isn t being forced to do anything he doesn t want to do. He can still live his life with hate in his heart and no one will do a damn thing about it. He said: I don t want anything to do with sodomy. It s wicked. I don t want anything to do with abortion. I don t want anything to do with the things that our country is starting to stand for. Then he steps further onto the crazy train by perpetuating the myth that the United States is pushing for a  New World Order.  He doesn t seem to realize that he isn t forced to pledge allegiance to the flag, nor that there is separation of church and state that protects the church as much as it protects the state. He said: The problem with making an oath or pledge or affirmation is that you might sit there and pledge allegiance, right? And then, like, 30 years later, what happens when that country is a totally different place? What happens when that country stands for something totally different? And you ve already pledged allegiance to it. I mean, we don t want to do that. We don t want to get wrapped up in that. Sure, but he doesn t seem to have a problem pledging allegiance to an archaic text that was written thousands of years ago by men who claim the are writing the word of God. It s more than fine to believe in the Bible. It s more than fine to believe in God. That s his freedom that is protected under the Constitution of the United States. He s allowed to worship freely under full protection of the law as so long as he doesn t harm anyone. So, before he goes and swears off our  earthly government  he should probably think long and hard about the fact that freedom is granted to all, not just some.

" Boston Globe Goes #NeverTrump On Its Front Page, You Have To See This (IMAGE)","The Boston Globe will publish a satirical front page on Sunday, April 10, showing just how insane the news could get if Donald Trump is elected President of the United States. The page is part of an effort by the paper s editorial department to get Republicans to break out of their stupor and to stop Trump on his path to the nomination.It is every much the nightmare scenario it sounds like:The banner headline on the fake page, dated a year from Sunday, reads:  Deportations to begin, President Trump calls for tripling of ICE force; riots continue.  The page includes full, realistic articles about Trump s actions as president.The main story includes mentions of an Attorney General Chris Christie, and Fox News  Megyn Kelly tweeting from a bar because she s been placed on a White House black list.Other stories on the fake front page include  U.S. soldiers refuse orders to kill ISIS families  and details such as new libel laws targeting  absolute scum  in the press. Another story is about how Trump had offended the Chinese first lady by naming his new dog after her.Here is an image of the front page, see a PDF here.An editor s note on the page explains their goals: This is Donald Trump s America. What you read on this page is what might happen if the GOP frontrunner can put his ideas into practice, his words into action. Many Americans might find this vision appealing, but the Globe s editorial board finds it deeply troubling. Also featured in the issue is an editorial warning America off Trump:The GOP must stop TrumpDONALD J. TRUMP S VISION for the future of our nation is as deeply disturbing as it is profoundly un-American.Trump has experienced a recent series of setbacks on the delegate front, as the party s establishment attempts to deny him the number of representatives he needs at the convention in order to be granted the nomination. At the same time, much of the establishment is now backing the campaign of the far-right Senator Ted Cruz in a desperate attempt to blunt Trump s momentum. The reality star recently suffered an embarrassing loss in Wisconsin s Republican primary, and brought on new staffers with experience fighting for delegates at the party convention, scheduled for this summer in Cleveland.Featured image via Boston Globe ",News,"April 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 A Bi-Partisan Miracle: Federal Employee Health Plans Add Critical Autism Benefit,"A first glance, this doesn t seem like a big deal:Federal employee health-care plans will have to cover applied behavior analysis for children on the autism spectrum starting next year, and they are being encouraged to step up the incentives for enrollees to participate in wellness programs.But that s only until you understand what applied behavior analysis actually is and why it s one of the single most vital steps in helping children cope with autism. ABA is a form on one-on-one tutoring that can start with children under two years of age (my own son, Jordan, started at about 19 months).This tutoring varies from child to child. In Jordan s case, he learned how to focus on the task in front of him and how to behave in a teacher/student setting. He did this for 2 hours a day, 5 days a week for a little over a year. By the time he went to Early Intervention schooling (another critical component), Jordan was capable of being a student and has been steadily progressing from there.It s hard to overstate how important ABA is for children with autism. It s an incredibly time intensive program taught by highly trained professionals, which means it s very expensive. A full week program is certainly out of the reach of anyone not in the upper middle class and beyond. Making it a mandatory part of federal health care is literally a life-saving and life-changing event for countless parents and their children. I can say with absolute certainty that Jordan s ABA teacher helped him reach out of himself at a time where he couldn t even point to something he wanted because the very idea of directly expressing a need was completely foreign to him.The best part of this is that it s a bi-partisan effort, meaning the usual gridlock will not impact the families that need help the most:Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), co-chair of the Congressional Autism Caucus, called the requirement  a milestone that will help ensure families across the country using ABA therapy will no longer have to pay the full out-of-pocket costs, and that public servants in every state will have access to an insurance plan that meets the needs of individuals on the spectrum. We know that early diagnosis and intervention services are critical to the long term development of a child with autism,  he said.  In addition to universal and early detection screening, interventions such as ABA therapy are important tools that helps provide children with ASD an opportunity to live to their full potential. This is a godsend and I can only hope that it becomes mandatory for EVERY insurance plan. The epidemic of autism is not going away and the longer we wait to help these children, the harder it becomes to help them effectively.Featured image via Getty ",News,"April 9, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
 Case Regarding Cruz’s Birthright Citizenship Reaches Supreme Court,"One of the biggest mysteries in Constitutional Law is what the Framers meant when they said  natural born citizen.  Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution states the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United States, and under clause 5 one would find the  natural born  requirement:No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.The Supreme Court will have the option to take up the case, if it so chooses, now that the lawsuit challenging Ted Cruz s eligibility to be President has been filed.Retired Utah lawyer Walter Wagner has led the  birther  movement against Ted Cruz, filing multiple lawsuits in federal court to block the Texas Republican from seeking the nomination. Wagner lost his case in Utah District Court, with Judge Jill Parrish writing:Nowhere does Mr. Wagner allege how he will be injured in a personal and individual way.All cases must show that the individual bringing the lawsuit has suffered, is suffering, or will suffer an injury personal to them, and that their rights have been violated. Wagner contends that he does have a vested interest, saying it s his job at  insuring that all candidates for the position of president are legally qualified.  Basically, he s a taxpayer and an American citizen, so he has a particular interest in who the president is.After being smacked down in Utah, Wagner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver and subsequently the U.S.  Supreme Court.Hopefully the Justices see fit to end this ridiculous talking point, seeing as though Trump will most likely emerge as the nominee. Also, establishing sound Constitutional decision to this long mysterious issue.
